Their questing experience is generally more fleshed out and grounded in Warcraft lore. Every Alliance race has some background and history that shapes their narrative and propels their story. The humans have their intrigue, the elves are struggling with mortality, dwarves have their clan issues and the search for their origins, gnomes are gearheads, etc. 
---

---
By contrast, the Horde races are all newcomers and have a questing narrative around that. Aside from the Forsaken, who do have a fairly unique storyline, everything else is basically "go there, claim some land, and hunt the things already living there FOR THE HORDE". Even the Tauren, ostensibly the natives, have their entire storyline boil down to "orcs are bros, the sprits are angry, and the black Tauren are mean baddies".
---
As others have pointed out, however, it's not all bad as Horde questing is way more efficient. While Alliance quests have you go talking to every spy and distant cousin across the continent to piece together the intricate plotlines, Horde towns are usually a hub of seven people, five of whom want you to go kill 20 boars/harpies/dwarves in the immediate vicinity, the sixth wants some giblets from a dungeon next door, and the seventh wants you to bring a letter to the next hub.

---
They did after maintenance this morning.
---
Faction change was added in WotLK, where both Horde and Alliance had Shamans and Paladins.
---
In Vanilla and TBC there was no such possibility.
---
what's the math for this? never heard of it before
---
Might not seem much like it horde side, but ally population has definitely been dwindling hard according to census trackers.
---
I know that the games came out 5 years apart, that isn't the point. It's to show you guys what type of play-style I enjoy so you can help suggest me a class to play
---
If you're used to LOL/moba then probably classes with a big pvp toolkit will interest you - rogue, mage, locks come to mind
---
100k after four hours a day seems pretty low tbh.
---
I did 100k after less than 20 matches... maybe 10 hours total in av.
---
That company is pretty cool but looks like they're not doing Classic characters since we don't have support for the armory. Looks like their process involves pulling character models and details off the armory site.
---
Its one thing I like about WoW, you can just be playing a single faction your whole life and then you know there's another faction that you can try which totally feels like a different game.
---
I cant seem to find it on twitch extention, is it worth getting through other sources? (Twitch is super easy to update etc)
---
How many time are you gonna say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm surprised‚Äù
---
Rogue
---
You do you man. If you ever get the vibe people dont like you or theres animosity dont say i didnt try tell you why. Druid players never seem to get that it triggers people they tryna gear 3 spec. Your avg player does a dunge to maybe get some upgrades or some blues to sell. If you gear 3specs you will clean up everything so theres no surplus to sell.
---
I refilled from horde to alliance. I actually love undead sand their quests. It‚Äôs the capital cities on the horde side that are a major annoyance. On the bright side I can now shadowmeld and ambush people with aimed auto multi auto combo. My hunter feels like a scuffed rogue now.
---
and this wpvp has died
---
For channeling spells\hots\dots that you could learn past level 20, you could calculate it as "Duration / 15".
---
This. I'm in Kalimdor most times I'm online, and don't need to be in Eastern Kingdoms except for raiding or other various things I need to get done. The best demon farming is in Felwood or Azshara and right now I'm just PvP'ing or raiding Ony/MC once/twice a week depending.
---
Is it ‚Äújust‚Äù because of that? Or do you think maybe there are a bunch of reasons and being able to switch and pvp ppl is just one of the benefits? 
---
I feel like i see this on the sub all the time where ppl see a character do one thing and then make sweeping statements about how that‚Äôs their fav thing to do and do it all the time. Get ganked by a char 15 levels higher for 2 hours? That player is trash who can only kill ppl lower level than him and he NEVER attacks other lvl 60‚Äôs or challenges himself in the game
---
Have someone switch to an ally char to shit talk you... that must be the ONLY thing he does on that char. He made it JUST to shit talk. 
---
Offers to bring his horde to gank, that must be the only reason he has that char.
---
Why is this assumption made on this forum all the time?
---
It's funnier than your comment
---
You could just lock them from being able to change?  lol
---
Sucks you have to pay a second fee to play
---
$50 is $50 to Blizzard. Don't expect change here.
---
all these posts and zero explanation of how to actually do it
---
Imo 70/30 is the best ratio (assuming you are on the dominant faction). You can find wpvp if you look for it, while also not having to worry about losing raid buffs or getting camped.
---
This will be even more apparent when BWL (attunement) and ZG (world buffs) come out.
---
&gt; 12 hours a day in game
---
That's only like rank 11 given the numbers seen last week... r13 and r14 were taken by people putting in 16-17 hours a day
---
[removed]
---
Really, you got a premade that's all like 'yeah we don't really need a priest in t1/t2 but if you happen to have a lock in blues you're in!!'
---
Thanks for this, you've ruined my holiday.
---
That's what I thought as well. Thank you for the reply, I'll most likely end up re-subbing and giving it a go =)
---
Great to hear!
---
im assuming you dont never fail, 4 runs a hour
---
Thats classic for ya. &gt;,&gt;
---
70/30 is a dead server wtf
---
Wait are you serious!?
---
Yup. üòä
---
You need to be ~3 levels from last boss of dungeon to hit it properly.  
---
Last boss of GY is 33, last boss of Libraty is 37, Armory - 40 and Cathedral - 42.
---
Woosh
---
Just wait until you check out how much every other form of entertainment costs.
---
Wait what. How would that happen in eve ?
---
My first thought what's the average times for wins vs loses
---
If you have an epic mount get in a premade. I havent lost an AV in forever
---
Thats kinda fucked up...
---
We're losing 4-5 people per raid team per week at this point due to lack of content. People are going from raid logging to just not logging at all. We better get some new raids released soon..
---
Yeah rank 10 might be a decent enough goal in a few months. 14 is never going to be worth it.
---
You lose everything (except your skills) when you die in EVE Online. Gaining skills is also based on realtime... so you must be a long-term player to be in the bigger ships. Bigger ships (Titans) are so extensive to craft that some have been worth $10,000 USD. They are the equivalent of Orgrimmar on wheels.
---
Guilds can gather and destroy Titans if they have the capacity. They are heavily defended and guilds who have them are always active and monitoring. If that ship gets destroyed, it's gone forever. That guild has effectively lost an entire year of farming.
---
Not sure but there's tons of white posts here that will tell you all about the game.
---
If you re bracket 3 you will be rank 3
---
The twitch app might be showing ur retail addons instead of classic, you have to swap the which install path it is showing.
---
Anything R8 and above takes dedication, and this means no job or adult responsibilities. 
---
R10 and above requires you have no life outside of the game, and R13 + R14 requires 2 no-lifers to play your account 24/7.
---
What a fucking  scam lmao worse then the lottery.
---
The amount of people that will transfer to farelina will be nuts
---
&gt; I've tried Rogue and thought I would like it, but didn't really (got to around lvl 25),
---
A lot of people are grinding AV for rep atm
---
Bad lag across all of Stalagg starting at 5:20pm central us time
---
You new to the internet? People complain about anything.
---
I haven't logged on today yet. Good rank increases since last week?
---
Wait so both people had two accounts? Because you can't have a char of the same faction on a pvp server.
---
So then your friend got lucky that this dude was pvp flagged?
---
There's some fishy stuff in here.
---
After a week of doing almost nothing in WoW but AV, I'm pretty sure the quote is "Stormpike Filth! In my keep?!"
---
A gold is a gold
---
idk how many games ive played (got exalted 2 days ago) and ive only had a handful of 35-45 min games and only 1 hour long game where we summoned the thicc stoney ice boi and it was fun as hell
---
YMMV im sure people have gotten far more than me but i think 10-20 is the average now
---
Axe if you're axe spec, but otherwise I'd say Scepter. Higher top end damage and the proc is better.
---
Yeah, there being no alliance FP except BB in all of STV sucks a lot. So many runs back through Duskwood.
---
This is representative of low-trust societies.
---
I have noticed a lot of PvP threads recently have this recurring theme of being created by people who have no idea how ranking works or maybe wishful thinking that you can get R14 without no lifing, not going to happen.
---
The barrens can be tough. If you're not loving your class in the teens (but are waiting to love it a few levels down the road) the Barrens can fucking suck.
---
I was a cap pilot in Pandemic Legion and Black Legion...
---
I don‚Äôt have a premade. I‚Äôm just a normal guy that plays the game with a small group of friends. 
---
PvP for me is random world stuff, just for fun.
---
I thought you can't have alliance and horde characters on the same realm?
---
Yeah but alliance get free AV wins.
---
&gt;*people don't run instances for fun.*
---
Sure they do.
---
&gt;*if you can use it and plan to use it then you should be entitled for a shot at it whether or not you are actively playing that role in the dungeon*
---
As long as you communicate that you'll be needing on off-spec beforehand and your group is cool with that, fine. Otherwise you're pretty selfish taking gear from someone's main spec in a role they're actively contributing to.
---
&gt;*good luck trying to find a tank for strath live without having to reserve an orb or something for them*
---
They're out there -- not everyone's a selfish loot goblin. ;)
---
Guy is paying for two separate accounts
---
Census data only exacerbates the problem, change my mind.  The vast majority of players would not knowingly roll on the underdog faction.
---
I actually downloaded D2 and run in windowed mode and play single player on my 2nd monitor. Super fun :p
---
How long was the servers down?
---
If allies were any good at pvp they'd realize being on the 40 side of a 60/40 server is optimal for ranking up.
---
Diablo 2*
---
This week is going to be bad for everyone with all the pve players getting 300k honor from AV grinding.

Last I checked (admittedly a while ago) the top dps for their thief was literally autoattacking with.. a stick.
---
Druid.
---
I've played caster/dps only (3 lvl human 60 mages) so having a toon that's melee and heals, and doesn't need to drink water ever 3 mobs is a huge win.
---
And lurking around in stealth is fun!
---
Earthshaker - Venture Ally
---
Obviously he's talking about Destiny 2.
---
The two classes with the most insane CC combos are Rogues and Warlocks.
---
There was a guy back in vanilla that used to kill completely raid gear kitted out opponents while being naked (using only daggers) with a rogue. They can kill many classes completely without the opponent being able to move.
---
Warlocks can just fear people for days.
---
But the problem you have is:
---
&gt;  ambush tanky-ish characters with great gap-closers. 
---
That class doesn't exist. All the classes lack a specific part of that. E.g. Rogues are not tanky.
---
Apart from rogues, the Closest two I can think of are feral druids (they have stealth, are super tanky and can ambush, but their DPS is low and CC not good at all) and mage (No stealth, but their PvP spec basically meansthey can charge into a group with mount + blink, AoE CC, AoE down, Ice block -&gt; Reset, CC, AoE -&gt; Ice block again.

---
Battles in EVE are so catastrophic that they're recorded almost as if it was real history.
---
The biggest difference between WoW 15 years ago and WoW today is that online voice and text chat are 100% normalized and commonplace. The thing that made WoW so fun and addicting wasn't the gameplay or even the world - it was spending time online talking and interacting with real human beings. That wasn't something most people had access to 15+ years ago. Now that's how almost everyone spends most of their time - texting, facebooking, tweeting, instagramming, etc. - so there's nothing unique or novel about the social experience in MMOs.
---
Will you still keep your PvP rank or will it reset?
---
Maybe you're right. My guildies wont leave AV for anything though, they're all trying to rank
---
And here you are trying to explain your commentary while pretending like you don't look to have your opinions validated. Pretty funny
---
This week is an outlier, most pve players earned 300k honor farming their AV rep.  Many of them won't even get 15HKs this week.
---
What is this 'racist guild' meme
---
Lashers do about negative 4 damage pet hit so yes it's easily doable. You won't be able to do the big pulls to kill all the lasher packs in two pulls. You will comfortably be able to do them 1-2 packs at a time though.
---
Talk about stress. I raid in WoW at the same time I raid in Destiny 2. Pro skills
---
You realize I'm the same guy you're telling I've clearly not played EVE?

Nope. One person was initiated. The person who retaliated was 100% in the right.

I don‚Äôt get it

Are paid transfers from a US realm to Oceanic realm available? I cannot look right now, can someone confirm? Thank you
---
Oh man, my gf has a Mac laptop that she can't even play WoW on haha
---
I certainly hope so
---
This is the answer. It also fixes that messed up mana bar if you are using shadow unit frames.
---
Musician sounds wonderful!

I have no doubt, I was just generalizing the largest player groups.

---
I‚Äôm not being sarcastic. I think I could actually do more dps as arms, too.
---
Debuff slots might be an issue though
---
As a horde player on Sulfuras. I can attest to how shitty this place is.
---
CHEEZITS!
---
Paid transfers happened right around the time Naxx was going to come out, I remember it being a welcomed thing for our guild at the time because we needed fresh recruits who wanted to join our Naxx raiding guild and recruiting on our tiny populated server wasn't easy.  With that said it really did have long term consequences to smaller servers like ours because as skilled/hardcore/dedicated players left for greener pastures, it tanked the economy and made it an unpleasant experience for anyone left.  By the time TBC rolled around, most of the good players were gone and the server started to suck, our guild remained in tact because we were a solid group but there was nobody else clearing the content we were clearing, it made it really annoying to find Arena partners though and eventually in Wrath, most of ended up ditching that server.
---
I was one of the last to go and let me tell you, playing on a dead server is the absolute worse.  You can't find groups for shit, you can't find mats in the AH for reasonable prices, even if you get lucky and find a really valuable recipe or BoE, there's nobody there to buy it.  
---
If past behavior is a consistent predictor of future behavior, now that paid transfers are around in Classic, I anticipate a lot of realms dying slowly over time the next few months.
---
But your gear has more slots than 7 for pvp set and weapon
---
The reasoning was sound and I wasn't too bothered by it. 
---
But having all the random questions in one thread on a daily basis makes browsing at work simpler.
---
Love this thread!
---
&gt; There aren't enough Alliance to spread out to balance all the realms
---
That's why I'm talking about offering positive incentives for horde players to go Alliance. I think you're reading past that. 
---
You keep reiterating that there are more Horde than Alliance, and I don't think you understand what's being suggested.
---
It‚Äôs ok, wasn‚Äôt worded the best.
---
offt why dont you cry more about mechanics in a game that you knew were coming?   
---
I play horde and have been camped intensely too, since BG's its calmed down about 90%.
---
Grow a pair or just go play a safe space game
---
They are racist. Not really a meme.
---
yes burning crusade next pls
---
&gt;*how were we supposed to choose balanced servers before the game even launched?*
---
You're not. You pick a server and if you're not happy with it wait until transfers became available or reroll on another one.
---
I mercilessly gank every rogue I see because I *could* I see them.
---
Wow you really just want to harass people don't you. It absolutely kills you that someone thinks you have a bad guild yet spend time out of your life to verify that accusation through being a toxic child.
---
Enjoy the blacklist, I am done with your foolishness.
---
Oh God I didn't notice that. Good on blizz for designing such a great game to shame these people for their decisions.
---
Ooo a rogue.... wanting to tear things up wpvp... god damn I hate you ü§ì
---
That's a 60/40 population. We're never getting a better pvp faction balance than that with server transfers.
---
in the end blizzard will just make more money because of just that.. since they can just tranfser which makes them money...  already level 1's in trade chat asking how the server is....
---
Never given stuff away before, but this comment deserves some silver I lol‚Äôd to tears
---
Yeah, it took me 9.5 days to hit 60, and I was playing arguably the 3rd fastest leveling class and focused exclusively on leveling while in-game. And had experience leveling back during Vanilla to boot.
---
From rank 1 I only got into 60% of rank 2... I guess I'll not even make the blue set lol
---
A five point kidney in group PvP can absolutely destroy you. the 10 shadow resist ok but minor, there are plenty of other things you can be doing while someone is feared  outside of cannibalism, which requires a corpse anyway so it's very situational.  I guess I'm thinking about group PvP more than solo.
---
Diminishing returns apply in bgs? That actually makes no sense. You‚Äôd hit dr cap so fast in wsg
---
I'm about to ding 60 for the 4th time, and I think of all the classes so far I prefer my Rogue.
---
same
---
With +500 sp it bumps you up to an amazing 350 dps.  If you read that and still think that spell power trumps regen, you're in a guild that doesn't care about dps.  And if that's the case, why are the so insistent that shadow weaving is up?  Don't answer nothing you say makes sense anyway.
---
of course to you "what you said makes no sense" is just your way of saying "I disagree, and I want to be a big asshole about it"
---
you can check other logs when the tanks were full prot, i only linked the most recent. you can check logs here with tank as full prot:

i agree parses don't mean everything, but this is a conversation about druids not being able to perform as a healer using HoTW spec. but if a druid being in the 99th percentile against all other resto spec'd druids HoTW spec'd or not doesn't show that's it's a fully capable raid spec - i'm not sure what does.
---
other than that, it's molten core. i'd bet some of the better guilds could roll in talentless and still full clear.
---
Even more reason to have a PVE transfer waiting for me in my back pocket :)
---
They transferred for 3 months to a server that provided nothing to them but a title. No guild, no friends, nothing. It‚Äôs very similar. Transfer only to do what you need to do (rank up or ring a gong) then transfer back.
---
better than a dictatorship by greasy neckbeard reddit mods
---
No I know 4 people that did the grind to 14. They all quit or rerolled.
---
People have no fucking clue how bad this grind is, though a whole lot of them are about to find out. If you aren't rank 10 this week? Stop now, you aren't getting there. If you *are* rank 10 then you're going to need to actually step it up from here, or convince all the high end PvPers on your server to work together and otherwise game the system. Even then.. 18 hour days are your life for the next month or two.
---
Well, I guess I assume that normal people would just role the different faction on a different pvp server and not pay for 2 accounts. I don‚Äôt really care what you do with the second account. Operate a guild, grief people, spam chat, whatever. But to have a second account JUST to be able to play on the other faction on the SAME SERVER seems bonkers to me.
---
Let's look at Chromatic Boots. There's 5-9+ other DPS warriors that will be wanting this item. It could take you an entire year of BWL to get this item. So yes it is worth it.
---
&gt;Nothing is worth wasting 4 months of your life
---
On my server it's not "wasting", you can achieve bracket 13 with 600k honor. That's not that hard to get every week.
---
You can attempt serious speed runs twice per month, and getting WCB on every melee usually turns that into once per month. If you wipe a guild on their way to their speedrun, they can't really attempt records again for another month. 
---
Did I ever say it was the same as robbing an Alliance hangar? No, I said it was pretty major, and ruining weeks/months of prep work definitely *is* major. It's definitely a lot more than *"make your raid a little longer to start?"
---
There's no chance in the world you can do start to finish and out in 15 minutes. It's Im pos si ble.
---
I can't see how I could be wrong here.
---
That‚Äôs because people have things to do, so there‚Äôs no need for the made up drama
---
They obviously decided beforehand that it goes to a ret pala. The one pala that already farmed all the mats made the decision much easier. There is nothing worse than giving it to a person that might be slightly better but needs like 3 months to farm all the mats. Now they almost have an instant legendary.
---
So it doesn't let you change factions does it?
---
only like 3 hours
---
&gt;Including tradeables and non tradeables ?.
---
Yes, you keep your entire inventory and bank.
---
&gt;Also Can you transfer from a full server to another full server or it's limited to low pop servers only ?
---
The limitations are only based on realm type, if you're on a PVE realm, you can only transfer to other PVE realms, however if you're on a PVP realm you can swap to PVE or PVP realms, barring pvp servers that you have opposite faction characters on.
---
&gt;And when they say gold transfer is limited, does it only counts raw gold ?, or they count item vendor value as gold as well ?
---
Raw gold, just the amount that appears in your bags there.
---
Yeah because everyone needs to be bis class in the bis race with bis gear to contribute anything at all. 
---
This is such a false statement. Myself and the other hunter in the guild are always top 8 dps for the raid. Sure they don't scale well into naxx but that's like a year away.
---
Why would they? They didn't do that 15 years ago.
---
I'm not trying to deny the grind is bad, I'm saying that some people did stay on.  For some people the grind was worth it.  I've seen people with Rank 14 weapons in high level guilds, this is a fact.  
---
People also put down their one character for 3 months and come back to their main again.
---
The amount of people who pull that have no business doing it... is too damn high.
---
I got my priest to 60, and now I want to spec him Holy, which means he'll be largely useless outside of groups.
---
So I'm trying to get a rogue up to be my gold-making dude (got him to 31 and I feel like I've hit a wall).
---
People who can still sincerely xD are pure and should be protected.
---
Not sure if WSG vendor has anything available yet. Check out the AV vendor in Hillsbrad (north of Tarren Mill just before Alterac).
---
Eh I don't think adding that element would make Horde unambiguously the good guys, for the reasons you point out. Even if they are an oppressed minority, they have done a lot of bad things. I think if they went this way they should change the leadership structure to something less authoritarian (which I guess is what they're doing now with the end of BfA story content), just as a structural foil to the authoritarian Alliance political structure. So the split in faction ends up not really being a good vs bad thing, it ends up being a conflict between authority and freedom, order and chaos, traditional morality vs amorality or moral relativity, etc.
---
I solo'd it on an ele shaman using frost shock, searing totem, a mana potion, a dark rune, and several grenades. Think I finished with like 20% health and 0% mana.
---
what group pvp? in WSG if you are being focused you have already won cus warlocks are tanky af and most of your dmg still happens cc'd or not, in AV theres very likely a corspe around as a mage my canablise is used like 10+ per AV, as a warlock id use it even more cus of mana tap mid fight
---
Very easily just found one of many hunters that solo a run in 12 minutes.

---
If you by right mean toxic and entitled then yes, he was right.
---
But what if my main is a druid and all my alts are druids with different specs?
---
Why are you being so rude? I feel like its completely valid for him to raid log on his priest...? This thread is about altoholics, hes allowed to play multiple classes at 60.
---
Well that is true, I was only 11-12 at the time but I generally had the mindset people decked out in epics were awesome until I started to get some
---
of my own and the rarer the better. My ability to research anything about the game was very limited because I just started learning English at the time.
---
To be fair, no one wants to hear that the last 10+ years of their professional life have been a complete failure in the eyes of the customer.
---
As a priest I have single handedly won games because I would bait people into the horde fortress. It blows my mind how I use the same bait technique (hug the corner and fear them) every time and multiple people always fall for it.  The best ones have to be the paladin tanks who get feared into drek and then they DS and then run out with heal aggro so now their healers are dead and hes dead after the DS wears off and now the raid wiped and their nearest SHGY.

R14 Axes 1H axes for Orc DW Fury or R14 swords for humans.

Ime, Warrior starts to chug past ~16. You start needing pots if a same-level mob patrols into you right after you killed the first one, you can't 1v1 an elite 2 levels below you, etc. The gameplay rhythm is still just as fun, especially in a group, but you need a lot more caution. Mage makes a good main - a lot of warrior problems disappear with a high-level funneling gold for armor and especially weapons.
---
Thanks
---
Idk if this is just a Pagle thing, but IF has no NPCs right now. No auctioneers, bankers, flight masters, etc. We all had to take the tram to SW to get to raid tonight LOL.
---
You either have no tanks, no healers, or you pull all 4....it never goes right
---
The vendors can't get enough of it tho... That's mainly where the money is. Selling gear from the tribute chest is just a bonus.
---
This is why people are doing it. If they win, they get gold. If they lose, they can just /afk or ignore you and don't lose anything.
---
Lots of people out there just want to use deathrolls to scam people.
---
Deathrolling with people you know or friends or guildies is fun though.
---
Can anyone confirm if HoJ is still dropping from anger or has been moved to emp already?
---
and horde arent going to transfer off remulos, because they can't go to PvP and won't want to go to US servers
---
So quite a few things here which would easily explain the discrepancy between us:
---
- You've got 225 damage as the white hit median. Going through our logs from when our tank was prot with QS, this number was closer to 200 for targets with Sunder Armor applied
---
- Your tank only has 17,5% crit. Ours ran just above 30% in a raiding scenario over the course of a full run. This is of course dependent on gear, and if your tank only has 17,5% crit, then that's naturally the number you should use
---
- It looks like you've completely forgotten about Impale across the board, and crit in total in some parts
---
- You've again got these weird, wrong assumptions about game mechanics, like improved revenge generating 25 threat on proc. I have no idea where you've got that from, but just like Sunder Armor cannot crit, Revenge procs also do not generate any rage directly. You could of course say that since a stunned mob cannot dodge or parry, your next main hand auto attack would be a hit, but you're very specifically stating something else
---
- Your rage estimated rage generation is wrong, as you are once again not accounting for neither Impale nor even crit chance
---
- You've decided to deduct the threat from the auto attack portion of the Heroic Strike from the threat generated, but you're still adding the rage cost of not having the auto attack. It's either or, not both. I would definitely add the opportunity cost in rage, but you need to add the threat from the damage as well
---
I can create a spreadsheet for you tomorrow, so you can roast mine as well if you like. ;)
---
Heartseeker horde is busier than ever.  Org is getting crowded.  I've never seen it so busy.
---
If paid transfers opened prior to BGs, you'd have a point.  Afterwards, I can say that I've only been successfully ganked once since the 10th.  And that's with a lot of farming.  Had I tried it the first week of December, I'd be slaughtered every 5 minutes.
---
I think he‚Äôs commenting on the other guy‚Äôs unprovoked whispering, not the mob tagging itself
---
Bloodsail is alliance dominated but it isn't 100% :P No need to drive off the Horde on a PVE server.
---
You do realise that 1 weapom DPS is equal to 14 AP right?
---
And that's the major difference, for someone who is spending "casual hours" (as op put it) and are below the "honor for exalted" this week, they gained less rp than they will next week, however for people who are ranking, they gained a lot more.
---
Yeah I think the reset was a whopping 2 hours MAYBE. I got kicked and managed to log back in 2 hours later when I tried.
---
So finally all the Rank14 Nerds can go to sleep!
---
You got the long answer in the other comment. The short one is, there's real money involved in EvE along with serious hours. All which can be undone in an instant. You die, you lose what's on hand. Start from scratch.
---
How much DPS does ret do compared to similar crap gear as warriors currently have?
---
rocket power
---
You‚Äôre leveling at a good time. No horde zergs corpse farming you. 
---
It‚Äôs also much more time consuming to level on alliance but the endgame travel times balance out the extra time you spend traveling in between 1-60.
---
Same, I already know I'm not going to want to invest hundreds upon hundreds of hours in AV, so just get the rank I want and be done. I play this game for fun after all.
---
This is how it was in 2005-2006. No changes
---
This is very charming!
---
30-40 min queue in OCE. No way horde lets alliance win. Almost never lose now.
---
They did that, everyone complained
---
While items are much better, it's not the DPS/consumables I would be worried about...but casual player skill.
---
Yeh same here, I give up on rank 10 as a filthy casual. I'm hoping with a lot of people done with their av rep grind, that this week will be better and that rank 7 and 8 are still achievable.
---
And the playerbase would be too scattered to enjoy it.
---
My main is a 60 shaman, my favorite character is a 60 warrior, my "currently playing" is a 60 warlock, and I have a stabled 32 priest and 15 hunter. Although lately I've been feeling the urge to level a druid.
---
You're an idiot.
---
Im really trying to force myself to stick with my Warrior (56). I dont have all the time in the world like most so I told myself before classic released I was going to stick with 1 class and 1 only. Plus it would make me get more end game content completed, rep ect. On top of that seems theres been a shortage on tanks and my guild tends to need me often. But its been difficult to fight the urge as i do have a couple classes under lv 13.
---
For me its a flavor thing. I dont care about big number and what not, just as theres cool story to he class. Warrior flavor is very bland. When i first started playing i let my buddy choose his race/class first since hes a little more picky than I. That was a mistake. He chose druid, which on alliance side thats what i kinda wanted to play because i knew druid did it all and it would probably help with the alt itch. Now my buddy doesnt play and Im a Warrior. Why im a little salty at my friend now but its whatever i guess. At lv 56 its really hard to imagine starting over.
---
Get a free rename as well by making a toon with the same name before you transfer.
---
It sounds like he did have fun though
---
I wiped an ally push when somebody had one of those skeleton minion OH from Onyxia, the skelly aggroed me and I tan it into drek, the marshals did the rest. 
---
It was glorious.
---
Are you able to transfer to populated servers like Herod ?
---
My highest is a 34 mage that I abandoned somewhere. I'm brand new to WoW as of classic, so I'm having to learn all of this for the first time.
---
OP shopped the original to basically show that any server with over 60% of a certain faction, the minority faction would all transfer off so that they could be in a majority server with the introduction of paid transfers. Ridiculous considering world pvp is dead.
---
no, i got the 1g, im the troll
---
I just love how everyone bitched about q times but are gonna turn around n drop 60 bucks to get on the high pop servers üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
Level 44 plate boots that on use give 5 seconds immunity to immobilizing effects.  Doesn't work on slows, unfortunately.
---
DJ is a great guild, always love seeing them around!
---
I kinda like server communities and recognizing people in the world, and it is a big appeal of classic, but balanced servers simply won't happen, regardless of if blizzard incentivizes people to play the minority faction or punishes the majority. Cross realm sharding would probably be the most useful tool blizzard can use to balance out the amount of alliance and horde in a given shard, however theres still simply more horde than alliance anyways so ita still not going to being the 50/50 balance people want anyways, but it'll help out those on like 70/30 servers. Sharding however comes with it's own problems such as people shard/layer hopping to farm materials/mobs/escape a gank as well as the fact that any alliance on alliance dominated servers would once again become the minority. Blizzard could also create a war mode for classic and drop pvp servers all together, but this also fundamentally changes classic and well "no changes".
---
You need to download Lort UI classic. It‚Äôs on GitHub and you can search on google like i said, tem you just extract and name change the folder ( at GitHub they explain everything tou need to know about it). Good luck !!
---
I chose Hunter as my initial main and I regretted it. They feel somewhat exceptional for handling 1 vs 1 fights and even taking on elite quests solo a fair amount of the time, but I feel like AoE is such a huge part of the game and hunters are NOT very well equipped for that. They can definitely contribute with explosive trap, multishot, volley, etc, but that basically requires a dedicated player tank of some sort. A pet tank is good but AoE threat is not its strength whatsoever unless really giving them time for growl etc. Despite hunters being considered a prime solo class I had by far the most fun in groups and dungeons in particular. I feel hunters shine a lot better in dungeons, as then they can unload their AoE or just burn down single targets either or. In a pinch pets can offtank briefly or even do a distracting pull while the hunter character runs past for a feign. In a way hunters can sort of be a stealth class but I'd still probably have to hand it to rogues moreso.
---
Guild Wars 2's autoattacks are valid attack options in their own right.
---
Same here I would like to know as well.
---
25 dollars?
---
#HOLY FUCK
---
Sure...but they wouldn't be losing to OS if the OS doesn't roll against them ;)
---
Dark Rune :P
---
I meant L45 chars haha. 
---
Tried it on Hunter and the pet heal can't keep up, run OOM and dead.
---
Did it yesterday on my 45 Warlock and it was so easy chain fearing. OP class for soloing.
---
My first 60 was a hunter and then I moved onto rogue. My gear isn't great on the hunter - but I do need gold for my 60 mount. How does one do a tribute run solo?
---
You won't. BWL is just more of the same once the novelty of different looking mobs wears off. Not as piss easy as molten core but not much harder either. Phase 5 and 6 will introduce raids that are actually challenging but at this rate classic will be a ghost town by then
---
I thought you couldn‚Äôt
---
shhhh don't tell them our secrets
---
Sure...but i assume you tell them that?
---
I've repeatedly said...no one is objecting to people rolling for anything if they tell people up front.  We're objecting to OP rolling on EVERYTHING without warning them first.
---
&gt;people
---
You mean troglodytes
---
Yes there are some exceptions to every rule, but by and large this isn't a grind for 99.9999999999% of people. Most can't do it and most who succeed will burn out doing so.
---
Yea, three might be pushing it later down the road. I‚Äôd say two is good tho
---
I tried something new..... I .... tried.... retail.... and..... I ..... liked it. *runs*.
---
Holy shit I think I stand corrected
---
This game already has tons of changes.
---
I like it! looks clean AF, everything is easy to read, Nice find!
---
my apologies for the incoherent comment the other day
---
Ah yes, selling the solution to the shitty problem you created.
---
Confirmed, only person who comes off as a "little bitch" in this exchange is coocoocthulu
---
It is terrible. Even a 60/40 means that other side has 50% more players. That is massive and not because of wPvP but community.
---
You have 50% more guilds, more groups, more items in the AH, more activies, just about everything.

I honestly thought fury was more for dual wield.

Mace i guess since your not losing the 5% crit from the arms spec.

Don‚Äôt take to much time getting either of them since the polearm from AV is way better.
---
Damn thanks, I was looking at top post this week. Don't know how i missed it!
---
Currently 1h/OH is by far the best because Mageblade is a much better item than Staff of Dominance. 
---
However when BWL comes out that changes, Staff of Shadow Flame is better than Claw of Chromaggus + Tome of Shadow Force.

WESTFALL-US NEEDS MORE HORDE!

Muscle memory.
---
Prevents me from having to click on things, and keeps my hands situated around the movement keys.
---
Yes, I actually play like this, and yes I'm comfortable with it.
---
What role did you get invited to the dungeon to fill?
---
&gt;So you now agree that that is selfish behaviour but when you were called out on it being selfish you replied with "no you're selfish!"
---
Let me expand on that since you are having trouble understanding.
---
&gt;I roll on everything **that I need** whether it's for feralDPS/balance/healing/tanking
---
Where the prior statement was:
---
&gt;I agree that it's selfish to **roll on everything regardless of role**
---
Do you understand the distinction? Rolling on an item you need is valid, rolling need on everything regardless of role is selfish.
---
But no, you're trying to push a narrative so you'll just backpedal. 
---
&gt;Stay classy, bud. I'm just glad others in the thread are calling you on your shit behaviour as well...
---
Hopefully their reading comprehension isn't as bad as yours.
---
The problem is, it's not beneficial to yourself to bother getting those HK, only other people benefit.
---
Bragging rights (and the wolf)
---
There isn't real money involved in EvE. The whole "ships worth $10000" line comes from the manufactured exchange rate of ISK (eve money) to real currency. There is no (legal) way to buy ships with actual money.
---
Blaumeux seems almost perfectly balanced and none of us alliance are leaving so that's pretty absurd
---
I got 40g for that recipe, was going for more on the AH, too
---
I don't think it's merely the danger - it's the division of 'safe zone' and 'Danger Zone" - The Danger Zone can be full of paper tigers, but the gameplay loop of "Start in Town, stock up on supplies/gather quests, Travel through Wilderness, Assault Hostile Base, Get out, Return through Wilderness, Return to Base, sell junk/repair/turn in quests" is important.
---
Even in Retail WoW... Mechagon feels like a zone 'done right' - You have the Main Base of Rustbolt, which provides repairs, a bunch of daily quests, a few trainers and profession tables, the Reputation Vendor, and The Big Crafting Robot that provides the real rewards and supplies for the zone and turn-ins, and several hostile places, including the big, heavily-guarded Spare Parts (Map Currency) farm of Junkwatt Depot.
---
Oh, Heart of Thorn's mastery system and map-based currency did a great job converting the function of the Reputation Grind of WoW over, and done better. And then they ejected it in PoF, using one trivial map currency (With nothing to spend it on), and the mount masteries.
---
How to know if someone played eve: they will tell you.
---
Did you inform them you would be rolling on DPS items while filling the role of tank?
---
FY19 ended 5 months ago
---
This info is very old, titans are not that hard to get anymore, also you can buy skillpoints now
---
How dare you attempt to hold a conversation here that doesn‚Äôt revolve around whining about the game.
---
You forgot the hickory.
---
Well this use to be a thing when World PVP was probably at its peak during Cataclysm on Emerald Dream - US. Probably one of the few servers where WPVP was very active and it had a pretty even Horde and Alliance faction balance. Also there were numerous WPVP guilds on the Alliance and the Horde that would form alliances and gank the other faction. Probably one of my best time playing WoW. 
---
However, you guessed it. Maybe there was always drama but it really exploded shortly before the release of MoP. There was a ton of guild drama. A lot of Horde members would create alts on the Alliance side and find out when the Alliance held its RP events and would come in 40 man raids to simply troll and break up said events. It became really frustrating and things even got personal.
---
Nah we used all of that as syrup.
---
Both players need it, is it just a matter of who needs it more? Who gets the most utlity out of it? Or just what role you're performing for two hours in that instance? 
---
I've seen so many tanks roll on both the Dal Rends in UBRS runs for their offspec, literally no one has ever called them greedy except it seems to be the sentiment on reddit.
---
Did you play 2-4 hours every other weekend and got almost r13? Im sorry to say you lying or just played alot more than you remember you did. With like 10hours more each day
---
Go to your aid station and count how many vendors are around your aid station, realize that horde can aggro every single one of them. Your archers can still attack people capping the aid station GY. Now walk over to the hordes aid station and count how many vendors are in that area. I'll do the math for you, its 0.
---
You realize it only takes 5 weeks to achieve any rank assuming you hold that rank or higher each week?
---
60 warrior, 50 mage, 44 rogue, 38 rogue and lvl 8 hunter. First time playing WoW, I think im set on rogue.
---
I thought that was because they made it significantly harder to run the census add on?
---
Just about to hit exalted, and I'm barely 130k :(
---
[Here's the best one IMO.](https://youtu.be/KZQ4ejFq7BY)
---
Let's all hope that alliance come to the other PvE realms such as Mankrik instead
---
I‚Äôm sure faction change has been brought up many times... what is the argument against allowing faction changes to certain servers?  I would gladly switch if I could.   Or is it just something they would never do. Seems like it would be a better attempt.
---
I believe as he said on the last line, that if a druid simply states "Hey, I can help with the Tank role - but this is my OFF SPEC and I am here for Main Spec, is that ok?".  
---
If a druid makes that crystal clear before the damn run and everyone agrees, we can go.
---
If not I tend to link exactly what I need and ask again, maybe I need a particular tank pieces to get better at doing 5mans/10mans as a tank and some healing pieces, i'll link it and double check etc.
---
Never had a problem, I've had to leave a run and join other groups since some was not in agreement (but VERY few) and I've even said I'll drop rolling on certain pieces or promise multiple runs when I can and carry on with a happy team.
---
It shouldn't really be a problem if ya people generally can be upfront about their plans.
---
No, it effects everyone, including yourself. You're changing the number of active players taken into account.
---
hahahahahahahhah
---
And I'm deeply saddened from people you selfishly take gear from. I hope they find a better person to play with soon!
---
Now is the perfect time to grind r14 before he is capable of remembering you neglecting him
---
Pretty much what happened to me, rolled on herod and saw pretty early it was an est time zone server but it was also a huge server so I figured that wouldn't be a problem. Well I work until 3 am server time and I'm not too sure if there is a single guild that begins raiding after that time on the server. I haven't looked too hard, but have done some /who molten core and it's usually pugs/guilds that already started in mc at those times, if theres a single person at all. Haven't seen a guild that is "late night" that starts later than midnight in trade chat/general chat either. It's pretty hard to get dungeon groups together that late too.
---
Unfortunately this wont work. Your server will likely be on a downward spiral for a while, especially before bwl release. Alliance know what they're in for on herod. I feel for you, it sucks but you'll have to get used to a pve server mentality or transfer yourself.
---
Yikes.
---
Atiesh NA normal - Alliance &lt;Redacted&gt;, server first at everything but azuregos and very likely more world boss kills with partner guild &lt;Always Be Pulling&gt; than the rest of the server combined
---
Objectively there are a lot of issues with QoL and poor design that may turn you off.  Examples being 1.12 AV and the honor system for poor design and requiring mods to do basic things like check your hit or crit chance and to sort the AH for examples if QoL.    The community of friends I made in vanilla who play classic and nostalgia are what keep me interested personally.  YMMV.
---
I thought I misread that "1 day 7 hour" at the bottom. My longest AV was like 58 minutes.
---
C A S H G R A B
---
Shut the fuck up and just enjoy the video.
---
Every fucking meme
---
Can y'all meme "creators" pick some fresher memes to repurpose? I hate that this sub has made me sick of seeing Danny DeVito
---
Yep. I'd love to have other characters, but the idea of having to go through the whole pre-raid bis and then run raids and shit on a second character, so soon after the first? Yeah, nah, no thanks. Maybe later.
---
Stalagg here. Can confirm everywhere is miserable lag wise. Inside instances though is A-Okay.
---
Been saying this for a long time, but classic's PVP system is antisocial and potentially harmful to people's health. I understand that people want #nochanges, but it's irresponsible to put a system like this into place especially with all the hindsight in place.
---
But it's what we got so we're stuck with it unless we can all agree that things need to change. Aka that's never going to happen.
---
Lmao
---
FYI: This is grossly inefficient honor-wise. Because of 25% DR, your enemies will pretty much give 0 honor after 30 minutes of AV unless you camp in some obscure corner and get solo kills. Especially as alliance, I'm pretty sure you want to kill a bunch of hordes 2-3 times, win the game and queue up for next.
---
No, dual boxing a tank and healer
---
Blizzard didnt care about server pops because they already knew it would boost paid transfers numbers.  And on top of that they fuck up servers within 3 months, before a server has a chance to develop into a community.  Activision, you fucked classic up so hard, its the final nail in the coffin for me.
---
Much appreciated!
---
Blizzard "Adhering to classic there will be no server transfers". Also Blizzard: create an environment where people will pay anything to move. Open up server transfers and profit
---
Leveled a Hunter to 35 to supplement my Warlock by training up Alchemy/Tailoring for extra cooldowns. It was like grinding my balls with sandpaper. I have no idea how you guys enjoy leveling so much but power to you! (obviously not my cup of tea lol)
---
Your points only matter when both sides are ignoring each other and sprinting to each other's base uncontested. In this isolated (avoidable by horde) scenario, alliance have the advantage. The problem with that is, if even a small handful of horde choose to defend, either between the two towers mid point or at base, or both, they have a massive fucking advantage and can cockblock an entire raid of alliance. Alliance cannot do the same by map design. The fact that Stonehearth bunker is so far out it's a damn joke, it might as well not even exist.
---
Flamelash horde incoming...
---
The classic community is full of endless complaints.
---
Fairbanks seems fine to me.
---
The highest I got on alliance was a lvl 35 worgen warrior in WOD. My first ever character as a kid on a private server was a warlock worgen though. But then I went horde and never looked back ever since I got the real game. Kinda want to try my hand at alliance on classic but I'm on a pvp server and don't want to switch just for a character. I'd probably do a ret pala anyway, I really have a problem with subclasses. Im playing enh on horde.
---
*Is how I react to someone trying so hard to justify their selfishness...*
---
It's not really an exact science and part of it is just what you feel like you need in any given moment. It's also worth mentioning that the most mana efficient heal is not necessarily the best choice in any given moment, but it's definitely something to consider.
---
[Here's a graph someone linked on here a while ago about how various ranks of spells scale with +healing](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/638223908436312075/643685801582002177/HPtoHPM.png).
---
Personally I've been using Heal rank 2 as my low-mana efficient small heal for topping off dps in dungeons, and I've been swapping between greater heal rank 1 and heal rank 4 as my go-to mana efficient tank heal. 
---
A lot of this really depends on the fight though - when I joined a pretty good raiding guild that is killing all the bosses in MC in 1-2 minutes, suddenly everyone starts going with less mana efficient choices like flash heal and shields. Just depends on the situation.
---
Its an allegory to our reality, if we worked together we could fix our problems but of course that wont happen. Let the man dream.
---
Just wait a month when people will realize hot much they have to grind, probably most of them think "yeah easy rank 14, no problem!" Just hype atm, like classic release everyone was in and now? Alot of people are gone forever. I am looking forward how much/less I will get (eu so tomorrow I will see!)
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Right now probably the worst idea to compete, but for me, I wait what tomorrow has for me and if I get like 20% I will go level my mage to 60 and then see what goes!
---
I dont know why but this gave me a good 5min laugh, plus that dude looks stoked as fuck
---
from 10 until 2, about 4 hours
---
Server
---
You are right, you can make some of them kinda work but imo it feels awful to play the classic iteration of them.
---
&gt; I find it a shame that paladin tanks for raids basically don't exist
---
Guess which class/spec I played in both PvE and PvP from TBC to mid Cata before I quit ha ha... In Classic I'm only good for 5 mans and throwing snowballs on Horde in AV.
---
Double Yikes!
---
Oh, I agree. I don't seriously expect it to really happen. It's the same crab bucket mentality that keeps PVP the hellish grind it's always been. The groups with enough organization to make this actually happen, the hardcore PVP guilds, would never take a break from honor botting to do this. 
---
Just some fun math to show that 93.3% of people would be better off not grinding at all and that it's just our own greed that hurts us.
---
Warlocks can solo DM East jump runs solo but it takes decent gear and a good amount of practice. Definitely want to be Mining to be worth it but its higher than 40g/hr.
---
Warlocks and Priests can solo farm Maraudon almost naked though.
---
Depends on the organization. Companies often use different fiscal years for various reasons.
---
i wouldnt trust that guy
---
I dunno but obviously I didn't so feel free to continue acting superior over trivial garbage. I'm glad my life isn't so empty that I need to pile on strangers on the internet to feel good about myself.
---
I mean I also didn't get RE2 for free because I have the original. Or literally any other game that has been remastered.
---
Why dream about an exploit that wouldn't ever happen. Yes that would be an exploit. Obviously the system wasn't designed to accommodate everyone wasting time on 9 alts
---
As a horde player who was grouped with Herod based players in all 3 of my AV matches I must ask "Why is that realm stuffed with angry tryhards"?
---
People were anonymous and hopeful back then. Now they are anonymous and mean-spirited.
---
Never respect people based on their gear..
---
Well, yes and no, you benefit as well, however you would benefit more if you spent the time just farming honor on your main.
---
It‚Äôs not abandoned that‚Äôs for sure I see a lot of alliance and horde on here just more of a majority of horde , but I definitely get ganked when I‚Äôm out doing shit all the time and of course I gank as well
---
Here‚Äôs the problem.
---
Horde have long queues. Therefore, only the people who are serious about PvP bother queuing much. Therefore, Horde wins. Therefore, Alliance players get frustrated and stop queuing. Therefore, Horde queues get longer.
---
*Is how I react to someone trying even harder to justify their selfishness...*
---
You seem to conveniently forget that horde can literally wall jump into the alliance fortress right at the flag, with little to no aggro from riflemen.
---
True, but the effect is so miniscule for own self. People are selfish and without a direct incentive, this is never going to happen. You could try to coordinate this using the realm's discord, but that is still only a fraction of the population and as long as the number of pvp'ers is in the hundreds, there is no way this is happening.
---
Okay zoomer
---
Whitemane hype
---
I need to get my mind control helmet built. I assume one could just mc an ally into them
---
Part of this was the loudest majority of people asking for #nochanges and pure vanilla upon original release. While it may be easy to blame Blizzard (Activision at this point) for their many glaring incompetences and out of touch decisions, it doesn't solely fall on them.
---
I was thinking that I'm getting sick of classic (and WoW in general) because of this. Only the loser shut-ins win. I have a life to live. Grinding all that honor isn't even fun.
---
thank you for this information source, deff a better pre-raid bis list!
---
That is true but 70/30 on a high pop is probably equivalent alliance population as a 50/50 medium pop server. So it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm getting completely screwed. I‚Äôm just having a medium pop experience in those areas you described.
---
If your standing is high the odds of it impacting your standing within your bracket is slim to none, if your standing is low the time it takes to improve your standing within your bracket is negligible (and the odds of it improving your standing within your bracket still isn't great)
---
I did vanilla without quest mods, I did classic without quest mods.  
---
Believe it or not but 99.9% of the time all the information you need is in the quest text.
---
Here's the thing, heartseeker SEEMED just fine to me until about level 40.
---
What sort of things should I look out for in the chat?
---
They did for content, yes. You're picking one of the only things that was 1.12, and that's because old talents sucked ass. Go read the old druid talents, then say anyone would want to relive that.
---
I'm here hoping for faction change option so I can stop having 15min que times honestly blows
---
Without offtank you have to kill 1 warmaster (Iceblood). With offtank you can just ignore him too (have the offtank drag him off somewhere) and just directly kill Drek.
---
You can completely ignore the 3 other warmasters in there (west/east frostwolf and tower point) and any tank who pulls them just doesn't know how to do the pull properly.
---
The only way R14 will be feasible for me will be if Blizzard leaves the servers up for the next 15 years, and the only active accounts are chinese bots left to still run on them, leaving me targets to farm them for honor since nobody else will be playing.
---
Why did I expect anything other than yet another "no u" response...
---
You can respond to this and selfishly await a response that isn't coming.
---
Adieu.
---
Optimizing the fun out of a game basically
---
It‚Äôs only good for some classes, others not so much. But the ones it‚Äôs good for it‚Äôs *really* good.
---
It's a case of "I push you into this hole, and then sell you a ladder".
---
I still have the original War3 and TFT, I won't be buying the game again just for some better graphics.
---
It‚Äôs not but the Warcraft 3 had it
---
Something like this? https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05233112521051-052-052300012

do u use leatrix plus?
---
You realize horde can just send mats to random ally account?
---
THEY ASKED ME TO MAKE FRESH MEMES
---
SO ANYWAY I STARTED BLASTING
---
Thank you! I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs common or not to do fury with a 2H, but I‚Äôm saving a respec for lvl 60!

*Where was Stormwind, when the Westfall fell?*
---
Competent game developers, Community Council, popular vote, good game director, lots of options. I think most will agree having AQ/Naxx level PVP rewards in MC is a bit scuffed, and not the best decision.
---
See what people are running and what the needs of the server are. Compare items on the AH to see what the market is like. But do remember that a lot of that can change by the time you actually level your character so there is still a risk factor.
---
they use 3 "servers" Kalimdor, Eastern Kingdoms, and Instances. You'll be fine.
---
Nah, as far as BiS lists goes you generally won‚Äôt use any felheart other than bracers for the most part. It‚Äôs a great pvp set but for pve most pieces are lackluster compared to blues you can get or other epics.
---
Especially with transfers being new and we don't know what the impact will be for sure, that's a good point.
---
the biggest thing about questie is that it shows you every available quest around your level in any zone and continent. ever since i found out about that i don't play without it because i'm scared to miss a quest.
---
Worst idea I‚Äôve ever heard of honestly
---
Indeed. Good luck!
---
Ok boomer
---
\*38 manning Balinda, you forgot about the two jamokes
---
pretty sure all servers for a region are grouped in classic.
---
Do wc for your talbar mantle and crescent staff.
---
Do sfk for belt/chest/shoulder.
---
Get engineers cloak from stonetalon.
---
Rest of the pieces just buy greens off of ah.
---
I remember when this game out the first time I knew some guy that would bug bags and bags full of moon cloth then transfer his char and sell the moon cloth. If memory serves he bought the moon cloth for like 3g each on illidan (may be wrong on server name) then sold it on a lower pop server for like 15g each.
---
Yeah it's just very hard work as non-premade Alliance at the moment. With 30-40 min games and a sub 5 second queue (even at 5am) you spend a lot of time feeling negativity, unless you give up/afk or just roam looking for 1v1s. 
---
Obviously alliance would just prefer a fast 8 min game where everyone gets 2-3k bonus honour and a handful of HKs, then immediately into the next, these turtles do nothing for us but a good amount for horde. At the start of last reset my Rapid Fire from Drek didn't finish cooling down before I got to the next Galv, today I've done AV all day and rarely got to fight Drek!
---
Let me rephrase that so that you can better understand why people aren't all to happy:  
---
"Company is shortsightedly dumping the value of their IP for short term gains because their stockholders are locusts"
---
What do you mean? This literally happens all the time, whether or not you realize its happening.
---
Bigglesworth?
---
No I played many more hours on the weekend, probably 12 or more each day when I was that rank. One thing to note was that playing was much more passive as the queues took forever for Alliance on that particular server.
---
Oh my god
---
aoe farming doesnt really pick up until 26 with cone of cold.  prior to cone you are typically wiped when a nova is resisted.
---
Not just the fun harmless bugs. The old itemization and talents that made MC a hard raid, old scalings, blood plague, prenerf c'thun, AP TOEP ZHC PI POM Pyro, all the quirks that got streamlined before 1.12
---
All of the top end guilds except 1 elitist guild work together to drop head on my server and as that 1 elitist guild trolls us we have to start dropping at 7.30am on each teams raid day.
---
Well people are just people. In games, they're mostly dicks if the game rewards them for being dicks. Players are the ones being dicks, but blizzard was the one that could easily see it coming and do something(such as scrapping no-BG phase 2, as a starter)
---
New Insult: 
---
‚ÄúI will Venmo you $50 right now. $25 to transfer servers and $25 to fuck off.‚Äù
---
And if everybody else bothers with that, they just got you an easy rank 10-11. Maybe even 12.
---
Of course it‚Äôs not relevant anyway, it would never happen.
---
To be fair, this is exactly how the math worked in vanilla. It even would've been easier to actually pull off given the overall smaller server size and tighter knit communities back then.
---
I dont think it's even greed it's just a silly exploit you're talking about. I wouldn't be interested even if I got all the benefit myself. As a matter of principle I dont try to cheat the system, but that's why I dont always get the highest ranks in games.
---
Yes. Works for EU alliance AV
---
Oh boy here we go, next up mount store and level boosts.
---
Ah the good ole days. Nowadays even someone f2p could grind into a titan in a few months. Last time I played I grinded into a supercarrier and fax (capital sized heal ship) with just a few months of doing a special kinda of mission. Skill injectors changed the way an average player progressed in eve so much, and capital sized mining ships changed how much Titans could be banged out every day in all the major alliances
---
&gt; wowprogress

https://www.wowprogress.com/realms/rank/us
---
Wow you weren't kidding. It only shows retail not classic I believe, but the pvp realms are like 10-1 ratios at minimum for miles.
---
 it's the same as vanilla but its exploiting the system. Obviously it was designed to count only active pvpers. that's why it requires the active HK's. Getting the bare minimum is
---
I cant see them regardless if Im on my rogue or paladin
---
The best kind
---
Also on Earthfury, got about 100k honor this past week. Went from rank 2 3/4 to rank 3 3/4. Crazy. Guess I‚Äôll just settle for whatever comes my way lol
---
I have the exact same issue, though gaming on a 2560x1440 165hz G-Sync Monitor, for years I've tried to resolve this issue, and its mainly with WoW, I've tried the HD60 pro, and even upgraded to the 4K60pro, working like a charm, until I open up WoW... Flickering and no smooth fast paced gameplay to enjoy.  
---
Without the dedicated streamer or HDMI plugged in, everything works like a charm again.
---
Difference being that if they killed you with mindcontrol, chances are you participated in PvP where the worst outcome is a corpserun.
---
If you're getting mindcontrolled out of a BG, you're getting a 15+ minute debuff making you unable to do that type of content.
---
There's a difference between world PvP and locking someone out of content for 15 minutes.
---
Nah what will happen is that 35% alliance will leave to a balanced server then that now 100% horde will have to leave to go somewhere too.
---
Statistically it would always be an advantage to roll first. Otherwise it‚Äôs just a nearly 50/50 gamble. Way better than IRL roulette.
---
The OP is meant to push the idea to the ridiculous extreme but the math is the same if you replace the dumb, 40-person bank alt raids with legitimate low-level PVP alts. The low level penalties to honor mean even extremely successful twinks still get placed low in the standings, pushing the level 60s up.
---
I'm guessing speed runs for certain loot/gold
---
Yeah, if you sit in the packs and arcane explosion in raid gear, you will still be OK. Don't even need to switch to AoE spec. Super easy for mages to clear
---
WoW is a dangerous activity during your thesis.
---
Started as hunter, got like 3 pieces in MC, did the Rhok'Delar quest, got the bow, but pretty unlucky with MC gear otherwise.
---
Then I leveled a Shaman. Everyone loves Shamans. I got requests from guilds to join them. Settled on a semi hardcore guild to raid with, got full T1, aurastone, etc. This is my main now.
---
Then I leveled a Warrior, because Warrior is obviously the best class in Classic. It's a tank, completing my dps/heal/tank trifecta, and also does MC weekly.
---
Now I'm leveling a Warlock. I don't really know why. I definitely won't have time to play all these characters to the max when BWL comes out.
---
There's never ever any incentive for eve behaviour in a theme park games, they are simply too different in design
---
I'd go with Gatorbite and axe spec 100% 
---
It's just considerably better in most situations to have that raw crit.
---
Bar down
---
I'm level 49 on my Hunter and I'm STILL wearing the triprunners. Nothing else I've found has compared
---
Because people don‚Äôt want to waste time.
---
I believe the issue would be resolved having a capture card which can "bypass" the raw picture using DisplayPort Connections, then use both In &amp; Out to connect the Main Monitor
---
"Pretty easy" I lol'ed.
---
You're correct. There is a hierarchy for debuffs and weapon debuffs are extremely low priority (possibly the lowest). They will not knock off higher tier debuffs.
---
The problem with fixing facials is that the #nOcHaNgEs dumbasses chime in and scare Blizzard away.
---
I just sold mine for 80g. Stalagg horde. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll be worth more in the off season but I didn‚Äôt wanna risk selling it for less.
---
No
---
Dead Game
---
Is rank 10 the elite tier now? Give me a break. If you play every day just doing pvp it‚Äôs pretty easy, just not right now.
---
Did they change the rank with TBC patch for the black mount?
---
I only hit Blood Guard and remember having black raptor.
---
No it isnt. It is priced to make blizzard as much money as it can.
---
You have to understand that they are not playing, they are working. And don't mess with them because they may be frustrated. If you need to do some runs it's better to start your group, because having fun isn't what everyone is looking in wow classic.
---
It's no secret to me, mr. Kromcrush
---
I hope my 30k or so was enough for half of rank 2.
---
Longest game for me was an epic fight that lasted almost 2 hours. We won as alliance in the end. Both treant and ice golem got killed on both sides. We won with a small group of 6 men defeating Drek whilst having 5-6 aoe mages defending and rest standing on hut GY, or outside, defending the small PvE group.
---
Money is the only reason
---
it‚Äôs both, believe whatever you want.
---
I had 300k on one of the lowest pops and JUST went from 2 to 3
---
Naxxramas released on 6/20/2006 and a small minority of players even entered the raid.  It was out for less than 7 months before TBC release on 1/16/2007.  Naxxramas progress in vanilla was incredibly slow, not just because it was difficult, but also because the pre-TBC launch events sort of made Naxx feel pretty unnecessary to even do since leveling to 70 was going to more or less invalidate all your efforts there.  Only the most hardcore of hardcore raiding guilds cleared Naxx, with enormous swaths just going in and killing Instructor and maybe nothing else, or maybe just the first bosses in a couple of other wings in order to get the higher ilvl gear to farm AQ40 more quickly.  Relative to how long final raids have lasted in other expansions, Naxx really wasn't out that long, and considering you actually had to progress through the previously released raids to have to to Naxx (unlike retail now where you get to catch up to the current raid tier through 5 mans), it wasn't something you could just pick up and go do.  In fact, many people were transferring onto servers specifically to try to get picked up by some of the higher tier raiding guilds so they could actually do the content.
---
So, not exactly a well-informed post here.
---
The lowest effort memery ever
---
Real Rogues go daggers. It's an indisputable and irrefutable fact that daggers are cooler.
---
Leave the swords for the fury warriors.
---
you must be REALLY bad then
---
Off season Will be 300g
---
Most of the people will still jump once a week to keep rank 3 discount. 
---
It is easy to do it while spamming trade channel.
---
Lol jesus... we have many breaking 1.1 million
---
Oof... instant ques for ally
---
This is great. So they break server balance by allowing unrestricted transfers and then they charge you for it. I really hope that this is incompetence and not planned to get more money out of players that just want to play the game.
---
Afaik you cant transfer to full realms. Wont work my friend :(
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter in raids, but it‚Äôs nice in dungeons
---
You will need it in a month or so in BWL.
---
Try questing in places like STV and tell me it's not a problem. I can group with other Horde, not much I can do with Alliance players.
---
They're two different universes tho, the age of man in the Star Wars universe could have easily taken place before LotRs age of man.
---
Tbh its prob a bunch of Bots fighting bots and i mean real auto pilot bots not bad players maybe both.
---
&gt;I don't want this trend of companies reselling their old games but "remastered."
---
Yet you still subbed for classic lmao. So little self-awareness.
---
I just make events on my phones calendar
---
I thought you need to be a gen z to be a zoomer?
---
I'm only commenting that Grobbulus has been outed as a great server a number of times in far more public and observable places than a comment thread and no one is achieving anything by posting this.
---
So? It doesnt matter if it existed or not after all it did the game no good and they repating it once again. No fraction limitations, No server balance just server transfers how can that be good explain please
---
Yes.
---
These 8 hours are a wonderful time to take your weekly shower.
---
Oh. It was just a blanket statement so I was confused. Not that I'm ever going to make it much past possibly rank 6 or 7, just thought I was missing out on some amazing fantastic loot.. guess I'm not.
---
Are you alliance? I'm Horde and on my server we have 12-20 minute queue times depending on time of day. I can usually play out 2 games per hour or 3 if I'm lucky.
---
Or 99.9% of players.
---
Don‚Äôt even level past 19. Play WSG.
---
Oh for real? I haven‚Äôt had a close eye on it, was definitely planning on buying reforged but may just jump back on the originals when it releases instead. Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah I'm sure its not shitty at all if a Shaman or Paladin's friends all decide to change faction and they're unable to join them.
---
I actually enjoy leveling Prot Warrior with all updated professions. A lot. I usually go alch but for the next one I make I‚Äôll probably go either BS or Eng. I like to only level by tanking to be sure I get the best gear possible, then I stop at every level ending in 9 to do BGs and farm marks to buy the BG gear. Haven‚Äôt done so since WotLK but I hope to do it again in classic.
---
This is not true at all for PvE servers. I know nobody in Mankrik Alliance that is actively looking for transferring. Maybe we're underrepresented compared to the Horde but our population is pretty alive and well.
---
Sounds like Firemaw- EU
---
&gt;I'm surprised major raiding guilds aren't locking down zones with valuable raid resources in them like elemental fire. On and on.
---
Basically the only resource thats possible with is devilsaur leather. And they did. For weeks.
---
Level 60 horde logged into his 2nd account and called me a pussy for running from him as a level 51.
---
... i told him I like pussy
---
Yes, I got HoJ finally on a run last week! It's still dropping from angerforge. Goodluck!
---
How much do u wanna bet that some folks will take this seriously?
---
Yea but the point is how are you going to plan around that? There is literally nothing you can do about it.
---
Its been a while but before 40 i had lash of pain on autocast. And just manually conttolled pet attk and follow
---
At 40 i would manual cast since spamming lash will make her oom. I put mouse scroll up - attk, Scroll down - follow, shift+Scroll up - lash and Scroll down - seduce. I would set up seduce before venturing into STV
---
Don‚Äôt hate fury warriors, hate your incompetent GM for allowing that to happen

That's too much imo.. but holy crap they're going to make a ton of money.

Nothing but respect for you man. Alrdy been through a life worth of hardship, glad that WoW was/is there to give you hope. Wish nothing but the best for you, one day you‚Äôll have that pc. Until then keep lookin forward to those weekend grind sessions
---
Here I am with my 51 warrior getting excited I‚Äôm close.
---
The kid you're replying to made me think.. there is probably an entire generation of kids now that have never played wc3. It came out over 15 years ago, and assuming most kids under the age of let's say 8 probably wouldn't touch it that means the only kids born in the last 20 years who've played it probably just grabbed it because it was a classic or something. Sort of like we did with long it frogger haha. 
---
They will probably get a kick out of it.
---
NO LIMITATIONS!!!
---
\* Limitations may apply \*
---
Ha! Gotem.
---
Yeah! Apparently pcgamer confirmed it:
---
&gt; Blizzard says that Reforged is going to be an extremely faithful remaster of Warcraft 3. To that end, those playing on Reforged can actually still play multiplayer against those using the original version of the game, and Blizzard has said that even mods and maps made in Warcraft 3 should work in Reforged without an issue.
---
Good shit man. Cheers to an awesome 2020 for you.
---
I have been wanting to join Death Jesters and I'm already on Pagle!
---
Wow, cool. So what would be the reason to purchase reforged? Just updated art?
---
I mean my server did coordinate an honor cap back in the day and the top guilds all agreed to it. They picked who would be rank 14 that week and make sure that no one else went beyond that.
---
Was it a secret? Orc have always been my fav, so when there was no "real" campaign for orcs I was sad at first, but this campaign was awesome!
---
Also, Open RPG Islands was a really fun custom map with characters you can save and load, and quests you can do. They made this made while WoW was in beta. They changed the default cam to more of a over the shoulder cam like in WoW.
---
‚ÄúAt first glance‚Äù is too hard to understand?
---
their only requirement is that you have an epic mount.
---
message serade#7594 on discord for inv

Can I get an invite?
---
u stupid
---
the hunter blue set is complete trash. I looked over the stats and compared to T1, everything on the T1 was a stat upgrade over the blue set. 
---
Considering every hunter in game has T1 gear since it's so easy to get, pvping as a hunter is a waste of time if you're going for ranking and not fun. 
---
Actually for pvp, I believe T1 is better than T2 for the 8 peice bonus that increases multishot by 15%. 
---
Other classes like shamans benefit a lot from pvp gear if they're enhance since its primarily for enhance statwise. 
---
Mages do not benefit. Warriors benefit because of the large stamina stats.
---
In dungeons at least the ones that pull the most aggro from me (warr) would be mages.  Although I don‚Äôt care because their damage and control just allows for a smoother run as it‚Äôs less damage taken and more damage dealt.
---
Least aggro would be Ret.
---
Unhealthy NEET here, even I'm not willing to put in the time nessecary to get those ranks. Playing WoW basically has to be all you do every day to get over rank 12 on a high pop server, and sometimes I like to ya know... not play WoW.
---
That's how much it was in vanilla. No changes.
---
If you want to add in inflation it really should cost $31.
---
Rule number one for playing any mmo.  There will always be someone willing to grind more than you.  Never try to keep up if you have anything approaching a normal life.  Even after the smoke clears the 2nd tier nolifers and account sharers will be  living in AV.
---
Nerrrrrrrrrrrrrrd!
---
Didn't he basically already do that though
---
Had a mage try and push me off a spawn by explaining they had an instant claim and didn't want me to waste my time.
---
I have an instant too so whatever.
---
Then mobs started spawning in claimed with my ping under 30ms.
---
Yeah, and now I know why you wanted me gone.
---
get in this disc. these guys are legit.
---
I haven't lost a game since I joined the disc and we finish each match with ~3k bonus honor
---
I made a killing by rushing leveling and dsaur farming, but once it got a bit more competitive it became all about this. Still not sure who was just trying to bully me off with whispers vs. who thought they were somehow entitled to a piece of virtual real estate with more demand than supply
---
Kirtonos is not 55/45, its much closer to 60/40 (especially for active lvl 50+)
---
Hey that looks familiar! *looks for &lt;Mind Games&gt;* Yep that‚Äôs Skeram!
---
Dude, your a legend.
---
Friends and I who never played Classic made our characters here due to all the talk of fun, big scale world pvp in battles, not aware what we were getting ourselves into.  It was fun up until 40ish when the 55-60s started camping.  Then once Phase 2 hit it was just unbearable.  We've all been waiting for these so we can go to a PvE realm.  Can't wait to gtfo of here.
---
I have whittled it down to my Paladin, Druid, and Warrior.  It will likely be Paladin.  Or Druid.
---
Might have better luck if you say what realms you‚Äôre on.
---
If it‚Äôs frame rate lag you‚Äôre experiencing you have to go into your wow game system settings and select your graphics card. It appears that the update reset it to default which in my case was using my laptops power saving mode graphics card instead of my more powerful one
---
Why stop every 15min? Just jump in the cave.
---
I enjoy being adult buying my own alcohol, having more or less absolute say in the direction of my life, and occassionally getting laid.  I wouldn't trade it for the ability to grind more honor.
---
15 mins? They're close to 40 on my server!
---
Hunter in practice actually pulls the least threat because if they are ever high on the meter they can feign death and drop down to 0.
---
The pet will still pull aggro occasionally, but as long as you have growl off they shouldnt be an issue
---
There seems to always be a "free fall" trend for the most recent 2-3 days no matter when you check it. I think this is due to delays in receiving and processing user-uploaded data.
---
I‚Äôve been ‚Äòtheorycrafting‚Äô ways to be self supporting but nothing makes sense right now because I‚Äôm still in early sobriety. I have 127 days clean from all substances. I have a degree, I‚Äôm extraverted, I have great physical characteristics (Jenna said I was beautiful so I‚Äôll flaunt a little). 
---
It‚Äôd be tough. But I truly think that I could successfully stream. I believe I possess all the features and have the personality to do it. So that‚Äôs my goal now. Might be more of a dream but thats where my heart is.
---
I won a Hand of Edward the Odd on the first day of AV. Helped pay for all my exalted gear which was nice.
---
Is that a click-bait title or what?
---
Fury wars, warlocks and mages ... Any class without a threat dump mostly. However it comes down to player gear build and rotation as well as tank build, gear and rotation as well.
---
We have literally had a hunter tank onyxia so any class can do high tps but any competent player of any class watches their threat.
---
Yes this exactly. I don't really ever initiate PVP, but just knowing the threat is out there makes the world feel so much more vibrant and adds some depth to the experience. That said, ganking can make me second guess it all... yet I don't think I could leave a PVP server.
---
Hunters rank for 2 reasons
---
Rank 12 for gloves
---
Rank 14 for the 1 handers
---
Going in with 40 people is different than going in with 5 people into a dungeon lmao.
---
You can pick a number, you don't have to use the top choice of 'First Available'.
---
Since the latest patch it's vanished for a bunch of people myself included
---
&gt;https://ironforge.pro/servers?region=us&amp;filter=true
---
This is really the only semi-accurate way of getting info about server viability. It's literally just the people who've appeared in logs on Warcraft logs for the last 2 weeks. So it shows the size/balance of the raiding population, fairly well.

Who gives a shit I will look at this meme for exactly one second and go on with my life.
---
I got Skyrim remastered for free because I own the original
---
its almost like its the holiday season and most progression guilds full clear the content in 3 hours.
---
I'm 24 and never played it, but my 22 y/o buddy loves it. Idk.
---
Yep, that's what I've been mulling this time around.  but I think I put the 3 points into parry instead of imp seal of crusader. I really like parry and sometimes I forget to judge crusader or the fight isn't too long, but if u play better than me it's probably the better choice to do the points in crusader. Idk
---
If it's taking Horde 40+ minutes the Alliance will queue instantly for a long time.
---
As alliance hit exalted, they will stop playing... making AV queues even longer Horde side... which means it will require a lot more time for Horde to hit exalted
---
Ring is okay, but honestly kinda bad after DM came out.
---
"However" isn't a complete sentence.
---
I am making my own group, here are the conditions
---
There is always new players that are learning or friend of some core raider that doesn't commits. A lot of bad guild just recuit whatever 60 as a backup.So it end up  with shit show that you saw, a second team of alt/bad player/new player that can't clear shit.
---
But there is always couple of good enough to fill absence or quitter so they will keep a team B. You will surprise how much people stick around cuz people can't bother to switch guild cuz 90% of guild already established their core roster.
---
How long did the NA maintenance actually take today? 
---
EU player wondering when to set the alarm, looking for something that can give a rough estimate.
---
yea, it doesn't work
---
STOP PUTTING ORANGE SODA IN OUR MOUTHS!
---
i literally explain what happens in the video anf ollow up with a question... if you dont wanna see it then dont watch it.
---
Draenei could be shaman in TBC. Blood elves could be paladins.
---
Arms?
---
Sounds like you just don't like an authentic part of the game. Find a new one or stop complaining? I don't like getting gankbanged by 5 people, but you don't see me making a QQ thread about it.
---
Thank you! This is exactly what I needed to find.
---
What happened?
---
Every npc in alliance cities are gone.
---
Yeah we‚Äôve had two drop in back to back weeks. No one wanted either of them but they were handed out to people who reluctantly took them.
---
what about robe of volatile power? do warlocks want that or do they want to keep robe of the void? also, what about choker of enlightenment?
---
Relax. The ‚Äúkid‚Äù you‚Äôre talking about played Warcraft 1 and 2, including Beyond the Dark Portal. And eventually of course WC3 and TFT.
---
I was giving him a hard time lol
---
This image gives me the urge to drop tailoring and enchanting and finally embracing the zen of the herb
---
EU is up now.
---
Why? Rolling first means you are more likely to roll a 1. It may be infinitely small but whoever rolls more often is surely at a disadvantage?
---
Yeah, no ones said anything yet. Just got into a serious guild. If they want me fury I‚Äôll switch, but don‚Äôt have gold for constant switching.
---
What is Warcraft logs? if you don't mind humoring the noob question.
---
I literally just want to get R7 for the edgy Blood Guard title.
---
When raids are released with gear better than R14, it won't be anywhere near as competitive.
---
Oh yeah I remember last realm transfer you can only transfer off full realms to lower pops this is the same case ?
---
ok, guys, how simple can you be? ITS A¬†!&amp;$%ING TOPIC ABOUT STAFF USERS, if your not a staff user,¬†GET YOUR ASS OUT!!!!!!!! Jesus!!!!
---
This feels right
---
300 herb and no black lotus :/.
---
hey nice only the 49th post like this of the month, wasn't funny the first time, still isn't
---
and they do help you if you ask
---
Hyperbolic stupidity will get you no where in life
---
Basically, it's a place where all even semi-decent guilds upload Logs (basically an incredibly detailed report of the raid, including all damage done, spells used, consumables, how long you spent etc, etc, by all members that week). 
---
It's the only place people use to do that, so it's one of the few centralised sites we can get accurate data from.
---
The library bit had me dead.
---
No that's how you are. Have you heard of the id the ego and the super ego? Basically the id is instincts. Like reproduce and flight vs fight. All the unconscious stuff. The super ego is the part that tells you right and wrong. It's the part that says you can't cross the street unless the light is green.  The ego is the part that balances them and allows them to be controlled. It's the part that says "I may want a new car but I can't go and steal one. I need to work for one". So you may think "I'm not programmed to think only about myself". But in reality you are. It's just that your ego and super ego are stronger.
---
I don't think account sharing is very common.  I know a lot of "first generation" rankers on my server and as much of a time sink ranking is, they know how to do it efficiently.  They are always in premades, farmed a ton of pvp consumables and gold before hand and raiding schedules are adjusted (raid day before reset and immediately after, only one respec every two weeks).  
---
Yes, they are playing 12-15 hours a day and it's insane, but it's really only this bad when ranking first comes out.  After ZG patch the grind will be much easier, way less competition.  
---
I think a lot of us returned to this game expecting to be the top dog this time around, but frankly it's so, so much work to do.  It's do able, but so much work.
---
Mankrik-PVE is pretty chill bout 40/60 ally/horde; better than suckhole herod come balance it out boys
---
i was wrong perd dropped today and a rogue got it
---
It's a great answer though, you can then see the pvp gear and what ranks each takes.
---
Added to the post

Rest Plus, added a link

As someone battling my own demons I commended you and wish you well for 2020!
---
Use a target macro or something when you get in the spiral. Makes it way easier
---
/Target RareMobName
---
/Script SetRaidTarget("target",8);
---
No meme, if you're not hitting rank 10 this reset you will not hit rank 14 within 6 months from now. Dead serious.

This replaces the GetTotemInfo() API that blizzard removed. Works with Samy out of the box.
---
Would it be worth it leveling as a pally to go into holy till consecration then ret?
---
It's a year where the phone you're viewing this on is more powerful than the computers that sent us to the moon. 
---
Git gud scrublettes.
---
Wait until aq40 to rank.  The value of the gear is diminished, but you will have a much less competition!
---
The only reason I couldn‚Äôt ever think to cancel rez is if the GY is getting camped.  But that seems iffy at best

If only Stormwind's location was as accessable as Itonforge's.  It deserves to be the main city.
---
Whenever I see a male Undead or male Orc I imagine the player behind them is either really dumb or 12 years old
---
I found some more info, it‚Äôs kinda conflicting but some people say he can spawn in many different areas so I‚Äôll just have to make trips around the whole instance and use that macro. Thanks
---
Scummy, make servers deliberately unbalanced and then do this..
---
Fastest way to earn rep involves little to no PvP, so the low honor makes a lot of sense really.
---
Bots farming in instances are fine.  Bots farming in the world is obnoxious
---
I‚Äôm on Kurinnaxx which is a medium to high pop pvp server looking for a larger server. Any advice is appreciated, I‚Äôm horde btw in west coast.
---
What makes IF the main city is how close it is to BRM, EPL and Menethil for easy access to everything.
---
Where did you come from Cotton-eye joe?
---
You need to realize that this week and maybe even the next are the toughest it‚Äôs ever going to be. Why? Cause everyone‚Äôs grinding av for rep rewards. 95 percent if not more will drop once they get their rep. So not only will you be higher bracket but the amount gained will change to seeing as how your 4 hours of honor will be worth a lot more
---
Exactly.  That's what I meant to say.
---
i guess he changes the stealth hes using, but its still on him the entire time which doesnt make sense imo.

Galaxy brain comment
---
Moral of this comment chain: good communication is often a winning strategy.
---
You'd be surprised how far it works if your under high settings. Standing at the bottom of the spiral it would work on someone at the opposite end.
---
I haven't gone up from rank 2 since the system dropped and I couldn't give a single fuck. The system is weighted. Tryhards are just killing each other by tryharding so hard. Meanwhile, the other 90% of us are still having fun.
---
The difference between Troll and Orc in 40 man raids is completely negligible. Raids up until phase 5 and 6 are so easy nobody will care what race you are anyway, and AQ40 / Naxx success will be determined by a multitude of factors way more relevant than the handful of shamans having berserking. 
---
Orc's stun resist is absolutely godly in PvP so to me it's an easy choice.
---
Wat
---
You did not get to keep your title until TBC patch launched.
---
cant do 8 games an hour with 30 min wait times
---
Maybe spellcleave is just not a popular thing on that server?  I know where I am no one does it.
---
SW crashed for us today right before ony buff
---
Are you planning on only playing resto in both PVE and PVP? I'd say that Troll is better by a mile. Orc is completely worthless in PVE for resto. In PVP Orcs has Hardiness going for them but you gotta remember that Hardiness doesn't offer a flat stun duration reduction, it's 25% less chance to be hit by a stun. This can be situationally very strong, especially in 1vs1, and turn the tide on an encounter. But it can also not work at all 20 times in a row and the effect is negated in a milisec if you're being trained. 
---
Meanwhile Troll racials offer benefits in both PVE and PVP. Regeneration is constant and Berserking affects both spell and melee attack speed, even beast slaying can be situationally useful in PVP.
---
So if you're going with Orc you're only getting 1 situational benefit in PVP as resto through Hardiness. Even if you're planning on doing enhancement in PVP you're still gimping yourself as you won't have any benefits at all as resto in PVE. If you go with Troll you get benefits in both PVE and PVP. Berserking and Regeneration applies to enhancement, too. As I said, by a mile Troll. In my opinion
---
That's just not even close for a shaman healer.  By that point we're heavily favoring mp5 and +heal.  Don't get me wrong, it's a hell of a lot better than the best we have right now, which is Aurastone hammer.
---
PvE realm? after release of honor but before opening the BGs?
---
impossible.
---

Eve is the most incredible alternative reality I've ever seen.  I'm both incredibly sorry for and incredibly jealous of those who have the time and disposition to make a go of it.
---
&gt;Yea I also played back in vanilla and while there were a lot of ganking, its not remotely comparable to what happened in classic.
---
I can't be more dead than constantly dead.

What's the server discord?
---
4chan, /r/wsb maybe
---
All I know is when I help people I dont expect compensation. And who crosses the street at a green light? That means go for cars, not people.
---
Yeah, horde is a different beast with the queue times. This was alliance perspective, my bad.
---
Was there another change recently?
---
I really REALLY hate to say this but i do watch streams, spellcleave is or was extremely popular
---
"Soon"
---
Community
---
Yeah definitely impossible for horde, that's for sure. As for the honor 15k is pretty easy if you have a good premade, I gave the top end  because I've seen screenshots as high as 31k in an hour in our discord.
---
I‚Äôm scared my horde server is going to die soon and just want to play on a decent server with no wait que that‚Äôs active so i don‚Äôt get burned out spending two hours looking for a tank.
---
Kick enemies not teammates.
---
Naturally after I level a character on a second realm with my friends up to the level of my first, they add this.
---
&gt; ain't shit anybody can do to stop them. 
---
They could start requiring webcams showing you playing in order gain honor, similar to what they do with proctored exams online. Proctored exams are extremely difficult to cheat at - Blizzard needs to get with the times and start requiring it to play!
---
I've also been wondering why so few people are able to just wait the 5 minutes. Thats the reason bunkers and towers often are unguarded and gets recapped aswell. Instead everyone feel the need to be in on overkilling some enemy player or npc 20vs1.
---
Depends on what "stuff" you mean?
---
Consumables for raids may be dropping because as people gear and fill out raids and become more comfortable in farming there's no need for them in MC/Ony
---
Gear may be dropping because people are outgearing anything the AH can offer them now
---
Mats may be dropping because people have crafted all they need now
---
Pvp items have never been deleted when you lost a rank. You only need the rank to buy them, not to use them.
---
Meet Ivus: one of the things that spawns if you turn in all that random stuff you loot in AV!
---
Are you trying to sell twink items? People have been stashing that since release to sell when BG's were released. Now everyone is desperately posting their stashed stuff, undercutting each other and driving down the price. It will take a month or so until everyone has sold their stuff and then the market will normalize.
---
I have every class at 110 on retail because when I was first starting in legion I was having trouble deciding (later found out it was much easier to chose once I was already raiding so I could see which classes looked fun in the content I spent the most time doing). Ended up rolling a lock in classic first because spriest is my favorite class on live but I knew they had trouble getting raid spots in classic. This time I was set on getting one class to max and seeing what looked fun raiding as a main alt. 
---
I have a level 26 shaman but it might not hit 60 until the end of classic. My favorite role is ranged dps and I don‚Äôt see a reason to role mage or hunter alongside my lock. Locks are the best or 2nd best for gold farming afaik so no reason to have a char for that. Then I really liked having a tanking alt for dungeons but without mythic plus there‚Äôs not really a point for that in classic. Since I typically enjoy dpsing more than healing that leaves warrior and rogue. It seems to me that the melee take a lot longer to gear up than ranged in classic before they really start popping off. So I‚Äôd only want one of them as a main and leveling to 60 again in case I want to retool in the future also doesn‚Äôt seem like a great time. 
---
TLDR: There‚Äôs nothing I want to do with an alt/another class so badly that I can justify putting in another 200 hours leveling again.
---
Not long before race change eh
---
And also because the alliance are the ones with the numbers. You only ever see them crying about horde outnumbering them but silence when they have numbers on the horde.
---
People are probably over it and due to how many mages there are it's probably died down a bit, I only saw a couple people looking for groups while i leveled my main and while on my alt I haven't seen a single group this time around so it's not popular on my server either.
---
He rolled 1-2 immediately, he wasn't in my party so i cant see his rolls, and he doesn't show any chat, what a tard lmao
---
shoutout kylebro for account sharing and busting the brackets lmao
---
I hit 60 the same week as I had my first kid exactly 2 months ago today. I mean, the kid was waking up every hour anyway so I decided not to sleep and just grinded all day all night lol.
---
It was for double or nothing, I got a 2 and then he never rolled again.
---
ive fought alliance for mobs and usually thats the way it is. I've also had an alliance help kill something and save me before. If you want to pvp theres battlegrounds for that
---
&gt;elitist guild
---
&gt;don't wanna raid with wbuffs
---
To answer your post. If youre in barrens near the portal, thats the warsong gulch queue, to get those items you need warsong gulcj reputation. To get the rank gear, you can access the rank 1-6 vendor in orgrimmar, and to get the rank 7-14 you need to get access to the officer barracks. Google the different ranks and pvp reputations rewards.
---
Yes they are, as of today.
---
They trying to milk this game as much as they can before everyone quits
---
And here I waited until 5 central time like an idiot.
---
Look. Bro. I'm trying to help you understand how people work. No need to be a dick
---
Kromcrush to Mankrik. I wanted to move my leveling alt to a PvE. I realized I enjoy the PvE way of life more.
---
I'm not getting serious dude...  I know lotr and SW are different shows
---
I thought this was gonna be sarcastic
---
Has this been confirmed?  I didn‚Äôt see it listed in the official rules Blizzard posted (like you can‚Äôt go PVE to PVP, etc.).
---
You're taking this way to seriously dude lol
---
[so everyone is an asshole here.](https://youtu.be/sen8Tn8CBA4?t=25)
---
Yeah he's not wrong, you're an idiot if you just trade a random person gold and hope to "win" lol
---
I still can‚Äôt tell if it is.
---
I have skinning and made a bunch out of it about a month back, now there's no point bothering on my server either. I just figured most people have everything they need crafted right now so prices are low.
---
Because that‚Äôs how the PvP system works in vanilla?..
---
This. I‚Äôve never played a pve server and I can‚Äôt understand how it works for contested resources. Pvp just seems like such a core part of the game.
---
No, not at all, you misunderstand. Its a multi factor problem.
---
By gear properly, are the paladins hitting the required hit chance to not miss? Do they have a sufficient weapon with good damage range or crit chance for vengeance to sustain 15% extra damage? The other point was doing a gear for gear comparison as far as comparing a full epic'd out prot warrior vs a paladin having to suffer a mix of blue BIS and or a few epics for damage at this current state in the game. 
---
Your ret paladins should be doing more damage than a prot warrior, however if you were to have a fully epic'd out prot warrior vs a fully epic'd out ret paladin (if possible), there'd be no argument on the matter. Gear makes all the difference in the world.
---
They transferred servers.
---
How will I show my guild members I appreciate them. I know!

Rookie numbers. Don‚Äôt know why he expects anything significant out of that. I feel like a casual pleb playing 6-7 hours a day. WoW is a job.

Play one of each to 60, and then you can decide fairly what is your main.
---
Trimming armor for free.
---
Yeah, its hard to argue against this now. At the start I thought paid server transfers would be bad...but the whole phase 2 has been in complete shambles thanks to the toxic community. Many may say it will kill the feeling of "true vanilla", but that true feeling disappeared once most people started reaching SM. Vanilla will never be recreated in the community. We have to accept that, move on, and try to make the game as fun as possible.
---
I also wouldn't be surprised at all if Blizzard saw a stark drop in players. I know on my server the players in LFG, my guild, and major cities was dropping rapidly after world pvp started (horde dominated server). Even with the release of BGs; many didn't return for very long after seeing the AV rush disaster + seeing how much honor they would need to get to do anything. I still had fun in vanilla, but I 200% more enjoyed the first 4-8 weeks of the game than anything that I have encountered post level 60.
---
In 2005 did World of Warcraft target kids as a customer base?
---
In 2019 did they remake the game?
---
Why is it no longer for kids?
---
'Only' ... That's a lot.
---
I actually haven't checked but I was surprised too! Hoping it doesn't mess up too many server pops
---
So when you say fight alliance you mean race to tag mobs. How is that better than actually fighting? It sounds frustrating.
---
How soon?
---
Wow
---
Most horde is still farming rep, and a longer game with a win gives more rep.
---
I posted yesterday about the 2hr AVs I've been in and got a bunch of people saying "I haven't been in a 2hr AV so surely they don't exist."
---
I'm tempted to PM every single one of them this thread.
---
The alliance quest givers are usually dead.
---
Cool thanks!
---
You guys with 60s but struggling to level alts: you can run each other's babies thru lower dungeons for gear and XP. Or partner up and level together?
---
Nice ty I appreciate it m8 :)
---
yes
---
Depending on server rank 8 might be a good option for mage, gives prebis pants
---
I've seen similar aspects on my server's AH. I think there's a combination of simply more players than expected, combined with most players using AH/vendorprice addons. This means everyone knows what vendor prices are, and everyone knows to scan for items they can purchase if they are listed below vendor prices. You'd think this would keep things more expensive, however...
---
...some people just don't want to take the time to buy/sell items, so they will simply undercut any price listing by wide margins - often to offload their items to AH junkies and farmers, who are then forced to buy their ridiculously low-priced items or lose the deposit on items they posted. I see this often where one farmer will post a stack of 20 for an item at typical AH prices, then someone will post 3 of that item, but undercut their price-per-item cost by nearly half, which is then followed by a chain of 5% undercuts.
---
Additionally, some people seem to intentionally post items at vendor price + deposit value. This results in either one of two scenarios: 1. someone buys the item and they lose nothing. 2. someone posts an "undercut" auction below vendor price, which they promptly purchase.
---
As a result, the market fluctuates wildly, regardless of supply and demand for any particular item.
---
Can you elaborate on the differences in these mount systems, what we have currently, and what would have // could have been different?
---
I don't think that'll be an option ever. Paladin &lt;-&gt; shaman, do you see the problem?
---
He said, on the nerd device into the nerd website with a sub-group set up for the specific type of nerd being mocked.
---
I mean, they could have at least used language to ask the guy to leave first...
---
OMG that was good
---
Cool, a major draw of classic wow for me is gone. I guess I shouldn't have trusted Blizzard, I'm sad now.
---
At least give us some new servers without the ability to xfer ... The closed economies and social groups are certainly in my top 3 reasons for playing. Oh well I guess, I have other games. I was just so amped for actual Blizzard servers of a game I actually want to play, instead of one I just feel like I'm constantly supposed to do things a certain way.
---
So much for hitting 60.
---
What disc.? Got a link?
---
I'm alliance on Heartseeker. Horde are out numbered but they fight hard and don't quit. Fun times
---
ah yea, that game was a masterpiece
---
"How are you lost in a graveyard that goes forward?" lmao, funny stuff, thanks for posting. Only comment is that it's hard to watch with such a close zoom.
---
Did you use a guide to level up? Or just ran around?
---
Also what addon do you use to see the price once you picked it? Thanks bro! Nice post üëçüèº
---
So the guy has 2 accounts on PvP server?
---
&gt; now it‚Äôs looking like rank 10 is going to only be one full time job with R14 being 2-3 of them.
---
I think this is part of what makes "new" AV so shitty.
---
During Vanilla you could get ahead of everyone else by putting together a good WSG group. More wins = more honor, so the better you were the less time you had to spend grinding. There was at least some reward for skill.
---
Now everyone is just mindlessly grinding AV all day. I've talked to a couple players who are top 5 right now and were R14 in Vanilla and they said this AV has pretty much ruined the honor grind.
---
Thanks! Sounds like flameylamey was saying above - currently my top ranks are the most efficient. (Except with renew where rank 1 is actually suggested as a quick small bit of healing) 
---
Thanks for the help, this is perfect!
---
Oohh booh booh let me press F on the tiniest keyboard :( .

It would make it look smoother for you if you got a higher hz monitor. But I'm not sure, I'm using a 2080ti on a 144hz monitor.
---
Might wanna try check on your servers discord channel. If that dosen‚Äôt work there are a lot of leveling guilds on many servers or just joining a commited guild.
---
I started leveling with my friends. But most of them quit lvl 40 due to real life things. I joined a guild and befriended a lot of people by just joining the servers discord and most of them are horde and I‚Äôm alliance. 
---
Or go to who and search your level range and just whisper them if they wanna quest/level together. You make a lot of friends that way. And ‚ÄúLooking for group‚Äù chat might help you too. 
---
Hope you find what you‚Äôre looking for bro.
---
i think the reasoning behind this is because people understand the struggle your going through, and can cope with it so they wanna help out and make the battle a bit easier. When i first hit 60 on my hunter main , after i got geared out i ran over to loch modan, i found a bunch of noob hunters doing it all wrong, so i helped them learn! no longer was he spamming serpent sting to "proc an auto" , no longer was his pet attacking everything  it saw, and no longer was he a melee hunter! when you make your character, the game slaps you on the ass and hands you nothing and teaches you nothing .
---
Raiding char, farming char, class ive mained for 4 expansions so it felt weird to not at least reroll it.
---
Think you can on pve servers.
---
But lots of people are running two accounts
---
I‚Äôm sick of fucktards running and crying to Mommy Reddit when they perform an in game action against the ToS and lose.
---
You took a risk breaking the rules and got burnt and expect sympathy from the internetz? You‚Äôre like the guy who goes to buy drugs and goes to the cops to complain that his coke is actually flour and he‚Äôs been ripped off.
---
Waaaaaaaahhhhhhh
---
0/10
---
nope, take that in mind that you need number of players to even split the RP. I've seen people on golemagg with 400ppl in ally pool even thinking its not enough for r14. So flamelash might have enough rp for rank 9 with 30-50 ppl in pool
---
coming up next, paid race/gender and name change &lt;3
---
Right now, with that amount of time? Well depends on server but on mine it's barely enough for rank7. Better wait 3-4-5 month when the tryhards on curve get their desired rank, so it can be easier for you.
---
No login queue times.  60H/40A.  The server survived world World PvP and World PvP has survived BGs.  A handful of 90 minute guilds on each faction.  It‚Äôs the Goldilocks of Oceanic servers.
---
Just what I needed!! Thanks a lot üòÄ
---
I've had CE on my pc for as long as I can remember. I highly doubt that's true.
---
Ah the gambling is huge on our server too..I told my guild after you whispered me.. seems like we have a few who like to gamble in mine so it‚Äôs good you told us thank you
---
I have t2 pants, I'm just looking at which gear intersects realistic goals with raid-worthy gear, and I think (not entirely sure, bit of a newbie) that the pvp boots are stronger than Arcanist Boots and bis for this phase outside of Azuregos.
---
you are quoting skarms video, but forget when he says that deep prot is only viable for a guild of average players. However thats average players from Skarms private server experience, not the average classic player who likely has years of retail experience in min/maxing. 
---
The parse you linked (couldn't look at it @ work) has [no DPS parsing higher than 80% percentile](https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/H8B6TfncKyj2a3YG#boss=-2&amp;wipes=2&amp;start=1049133&amp;end=6551721&amp;view=rankings). Its basically a raid full of average players. The vast majority in his parse are hovering 60-40%! Those are the players that deep prot works for.
---
However im MT for my guild and I have people consistently parsing 100%'s/99%'s. We're not sweaty. We're mostly raid loggers who use consumables. It has been my experience that deep prot is just not viable if your DPS is playing their class properly. I started deep prot and had the same idea, that I could stay prot with mitigation gear. Warriors started pulling threat once they got weapons. Warlocks started pulling threat with 3k shadowbolt crits on pull. I went fury prot and those issues were solved. Until DPS got more gear and I had to completely drop mitigation gear as now one of our warriors pulled 1400 dps on lucifron and died.  Now i'm gearing towards [this full threat set](https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/kBQxpg2ooqqAW5dFMb5hEy).

Rule #3
---
It's great for me, back when Vanilla was out downtime was at 5pm for me. Now that sucked a lot, now it's at 1am for me. We each get our turn it seems.
---
Do you mean in the sense that you haven't been putting in nearly enough time, and if you continue applying the same amount of effort it will never be enough? Or is there some other aspect to it?
---
Damn, those paid server transfers are really getting out of hand...
---
grobb for sure
---
I bet that a lot of pve realms are going to see an explosion of transfers from pvp realms, particularly of lv 30-40 toons.
---
While I can kinda get wanting to play on a same faction dominated server, I can totally see people thinking 'fuck getting ganked' and going where leveling is peaceful and pvp consensual.
---
Most PVP servers are (and have been) 60/40 or worse, that was my point. That's not decently balanced.
---
yeah this happening to some guy who joined a bg i was in. our raid frames showed 39 members and he just wasn't in the raid at all when he joined midway through. i invited him to a group but it didnt work for getting him into the raid. he couldnt see anyone else on the map either.  
---
and theres that bug where the spirit healer sometimes doesnt rez you and you have to wait another 30 seconds for it, smh
---
My mains a healer i like to know whats happening
---
Yeah got my rogue to mid 50‚Äôs and thought ‚Äúhey a warrior sounds really fun to play!‚Äù
---
Hell yeah brother. My buddies are always telling me about how incredible but scarce hit is, and since I wanna replace my ban'thok and mysteria I gotta find the hit elsewhere.
---
What are your thoughts on the 60 rogue? I currently have a 44 rogue and was debating on if I should ditch it for warrior as they scale much better with gear and later content
---
Same lol
---
[H] heartseeker to Sulfuras
---
To move my 60 and my bank alt, too much stuff to take it all with one character.
---
Easier to pay a homeless dude to live with you and play.
---
Horde has tons of ways of getting faster honor before losing, up to 3k. But they never do it. Like killing balinda b4 galv dies im pretty sure is more honor, but despite being able to get to balinda before alliance can get to galv everyone loves killing the 2 lieutenants and everything people pull outside before killing her when you can just pull it all inside and cleave it all down while focusing balinda first. I swear people dont understand that the mobs move in this game. And im one of those people who pull one of the bunker commanders to balinda. Every fucking time a warrior follows my pull and hamstrings the commander and tries to tank it because im a priest so they wanna solo it because I will heal them. Motherfucker im trying to save time and ur wasting tons by doing that and im sure more people than just you need heals.
---
I see a lot of people misunderstand why Improved Drain Life is key to drain tanking.
---
The key concept to understand in Drain Tanking is that you're cycling through Mana -&gt; Health -&gt; Mana constantly, and every time you do this you gain \*more\* of those resources. That it also does damage is almost besides the point. The key factor is you're constantly generating resources.
---
**Example:**
---
Base Level Drain Life and Life Tap:
---
* LVL 30 Drain Life costs 135 Mana and gives you 145 Health
---
* Life Tap converts 145 Health to 145 Mana
---
* ***Result:*** **135 Mana -&gt; 145 Mana (\~107%)**
---
If you have Improved Drain Life and Improved Life Tap the cycle becomes:
---
* LVL 30 Imp. Drain Life costs 135 Mana and gives you 160 Health
---
* Imp. Life Tap converts 160 Health to 192 Mana
---
* ***Result:*** **135 Mana -&gt; 192 Mana (\~141%)**
---
That bonus 40% Mana occurs (and does additional damage) while your Dots do the damage.
---
The idea with Drain Tanking is that your outputs of health (damage) and mana (offensive spells) should be equal too the amount of bonus mana you're generating. This allows you to fight constantly.
---
Improved Drain Life is only +10%, sure, but that's 10% more mana you can spend offensively which is likely to translate into 12% faster kill speed.
---
The server discord would probably be a much better place to ask this
---
Skyrim remastered isn‚Äôt worth jack shit since there‚Äôs most likely a mod that does it way better for free
---
I mean that you're not putting in the time. The guys seriously pushing for rank 14 asap are currently earning roughly 350-400k honor a day, if you haven't been farming enough to keep up with them you wont hit rank 10 this today in EU or yesterday in NA, if you're rank 9 you can maybe catch up if they chill a bit during Christmas but if you're 8 or lower you're gonna have to sit around and wait for every single one of them to either cycle to r14 and stop grinding or to give up before you have any hope of hitting it, you're simply too far behind to catch up.
---
Is this some real service you can check to see state of things? Can somebody please share the link?
---
Wp but you committed some mistakes there, like not double, or even triple frost trap on banana, double trap on connector, rocket helmet on mage that just ice blocked it etc
---
I dont know how people can put up with PvP given the sheer amount of losses and failure BGs you have to put up with. Not just close game, but absolute blow out and your side is sniffing glue. Im barely making it thru AV rep grind--was going to do it on my alt for the caster OH, but no way I can muscle through watching people do absolutely nothing.
---
Lorti UI classic is the one I have! So I've tried that "/
---
I made a friend by aoe farming together :)
---
We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, and loot
---
...and my friends have never seen me online since
---
Sure! I don‚Äôt know what any of those are. This is my first time playing wow ever. Pally tank is what I rolled and it‚Äôs all I know.
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/F3aPT4NZH7QMw1Ad/
---
Go get the sword from Cho'rush in DMN, its close to as good as Mirah's
---
They  should just merge servers. The starting hype is gone merge servers where each faction is a bit weak or strong to get them as near as possible.
---
How does one do this?
---
Kurinnaxx gang
---
What happened to Kromcrush? Does that mean 100% horde?
---
Youre wrong on both accounts. A new phase didnt come out recently, blizz just launched the bgs early. Not every server was low pop before they launched the SECOND phase (we launched we the first phase and are on the second one), servers like herod, faerlina, gehennas, firemaw, and a couple others had queues even a few days before the bgs got releases.
---
What happens to mail when you transfer? Wondering if I'll need to also transfer my banker...
---
Sure, my point is that if you ignore golemagg cleave is 50% of the fights. The idea that one minute issue with someones argument invalidates their entire argument is a fallacy. 
---
2h spamstring spec is performing extremely well on cleave fights. It is also random and bursty enough that its pulling some really insane numbers on short single target fights as well. So for the current content its almost arguable that it is the best spec. 
---
It will be interesting to see how it does in BWL which is mostly single target. But right now its at the very least equal to dw.
---
What?
---
All food is one time use.
---
I‚Äôm going to go out on a limb and say the odds are 1:2
---
Wow you weren't kidding about that humor tag.
---
#NOCHANGES!
---
Correct for sure
---
Prob cloudkeeper legs
---
How do they translate it to USD?
---
Think I've played 7 AV games and won them all so far. Also dinged 60 in one! Super stoked.
---
I'm keen to play WSG too though. As much as I like AV, WSG is amazing. I really want that shadow damage off hand though. :P
---
You are one smart salami
---
I farmed my exalted rep in the first few days by doing premades. When I did was when ever we entered an AV I posted my orders macro, telling everyone (including randoms) their tasks. We won 95% of the AVs this way. Just by spaming out Macroed orders.
---
You definitely didn't play 4 hours a day every day if you only got 100k. Sounds closer to 2 hours
---
Im so happy when I reach exalted and never play AV again. Stupid alliance premade groups make the experience even worse.
---
only on PvP realms. Nothing wrong with the PvE realms.
---
Imagine being blacklisted by someone that you never want to play with anyway.
---
For classic, no
---
What i see anytime i enter a level 50+ zone in phase 2.
---
Doesn't the old WC3 need like a lot of effort to make work on modern PC's? Feel as if I saw a video of someone explaining all this weird stuff you had to do to get working properly. Maybe I'm wrong.
---
I know for stuff such as sims 3 the game, and its expansions, seem to hate being installed on the non-primary drive and I couldn't figure it out.
---
As soon as most people get there r10 gear and quit it there you need to put alot of time into that.
---
After this it should get a little bit easier.
---
For my part I just try to be around 6 or 7 until it slows down a bit and try to push for 8 or 10 afterwards.
---
Classic/Vanilla PvP honor system is grindfest in a nutshell. You aren't competing for winrate of any kind progressing you through ranks instead the one who spends most time gets highest rank. So if you are on a server full of jobless people who have nothing else to do with their life r14 isn't for you. Especially if someone has several players on one account farming honor 24/7.
---
So that is a legal breach afaik
---
Can't you one shot them
---
What kind of potatoe computer crashes in org these days?
---
Everyone Here Sucks. So your answer to him being a douchebag was to be a Super Douchebag. And on a Carebear server no less. Crazy.
---
We got second one in 3 kills. Nobody wanted it, so it went to pala healer.
---
Is it going down, or just Horde pop going up?
---
I've noticed a lot more horde presence in the forums and discord than there used to be, but it's purely anecdotal.
---
Maybe I can tbh, will try after work
---
Nope WC3 runs out of the box just fine on modern PCs. They even fixed the stretching on widescreen resolutions a while back.
---
As a former Member of Overrated the guild was compromised of players from PvE Servers who were able to transfer to Black Dragonflight for free (a PvP Server) which was a brand new PvP Server that was launched for a select grouping of servers to move to BDF (Shadowsong) being one of them.
---
This server was completely populated by PvE leveled characters minus the new characters that were made on the realm on launch.
---
Damn. I knew my classic main shouldn't had been made the same class as my vanilla main. Now alts are boring.
---
I don't think the troll racial is better than the orc one for healers, so troll wouldn't be in my consideration for min-maxing.
---
Orc has a huge benefit during pvp and a good contribution for pve
---
Tauren is nice for everything but raids and the extra hp in pvp is huge and a small benefit in pve
---
All in all for resto: Orc &gt;&gt;&gt; Tauren &gt; Troll
---
If you want to play dps: Orc &gt; Troll &gt;&gt; Tauren
---
If the english is bad, sorry :)
---
I'm a horde and saw a human priest running away in stv after pulling too many mobs and he was about to die. Could have been a free hk but I helped him kill the mobs instead. What's wrong with me?
---
"If (GG - 20% Total) is positive, you will gain : GG - 20% Total."
---
Can you explain how getting the same amount of RP per week gradually increases your rank after decay starts. Say you get 1000RP every week after the 5th week you would have 5000RP and then on the 6th week if you get 1000 RP again then the calculation according to this rule would be (6000-5000*.2) = 5000. So no total RP gained from that week. If this is the case how are people going to be progressing while maintaining the same RP per week? I know that people should be increasing in rank somehow at this point while maintaining the same RP per week because the top people on the servers only have rank 10, but don't understand how it works within this framework.
---
It does happen, we are constantly cleaning out the guild and discord from spies that try and predict our world boss kills.
---
Also, the game is almost always on sale for like 5 bucks, at least the PC version is.
---
60 Prot Warrior, 60 hunter for tribute runs for gold, 60 rogue for PvP, and a 60 prot paladin for doing 5 mans for the guild and I still love my prot warrior the best.
---
Priest is next though. I just literally can‚Äôt stop leveling. It‚Äôs so much fun in classic. 
---
The best part is having every profession yourself and don‚Äôt need anybody lol
---
800 dps is a dungeon number? Fucking lol. Maybe for like 0.1% of the sweatiest players, sure. Even then I haven‚Äôt seen it even though I‚Äôve tanked for a couple Limitless players 2-3 times, which is the #1 speed parsing guild in my server Sulfuras (whose best dps average around 800 in RAIDS btw).
---
You‚Äôre taking extremely rare cases and blowing them up to make it look like tanks must be specced according to that.
---
As a leatherworker: The 'Devilsaur days' are over for a while now (playerbase is past prebis), but also the 'Hide of the Wild days' seem to be over (ppl who wanted it got it). I sold many of these BiS healingcloaks for 330ish gold, but cant sell em for 270g now.
---
Because crafter sell less, the mats prices drop aswell (essence of water 14&gt;9g, cured rugged 14&gt;7g).
---
If played correctly they can be a very powerful support class.
---
To be fair, just having the ability to move I think has calmed things down, combined with BGs basically killing wpvp I dont think we'll see any major mass migrations.
---
Noggenfogger is a PvP realm. I also leveled herbalism 1-300 during P2, before BGs. I am Horde though, so I mostly had an easy time.
---
everyones a bitch everywhere if you just listen to trade/world chat. i love it here.
---
People are clearing mythic in retail with the default UI. Lets not act like you need a custom UI to press your 3 button rotation.
---
Pulling BS outta your ass show me a server with 2m floor.
---
Not 250k-400k, there is a 250k cap per day. Plus you are implying that the effort will be the same. It‚Äôs currently impossible, if you don‚Äôt have 16 hours of play time to rank, but if you start the grind in one month or two, it‚Äôs going to be easier, as lots of people are going to abandon the grind, because it‚Äôs too time consuming.
---
I plan to to reach rank 8-9 but I start soft and plan to grind it softly over the next 3 months. It‚Äôs going to be fine for me
---
What a little bitch.
---
That‚Äôs what I think it is, thank you
---
I‚Äôve heard the one hour resplendent is more like 45-75 minutes, and also Blackrock steppes is burning steppes
---
in german we use afklo (klo means toilet)
---
And you just assume, the tanks and healers keep everyone alive in future raids without having even seen them.
---
Bring more horde to Pagle!
---
Haha sry Budd no.
---
like every single reset since honor was implemented?
---
Poly is crazy broken at 19 lol
---
Sure my point was more that hitting rank 10 this week shows that you're keeping pace with the guys pushing seriously and will be have a shot at nabbing r14 in 1-2 months if you keep it up. Wasnt intended to be a statement of impossibility, but if you're not there now you are very behind.
---
Soon you will find out, that beyond lvl 30-32 Alliance gets much fewer quests than the Horde. There are also not as many convinient settlements near instance entrances (BFD, Mara, DM) and bizzare ship transportation instead of convinient zeppelings. You will notice, that from lvl 32 you'll need a lot of SM runs, and Tirisfal glades is a long journey destination from Southshore, and even longer to get there to open flight point.
---
Doesnt work if you got that top of the dps chart itch.
---
Replace the word hardcore with "welfare recipients" and players with "gaming addicts" and we're basically halfway through fixing your post.
---
It's possible to implement a rating system based on win percentage, like we had with arenas and RBGs. It wouldn't let more or fewer players through to the top each week compared to the honor system, and you also wouldn't have to play 16 hour days just to have a chance at finishing top 100.
---
the trick is to wait until the PvE bots hit exalted. its way easier after that.
---
move jeff back from overwatch to head wow, he does great at ow but damn i'd like to see what he would do if  he had full control to revamp retail
---
What bracers are you making?
---
Guess they're playing for fun past 250k then or to help other farmers coming in later than then, but that is what they're currently pulling on my server regardless.
---
60 paladin, then rerolled rogue, got bored of it around 30, went back to paladin. Started a horde druid, lvl 20, then rerolled shaman, which is also lvl 20 now. The only thing I know is that I don't really want to play paladin anymore, not because of it's bad, but the playstyle of holy paladin in classic is not for me.
---
Same boat here, have 69 horde and a now 39 ally hunter and leveling the hunter is some of the most fun I‚Äôve had
---
As I said the likelihood for a warrior to reach an outstandingly lucky parse are much higher, simply due to there being many more warriors than ret paladins. And if we had an outstandingly lucky paladin with world buffs and good gear, I'm certain the top golemagg parse would be around 750 dps.
---
However wheras the average warrior is around a top 65-70% parse, the average paladin should be seen as an 80-85% parse, simply due to the much lower number of serious raiding ret paladins.
---
And as I said, I did 430-455 dps on golemagg in the last three kills consistently and without a full buff suite, so I see that as a reasonable expectation from a serious raiding ret paladin.
---
why? doordash can deliver
---
&gt; Whether or not they do this is a litmus test for whether they care about classic as an experience AND a cash cow, or as just a cash cow. 
---
The moment layering and megaservers were announced without any balancing mechanisms you mostly had your answer. They care a bit but not enough to do it right.
---
Shoot her or something!
---
Took me like 3 days
---
No!
---
Like every reset that I have perhaps not personally been present for?
---
Btw you can eat this and drink water 
---
And it‚Äôs like an evocation
---
&gt;Clicker
---
Yup. Clickka power ‚úä
---
Wait wtf? Why would you do that lmao?
---
I don‚Äôt know if past 250k per day it‚Äôs still fun ^^
---
But could be that, or maybe the cap has been removed. But it‚Äôs an insane (literally) amount of dedication
---
I got that reference xD
---
Am I done with this game?  
---
I just got slandered and kicked out of a DMW run for wiping in a \*guild run\* (a large, supposedly "all welcome" guild). I can only imagine the response to messing up in a raid. The journey to 60 on 3 characters was super fun but I'm not sure if endgame content is worth putting up with veteran toxicity.
---
Why did you comment this?
---
If you want things that belong to retail you should play retail. Stop trying to ass blast this version into a shit version no1 wants.
---
It's because the alliance who was slaughtering you is in BG 24/7
---
You never thought that it could be different people wanting different things?
---
Doesn't ruin it if you don't watch it; I guess you're right about that.
---
If you change your mind and are looking for a great and chill community of people I am GM and tank on kurinaxx horde side. Guildies and myself are running stuff fairly often when not raiding or pvping. Feel free to reach out via PM if interested :)
---
Seems there are no limitations, which is unfortunate.
---
Oh hi Galv
---
The rank 8 pvp legs are also very good if you want to grind pvp.
---
this made me actually enjoy BfA. both versions are far from enjoyable at this day, because classic is filled with minmaxers and bfa is filled with achievementers, in both versions people attack any red name they see, but at least in bfa there is a lot of cool visuals of old content to enjoy... while in classic you have to work hard just to get somewhere or something that looks nice. so i play both versions now as blizzard intended haha
---
How do you end up with 100k honor over 4 hours for 7 days? Even if you played only played 2 AVs/hour (which is highly inefficient lol) and lost (around 2k honor ea) you'd still be at 100k. 
---
I think you've just grinded extremely shittily if you only got 100k lol.
---

---
Depends on your realm. On my normal realm 400k honor my standing was ~60 while on a busy pvp realm that's probably standing 700+
---
The competition should drop off in a couple months when the most hardcore farmers are done. At the end of vanilla our pvp realm would top around 700k-800k honor per week to swap rank14 around.
---
I think some of the turn ins gave exp the first time.
---
You split exp with everyone nearby. The quest caves are probably the only spots out of the way enough to avoid the 10exp per kill splits.
---
I have never played this game. What am I missing?
---
I macro'd Unending Breath with a /s and pretty shitty puns like "Breathe long and prosper" or "May the breath be with you".
---
  
---
And from time to time someone would /w me all kinds of nasty stuff due to it. Like really nasty stuff. I'm still baffled by this to be honest...like...why go out of your way to insult someone over a shitty macro/pun
---
Let's be real we're all just here for the drama.
---
Yeppers, you think those alliance leaving those horde dominated servers are going to balanced one? Theyre going to stack upon the Pagle 80/20 ally server. This was suppose to be a last ditch solution but it appears Blizzard rather do nothing and cash in while they can. Private servers may not do it right all the time, but that the fucking least they tried.
---
Well let's put it this way. You say its definitely not balanced, but I have no idea which faction you're implying is larger. So Its effectively balanced
---
I'm pretty sure the issue here is people explaining what's going on and people doing it anyway
---
What was the meaning with this post? Where you trying to hate on the best food in the game thinking it sucked? I dont get itüôÑ
---
Yeah saw that after I wrote it, they went there sooner than I would have guessed.
---
One game some guys wanted to get me kicked by reorting for capping sh gy (as horde). While ally already had the opposite. (Snowfall)
---
No, the most important take away is that you lose 20% of your standing every week, so you have to compensate by gaining at least 20%. Of course loosing 20% of rank 1 is much less than 20% of rank 10, so the higher your rank, the more you have to play to combat the weekly loss.
---
I wish. Mongoose is so expensive.
---
Have a 60 mage and 60 lock and working on a level 32 rogue rn
---
You say that like balance on skeram hasn't been fucked since day one.
---
There's crossrealm premades, I know about my own realms discord
---
Oceanic servers, smaller population to draw from.
---
It doesn't help that the early Horde levelling zones(bar Mulgore). are some of the most boring and monotonous I have encountered in any game I've played.
---
If it weren't for the Green skinned wonders I'd be surprised if anyone would play Horde.
---
Yes I love those moments :)
---
I hope you will Hand it back once you are a grown up Level 60 :D
---
It makes such a big difference at low Levels and also at 60 it takes some time to farm 25g but it has such a large meaning behind it!! :)
---
Glad you could have this experience =)
---
Hahhaahahah flamelash alliance that rerolled on another server and got like lvl 50-60 üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
shut the fuck up theres a problem if allys can group up n not horde. i dont give two fucks about o its the classic  experience . fuck that it should be fair like allys av is way easier to win then horde in the first place n ally can make a premade say that is the classic  experience . im tired of ppl saying o thats the classic experience  fuck u
---
Which server is this?
---
If people rolled because horde are inherently stronger (due to racials), why is it alliance are the stronger pve and group pvp faction due to blessings and bubble?
---
I just dont get this reason for faction imbalance.
---
Why cant it just be because player base is 15 years older and that changes the aesthetics they are drawn towards?
---
&gt;I don't think server transfers were a thing in classic at this point.
---
This part is accurate (they were introduced during Naxx, \~6 months before TBC release), but as others pointed out, Draenei and Blood elves were not introduced as playable races until TBC. Sorry, but what you're hoping for will not happen in Classic unless some TBC Classic addon is released.
---
Oh, makes sense.. RIP.
---
Oooh okay I get it, thanks.
---
Where the pk videos at tho
---
Mine mobs give 12 xp per kill (at level 52) it will take FOREVER doing that.
---
The irony is that the whole point of fight club is to make the best decisions based off tangible data, rather than following the norm. 
---
Deep prot is the norm on your analogy.
---
Palpable.
---
Thanks for this reply, saved - will look into this myself. Been putting off using WA for ages due to the code strings it's using but I think I'll have to give it a shot. Seems incredibly powerful, and apparently the sky is the limit for what it can accomplish. Cheers once more.
---
Everytime I read that line, I read it in his voice.
---
Source? I can't find one
---
You took turns griefing each other, which is what WoW has instead of world PvP.
---
inb4 late and faulty
---
Basically retail
---
shhhh dont you fucking dare tell about my hidy hole
---
&gt; You deserved it.
---
That's for sure, but what about my opponent? Did he deserve it too?
---
FOUR HOOVES OF FURY!!
---
This
---
I did 51 to 53 in AV, doing all the quests except The Proving Grounds (couldn't make it to the flag room) it was by far the longest timed played per level. But also the most fun.
---
Mine mobs give 12 xp per kill, harpies &amp; gnolls give 250 ish, guards &amp; shit give 12 as well. Quests are all good xp, with the 3x marks giving 8800 1st time then 3300 every time after that (main source of xp really)
---
So it can be done, it's just slow AF
---
Yep, it's awesome, and a little like a village: You get to know the regulars. Bear comes to mind, he's always there. Pays off to get to know people in a community, not just grind level to level.
---
I never AFK! I just pick snowballs and try to piss off my own Team :P
---
Ironforge.pro
---
I dual box and invite people to parties all the time; I run Warrior/Druid though so they basically get a tank/healer for free.  
---
I am a control freak though, I work in IT Service Management so it‚Äôs literally my job to be one...
---
TSM has it as being at an average of 500g
---
This is largely because alliance starts to argue amongst themselves about how they failed because of galv... Often... You'll hear "we failed because some stopped for galv" even though literally 0 people went that way.
---
People start the "ugh stupid horde wants to fucking turtle again... Just let them fucking win".  Many times, if people just make their way South, they would still kill drek faster than horde kills vann...
---
Alliance mentality is that of lost hope once you pass 8 minutes.
---
Manufacturing drama in WoW guilds is ... analogies fail me, but you‚Äôre surrounded by the shit already.
---
You are mean
---
I don't know about you but I usually don't find a drawn-out losing match to be very fun.
---
Don't forget better resolutions and UI scaling!!
---
It's not bullshitting.
---
The reality for not so hardcore folks will be: they will get themselves in position to go hardcore by ranking to 7 or 8 and then camp there for a couple of months doing fun PvP, until the hardcore people are done ranking and they can compete. 
---
That's how it worked on every single pserver in the past years:
---
 1. hardcore rankers get their desired rank (13 or 14 depending on what class)
---
2. more "casual hardcore" players get a shot at ranking
---
People with a life not wanting to account share simply do not have the social environment of another 40 no lifers in their guild to be able to compete. And that is fine.
---
Being present can apparently cause issue, like honor not updating from what I can tell. I've had 0 issues, also not been online for the honor resets yet
---
Vanns room is way bigger and has way more room to work with, not to mention the way the marshalls spawn in there you can pull one end or the other and it only pulls 2 mobs.
---
Or you could pull vann from the middle and kite the marshalls pretty easily if horde killed a few NPCs clogging up the area (which they usually do ive never seen horde actually avoid those NPCs). Vann also doesnt enrage I think and is so easy to heal for a single healer could do it.
---
My goal is just to hit R7 for mage raid loot. I pushed for 170k honor last week and made zero progress in R5. I'm not sure that R7 is achievable for me. 170k honor is pretty close to my 20 hr/week limit.
---
Another vote for using the Dive's guide. Fel Dom + Master Summoner would be useful for levelling and PVP, but those would be the last talents you get since you need to down Afflication first. So it's not as if you will have them for the bulk of your levelling anyway. But the main thing is you should not waste 5 points on Curse of Exhaustion.
---
Used to have to log in for a friend because of this.
---
Bless.
---
It is a travesty that rank 14 is going to be achieved by grinding PvE in AV.
---
I thought BRB meant "BathRoomBreak" :O
---
Usually you have a mage with Ice barrier and Mana Shield aggro the mobs on the way to the safe spots and have the squishier members follow behind. If you're being boosted by a 60 mage, he CAN aggro things for you but its kinda a pain for him to do so given the small aggro radius.
---
OMG, such a great. Going to do just that now
---
&gt;Create a problem
---
&gt;Offer solution
---
&gt;Profit?
---
Just because you are a filthy casual doesnt mean everyone is. We have been playing like this for years jumping from shitty instant gratification game to the next. This game appeals to the hardcore players. Cause there is nothing else for us to play that captures us so well. Thats why you find so many of us in 1 game. All other games out there are not made for us.
---
It's because it's not worth the time investment for most people since most people just want the reputation. If horde could just win in 5 minutes it would be a lot quicker to just get the 125/137 rep for Galv and take the loss and just requeue since queues are instant on alliance side. 
---
Horde wins 95% of the time because alliance are only running one strategy with the only variation being if they go from the left or the right at belinda. They are unable to deal with even the slightest defense since there is seldom someone actually leading the raid. This leads to the assumption that any raid that hasn't got 15-20 people at Drek before the 8 minute mark is a loss and not worth trying to salvage. It's mostly correct.
---
Nothing. You're one of the nice guys
---
As with anything, you have to live and breathe wow to get that far ahead of the curve, and that's ok.
---
I have a gsync display with a ryzen 2700x and 2070 rtx.  It typically stays pegged at 144, even raiding.  It was about 30 in org today.
---
Good to know. I might get back to leveling soon.
---
Ah the tales of Littlefinger and Shartacus.
---
I've completely skipped Stonetalon on every alt I've made after my first toon for this reason. Every quest there is terrible. I hate the whole zone.
---
There's only so many items people will make and use.
---
Your logic would be supported if there was a constant stream of new players making Devilsaurs and Hide of the Wild for example.
---
Devilsaur sets are already history and people won't spend big amounts on it for their alts. Same goes for Hide of the Wild- people made them and are using them. They won't make another one unless it's for their alt and waaay cheaper.
---
Leatherworking is one of those proffesions that is good in the early stages if you get most of the recipes and mats among the first people. It becomes worse as time goes on.
---
Depends on the server of course. Nvm server transfers a thing rip low pop servers your entire cozy community will be shafted.
---
Of course, as it is about money.
---
Weren‚Äôt realm transfers implemented right before BC? So you‚Äôre wrong lol
---
&gt; Though we‚Äôve been working hard to get Reforged in your hands before the end of the year, as we started approaching the finish line, we felt we‚Äôd need a little extra development time for finishing touches. As always, our goal is to honor the high standards you hold us to.
---
They said 2019 and didn‚Äôt make it in time
---
Meh, reforged is trash and will be full to the brim with micro-transactions.
---
Except for the fact that the 6 level discrepancy will cause a level 31 to basically miss him or do glancing blows most of the time. Last boss is a carry in that case.
---
It seems world of warcraft isn't a game for you, be it classic or retail. Accept it and move on, why are you still playing a game which you don't like?
---
I think I understood what happened, but can you explain 'deathrolling' to me
---
Love fin and wholesome classic content like this! More!!
---
Cries in Darnassus.
---
Nope. We did it with 60s and 55s in greens. It was a push but it isn't a gear issue. Unless you're bringing a ton of lesser DPS classes like boomies.
---
Your orders are the same orders being thrown out now, or that people do even if they aren't being told. The difference is that horde have adapted to the only strategy while alliance haven't figured out a new attack strategy that works. Couple this with the fact that the people who got exalted first are the best players and they are no longer joining and you've got a 80-90% alliance loss ratio.
---
I wish I nolifed a bit harder when alliance won 95% of the games but I didn't realise it would swing around the other way within a few days. I did get exalted though and that means I will never play another game of AV again.
---
I'm sure when all the rep farmers have gone their way and only the people actually playing PVP are left that there will be a more even win/lose ratio again.
---
It will get easier as time passes by. But for getting Thise sweet BiS items now, I'm out
---
*How long for keyring, basic feature we all want to see*
---
Lol dunno, maybe in 4 months?
---
*How about paid transfers?*
---
Got u fam, coming next week!
---
I counterintuitively flamed a few people at my farm spot. Apologized to two of them which were kind despite me being a jerk. Nowadays I just switch to League of Legends if my farmspot is taken.
---
So no BWL until end of February
---
Adding to this.. I didn't want to do much farming when I still had to run scholo two hundred times for BiS items.
---
A lot of people, even aside from not needing consumables due to better gear, have more time to farm themselves.
---
As Horde I relish a 45 minute win - tons of honor and rep, and with a 10-15 minute queue longer games feel more rewarding than a rushed win or loss. More time to build both honor and rep, regardless of if you lose or win. But that's for Horde.
---
Be his sugar daddy
---
Yep, a PvP vendor in OG or (I assume) SW.
---
Man I am there only for rep. I hate that place and I hate mass pvp in general. And I understand why horde is defending, it is because of queues, I got that. But man it is so frustrating. It is like 800 rep per hour nowadays and it is taking so long to get to exalted. First wave got it in one day, I wish I could start sooner.
---
Hey how did you get the dagger icon to show next to the \[item\] in chat?
---
You set the limit of your roll to what the other person rolled. First to roll one wins.
---
Everyone‚Äôs at different places. The average hardcore players are finishing their AV rep, completing MC in under 90 minutes, and splitting their 40 man raid team in two for ony. 
---
Great thing about classic I‚Äôve been told is that some gear is so good there‚Äôs not really a point to no longer do certain raids. Like viskag, robe of crit power, and wild growth shoulders (last two are bis through phase 4 for me)
---
It literally has nothing to do with anything related to their rank.
---
Majority don‚Äôt.. that‚Äôs why 37 people left this guys match lol
---
If Blizzard isn't locking servers for specific factions based on population issues then we can assume they don't care to fix anything and are looking for quick transfer cash as people hop at random hoping for the best. I'm more curious about the PvP to PvE option. That one is going to get used more than we expect I'm thinking, phase 2 soured a lot of opinions of PvP but didn't seem to kill the interest in the game completely
---
I'd honestly say your guild is behind the curve, to be honest, if you just cleared MC for the 1st time last week. But its not an issue. Keep clearing MC and Ony weekly and gearing up your raid. We dont even know when BWL will be released yet so no rush. 
---
AV is a good way to get BWL level epics for many of your raiders (and with very little effort needed). I play casually (couple hours at night - except on our guilds raid nights) and I should hit exalted with AV tonight/tomorrow (so basically 1 weeks work). Some of the AV exalted epics are brilliant upgrades and fairly easy for all to get, so during the xmas hols when a lot of folk are off and raids are tough to fill, players can grind a little rep here and there fairly easily.
---
People have multiple WoW accounts for a variety of reasons. You're assuming he bought a second account for this specific reason, but that's a fabrication with no evidence.
---
    HIGH TARGET DENSITY
---
Share the aura? :)
---
had the same thing happen in my guild yesterday only it was a 98 and a 100 and another item
---
Hold!!! When BWL comes out they'll be in high demand.
---
Because noone wants to grind something everyone gets. They want to deny others getting it.
---
Apparently the towers aren‚Äôt free from batching either
---
You're against the other horde players on your realm. If it's hard for you it's hard for all of them.
---
its not necessarily like the ally have a choice, on flamelash it took only one guild to leave to start the panic and then even the ones who want to stay are kind of forced out; any server at any moment in time is at risk of being flamelashed by alliance so its hard to tell where to go atm lol
---
There's a 3 month cooldown on transfers.
---
If you didn't play much.   
---
They removed phasing with the launch of the PvP System.   
---
Thus servers seem a lot more crowded nowadays.
---
if you dont like it, go play something else! Nobody is forcing you to play. If you are this angry, go play something that makes you happy!!
---
No because if you are on that server, you can talk to all the guilds literally and help out with the bigger picture, you‚Äôre not playing with bots, it‚Äôs people who you can talk to if you want to avoid a flamelash situation. It takes 1 person to get the leadership from all the guilds to sit down and talk in the same discord, it‚Äôs not rocket science
---
Cheers! will check it out soon :)
---
How do you check what bracket you ended up in?
---
Jesus, how many hours per day is that?
---
That's what you call this incoherent rambling? he makes little sense, then drifts off to Diablo 4.
---
Glad you could make it.
---
pretty sure your GPU will bottleneck your CPU.
---
You really have the: "Everyone but me is an idiot" - mentality?
---
Did you even try to read the: "Tell them before" part?
---
So you're lying. You tell people to be away from your toilet but plan to go there. Naughty.
---
Even most Horde players will tell you the aesthetic sucks.
---
Horde racials are better for individuals, Alliance (Paladins) are stronger for organized PvP. Guess which one people gravitate to more?
---
50 euros and some grind or 0 euros and unfathomable grind. If I was serious about r14 and could still do "some grind" that seems like a pretty nice deal, after all it's barely 2 hours of work for that 50 euros compared to many many hours of grind :P
---
It depends on which server-cluster you are in and whether you are Alliance or Horde. That's because both things heavily impact the queue time you have to endure.
---
&gt;or do I get some shitty x added to the end?
---
oh boy imagine if that were actually possible. Any name ending with "se" ...
---
so stupid they made the fruitcakes BOP how am i supposed to regift them
---
Mograine remains even, all alliance head over there let's boss about em
---
lol that's more than shazzrah right now
---
Except he is right about hardcore, grinding bg nonstop 24/7 doesn't take skill, it takes time. Its not gaming addiction, its just people who want to achieve what they want. I'm not going for r14 because i have a job, but i'll be impressed if i see r14 in orgri just due to sheer determination he has.
---
Hover at rank 6-7 for the next 3 months so the nolifers complete their grind then push for it. Right now if you aren't ranked and if you play on a high pop server you're looking at 50+ hours of play per week for the next 2 months to get there.
---
Just use the same bottle your beverage came in. The cycle of water.
---
Ye this. 
---
Also I don't even think the graphics are better, reforged looks like a cheap Chinese clone of it to be fair. Graphics are way too shiny and so on it kind of looks like a mobile game.
---
Omg classic is dead
---
less people on your side = less competition for brackets
---
Why is this happening? The entire server wants ony buff before raid?
---
oh it will
---
dOnT yOu gUyS hAvE pHoNeS?
---
&gt; This is just how PvP games go
---
I don't know how many PvP games you've played but the majority I've seen try to give both sides an equal number of players. Even within WoW itself. You queue for WSG? You need to wait until both sides have players.
---
That's your experience - I've got well over 200 kills on my alt who isn't even lvl 40 yet. True world pvp is awesome.
---
Balanced servers feel best and most fun to play on.
---
Blizzard can suck my ass, but people's suggestions are shortsighted and laughable. Short of giving people free fully prebis geared 60s of their choice, good luck getting people to change factiona now. So feel free to lick my balls while I "lick Blizzard's boots".
---
Everyone thinks rerolling is such a great idea yet its statistically demonstrable not many people have done it. HMMMMMMM....
---
If you are doing bgs definitely
---
People are really overestimating the difficulty of the 5 man dungs and even ubrs. I heal dungeons and ubrs as full shadow specc all the time when my guild cant find a healer. Full runs of ubrs obviously needs 2 healers but have had no problem solo healing rend runs.
---
If people knew I was shadow they probably wouldnt want me to heal, imo just dont tell anyone ur specc cause ur healing is more than enough to work.
---
I'll easily believe there are a few mad top players, and there's probably some variation server to server. What I didn't believe, is that there are 200+ (probably more like 300) players in brackets 10-14 with 900k+. And, as it turns out, that was a misunderstanding. 
---
My honorspy hasn't updated most of the top runners, but I believe at least 2-3 have made it above 1M yesterday too. One was sitting at 945k yesterday morning.
---
I have a 60 shaman and 60 mage. I mostly made the last post as a joke. I certainly hope but your points make a lot of sense as there is no "paladin horde race".
---
I could see bliz adding in a race change (because 25 a go isn't unpleasing to their bottom line), but that's a lot of shit to add (and money to change if it's 25 bucks a pop).
---
Level in dungeons mate! I found leveling in the open world to be much more difficult, at higher levels especially. Solo Mara  few times and you‚Äôll be there in no time!
---
Ah, I meant Horde (ovbs Alliance pool I guess is... small).
---
Is just that people assume Flamelash is dead just because Alliance left, when it is a perfectly normal server from Horde's point of view (other than you can assume you can AFK anywhere in the world and be safe and you are 99% of the time right).
---
4 hours a day isnt casual.. you are a special one
---
Ranking will arguably be affected least by this. 
---
First, ranking is all done in cross-server battlegrounds now. Even on a dead server, someone could pvp all day if they wanted.
---
Second, ranking is really just a measure as to how much you've pvped compared to others on your server. People who pvp +12 hours per day are going to rank high, regardless of their server population. It's all relative.
---
&gt;, because they can't go to PvP and won't want to go to US servers
---
wait you can transfer cross region?
---
I stand corrected, thank you sirrrrr or mam
---
Indeed, this was my journey to 300 herb, and since you need 300 herb to gather a black lotus there aren‚Äôt any gathered ones in the picture ;).
---
Then again one of the main reasons for taking herb is the incidental lotus that I can find, so hopefully that numbers will rise quickly from now on!
---
This still has nothing to do with it taking 6 months from 4-5 to hit rank 14.
---
Not everyone goes to reddit to see the timeline how everything will unfold. Some people just want to play a god damn video game. Love these "OH IF YOU'RE NOT A 1337 OLD VETERNAL LIKE ME WHO HAS DEDICATION AND SKILL IT'S YOUR FAULT 40 PEOPLE ARE FARMING YOU, L2READREDDIT&amp;RESEARCH A 15 YEAR OLD VIDEO GAME, SCRUBS!"
---
Also it's hilarious how you, in your delusions of grandeur, assume most of the thousands of players on PvP servers read your reddit posts.
---
So.. you took it the wrong way then? haha
---
I will jam a thumb in your eye and a snowball in your mangina for this insolence.
---
To be fair, I wouldn't mind loosing 80% of matches if they are 8min short.
---
Perfection. I just hit 54.
---
Fine :D only 2% people or so on server can be rank 10 or so :D GL getting those 11-13 ranks in first wave.
---
Pvp realm actually. Got ganked once while I was AFKing a bit. BG‚Äôs changed the server so much, I‚Äôve been roaming around the world running into hordes and gathering alongside them..
---
But yeah I wouldn‚Äôt even attempt to do this before BG‚Äôs were out!
---
you've come to the wrong place.  
---
People dont like streamers here in general.  
---
Also its not an advertisement board
---
i dont consider myself super hardcore but hardcore enough.
---
we are doing MC in 1hr30 mins, 20 man ony groups, most have AV exalted, and close to a 2nd lv60 alt. my char has pretty much all raid items with viskag / brutality except 2 (belt / shoes).
---
we are pretty prepared for phase 3 already.
---
have 35 game days played
---
I remember getting 4 pc blue set and and joining random WSG's with 60's on 60% mounts, flag carrying at 55% speed was so much fun.
---
All my ally AV groups yesterday went "zerg galv, when we get intercepted, skip it, zerg drek" and that is basically the only raid tactic for the next 15 minutes until we lose.
---
All tips like "stay in groups, help cap this tower, tp back to slow horde down a bit" are just ignored.
---
The point is simply, by giving an item to a healer, you reduce the chance of a wipe, by giving it top dps, you kill the boss half a second faster.
---
There just is contest, dps is meaningless as even now it's high enough to beat every boss in the game. The only possible point of failure is people dying and for that you need to gear tanks and healers first, so any overlapping items should go to them first rather than dps.
---
Haha thanks, exactly this indeed! Ah well whatever makes someone happy. I get happy from seeing my loot from 1-300 herbalism and that other guy gets happy from screaming Nerd ^^.
---
I'm not p1stols but the addon is 'chatlinkicons'
---
But why
---
ironically horde brainlets dragging out games will actually increase their queue times
---
Ty
---
Anytime bud
---
Try lowering your max FPS in the settings
---
Ah damn it I assumed as much, but since my own sarcasm often goes /woosh on here for some reason I've grown cynical lately.
---
Yea, long story short paladins and shamans both crossed the faction borders in TBC - it made for some interesting changes, but that together with arenas led to both factions and, later, all classes, being much less unique. All of a sudden both factions had both blessings and totems, and soon enough everyone had to have an interrupt, CC and whatnot because otherwise they were "unbalanced in arena pvp". 
---
But yea, let's see what the future holds. In the meantime, enjoy your shammy - I'm tempted to respec 30/0/21 instead of my deep resto, could be a lot of fun in AV/WSG.
---
Who said to transfer to a dominant faction? Are you retarded?
---
Not exactly loser but no life dedicated nerds.
---
I have the same experience up until the release of battlegrounds. /bg chat is really a gutter. The way some people talk to other players is just depressing.
---
Bloodbath and Beyond is an amazing guild name
---
I start to think I have problem about being indecisive about classes...
---
" 4 hours each day "
---
" casual numbers  "
---
Lol
---
BGs are cross-realm though
---
Hah, and people think AV is covered in snow. It's salt!
---
Nope, all the same! I tried going shadow on retail once but just couldn't get away with it, so I always end up levelling as some combo of holy/disc. 
---
Also, explaining all this on the internet is somehow making it seem weirder than I'd previously considered.
---
&gt; WoW is a job
---
Except it isn't. PvP rank grinding is a job, but if you're not doing that then you're OK.
---
Easy there, china.
---
Hi, /u/kiwibird9000
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eca8nq/pyrewood_village_is_literally_unplayable_right_now/). 
---
LOL hahahaha Casual? are you for real?
---
That's what you get for slacking and not tipping that number over 300k when you were so close.
---
Yes there is. You can buy $10k of plex, officially, sell them on the in game market, officially, and get whatever you want ( except a titan, you don't just get a titan ).
---
What you really can't do is sell this legally.
---
Get him the best blue weapons for his level and enchant them with fiery. Repeat this process every 6-7 levels. He will mow through mobs. This way he maximizes his Xp/hour. You just need to provide cash and ports.
---
I feel like this was made specifically because of me LOL.
---
Enhancement shaman on bigglesworth and this is what i do everytime (wearing that helmet and weapon :D )
---
FML
---
Yeah and if you‚Äôre horde you win like 80% so you get over like 4K honor per round lmao
---
Needs a big word. You can take a gamble and run lower hit and you might do more dps because rng is on your side. Or you'll miss a lot during your nuke and get fucked
---
pepeLaugh
---
Except youll be the same cat/bear forever
---
Queues get longer because horde turtle, as always horde players fucking themselves due to short term thinking
---
Thanks a lot! It‚Äôs 17.58 so I missed the 7 after the 1 lol.
---
Will edit it straight away!
---
Well it depends on what you consider HC. Many would say that is not very HC compared to the ones trying to grind to r14 right now, some seem to have become undead since they don't sleep or eat :D
---
They are for professions and I love warlock leveling
---
Horde mage EU, looking for a good PvE server. They all (3?) seem to be Alliance dominated though. Where do I go? Any guilds around to lure me?
---
"No meme, if you're not hitting rank 10 this reset you will not hit rank 14 within 6 months from now. Dead serious."
---
This is the premise of our discussion.
---
If you are putting in the same effort week after week and haven't reached rank10 yet, you will not get r14 in the foreseeable future, because the super hardcore crowd is already outfarming you. 
---
This can only be alleviated by putting in some time now to get into a good starting position in which you dont have to maintain PvP by sacrificing other aspects of your life/gameplay, then go hardcore once the super hardcore crowd is done ranking.
---
Else you will simply not 14 at all.
---
Why waste 12weeks ranking now, seeing you can't compete with the super hardcores, falling back to rank 7 to 8, because you get hardstuck at R11/12, all while you could maintain 7/8 rather easily as long as you enjoy PvP, then going hardcore once you actually have a shot at the high ranks?
---
You got a link for the classic version? can only find retail versions googling it. thanks
---
Not only did you spell literally wrong, but you used it as its antithesis. You used it figuratively... I just dont like when people use the word so often, and redundantly.
---
It's inflated a bit as well because you will nearly always face someone new in av with cross server. Before x server you'd meet same peeps and only get honour for objectives
---
Can confirm. I transferred into a Horde-dominated PvP realm near the end of TBC from a PvE realm as Alliance and during WOTLK I would regularly faction change without even bothering to look at the faction ratio. Couldn't imagine doing that now.
---
So what you‚Äôre saying is it does not take 6 months . Thanks anyone going for r14 is surely not a casual
---
So just to be clear, while the snapshotting no longer works, if you still had the healing gear equiped (eg Paladin T1) you would still get the +healing benefit every 5seconds?
---
after reset today
---
Your battery may be not be charging correctly or deteriorating.
---
60 pally 60 hunter 40 warr and now lvl 11 mage, I feel ya ( under lvl 10 classes not counted)
---
What makes you think there will be an influx?
---
Finkled bro high dps
---
Well, because honor was much harder go get
---
Omg thought this was just a South Adrican thing, never seen it anywhere else though. Atleast our guys have spray bottles and actual window washers, still annoying though
---
Aaaah, it was that easy! Thanks for letting me know.
---
CORRECT!
---
Why would they put faction restrictions on paid transfers?
---
Send a job application to them.  
---
Sounds like you know quite a deal how to handle this.
---
Well, that's a point he addresses in the video I think. But you can also still put on a shield when you need extra mitigation, the actual mitigation you lose from being fury prot is almost nothing.
---
Warlock. Hunter is always overplayed
---
In the perfect world it takes 12 weeks of the top of the crop. Everybody knows that.
---
The discussion you entered revolved around the people *not* being the absolute best on their server and how they can just avoid destroying their dreams now, because they burn out on a grind they can't win, all while they could wait for 3-4 months and then do the grind that is very achievable for them.
---
You dont have to be a casual to be outfarmed by your opposition. You can be in the top 5 guild of the server and still be severely outfarmed by the top prems. You only need 30 people ahead of you and you will simply not hit 14 in the foreseeable future.
---
people doing this have a special place in hell
---
Same here buddy :) I was like, ill probably get rank 6 or rank 7 this week, i didnt rank up from Rank 4, only got like 50% progress :D i feel like i can finally focus on my alt
---
Why is there always one person who does a post like this claiming that what is clearly hardcore (i.e. AV rep done a day after release) is actually casual?  How can you really live so far up your own arse that you misjudge it so badly?
---
I was on Heartseeker and I ended my subscription when I found out how shit this version of AV was. It was a fun few months but people are starting to play Classic like it's retail, just rep and loot grinds again with little emphasis on community.
---
If unstoppable changes ur prio that's bs. Gear you earn on your own unless it is better than raid gear should never effect your prio, that's just shitting on your efforts.
---
Pretty much people are 60 got prebis and they are now slowly getting their alts up.
---
I think you are undercutting dreamfoil too much. I usually sell each stack for minimum 12.5g and when there is not much of them on ah i push it to 15g per stack, so i would say at minimum 60s per dreamfoil but then again maybe its your server prices.
---
I thought reset was Tuesday night? Do you know what time today?
---
I may be wrong because I have a loose understanding of the system, but wouldn't you say that it will be slightly easier 6 months from now to hit rank 14 as the mad dash and hyper hardcore pvp rank craze will have died down some?
---
There's so much wrong with this comment lol.  What happened to last week when the alliance kept saying it doesn't matter how much honor you're getting because your competition is getting the same?  Queues get longer because there's less alliance queuing.  That's it.  As to the why, we can only speculate, but it's clear we have very different opinions on the reason.  I suppose I wouldn't want to q either if I lost almost every time with less than half the bonus honor.
---
4 hours a day is pretty casual and it's a release event, it's new content. Not unusual to play more doing that.
---
Good to know! Thanks! :)
---
I haven‚Äôt sold anything yet actually, so I‚Äôll check the prices today and see if they‚Äôre anything similar to yesterday‚Äôs, and will take a good look at the dreamfoil especially!
---
Berserking all the way it's just more fun and good when you already popped ns.
---
I'm fully aware of how PLEX works, and sure, it's possible, but no one ever buys that much plex. I'm just tired of the misconception that you have to buy ships with real money in EvE, a misconception perpetuated by the whole "THAT SHIP WAS WORTH $10!!!" sales pitch.
---
I HIGHLY recommend trying either 23/0/28 ( https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zy0MoZZVfct0xs )
---
Or 30/0/21 (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hEzzE0MqZZVf0x0xo).
---
(For both builds move points to get to 3% hit based on gear, there's flex points in both in improved ahnk)
---
They've been a lot of fun! The 30/0/21 is much better for damage dealing and solo play where as 23/0/28 has better group play since you're mostly healing and occasionally burst damaging targets or spamming slows. 
---
I personally like the 23/0/28 a little more since I'm mostly playing shaman to heal. Mage is just so much fun in the ability to kite/Rdps that I get more enjoyment in the change of pace with filling green bars.
---
Good to know! Thanks! :) I haven‚Äôt sold anything yet actually, so I‚Äôll check the prices today and see if they‚Äôre anything similar to yesterday‚Äôs, and will take a good look at the dreamfoil especially!
---
I'd say people who are getting R14 aren't hardcores since they are literally at the top and there should be a classification beyond hardcores, either a potentially offensive word or Professional, since they are putting just as much if not mote time into it than others put into their professions
---
But they said end of 2019!! WHERE'S MY PITCHFORK??
---
So it should be done now right?
---
you're just being rude.  we've had several players who were stranded on pst who live in est and the time difference is inconvenient.  you and I both know that if paid server transfers weren't just sprung on us, there would be time to talk with people about what they want / plan to do and as a guild there would be time to recruit people into missing spots.
---
no one left nor do they want to btw.
---
Lasher packs are a very very good gold source too (greys are worth quite alot of gold) plus, they drop pretty much all level herbs, from peacebloom to dreamfoils to shrooms. Happy farms m8 :)
---
My server has been steady around 40 silver for quite some time now.
---
It's not like it's impossible to think of honor system that wouldn't give reward to everyone.
---
For exemple make blue PvP set a long grind: (something like 200 hours of PvP) it's true that in 6 months a lot of people will have it but is this really a problem? a blue armor set that is very often not even BiS even in phase 1-2 is not really game breaking.
---
For rank12-14 rewards, ranked BG in team or weekly tournaments so only the best players can get it.  
---
Not saying it's perfect and I'm sure some smart people can think of better solution but almost anything is better than the current system and it doesn't mean rank 14 weapons would be given to everyone.
---
after first few hatches of r14 are done with their ranking the honor required for br1 will go down
---
This is really stupid. WoW is an MMORPG. A genre that was defined from predecessors that focused on group oriented gameplay. That's not even the point.
---
Without PvE, WoW wouldn't exist. Without PVP it still does. Because if WoW weren't modeled after PvE, there wouldn't be any leveling, the fucking foundation to the game.  Your point is moot an unhinged, and especially ignorant.
---
horde bad alliance good
---
why would queue matter? you are competing vs ppl having the same queues
---

---
I had eight, 1-2 rolls last week in a row.
---
I have tears in my eyes that was so fucking funny
---
no horde is getting that per day
---
well i can say this . Unstopable force for PvP , Spinal for PvE...  You cannot compare that CC unstopable force has with the non cc on spinal for PvP.
---
Dude I have been 300 herb for months now. I farmed stacks of dreamfoil, ice thingies, mountain silversage, etc.
---
I have never seen a Black Lotus.
---
Pretty sure the number of hours alone required to get r14 makes you qualify for the "gaming disorder" designation. It's simply not possible to get that rank and have a healthy lifestyle. It forces addict-like behaviour by design
---
Does this also offer bnet account transfers? I‚Äôd like to play bfa while in queue
---
Anyone up for making a fresh new raiding guild on Noggenfogger eu? Kinda getting tired of lack of transparency, poor organisational skills in a number of guilds i've been at (both in classic and private servers).
---
From the horde side:
---
I haven't pulled Hunter pet into drek yet. 
---
Warlock pets though like ever game. Idk if they just normally run sack for raid but they ALWAYS seem to forget that pets agro. I've pulled the same demondoge into WMs 2 or 3 times.
---
Why did you have to add the literally to your title. Very redundant. Its a pet peeve of mine. Please pay it forward and remind others who use it so often to avoid it.
---
Last week was probably the worst time to try to rank up because there were a tonne of people farming exalted AV for the rewards.  A lot of these people now have exalted AV and so, while many will continue to farm honour, the numbers will be a lot lower as a lot will stop or slow down.
---
Yeah I spent 3 full days of 6+ Hours to grind some Lvl 19 and 29 WSG's cause why not. Made around 7.3k Honor, over 1000 Kills and I barely reached Rank 1 60% when HonorSpy was constantly around Rank 2 20-30%. Definitely hit me in the face, but ya know what that means.
---
**More BGs!**
---
90% of these posts are bullshit, I resubbed few days ago after 2 months break, and game is awesome, people too, enjoying it so much
---
I also told this many times and I'm quite surprised it didn't change. Like you said it's borderline unethical to put a system like in a game that punish player for taking break and push them to play unhealthy amount of time.
---
(and back in the days, the devs could at least say they didn't expect it)
---
Your inability to understand that some players bring more value than others is whats rude here.
---
If your players have literally 0 ties to the guild and will just up and vanish, especially if they¬¥re important to the guild. That means your guild didnt have much going on in the first place.
---
Dont start any of that me and you garbage either, I completely disagree with you.
---
If you have no way of even attempting to reach the important people before they switch, it really did not matter if this was announced or not.
---
Whats with all the pushback on wanting to plan around the potential loss of x players because they are est and got trapped pst?  
---
What you do is talk to your est players about what their plan is.  if they do want to move to a timezone that raids closer to their preferred time, you start recruiting heavier where you can and start picking up players below lvl 60, maybe even help them with leveling and attunements.
---
I'm not on one of your megaservers where theres thousands of players and everyone is trying to raid.  Theres like 350 active 60's total and they dont all raid.
---
Why are you not getting spinal? I think enh should be prioritized for spinal because there are much better options for 2h warriors.
---
"Hardcore" here.
---
AV Rep done in 2 days.
---
Pre 60min raids.
---
Full raid BiS besides Vis'Kag.
---
That is true but not for this patch
---
Because more people will get the recipe.
---
I had a guildie who thought he was going to hit rank 10+ within a few weeks of honour launch.  Told me I was wrong when I corrected him and explained how the system works with rank points and brackets n shit.  
---
In all fairness to him a couple weeks later he apologised to me.
---
Does no one see the irony in this? To my mind, both players in this scenario are being douchey.
---
Wonder why this isn't more popular
---
So the games being 40 min instead of 5 min has no influence on queue times lmao?
---
That's OK. But thanks for the notice.
---
Incidious. Very balance with good communities.
---
Rarely do I stumble over them. But once you do see one or someone picks one. Just time out about 45 min then run between all their spawn locations. You‚Äôll prolly find one eventually doing that. Knowing the timer is key. Ask around the zone most herbers are willing to share the timer if they know when the last one was picked.
---
He's an aussie though - oceanic servers are known to have 35+ min queues even at launch of av....  So 1 hour isn't that much of an outlier.
---
Yeah cuz instead of paying the person you just logout, easy.
---
This is one of the many reasons why classic is so much fun. It doesn't feel empty.
---
Mograine is best realm, nice community with good balance out in the world
---
No npcs, no fp, no guards, no bankers, no ah, literally EVERY npc
---
It takes roughly 60 int to get 1% crit.
---
Spinal is the best weapon you can get for a very long time outside of Sulfuras, especially if you're Orc and raiding as enhancer. However I'd assume there's quite a bit of competition on it, as the same is true for warriors, and it's not a very common drop. Until then, Unstoppable Force is a very good weapon and I'd absolutely get it if you don't have Spinal Reaper already.
---
pardon me nani?
---
Very balance. Even in Wpvp both sides had territory and both sides raided each other. 
---
Much chiller now.
---
Lol?
---
They meant end of the year according to the Chinese calendar.
---
But it doesn't matter if they're not - since it's faction based anyway.  I'd wager that, at least at the moment, alliance side honor on a balanced high pop server is far more competitive than horde side.  Largely because the average newb is farming more honor on alliance than horde because of the insta av queues and the ease of getting a premade in - and the ease of winning av even without a premade as alliance.
---
8-12 weeks of 4-6 hours per day.
---
Honestly, I could give a damn about killing other players. Occasionally, if it's been a long night, I'll get dragged along into a few rounds of duels, but I don't go in for the 1v1.
---
I fucking love healing in PvP though. I love turning Prot Warriors into unkillable gods with HoTs. I love having to care about my positioning, and using abilities like Barkskin and Nature's Grasp to escape enemy players. I like making those clutch saves, when I'm able to take someone from 0% to 80% and let them win their fight. I've done a lil bit of tanking when nobody else will, trying to lead the charge in, but I'd much rather just heal everyone.
---
I remember playing vanilla without addons. It was rough. I only managed to get in the 30s before bc came out.
---
Granted I was super young then though as I‚Äôm only 22 now.
---
Did I hear about a class action lawsuit?
---
I can definitely confirm he's there. I got X'Caliboar a month or so ago.
---
The banshee boss won't be the until p3 however
---
Orc ugly. Troll ugly. Go cow. Orc is pry best but that casting speed is pretty sweet and definitely will boost your numbers, 5 min cd I think? Orc stun resi is the op racial if you want strongest pvper.
---
Very stupid move. That actually convices Most people to stay, just to prove a point (‚ÄûWe do not negotiate with Terrorists‚Äú).
---
without checking i can‚Äôt be certain but i believe so
---
Oh.  My god.
---
not on my realm (germany)
---
ha the weapons....  
---
only a small fraction of the smalles fraction will get that. and when they get it, its very probable that they quit for beign burned out.
---
Dont aim for the weapons, unless you can commig 2,5 month of grinding all day, everyday.  
---
im not toalking about 12 hour sessions, but more about like 18 to 20 hour sessions for multiple months in a row.
---
Druid main. Leveled a Rogue to 40 because I felt like they were better for stealth missions.
---
Truth is, you always only see what you're missing from the other class, and each is great in its own way but pretty redundant after a while.
---
So I would stick to Druid+Lock if I were you. Mostly for the differences in gameplay.
---
Tried it, it's about 15g/hour If you do it efficiently and don't die. That's pretty meh, but also the chance to drop forors makes it worth it imo.
---
This is why cow warrior is best warrior
---
DAE hate min/maxers? Right guys? How about having fun amirite?
---
Shazzrah is around 70%-30% horde/alliance. I wouldn't recommend it. No clue about Firemaw.
---
Didn't they say expected by end of 2019? It was never promised right?
---
4 hours a day to only get a bit of progress in rank 4 is very surprising tbh. At this rate you'll cap out at rank 5, which definitely shouldn't happen at 4h/day investment. You probably had very low honor/hour (which is possible if you solo queue AV on alliance side and don't try to farm honor in the middle) - what's your week total?
---
Also keep in mind that tons of people were farming rep this week, it should be a lot easier to rank in middle brackets once people not interested in ranking stop spamming AV.
---
If you run AV premades for a significant amount of time every day you have a good shot at ranking up. Don't know about rank 10 but I'm sure you can do like rank 8 with your playtimes. There's a crossrealm premade discord for NA alliance; on EU it's invite only so you'll have a harder time getting in. No idea about horde side. Plus your server might run their own premades but then again you might have to work to make your way into them.
---
They do, just not to the same extent I guess. But spies are absolutely a thing and really fun to hunt
---
What person would even transfer to a server, where their faction is in minority? Especially if they had to pay for such "pleasure"
---
Been doing that to the people who ‚Äúafk‚Äù but are using macros to keep slightly active.
---
Thank you oh wise one, that was exactly what I needed. Have a lovely day.
---
Just the info I wanted mate, thanks!
---
\&gt;The only thing that is easier on small servers is coordinating the push to 14 with the other top players, so you don't ruin each other every week.   
---
sounds ideal tbh, but then again im not going for ranking this time, in vanilla we rolled our alts on low pop rp-pvp server for this very reason, our guild basically controlled the r14 list and we didnt have to play 20+ hours a day in the final weeks  
---
also because it wasnt crossrealm and there was one guild on the horde side that was as competitive as us,  we got to play so many matches against them (everyone once and awhile we would go heavy turtle in wsg (1o-9d) and see how long we could get the match to last, we knew everyone in each others guilds (and a few of us had access to the other ventrilo) and if we came across one another in wpvp or av (or pug wsg/ab) we would acknowledge eachother and it was pretty cool imo
---
This wekk is not a proper representation of how ranking will be for you.
---
Plot twist: Horde got bored of having to alliance players to slay so they killed every single man, woman, child, dog, cat and cockroach in all alliance cities.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
This. If I'm not mistaken, the ammount of xp the lowbies get delivered ends on the average level in the group, the closer to your own level, the more xp you get.
---
I bet you're great at parties.
---
Might be a difference in faction. He‚Äôs alliance.
---
Please. Alliance don't stop at Galv.
---
Also, as an Orc, you wanna wear an Axe.
---
Just tank for a guild's alt raids?
---
Then slowly work your way into replacing one of the MT/OT and then take the guild over!
---
I don't think there are (for orc warriors, anyway)
---
Most people work 8 hours a day, 5 days a week, right? I am not counting 996 chinese work culture.
---
Well, R12-13 will require 16+ hours a day and god forbid the effort for R14. 
---
The issue with dedication is the more relaxed a level is, the more broader it's expected to be, like a pyramid. Your categorization of hardcore and professional is too broad and vague.
---
Anyway, community has established a way to measure it long ago:
---
1. The one who is less dedicated than you is a noob, scrub and loser.
---
2. The one who is more dedicated than you is nolifer and NEET.
---
/s
---
I thought the same as I logged in today. Its a fucking joke. I was rang 3, ~75% to rank 4 and I did 25k honor. ok its not much but I thought it would be enough to rank up atleast but intead I got like 5%... So I'm now sitting at rank 3, 80%. And this is where I quit. Still rank 10 is nearly impossible.
---
Blizz should have add the pvppoint system instead of adding the rank system. With the honor point system they had nearly before bc launch, you could have bought your set someday in farming these pvp points. So it was a thing anyone could achieve. This gamedesign descision adding the rank system again gives me headache...only those who dont have a job and got absolutely no RL can achieve the higher ranks. Its not only getting to rank 14... Blizzard, open your eyes, its fucking bullshit!
---
I don't get it.
---
I mean, I saw people yelling that in AV, but I still don't get it. What does getting killed in AV have to do with retail?
---
Considering people gamble irl at casinos where the odds are against you, a 50/50 gamble is actually pretty nice.
---
You guys do realise server transfers were in vanilla right?  Stop acting like this will destroy the game.
---
You can at most get 13k rank points per week. Rank 3 is at 5k points and after that one every rank is 5k rank points more.
---
There is a 20% decay on rank points. So if you are rank 3 with 7k points for example, and you get 13k points. You will decay down to 5600 points and then go up to 18,600 points which is rank 5.
---
Thanks mate! Awesome to hear you enjoyed it!
---
To be honest I just woke up and was already very happy to have 100+ upvotes lol!
---
Many thanks again and GL lvling herb!
---
Damn dude. what did honorspy say the day before reset?
---
No NPCs in Undercity either, Maybe the problem is only in the Eastern kingdoms.
---
Yeah looked into them for a bit too, will certainly try a few farm runs! Cheers!
---
Blizz, one of the good guy companies left who don't just release games in alpha/beta. They can take as long as they need imo.
---
This reminds me of one of the arugal layers UC was empty.
---
Server transfers were in classic
---
Overhealing is not a downranking issue. If you are going OOM in 1 minute in full raid bis I have bad news buddy. Do you even play a Priest or just pulling nonsense out of your ass for fun? No offense.
---
Also, if someone loses roll and doesnt pay I'm fairly certain it is not against ToS and blizz will take no action against them. Same with trade mats if you ask a random to craft for you. I could b wrong.
---
wish i had held onto my level 40 shamans that was on a pvp world
---
hoting tanks when buff cap exists is a terrible idea
---
Planning Judgement-EU -&gt; Mograine-EU (Alliance)
---
Epic mount, with mithril spurs + carrot on a stick (and minor speed on normal boots, which auto equipped once I dismounted). So I was getting around the map quite fast! :)
---
Pyrewood Village? It seems all mobs are missing from Ironforge and Stormwind. Darnassus is the busiest I've ever seen it with everyone having to go there for AH, battlemasters, etc.
---
Wanna know a good thing?
---
Being the only Resto Druid means I got fully set-geared in 2-weeks time. Now I'm just hoarding DKP for the next item I want - none of the other healers will be able to do anything about it and as soon as BWL is released I'll be flying in more T2 pieces. Also, this set is incredible for RDruids.
---
So yeah, we exist and gear does exist too!
---
But I'm still planning on leveling other classes because farming on a druid sucks balls and I just can't stand being max level and grinding for gold...
---
Pre-made WSG or AV?

Agreed. Mograine is solid. Still a distinct horde advantage, but Alliance managed to survive the pre-BG wPvP madness largely intact. It is as healthy a server as one can reasonably hope for.

I dunno. Maybe if we could rely on everyone doing this, it would be viable. Unfortunately we can't. So I'd never transfer anywhere that has a balance of more than 45-55 against my faction.
---
(Of course that's kinda irrelevant since I wasn't planning on transferring, but still)
---
I just started classic about two weeks ago. I got a 24 priest, 18 war. Always got that feeling "maybe I should lvl that class"....
---
As I play on EU and wanted to go PVE server (I played mainly PvP when I started late vanilla) since I didn't want to join the toxicity you saw on the reddits, so my choice of servers where 3....
---
As I plan on making som cash of the auction house I felt like taking the minority side would be a bit of blow so it had to be ally, since all are alliance favoured...
---
But if I'm really honest I would like to play an shammy, at least as an alt. I know I can have chars on both sides but since gold isn't as easy to come by I prefer to have all toons on the same server and side...
---
So I'm a bit thorn if I should reroll a PvP horde favoured server or just stick to it. I know shammys miss som real qol in classic that didn't come untill the burning crusade (where I mained resto shammy).
---
So I'm wondering if it's just nostalgia or that I actually want to play it at max lvl in classic.... :S
---
Eh why would saving up mats give you prio? You worried he wont farm the mats for a bis wep? That's something that should be stated in the guild rules or something. What logical person would farm HoR mats without being guarenteed the first eye drop? Kinda nuts.
---
Its not a 2019 thing though that's just how the honor system works. Back then the people who got rank 14 literally were playing 20 hours a day. Many of them were account sharing or being suspected of account sharing. There's a reason this system didn't last long.

do you play a druid just curious

Yeah they're actual garbage tier.
---
Jeff was the same though. He was hired on after bitching about EQ &amp; WoW on the forums. Ion was from Elitist Jerks and I've heard him talk about how classic was bad design and wouldn't work for future expansions because there were too many gimmicky items, but those gimmicky items are what makes classic PvP fun.
---
There is just not enough alliance maybe? Or is that not an obvious option when every pvp server is vastly horde dominated?
---
:( God damn it.
---
PvP -&gt; PvE is possible, but not the other way around.
---
I too am stuck between 130 Angerforge farm and AV farm. Glad someone else understands.
---
Have you consider getting a extra batt to use after u discharge one? Have one charging while you use the other.
---
Please to god be as excellent as Wc3 was in custom game modes, I would literally hate blizzard if they did something that hinders map development. Custom game modes was 99% of wc3.
---
I got to 13 in Vanilla - it took weeks of pretty much non-stop grinding in AV.  The final push I pretty much played 5 days straight with a couple of hours sleep each day.  And then I still didn't get to 14.  It was brutal.  Never again.
---
easy, kralnor
---
Jesus, nothing gets past you does it
---
I think they should merge servers instead transfers... 
---
The reason of privates are the making it a global servers instead 283837 different server and region locks.
---
I do play early morning in eu gmt+3 which actually best for wcoast or oceanic players game time. But its not allowing me to play it since my game is eu (retail sub) its frustrating that they force ppl to seperate like its 2000... man 20 years passed hello.

If alliance were to defend, like the horde is, your average AV would be 2-5 hours.
---
Loot Councel,   
---
1st week, loot goes to Mages, 2nd week loot goes to Warlocks, 3th week goes to mages etc etc etc.
---
I don't understand why there isn't a faction cap for servers in general let alone for transferring. Once the cap reaches a relatively even amount open it up for both factions until the cap is hit again and repeat. Maybe there is a problem with this method? But this seems pretty logical to me.
---
If playing 6-8 hours a day is hardcore for you, what about playing 16+ hours a day? You should know some activities in wow classic will demand even more.
---
Someone who hasn't even started yet, most likely wont be able to get 12-14 bracket even for one week no matter how hard he tried. I don't know what kind of servers you guys are playing, but on high population PVP server, getting to bracket 12-14 is 12-16 hours of PVP every single day.  
---
If you aim for rank 10, you should aim for something like bracket 7-8 at the beginning, slowly climbing towards bracket 10 when you get closer, then at the end go for \~11 bracket for few weeks as a final push.  
---
Also as a side note: first AV week was the \_easiest\_ week to rank up, \_not hardest\_. More low rank people = more slots at higher ranks.
---
I guess you're boycotting ranking too then lol
---
Horde players: GO TO RETAIL 
---
Alliance goes to retail 
---
Horde players: Why did Alliance players go to retail?
---
Not addressing the biggest issue which is faction inbalance
---
Every imbalanced pvp server will still create a bottleneck with wpvp one way or another. BWL attunement will be a shitshow, AQ gates will be shitshow (also could be the same on PVE servers with crashing though), world bosses are more of a problem on PVP servers for obvious reasons, etc. etc.
---
If it bothers you, better think about PVE server. Still, the direct answer to your question is yes, BGs have reduced wpvp to P1 values or so.
---
You can get a large capacity power bank with a USB output that will hold hours of charge. Just get a USB charging lead fornyour laptop and hook it up ti that
---
People who spend money on this are crazy.
---
Blizzard, keep milking, kill Classic even faster.
---
That's not olympus lol. Also check their honor.
---
WOULD YOU LIKE TO PLAY A NICE GAME OF CHESS?
---
It is actually a positive change for their money flow. More people will play as they can now leave whatever server with almost no player for their faction they are one. Because of BG's nobody needs faction balance anyway anymore.
---
Yes, add `/cast [@mouseover,helm,nodead] Renew` as the first line (and remove the first conditional on the other renew line since it doesn't do anything anymore).
---
Any off hands I can use as a lock that will get my crit chance up not using a spellstone?
---
&gt; You do nothing but play the game for 3 months in a very specific way. 12-18 hours a day.
---
Isn't it mostly just the last few weeks you need that kind of time?
---
This week was very easy to rank since pool size was inflated with pve players grinding exalted and others trying out BGs for fun.
---
https://youtu.be/RVQgBE_wFuA
---
Thats unfortunate m8.
---
I¬¥m guessing another way (and because they are very cheap nowadays)is a couple of 12000mah powerbanks probably, those will probb give a couple more hours of gameplay.
---
Any class can do the same thing, warriors can need on tanking gear, PVE dps gear and PvP gear. Rogues, Mages and Locks all need PvE and PvP sets to maximize, shit, healing paladins could go for a spell crit/MP5 set for mana efficiency, and a max HPS set. 
---
Part of my strategy for prepping my warrior for PvP was to roll tank to get easy prio on some items that are also good in PvP like the might bracers, ony neck etc.
---
As far as I recall I tried switching the orders of the SW:P and Renew parts without any effect, but I'll give it a shot again. Cheers.
---
If I roll 1-1000 there‚Äôs a chance of 1 in a 1000 that I‚Äôll hit 1. The median of my roll will be 500. So hitting 500, would mean your chance of hitting 1 is suddenly twice as big as mine.
---
* Main is pretty much only lacking 2/15 pieces of raid BIS. 1h 15 min 40 man MC runs, but mostly we do 4 hour runs in 20 man splits, ony in 15 man splits. 
---
* Alt just started raiding MC two weeks ago in PUGs. Most PUGs spend the same amount of time clearing with 40 as we do with 20, but they do clear it.
---
* Got Force Reactive disk and Hide of the wild crafted, epic mount on both chars. Also done some investments.. all in all I have made close to 5k gold since the beginning of the game. 
---
* PvP ranking is a hot mess I do not take part in, because I already "struggle" with balancing game and IRL. Got my AV exhalted and never stepping into a BG again.
---
I just hit lvl 35 with my Horde priest :) 
---
Everything is according to plan. 60 will hit in May or June.
---
Minmaxers and stupid idiots will be gone at that time and chew on other games, maybe gone back to Retail.
---
I guess BWL, AQ and Naxx will be out at that time and I will have fun with some guys who really have some passion and love for the game. Not for themself :)
---
Same question but with arcanite bars
---
I think I play even less active gaming time wise, AV rep is more like an exception since it was just released, just like any other new content. It's around 2h for MC, 40-45 mins for ony, other time I play AH which is afking near postbox or auction house. So yeah, not a lot.
---
This is adorable and hillarious and I love it. Reminds me of playing with my friends way back when. If you do decide to make more of these (please do) don't change anything stylistically, it all works brilliantly
---
Blizzard borked shit up as usual. I quit AV this morning after seeing that my 40 hours of grinding didn't even get me 1 rank up. And us Horde get to wait in 20 minute queues for most of the day so it's not worth the effort. You know who got rank up? The people queueing 16 hours every day and then stand AFK on the BG somewhere just getting free honor. Blizzard already killing the game with bad mechanics because nobody wants to spend 90% of their free time for literally no rewards.
---
Do it for the Exalted rep, and then just quit BGs before you get first class depression.
---
there is a vendor in org or Stormwind depending on which you play
---
&gt; I understand there's a lot of people in the anglosphere that are unilingual, but I think most non-anglosphere people are actually bilingual.
---
FTFY
---
This isn't how it works buddy. There are never "more or less spots" There are X spots and that X is always the number of people that obtain honor for that week.
---
Claims made:
---
- Vanilla servers used to always go down for roughly eight hours
---
- Some of the systems were built to run during outages
---
Both of these are facts, and based on two facts, someone is full is shit?
---
http://reddit.com/r/nothingeverhappens
---
Frostballs benifit more from spell dmg than from crit, so you should always prio raw spell dmg.
---
Coming later phases where we will be running fire spec, crit will be more favoured to feed ignites.
---
So you're just demonstrating what is theoretically possible, if there was some semblance of coordination and respect amongst fellow pvpers. I can respect that.
---
One of my OCE games I waited for 40 mins for the queue to pop, joined instantly and the starting cave was being farming by the Alliance. Lots of Chinese names aswell and it'd been going on for 2 hours already. Ridiculous.
---
Will it, though? Will it really?
---
REAL soon!
---
He'll still get a tonne of XP, even running with you alone. I know this as I've boosted my own chars, using a 2nd account. its a great way for boosts, but also get your friend a tonne of XP, cloth, greens and even blues. 
---
As a mage, you can pretty much clear the whole low level instances in 3-4 pulls. Tell him to stay at the entrance of the instance and then you go pull everything.  Also, he gets access to all the drops and blues (from WC/DM onwards), and this means when he is leveling solo at times without you, he has great gear for his level.
---
Probably time to turn off shadow form and get healing, if you are at all interested in winning!
---
Don't worry about the curve. I dinged 60 two weeks ago started doing dungeons got a few pre raid bis and then my guild took me 2 times to MC and I almost full tier. So dont panic if you think you are behind. Also bwl will drop next month or two and people will continue to raid MC and Ony besides BWL
---
11$
---
And nobody spoke against this. What they said is that if you are intending to roll outside your specc, you should make clear inb4. If a druid comes and says I'll tank but I will roll on healing piece you need, then I'll just leave the group/kick the druid, depending on whether I'm leader or not.
---
Come to Zandalar Tribe Horde. We have a wonderful server-wide community! Hit me up if you need a guild
---
"only"
---
Hmmm, I think I'm fine in rank3
---
A immovable object is the same as a unstoppable force. If a object is moving or not depends on the viewpoint of the observer.
---
And you yourself is mr.positive. Clearly.
---
And all warlocks suddenly can‚Äôt make it to raids every other week
---
the main purpose of int is to increase your mana pool. Which is often a tremendous advantage in PVP, and can make some boss fights easier in PvE.
---
It takes 59.5 int to equal 1% crit, and 1% crit is will be equal anywhere from 8 to 25, depending on your spec and spellpower. 8 being a frost mage with weak phase 1 gear and 25 being a fire mage with ~1000 spellpower from the craziest gear imaginable.
---
Dude its usual right here in Prague too.
---
We should define this once and for all. How about 4 ranks:
---
1. Casual  
---
2. Dedicated  
---
3. Hardcore  
---
4. No-life
---
Tfw the warrior was ready level 40 when you met.
---
#LevellingAsAWarriorTroubles
---
small indy company
---
The mines aren't. 
---
The items absolutely are. You can casually loot like 10-50 rep off a single corpse. 
---
Just need people to talk to the wing commanders and send them home. The turn-ins are mostly annoying since you need to click it N times. But you can get something like a thousand rep from turn-ins in a single BG.
---
Yep, finally got him. Spawned three times in a row and got the stuff I needed!
---
I work till 7am daily
---
its impossible to raid
---
finding a group for dungeons is a waste of time
---
but questing is amazing  ( on pvp server: sulfuras) noones there to kick my ass!
---
while i wouldn't exactly call it casual it is nowhere near nolife territory
---
Hey, I feel good about myself.   
---
Don't you, Mr.Stoner? Or that answer varies on before or after 4:20? lol
---
100% use DKP, you bid what you think an item is worth. Not had any drama at all, and been running MC &amp; Ony since 1st week in October.
---
There can still be drama in DKP guilds over loot; how your guild chooses to break up class priority, complaints about DKP bonuses for consumables, accusations of collusion, people accusing officers of benching or bumping to try and benefit their friends. That it's less prone to this kind of thing doesn't make it immune.
---
what activities exactly?
---
literally the only one that demands anything more than a few hours a day is pvp ranks
---
So what defines hardcore from nolifer then?
---
yeah the first two days we got stomped basically every match, now I lose maybe 1 in 20
---
Sure does. Are you German?
---
Do you use many other spells that aren't frost and do they scale well with spelldmg? Then go get the tarazanes. If not then get ice lord tome. Might as well get both since Icelord should be strictly better in pve.
---
Yeah, but which weeks?
---
Maybe the monkeys were telling 2 weeks after Naxx is cleared by alts.
---
Maybe you shouldn't have transfered to a dead server from the best one
---
Even so, 1.5 healers isn‚Äôt much good!
---
Devilsaur is going down on PvP servers because the world is no longer being farmed for honor like it was 2 weeks ago. The prices you are seeing now are probably the new normal price.
---
Stockade Pauldrons are not amazing in the first place, valor shoulders are totally fine when you factor in set bonuses and are better "balanced" between mitigation and threat anyway. Might shoulders from MC are better so a lot of people are over-geared for Stockade Pauldrons as well.
---
Nope.  
---
I do speak German tho.
---
The laptop screen brightness can chew through battery. Keep it as low as you can tolerate.
---
Appreciate your input! I do agree that I do enjoy higher satisfaction fights, so thanks!!
---
I was currently in bracket 11 last week. I farm honor every day from when I go home from work to midnight, sometimes more. Basically all my free time. Our top guy has double my honor. So ye its pretty hard.
---
Those would be a solid 7g in my server ROFL
---
Alliance on noggenfogger pls dont leave, i dont want a dead server :(
---
basically every mob in brd can drop the crumpled note.
---
&gt;I've seen some posts of you round here.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;Can't really explain it, but you just yield that negative vibe in every single word you write.  
---
&gt;Are you by any chance not that good looking with mediocre career and just angry at the world?
---
Excuse me what ?  
---
That braindead reply wasnt ment for me, i assume ?
---
Nerfed AV only came near end of vanilla..which is why Blizzard fucked up ranking system adding it already
---
It's Skeram, but most servers look like that anyway.
---
Slightly disingenuous, the assumption here I guess is that if you have been trying to rank up since honor system came out and you're not rank 10 yet then sure. If however you just started PvPing on release of BGs then no, not necessarily if you're willing to put in the hours to be standing No.1
---
Most people are going for rep. And winning is more fun too.. Lots of people know they dont have the time for high ranks, so honor is just a side bonus
---
Does anyone have a macro that turns helm display and or cape display on or off? I'm not looking for a toggle but an on and off switch kind of macro to use with my gearswap macro.
---
And inaccurate. 100% alliance?!
---
Wait really is this a thing? I totally gave up on raiding bc I work from 6om to 3pm. I never thought of this
---
But how long is the queue for wsg?
---
Ill try that then, thanks!
---
i mean it's all pretty subjective but you are only kidding yourself if you think 8 hours a day is not hardcore as fuck. 
---
people who are ranking to r11 or higher are all nolifing welfare/momfare babies
---
Some1 knows when faction change became a thing?
---
Honestly considering going alliance for faster ques
---
using jeff on ow is such a waste of talent and resource,but they need him up there to charm overwatch league investors (big corporations) that dump money into that boring money pit expecting it to be the new NBA or NHL
---
Give him both. He can take it.
---
blizzard plz don't let already horde dominated servers get more horde dominated...
---
I more or less lucked into it
---
As someone who suffers chronic sleep disruption and will play pretty much whenever, that's mostly just the way it is now that BGs are out at any time. The only time fights usually break out now are over heavy farm spots like volcano in Un'Goro or Satyrs in Azshara. Even that's not all the time.
---
I did have some Hunter deliberately train me from my own faction a few nights ago. I can't imagine being bored enough to risk getting a warning for that.
---
And this myth is... THUNDERFURY
---
I saw a lvl 60 paladin RPing as a Stormwind Guard recently. Anything is possible if you can wear all types of gear.
---
I just got exalted in AV and bought my two hander + epic mount. (Arms war) 
---
I'm broke af. 
---
The queues are 40 min long here in oceanic servers so I have plenty of time to farm around alterac valley. 
---
I tried these things but they all yielded too little gold for the effort: 
---
-Sm (all of them except gy) 
---
-wpl for runecloth 
---
- elementals in arathi 
---
- mining (10 mithril Ores are 50s) 
---
As I said it's 40 min queues. So if anyone has advice on how to get gold between AVs I'd love to hear it. 
---
Did all quests in wpl and EPL.
---
to litle to late, im done with wow. the entire pvp fiasco thx to the increase in server pop and all the isues that came with it. aka omw to the dungeon boyz il be there in 2h. Put me off for to long, now im no longer in the mood to play wow and im litrely just riding out my sub, in fact im gona skip tonight's mc raid.
---
Get both?  You'll need the tome for most pve encounters, but therazanes is great for PvP where fireblasts and arcane explosion is often used.  There's also the second encounter of BWL, Vaelastrasz the Corrupt, where as a mage your going to be using Arcane Missiles so all spell damage is more useful
---
he was literary elitist jerk,elitists know whats good for them,not the average player,there is a big chunk of wow players that are between casuals and hardcore players,that have been neglected since wotlk
---
yes exactly I never had a problem with that, and that's exactly what I mean, Os rolling shouldn't be treated as a mage rolling for plate
---
I am German.
---
o/
---
Don't draw attention to us!
---
Noggen for life
---
Why? It‚Äôs his life
---
What realm is this?
---
You're totally right, it's too late to do anything now. Blizzard knew this would happen and let it happen. Not only that, they also fumbled with the free transfers. If they had communicated from the start and done something, be it faction-specific queues or what, they at least could've tried to handle it instead of letting it be.
---
But your stance is that micromanaging it is not a real solution and letting whatever happen, happen. I'm used to better treatment from developers than running a potentially great project crash into a wall time and time again. I'd much rather they not have released Classic and just play on a private server at this point.
---
On alliance? About a minute. Don't have first hand experience on horde side but I hear it's about the same or a little shorter than AV.
---
I came from an 80:20 ally/horde server to 40:60 ally/horde.  
---
Playing the underdog is more fun. And I do contribute to balancing things out a bit.
---
Xfers came out late vanilla. So this isn't at all like Vanilla.
---
Mankrik 100%
---
‚ÄúI AM THE LAW GIVAHHHH‚Äù I seen that link and hoped it was what I thought. Did not disappoint.
---
Just more time basically. To the poin√æ of ignoring life :P
---
I think how many people rather be in a pvp server dominated by their faction is a sign that people aren't in pvp servers for the right reasons and should just play in PvE. Bigger reason is probably an ego thing or i guess calling it an insecurity thing would be more accurate. Smaller reason but still a big reason is how much most people follow streamers. Don't mean follow them to their servers but i mean try to imitate what they do.
---
Okay thanks for explaining üòÅ
---
Oh, okay, you call them nolifers. Okay, not a problem: how are you going to call people who play ~16 hours a day in order to get pvp ranks 11-12-13 or so?
---
bfa azerite procs are the most gimmick thing ever in wow,random procs that clutter the screen,smother the server and do absolutley nothing but add small tiny dps or hps or shield to the logs
---
That's because we are at work.
---
True. Using my 3500 sized pool example, if a single raid sized guild did this it would add 40*9 = 360 players to the pool. This happens to be just enough to push us from 11 rank 14s per week to 12. The effect is much greater the lower you go. There would be around hundred extra rank 6s and 7s per week.
---
If you break it down to the individual level, a single player increases the total number of standings in a bracket by between 0.17-0.48% up to rank ten. After that, and individual's effort becomes a rounding error and you need group effort to increase the number of standing spots.
---
Theres two entry points: one by the tower and another just a bit back from there behind the stabbles guy.
---
Then they should have no business in a guild. If they get all of their gear out of MC/Ony do they stop attending raids? If so they are aren‚Äôt helping anyone who assisted in them getting their gear and suck.
---
I like threads like this. Please, give up if you can't do 100k honor minimum a day. It makes it easiser for us pvpers.
---
It's pretty funny how the replies I've had range from "of course this doesn't happen, why would it?" to "this is totally already happening"
---
There's no difference between being outnumbered 2 to 3 vs being outnumbered 3 to 7? 2 to 3 is 50% more enemies than friends, 3 to 7 is more than twice as many enemies as friends
---
You forgot the people fishing.
---
Cannot believe anybody is taking this serious with such small sample sizes come on my dudes
---
Now that this is available,  I'd love to know if any of your guilds have AM raid times on US servers. I'd definitely transfer to be able to raid reliably
---
huh thats just how Org looks on high pop servers
---
Yeah I'm sure they're using the same systems and hardware as 15 years ago. I'll be sure to let you know you're wrong again next week
---
Does this allow players to transfer to some soft PvP BG ranks (PvE probably, or low pop) get Rank 10+ PvP rewards and than transfer back to PvP server with high pop?
---
I believe that the mark of any guild with decent loot council is transparency and open discussion with proper motivations if something seems unfair or sketchy - ideally you would not have such incidents to begin with, but I think there's bound to be some friction at some point.
---
That's what you get if a majority of the players really lack self-esteem and think they can only be cool dealing damage.
---
Yes they have rediculously low hp.
---
That feel when your 2019 PC can't handle a game released in 2004
---
Alliance were raiding more than Horde from what I saw. Never a day went by where there weren't a constant back and forth in Feralas
---
After being a new player to both, classic is just that much more enjoyable to level in. I feel like the world is actually there and a part of the experience. Everything in retail just feels like I‚Äôm walking to the next thing. They need a world refresh past cataclysm, because the changes they made somehow put ‚Äúworld ending threats‚Äù in leveling zones.
---
then come back to flamelash and make things even again! its been really lonely :( Druid Tiggi demands!
---
remember that alot of people went HAM for exalted with AV this first week, so ranking the following weeks might not be as tough as this first week.
---
Dang arcane missiles is in the game already? I really don't recall anyone using that üòÑ but if that's your spell load out then the answer is obvious.
---
Just go into WA options and change conditions.
---
I did that with some addons that I only want to use in AV or while in a raid group.
---
It's gambling its fun
---
Not at home to check, but couldn't you go to the LOAD section in the ones you found and click "In Combat" until it says Always?
---
2real4me
---
I DON'T THINK SO &gt;:D
---
thats what i had in mind
---
Instances only create a competition on price not on raw resources
---
Seen far too much of it, and it's an easy base to defend at that.
---
Love how everyone does this while the intelligent raiders end up with epics in every slot except weapon for almost no DKP.
---
Basically it's like playing the game when there's someone from your faction, except you don't have to put up with them talking shit about how you're stealing their mobs.
---
It can be annoying if you find yourself in a super crowded area, but for the most part in the vast majority of zones horde don't have the exact same quests, and where they do it's only an actual problem if there are enough horde that on a PVP server you'd still be unable to do the quest, because you'd be outnumbered and corpse camped anyway. 
---
There's very few quests where a single player killing the same mobs as you is an issue, and combat isn't the solution to seeing someone else doing the same quest as you. If you're the sort of person who repeatedly ambushes and kills a single opposing faction player because you're questing in the same area as them you're not saving yourself any time in doing so and you're actually just being a bit of a dick to someone trying to do the quest.
---
When you think Flamelash couldn't possibly get any worse...
---
After the release of BGs, the world PVP slaughter fest has really died down.
---
Got to level 31 as a Paladin, got bored, rerolled as a Druid and loving life. Level 25 and not in any rush.
---
Imagine devoting this much time and effort in a game for some loot that no one gives a fuck about in rl world...beyond sad.
---
You can but the best I've seen so far was a toggle. Which sucks if you want to have a macro to equip and show a certain helm. If you accidentally double click it or press it in combat the option will toggle.
---
Not at how right now but maybe later I can post the code for that one.
---
I feel for you.
---
Even on faerlina nobody cares about him. He plays during off hours. His name is never even mentioned
---
&gt; I guess I‚Äôm wrong but I was basing it off the guild I play with. And what made you think that was a valid basis for an assessment of the average time to level 60 for everyone? 
---
&gt; I hit 60 with a rogue on private and classic in 7 days and a few hours.
---
So you, a player that has leveled the same class on a private server, and therefore is pretty experienced in playing the class (relatively speaking), is the average wow player in Classic? That's really not what I've been experiencing in my playtime.
---
So in general, it doesn't matter to you if someone got r12 or r14 or what? Well, that's just plainly wrong, because you are expected to know there is a big difference in effort required to get these ranks, big enough to put them into completely different categories.
---
Were you supposed to reply to EthicalPiranha?
---
Rogue here. Just won Nightslayer pants. Currently using devilsaur, so will be breaking set bonus. Now looking to see what gloves to use and cant find much info. im thinking Cadav
---
This. Cuz all those guys have to keep it up, and they wont
---
stonespine eu, "yankos concrete company" on horde is legit! ask anyone ;)
---
But that logic continues until someone rolls a one. After he rolls, you have twice the likelihood of hitting a one (using median value again). 
---
However, you have always made either the same number, or one more, of rolls as your opponent. Therefore making you SLIGHTLY more likely to lose.
---
Video games where the weak get power and trip in this case literally.
---
Yeah I almost puked when our co-leader druid was bragging about how equipped he already is and how he hopes we find enough healers "so he can also equip his hunter".
---
The day he starts doing this I'll boycott.
---
Alliance, for the love of god, kill the Lieutenants, your bonus honor is really painful to watch.
---
I actually never played current retail. I started in Vanilla and quit after Cata. Came back for Classic. Maybe I just got lucky with the server I picked back then, but wPVP was never this bad when I used to play.
---
Sure a double team here and there, but I never had to literally stop playing because I couldn‚Äôt get anything done from the ganking.
---
Premade WSG farming is already outpacing AV, especially for alliance considering the low winrate and inability to kill commanders.
---
you as a specialized class with only one set will largely outperform a hybrid, unless he's playing his class the way it is supposed to be played and switching between roles. for example why would any sane person bring cats to a raid with all the rogues out there?
---
Got to fill them coffers!!!
---
That's honored. Revered and Exalted doesn't reduce prices beyond the 10% from honored.
---
To be fair, it's not like you're helping your team win.
---
What makes you think I didn't know that? I commented upon a gear level that is readily available in our current phase and wasn't using an estimate of being either in full Naxx gear, nor in full leveling greens without +sp. But it seems your eagerness to put me down (since I've triggered you for some reason by simply writing logic) blinded you from thinking clearly. At least I hope that's the excuse for you making such a pathetic (and irrelevant, mind you) reply to my comment
---
Same! I was thinking between pyrewood village and mirage raceway.
---
Over a year after preorders opened oof.
---
I originally did my Rank 14 grind back in Vanilla on Dark Iron and did a grand majority of the climb prior to when Cross Realm was released. I was in a PvP guild at the time that would do a lot of WSG premades at night. The social aspect of grouping up with friends and fighting other known players on the Alliance side was what drew me in the most.
---
Queues during the daytime would be anywhere from 1-2 hours long since not many folks were on during those hours. You'd end up spending more time just finding people to gank while you were waiting for queues so it was more efficient. Even then, you only needed to put at most 6-8 hours of real effort a day for that climb. And this is with some time to queue in Undercity and go pick flowers in EPL for some cash in between.
---
When Cross Realm occurred, that changed entirely. I was already at the end of Rank 12 into Rank 13 by that point and was at the home stretch and spent almost a month alone at that rank just being in AV for 16 hours a day to finish the climb. 
---
[Pictured was my final weeks of honor.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/608727249994121216/654539073234403361/leosrank14yay.jpg) 
---
I hated the climb at that point. It was no longer fun. I couldn't group with my friends to do AV (unless we got lucky with a mod we used). I even warned people in my current guild that this would occur after experiencing it myself. 
---
The honor system was **not** designed for cross realm play.
---
Long shot- any Horde guilds on Faerlina selling ancient leaf on Tuesday?
---
So, we can start with nolifer then, since that would be R14 players, investing a required effort of 20 hours per day or even more, whatever not makes them banned.
---
R14 and R11-13 players are big big big difference, but R11+ still is expected to require 16 hours daily or so. To me, that's pretty hardcore.
---
Maybe in current environment even R10 is going to be hardcore, but that's still around 10 hours a day.
---
Players doing 6-8 are dedicated then and 4 or less is casual, fits the description pretty much.
---
Actual stormpike rep or only dwarven rep etc? Because I do not care for honor, I care for getting exalted. Can you loot stuff from the player corpses that give rep? Combining rep gain with actual PvP is still kinda fun.
---
The logic only apply on the two first rolls. The only advantage is rolling 1-1000, as that‚Äôs the best conditions throughout the game. First roll is basically a ‚Äúfree roll‚Äù given the chance of hitting a 1 compared to the rest of the rolls.
---
How cute. You read how alliance once successfully boycotted AV until blizzard moved the horde spawn and are trying that here.
---
BfA was an outlier. Everything else EXCEPT for BfA was released in a really polished state. Granted, BfA was their latest release but I wouldn't announce a change of course because of one single occurance...
---
What addon do you use?
---
I've been wondering the same thing.  I stopped levelling my Warlock around that level but I kinda want to go back.
---
You either have to do this for a living or be heavily and I mean heavily addicted. I got to 40 in classic and realized I don't want to waste time on a 15 year old game where skill doesn't matter. This was said when vanilla was still current but time investment&gt;skill every time in classic/vanilla it's a game designed for addicts who spend half their day playing it.
---
Ya, there was definitely fight in the Alliance on Mograine. Also had good fights by Dire Maul. It didnt generally collapse except in areas like BS/SG/BRM where the Horde numbers were largely insurmountable 99% of the time.
---
No, They are all just varying degress of nolifing welfare/momfare babies. They are easily lumped together
---
Too little too late
---
Actually many guilds are going to break after things like being blocked for the entire raid by failing to kill the 2nd boss, suffering to complete the suppression room, beating chromaggus, and realizing far too late that they don‚Äôt have enough Onyxia scales for Nefarian.
---
BWL difficult is far superior than MC on the difficulty scale.
---
I want everyone to remember, "you think you do, but dont"
---
yay, much easier to sell characters now  
---
win-win i guess?  
---
classic kinda died down tbh.
---
I didn't know that, thank. That's a cool feature.
---
Except the graphics are uglier than on the orginals.
---
Meta content creation for streaming content creators
---
Never has a more insufferable sentence been written.
---
I have a 54 undead priest, 48 paladin, 48 hunter, and 42 druid.(no 60 yet)
---
I basically sacked the priest and have settled on just the paladin and hunter for now. I adore my druid, especially solo play but I don't have the time.
---
If you are going to grind honor, don't waste your time on farming DM. Just make sure you won't burn out grinding.
---
&gt;It is certainly better to self cast with a hotkey rather than relying on the "have nothing targeted" condition for the exact reason you mentioned. 
---
You are probably right, it should be safer overall. But if reconfiguring the macro in the way above works to prioritize my mouseover Renew over SW:P with an enemy targeted, that should at least make it more manageable. I tried looking up was to disable the automatic targeting upon getting attacked, but came out empty handed. Seems like it's really hardwired into the combat system.
---
As long as you communicate it in advance, "Btw, I'm tanking here, but I main spec as a healer in raids, so I'll be rolling on healing items I need" they can decide on what they want to do about that, do they want to go with you, or do you need to find a new tank or healer. 
---
Same thing I did after I'd finished gearing my warrior for tanking in dungeons. I kept tanking dungeons to help guildmates and friends get some gear, but was open with the fact that since I didn't need any gear for my main spec in said dungeons, I would be rolling on fury gear. 
---
The thing people have a problem with are the "low-key" druids who may come in as a tank or healer, but roll on gear for every spec without telling anyone about it.
---
Ohh yeah I'm sitting on about 16 stacks or so currently.
---
can't actually think of anything i would rather watch less
---
Rank 7 FTW then /camp
---
You have to no life hard to get past R10 and join your server mafia to wait in line for your chance at the higher ranks.
---
Wpl for rune cloth and crusader enchant sounds like a decent option. Or try mining thorium in epl.
---
what race are you? are you using daggers..?
---
You can't even have two chars on the same server for different factions so all of these people saying they are logging their horde alts are just lying. Noone fucking buys two accounts just do to that
---
While I understand where you are coming from. Anyone who owns wow can play wow classic as long as they are subbed 
---
So technically if you own wow you can play it's remaster without buying it again.
---
Obviously wc3 does not have a sub. I get it. :)
---
This is how we manage ours, but lately we're having issues with the guild leadership vetoing DKP bids of DPS warriors in favour of other classes "because that's a rogue/ret pally/anythingbutyou item". It's led to our DPS warriors having a massive amount of DKP and being unable to spend it, which is made worse by WEEKLY DKP decay. One of our warriors has so much DKP that the 10% weekly decay is basically half of what he what he gets for attending MC.
---
Maybe try it here: https://www.reddit.com/r/FaerlinaPvP/
---
Or the discord, the server is in the sticky of that sub.
---
We let people bring alts to our second raid group (we run 2 40 man) OR if we have a lower played class that might cause loot rot we let someone come on that class so we don‚Äôt DE stuff. For instance, we have had a LOT of T2 shaman helms drop. All 9 resto shaman have it between both raids. We let people do Ony on an alt if they want so it doesn‚Äôt go to waste.  
---
But if someone says ‚ÄúI got mine, good luck everyone, see you at BWL!‚Äù They should be kicked out of the guild because they don‚Äôt consider anyone else as valuable.
---
He's been in since phase 1. I haven't seen him myself, but a friend had him spawn once, and got the belt from him. Can 100% confirm he had it too.
---
Hell yeah time to collect our 15 cents
---
Wat.. You know, like DM E? 
---
Vendor greys add money to the net gold supply out of thin air as well.
---
What are you even trying to say here
---
No there isn't. Show me a mod that changes the LE engine to 64-bit and therefore tremendously improves the stability of the game with tons of mods...
---
AFK Defense team checking in
---
3/4ths of your vid is just you talking about your gear.
---
The rest of it is you pretty much one-shotting enemies, which doesn't exactly show great skill.
---
the same way you keep the fury warriors, rogues and hunters happy? What about paladins, priests and druids for healing items? Such a dumb question
---
It depends how a guild uses the dkp system, some will use bids others use fixed dkp price, wich is the case of my guild. 200 dkp per item, no bids, goes to who ever has the most dkp, drama free.
---
I'm solo farming ZFGY at level 60 and making 50-60 gold per. hour. It's really consistent farming compared to the options other classes have.
---
I underestimated how triggered wow reddit kids would get over saying his name lol. I don‚Äôt even like Assmongold. I was just giving them the reason for why there‚Äôs been a massive jump in kids in all the trade cities yelling ‚Äúwho wants to death roll‚Äù in the last week.
---
sounds like its not really DKP is it, its a loot council with a DKP system bolted on so ppl dont think its a loot council
---
time to find a new guild, huh?
---
I had a 33 warrior, 23 priest, 22 mage, 16 shaman, 13 rogue, and a 27 warlock. I finally settled on the warrior, currently level 40 now :/
---
sikilar to how halfway to 99 is 92 ? :D
---
Thats kinda stupid imo, if mageblade drops, just let them roll the first time, 1mage vs 1wl
---
if mage wins, first goes to the mages, next to the wls, next to the mages.
---
Simple clause "Attendance at the previous weeks raid is required to be eligible for mageblade"
---
Anyone who did that would get kicked from any serious raiding guild anyway
---
I‚Äôm currently farming elementals peacefully side by side with the other faction. I‚Äôm full raid spec so I basically die if you right click me, but so far I‚Äôve been going at it for three days and haven‚Äôt been killed yet.  So I think it should be okay.
---
For most cases it would take 1 guy to defend it. 1. But nobody's ever there.
---
That was a one-time deal when the SE was released. Anyone who owned the whole package of LE got SE for free. Maybe because SE wasn't much of an remaster. It added a few graphical effects, but the main thing was the transition to 64-bit engine which greatly improved stability with large mod load orders.  
---
Still many companies would sell even this upgrade as a new game to existing playerbase. This shows that Bethesda CAN be a good guy (despite the narrative).
---
Can we do account to account yet ?
---
Short answer: No
---
Long answer: https://classic.wowhead.com/items/class:9/slot:23?filter=49;2;1
---
The only options are from ZG, AQ and Naxx, as well as the T0.5 quest in Stratholme, and all of these are not in the game yet.
---
Back then an account cost 100 dollars plus 15 a month. Now it'a just 15/month.
---
As someone in a DKP guild, it really sucks watching people pass up upgrades in the chances that one day you'll get the weapon you want. You're basically limiting the raids power because you personally want specific loot. In a raid with 40 people, it's an awful mind set, and quickly making the more dedicated people in my guild hate DKP.
---
Earthshaker has looked lile this ever evening for months and it was one of the new released servers. It's now at high and we had queues with AV release.
---
i love long games.
---
So your rush strategy no longer work and your solution is to boycott? What a joke.  
---
Alliance can kill Drek faster even if horde use this backdoor. Only reason why you losing is your nonexistent defense staling.  
---
Horde knows very well you don't need to brake enemy push, you just need to buy enough time so your push can finish it.
---
This is one of the more useful suggestions, just tweak the alliance racials. It won't make people reroll, but it could influence new players to roll alliance.
---
For ref, the ‚Äúavg‚Äù player got about 190-200k in honor on my server. 
---
This got most people rank 3. 
---
This also got most people exalted in AV. 
---
From talking to most folks, they are done with AV other than maybe 1-2 games for fun a week. 
---
The avg honor will drop and the folks getting 90-110k will be the new norm. As long as you get your 25HK and close to the faction/server honor norm your going to rank up. Slowly but you will rank up. Come mid Jan, folks will be done with BGs and you will have more casual players or pre-maids going on.
---
Hold for much much longer. Lotus prices will peak during late AQ/early Naxx when people actually consume them en masse and the large stockpiles start to dry up. BWL release will NOT increase the price of Lotuses, if anything it will go down as people are competing to sell off.
---
That's a good question - I believe they share a cooldown, check out [this source](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-consumables-list-for-each-class#blasted-lands-buffs). Playing healer, so only ever been interested in the +Intellect version and haven't tested any stacking after reading that.
---
Sounds like you either leave potential upgrades to the vendor or hand them out for free cause no one "wanted" them. If you at least bidding for the the guy doing the responsible thing and picking up the small upgrades would catch up on dps when all the morons blow all their dps on weapons and toep.
---
It doesnt matter really, people will be leveling characters even 1 year from now and people will still clear MC, the difference will be that there will be more raids available.  
---
For me it was getting very dull to do the same raid every week and I it was no longer fun for me to log on my rogue and pvp is not something I am interested since I did nothing but pvp from TBC to WoTLK.  
---
So I made a gnome mage on a different server and I am having a blast. Do what is fun for you.
---
Not as good, no, but if the open world wasn't an option you'd find plenty enough in dungeons and MC to sustain the server
---
You want sensible players, on WoW, in 2019?
---
...
---
Good luck.
---
Does the Night Dragon's Breath from felwood spawn depending on time of day?  
---
Been chasing around for hours trying to find them for my libram, the only thing i find is windblossom. Looked up cords on wowhead but it's completely empty at the 4 locations where it's supposed to spawn.
---
It's achievable. Quite hard if you have a a life though.
---
Anything higher than 8 is nearly unachievable with a life. 
---
To illustrate, I did the AV Exalted grind this week to profit from the low queue times. I ended up in bracket 9 ('=would hit rank 9 in about 3 months if playing at this rate').
---
But there's no fucking way I'm going to spend 30 hours a week in AV for 3 months though :)
---
Grats on 60. As a fellow priest I have no idea how your skillbar is setup, but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd say the same about my spell placements.
---
b-b-but what about playing because you want to have *fun*?
---
Ugh, only 1 rep per turnin though....that's just a couple of dozen rep over the course of an AV :(
---
Do notice that capturing a mine is 12xp and capping towers yield 25rep. I'd rather see rep gain like that increase a bit and make drek worth way less so people are inclined to do other stuff instead of zerg and lose.
---
That is true.
---
Most people just use programs that let their keybinds go to all windows, then set up macros that only have keybinds on the other account. For example, just need like 3 macros, one for follow, one for heal, one for renew, and bind them to 4 5 6 but don't bind 4 5 6 to anything on your main account.
---
Aaah that makes sense, my bad :D
---
I know, I know - but one can alwayd dream, right? 
---
Our guild seems to have a very good ratio of sane-to-others, so I'd say there is hope - if only a fool's hope.
---
Wow census is going to be more accurate because it doesn't have any biases in the data. It shows you the people online at the time regardless of what they are doing, so the more people using it at various times, the better its data gets. 
---
Ironforge assumes that players are of equal skill on both sides. But if, for example, 10% of one side and 15% o the other side were doing raids, it would skew the data.
---
Yea i didnt realized you are aussie :D
---
Lies.. There are around 200 at night time.. I play there.
---
Open the Honor tab in your character. Shows what rank and % your at.
---
You can activate one BL Buff, logg out and activate a sccond BL Buff. Logging out resets the CD.
---
Can't tell if you're trolling or not...
---
no
---
Horde side it's fairly likely that premade WSG and AB are the best honor farms. AV will have 50 minute queue times in a week.
---
The server IS dead.. Not THAT dead tho.
---
My guild (Horde) is considering moving to another realm since Blizz wont fix it.
---
What level are you?  Its harder for lower levels to rank up.
---
You probably have a life. Don't feel bad.
---
WITNESSED!
---
Not in PvP. Weapon skill is almost meaningless in PvP.
---
Is that so? Sounds like a bug, but that's great information to have for speedruns or tryhard progress raids. Very cool indeed!
---
why not the spirit one?
---
The running distance is only 1 advantage. How about the fact that alliance base is way stronger than the horde one?
---
It's 300k honor for Exalted ( did it, got about 315k ) if you do it right ( = PvE )
---
Funny in my raid we are only 3 melees but 10 mages.
---
Playing Shaman and always casting. It's mp5 all the way for me.
---
Running distance and way better base to mention a few.
---
You can't engage in these conversations with the public, your mind will melt
---
4 hours a day is obviously above casual. The average person has an 8 hour a day job, and between getting ready, commutting both ways, you can round that up at least a 9 hour or even 10 hour part of your day. Yes... I know you all "work from home for 2 hours a day", you don't count. This player base is older now so we can conservatively say people are sleeping 6-8 hours a day (if they're not hardcore, because that's what I'm literally proving to you right now, so no one can argue). We're now at the 16-18 hour mark with work, sleep, getting ready in the morning, and commute...and you're going to tell me a CASUAL player spends 50%+ of their waking free time on world of Warcraft daily. Ok...
---
Then you better go catch it!
---
I know right? Goldthorn is a minimum of 5 g a stack. Usually closer to 6 or 7 on my server
---
WPvP is all but non existent now.
---
You're not going to be farmed for honor any more, but I would like to stress that if you can see yourself getting frustrated by being killed over and over by other players then please save yourself some grief and roll PvE
---
Spinal is pretty good for orcs. Also why would you prioritize anything for enhancement shamans? They're absolutely not necessary.
---
Interesting, I ended up in 9 ( horde side. Are you Alliance? Very different experiences )
---
What about raids? Casual players can reliably clear MC every week, if we're not giving them the best gear, shouldn't we make the raids harder as well?
---
Somebody is triggered. Please put OJ Mayo into Google
---
... how ? where?
---
Funny thing, if I was to realm transfer, it would be to a realm with less tryhards. I have no issue with competent, skilled, tryhards. My issue is with the "terribad-tryhards" I.E the mage who has to get a mageblade because it's his BIS, but barely breaks 100 dps in pre-raid bis.
---
Remember that this, just like with the server queue times, will pass. BGs are new and everyone and their brother is chaining the shit out of them. Give it a few months when everyone is exalted and new raids are coming and rank 10 wont be all that unachievable.
---
I think it does
---
Solid counter argument, dumbass.
---
Weren't the models outsourced to an Asian company?
---
Im so glad i got exalted the second day. What a shit show it is now. Have fun with your "authentic" experience. Haha.
---
Yes?
---
Yeah fuck stormwind....
---
I needed arrows from IF and that SoB done ran out on me! ü§£
---
Not for horde with 15+ min wait times.
---
Wish you were on our server friend! (
---
We‚Äôve been gathering humans to raid in the mornings 8-10. (Incendius)
---
Remember when Bliz convinced everyone to use layering because of "server health, identity and longevity?" And then they came out with this ASAP with virtually no limitations? Because at all costs we were supposed to fear server merges because of how "damaging they are to communities." Shills have any defense for this?
---
You're wrong but I'm not sure about exactly what. You might wanna read this and be less wrong: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eblrp0/honor_ranking_realistic_expectations_week_6_update/
---
You can't balance the factions on every server when the overall population is unbalanced.
---
Holy moly, sensitive much? :D :D
---
That's about what I did last week and I was standing ~650 on my server with 250k honor.
---
I went from like 94% rank 5 to 25% into rank 6 so hardly moved at all.
---
I was mostly just farming to exalted in AV.  I thought about trying for rank 11 but with how many people are PvPing it doesn't seem possible for people with jobs.
---
Try bartender instead. Very close to dominos.
---
Yeah it's just simple logic why wow gambling become a little more popular.
---
BFA launch be like
---
Honor kill counter i think its called
---
Unstoppable Force is the best weapon avialable outside of raids and R14. Get it and use it.
---
Spinal Reaper isn't even a big upgrade, due to the much worse speed (unless you are orc, then it's a massive upgrade for pve), but the only shaman useable weapons, which are truly large upgrades over unstoppable force are Severance, Sulfuras, Dark Edge and Might of Menethil (in that order). The 7x dps 2h weapons you can use generally have bad speed and weak stats, which severly reduces their dps advantage.
---
Back in the day an extra 300 ping didn't mean much when everyone had a ping in the thousands
---
Not online right now, i'm at work.. i'll ask for guildies online.
---
What do you mean? Do you think that you wont pve and therefore the pvp gear you get from ranks and and rep isnt good enough or that when you do pve, you wont get good gear bc priority will go to rogues and warriors?
---
I first tried Grid2, it took some time to set it up, I think it's realy cool because you can modify it as you want but it makes it a little time intense the first time. After that i tried  Aptechka and it's really nice. It looks like Grid and has all it's features as far as I noticed but it's already set up so it make life much easier when you install it for the firt time. Also I'm usin clique, I have a lot of buttons on my mouse and it makes healing (and moving in between) much faster. I think this will work for me now
---
Now u have to be his personal healer for the rest of ur life. Enjoy
---
I'm glad you had this experience, but keep in mind that there are assholes everywhere, not only in retail. It may seem like retail is a toxic game but I hope you will never have to deal with the classic elitists.
---
purposely aggro mobs and then kite them into players and then feign death, if you do it right they aggro onto the player  
---
considered griefing if done to the same faction, unsure if considered griefing if done to enemy
---
Let me guess, "nolifers++" for R14 then?
---
Showed him a rocky montage.
---
Que times and more competition, basically it is harder to rank on the majority side
---
wtf are you talking about. int does not stack with AI. did you even try???
---
I like firemaw as alliance. :)
---
I've heard there are even boomkins there. If they allow that, what else?!?
---
Fine, I'll spell it out. The guys name is "sowed" and was talking about giving blowjobs for reputation. Sowed can be interpreted as "turned into a bitch/slut‚Äù. So someone who was turned into a slut was talking about slutty activities. There.
---
Whitemane Alliance - Went straight through Blackrock Mountain, several Horde ran by without acknowledgment. Have quested in Tanaris, Felwood, Un Goro, Searing Gorge and Azshara without significant trouble.
---
Substantial difference since BGs were released.
---
As a tank/rogue leader in my guild, I like to speedrun my warlocks through Scholomance whenever I can in hopes I can get the Headmasters Charge to drop while searching for a Cadaverous chest for another rogue or pattern of Robe of the Archmage for the guild bank. It‚Äôs not the most effective, but we actually have had the Staff drop once so far! And you keep up the morale &amp; make some decent money in the process. Fastest speed run we have is 28 minutes.
---
Come to stalagg lol
---
The sad thing is that it will be the best game Blizzard has launched in 16 years
---
East in terms of in the world East or Na East?
---
If alliance gets insta quques they will basically need mote honor to hit r14 than horde who queue once per 10 minutes. RP is not about how much honor you have its about how much honor you have comparing to othersin your faction.
---
The goal isn't to fill a role, it's to complete the dungeon. e.g.: tank on garr, sulfuron, domo, some trash; decurse/heal on luci, shazz, rag, some other trash. etc.
---
Us East, or North American East is what I mean.
---
There was a (reddit) community survey a little over a month ago that showed something like 20% of players had yet to reach lvl 60 and 15% yet to reach 50.
---
(I pulled these numbers from memory so don't take it as gospel)
---
Me too. I think judgment is going to die
---
Lol. The backdoor is the least of aliance problem. Is the head start horde gets. They get to belinda before the aliance can
---
Alright, good you found a working solution :) play around with it a bit until it feels right. Also, as you approach your mid 50's, do not forget to download HealComm so you (and other healers in your raid) see every incoming heal in order to prevent 2-3 people healing the same target by accident, causing 2 out of 3 heals to do nothing but overheal and waste mana. And slap up a screenshot of your UI when you're happy with it!
---
*depression noises*come join us over on eu we have less ddos and more cookies
---
Oh okay. Duh. Thank you!
---
Pyrewood is best alliance realm in EU
---
You get excellent xp in dungeons with a couple other players the same level. We aimed for 60-120 per kill avg and moved on if it dropped below 50xp. We did deadmines, stocks, sfk, sm, ulda, zf. 
---
Yes, he‚Äôll get a lot more without the boost, but he won‚Äôt be able to do the dungeon 5x an hour.
---
Crown of pork is where I lost it.
---
That was one I had in mind as I started on stalagg but I was told they pretty heavily outnumber alliance similar to how heartseeker is for alliance vs horde. I‚Äôm just concerned world pvp might be very one sided.
---
I mean I think most people assume resto shamans will roll on healer gear. 
---
Some classic projection there, you whining about imagined whining on my part.
---
If transferring to Incendius and looking for a Core raiding guild on Horde side, message me in game or on here, @Garycoleman (&lt;- in game)
---
Still Alliance wins the rush games. I'm as surprised as you oO
---
It's not a backdoor, it's a terrain exploit.
---
If that were the intent then measures would be taken to control faction/server choice for sources and destinations. This is just a free for all
---
There no direct conversion. 
---
Intelect gives crit and crit has different DPS values depending on your spell power. 
---
That said its almost alway better to go for + frost spell dmg. 60 int = 1% crit, its garbage stat DPS wise.
---
Those days are long gone.
---
Yea but since bgs wpvp has been mostly non existent, hopefully with xfers finally out people will come here since the alli guilds here are amazing.
---
I guess you guys just join guilds cos they are doing raids and have a lot of people, then constantly paranoid about loot drama. We are a very tight group of single core raid, and what part of "I shouldn't" don't you understand? Hell I'm not even gm and I think we shouldn't waste of a minor upgrade, and what if it drops and day after I get unstoppable and throw crusader on it? You think I would feel good getting spinal?
---
Needs to be on two different accounts but you can have both on the same battle net account.
---
If no other option was available people would still just gold-farm over farming elemental fires with an inefficient farm-route.
---
Diablo 3 was hot garbage when it released. Thankfully they turned that around.
---
Minority side doesn't nearly the same issues anymore, since wPvP was once again minimized after BGs released. Tamp5 covered majority drawbacks.
---
So you are saying he showed him how to beat meat in an isolated shed somewhere?  I could see how that would warrant a warning from somebody
---
If that was possible everyone and there mother would be doing it. 
---
No. Can you imagine if you could gear your own twinks or alts? Get some friends bud ;)
---
The other day I saw some guys playing a game of ‚ÄúRevenge of the N*****s‚Äù so I know nothing has changed
---
40 Silver Dreamfoils...im wet now.
---
lol
---
That's not how altoholism works...
---
For those of you looking for actual numbers on how this stuff calculates and what it might take to become r14, I did some of the math and used last week as a basis for what might be possible if I did nothing but grind honor.
---
I was able to pull in around 600k honor last week while still working and taking care of stuff around the house like normal.
---
This put me at #34 on the server.
---
This got me around 11650 rank points.
---
I started at rank 3 65% and became rank 5 at 65%.
---
The math to get me to r13 means I would have to repeat this until the end of February.
---
To get to r14 would require at least 1 million+ honor in a week.
---
The rough max achievable honor per day by those grinding incredibly hard for 18-20 hours straight is around 200-250k per day. If anyone has this much free time they will beat you no matter what if you have a job or other real life obligations.
---
After confirming all my calculations for ranked advancement were spot on accurate, I remembered everything I hated about vanilla.
---
Its so sad to me that there are so many #nochangers out there, because wow classic plus would have been an amazing experience.
---
It does not matter if someone plays 14 hours or 18hours a day, both cases are in nolifing welfare/momfare babies territory. 
---
Sorry but it sounds like you need to face the truth that wasting your life on a silly game is going to lead you nowhere but disappointment in 1-5 years
---
is this satire?
---
That is at the end of 2019. Lol. Kinda.
---
We really should have came up with a unofficial 3rd shift server so we could raid lol
---
I have a full-time job &amp; fianc√©, so realistically I get 3-4 hours a day maximum. And I can‚Äôt play everyday either. That said I‚Äôm at 60 on my rogue main with 5 pieces of Nightslayer &amp; have bearing down on 60 on my warlock Alt.
---
What... That wasn't even a negative response.
---
If you don't like getting ganked get good. Don't blame the game designers for being terrible, and you totally abandonded a group. And have you considered playing on a non pvp sever? Blizz already did fix it for ya mate
---
Yeah Activision can suck my dick right off my body if they think they are getting 25 bucks from me to fix their lack of giving a single fuck about this product. LOL
---
Wowclassicpopulation has recorded over million active characters in the last 14 days.
---
37% of those are level 60. Now how many of those were alts? I personally have 5 alts below level 60. Tough to give anything else than rough estimates but I would say that it's safe to say that "almost everyone" who still play are level 60.
---
To answer OP's question the progression curve right now should most definitely be MC and Onyxia on farm. My guild that is pretty casual did last week 17-man Onyxia and 23 man Molten core (Split runs). We even took some lvl 58's to our runs.
---
Bottom line is that vast majority of players are level 60 and given the easiness of current raid content anyone should be able to participate in MC and Onyxia even if freshly dinged.
---
Well, sorry to disappoint, most people tend to call them hardcore without some artificial terms only you use.
---
You really don't lose much in Fury Prot in terms of mitigation. And full T1 for your MT is an issue of weeks - it's been months since Classic was out. Even the most casual of guilds has their raid tanks in full Might by now.
---
Deep prot basically only gives you Shield Slam and Shield Wall of any real relevance in raids. That's worthless compared to letting your DPS go all out.
---
The API required to build this website is not available to the public.
---
I dinged 60 in the same spot last night. Gratz :)
---
334, to be exact. But you can just level an alt to level 15, to one WSG and you're on the board. If everyone does that, you can still get R14.
---
You can't transfer from pvp to pve.
---
No like full melee surv hunter
---
At this point you can transfer without any problems to almost all servers.Hence, you can try PVP first and if it doesn‚Äôt feel right transfer to PVE.
---
I feel you. On my mage I also rarely kill people when I don't fight back. This game sux.
---
Buy the devilsaur legs, they're much better than both options.
---
Oh lol, i mean you could, but you‚Äôd probably be just as good as a ret paladin
---
That's completely untrue. It matters a lot if it is suddenly very hard to find dungeon and/or raid groups, for instance. No one is talking about PvP activity exclusively.
---
I don't even play nor follow world of warcraft as much but I live for posts like these. I just wish I played it back when it was still in the OG states. You guys seem so indulged in the nostalgia, friends and memories that you've made that it does put a smile on my face.
---
I also use flash heal rank 4 I believe. It's great for topping off clothies and rogues. Especially on tight situations where you cant sit for 3 years casting heal.
---
&gt;Failing to kill the 2nd boss, 
---
This boss will be laughable. The fight is 98% preparation and that preparation is all about just having today's known pre-raid BIS (don't even need upgrades from MC).
---
Reason he was known as the "guild killer" back in the day was because he serves as a DPS race/test.. Back then the meta for tanking was to stack 440 defense at literally the cost of anything else making tanks shit at holding aggro so ... Also the MT needs to swap to a faster weapon to utilize the fact that he can spam Heroic strike every hit.. this is super easy... 
---
What else is there?? oohh yeah, the mechanic from Baron Geddon witch is arguably one of the easiest raid bosses ever.
---
&gt;suffering to complete the suppression room
---
Suppression room is a suffering, not actually hard. The lava trash packs between garr and solfuron are also horrible and can easily wipe an inexperienced raid, but I have never heard of someone stopping the raid because of said trash... Bring a repairbot.
---
&gt;beating chromaggus, 
---
Decurseing is not hard.
---
&gt;and realizing far too late that they don‚Äôt have enough Onyxia scales for Nefarian.
---
True, a lot of guilds will stop here, but this can't be fixxed with a black lotus. Also, it is not a big deal, the guilds that don't come prepared with cloaks will do the same as the guilds that could not downse runes in MC.. clear as many bosses as they can this weeks reset, then come back ready for the next.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any horde camps/quest hubs in darkshire. 
---
But it's very close to Grom'Gol camp in STV, that's directly tied to zeppelin from Orgrimmar. So for Horde player to reach Duskwood is very fast.  
---
And guy on top did a mistake - Darkshore is Alliance zone, but Duskwood is contested.
---
So... You're saying that lord of the rings and star wars aren't in the same universe?  
---
Poppycock.  Next you'll be telling me that Harry potter and Gandalf never met.
---
What's a battlegroup?
---
I love revenge stories. One of my guildies had to kill water elementals for a quest and tried teaming up with someone also doing it, to help speed up kill times. Other guy responded like an asshole and went out of his way tag mobs right b4 my guildie could...
---
He fucked up when he decided to be a dick to a warlock.... while farming elementals. Let‚Äôs just say he didn‚Äôt get to kill any elementals again after that, as they all seem to have mysteriously been banished to another realm.
---
ok boomer.
---
I think it has like a 30 min to 1 hour cooldown or something.
---
If the 10 that stay back keep the relief hut it‚Äôs just as good.  A couple heals and a couple big bad warriors and the hill choke point before the East and west tower becomes quite the meat grinder. And a strategic recap of frost wolf graveyard means you guys are all spawning back at Stonehearth. This usually allows the offense ample time to finish.
---
Depends on what you mean by achieved.
---
Downing bosses in MC? Sure, the rest of the raid will have to pick up your slack. But its possible.
---
Leveling can be done in any spec. But BM is by far the smoothest spec for leveling.
---
That soon?
---
I thought it was Naxx gear viable only, at the expense of the rest of the raids damage.
---
Can confirm. Mankrik is like 80% horde.
---
Honestly I kinda love AV as horde. 
---
It gives the best honor per hour for horde.
---
You don't have to respecc.
---
15-20 min queues so you can do other stuff whilst waiting for queue.
---
Just from getting to exalted this week I got 300k honor which put me in bracket 7. Despite only pvping for half the week. I would've needed  500k to break into bracket 10. 
---
I feel good about my odds to hit rank 10. But I'm going to wait a couple generations of R14's before I make the final push.
---
You really can't even entertain people like this.... They know everything because their life has been ??????.....   A quick look thru his post history provides some decency but overall trolly douchy attitude.  For some reason he's projecting his daddy issues on me.  u/notappropriateatall I'm sorry your dad was a drunk, and beat you, or whatever the hell happened to turn you into such a salty judgmental asshat....
---
BTW this was not some call to arms, or chant to bring the neckbeards together..... I was genuinely trying to share something I found amusing.... That also happened to be my fault....  Imagine that!
---
Wasn't that you asking for more artificial terms?
---
Idk about that, I bought bitcoins in 2013 exactly because my wow buddy hard convinced me back then. Still, how is it relevant somehow?
---
I'm not sure which random list you're blindly following, but RoVP only works with one certain healing build and is useless otherwise.
---
There's no way you can keep off a full zerg with 10 players.
---
But I also haven't played solo queue AV since the first day so idk maybe they trickle in one by one or something.
---
It‚Äôs going to go TBC. People want it, it costs less, it takes a lot less time. I think they will keep some servers classic only. It‚Äôs all speculation but just what I think. I‚Äôm not bothered either way I‚Äôm enjoying it now and il enjoy whatever direction they will go as long as it‚Äôs not towards the crap buckets which retail is.
---
"Dominated" and "unpopulated" are two different things, no?
---
As someone that has 2 60s, I beg to differ. Find a nice social guild and you will have plenty of people to level with
---
But then you are looking for "populated" Horde realm, not "Horde dominated".
---
oh i didnt realise that, i thought they were their own server group
---
Lol nice reply..You are assigned ranking points based on the percentile you are in for honor gained over the week. Your percentile puts you into a bracket, that then allots a certain number of ranking points depending on the bracket.
---
If 1000 people are pvping, you still have the same percentiles and same brackets as if 100 people are pvping. It just gets less competitive with less people.
---
More people pvping doesnt make more room for the upper brackets, because thats not how percentiles work.
---
If everyone received 900k-1000k honor..the people that got 900k would be the lowest percentile and receive the lowest amount of ranking points, even though they got a shit ton of honor. 
---
It is all relative and you can read about the basics of bell curves. Have you ever been in a classroom setting and were graded on a curve? Thats exactly what goes on with honor. If everyone got 90-100% on a test and were graded on this system, even getting a 90%, though a great score, is still relatively the worst in the class.
---
Imo, since they merged with Activision they have been constantly shitting the bed on releases. Before that they were the golden standard of a game development company that the fans respected.
---
Yes
---
It's fine when you do it yourself but as soon as someone tells you to it's strange! Smh. What has the world come to
---
Alliance is the (extremely) dominant faction.
---
Yeah there's an NA one but can't seem to find an EU one, hopefully there is.
---
Ultimately every upgrade just boils down to "a few stats".
---
Yes eldritch is a massive upgrade to warmaster for damage/pvp, more than 1% increased crit which will increase your dps just because of that extra damage, then on top of that you're getting better flurry uptime and more rage so your dps will also improve.
---
But then the pvp legs https://classic.wowhead.com/item-set=537/champions-battlearmor have even more crit, and if you have the 2 set bonus, have a solid attack power upgrade too.
---
So I would prefer the pvp legs to eldritch which in turn i would prefer to warmaster.
---
How long are you expecting to take to hit rank 8? If next week, skip eldritch, if 2 months, get eldritch as it will onyl take a few runs.
---
I think the spawn points are just any herb node in the zone. But only one up at a time.
---
Welcome!! New toon or character transfer?
---
&gt; the officers cared more about having as large a guild as possible rather than growing a good community
---
I think this is probably the reason you had bad apples in your guild, had that in a guild I was in while leveling up. Hope for better luck in the future on your Ally toon, I've heard there's a lot more bickering in general on Ally side but have no idea if there's any truth to it - but overall the people on Horde side on my realm seem nice overall, save a few notorious douchebags. 
---
As a side note, from what I've seen there are quite many players about who expect to get geared straight away after joining guilds and get upset or straight-out leave if they haven't gotten any in a couple of weeks. That type of behavior really rubs me the wrong way, given that decent loot and upgrades are not very plentiful in MC/Ony, and with 40 people in a raid there's bound to be competition, regardless of what loot system your are using. Well, save for simple /roll, but that system is really not for me as it can lead to new people joining, snagging some highly valued item on their first raid which then turns out to be their last one as they hop to the next one. 
---
So yea, when you luck out and find decent people who share your mentality, they are worth holding on to. If you make friends in a guild it's much easier to have fun and shoot for the progress of the guild as a whole, rather than just personal progression and seeing the guild as a means to and end (of gearing up).
---
Same, I just sit to make them crit often. Hate blizzard for that.
---
Incorrect, pvp can transfer to any server.  It's pve that can't transfer to pvp
---
Isn't your guildie also having gold, so that he could buy things like Mana pots/consumes or even his own lionheart helm, also benefit the guild?  There is an opportunity cost to a transmute in the form of a cooldown.  Effectively the alchemist is just giving the warrior the average going price of the transmute for free.  
---
Do you give guildies 5g every 2 days just because they are trying to farm an expensive item? That is effectively what you are calling the guildies "really lame" for not doing.
---
This is different than charging for a craft, since there is no lost opportunity cost in terms of doing crafts.
---
Pretty sure you can do that. As they are the same version of the game. US, Oceanic and Latin America are all the same version.  
---
Don‚Äôt think you can transfer from US servers to EU servers.
---
New toon, haven't played wow for years but classic looks like fun so why not!
---
Interested if you manage to retrieve something (to know when I‚Äôll need to grind seriously to reach rank 9-10!
---
&gt; for increasing your damage output
---
Don't forget pure spell power greens also increase your ability to get one-shot by 1k damage AoE.
---
yes, 10% per week.
---
Add me in game ‚Äúbrowny‚Äù and i‚Äôll send you some bags and a lil bit of gold! Not much but itll get ya started!
---
I did warrior and was really happy about until my friend whispered me and guess who now have two mains and now raids 3/4 days a week? ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Yes ive heard of these Duo jump runs, do you think it would be possible with a Druid heal? Etherway I‚Äôll start looking for those, thanks for the advice.
---
Can't they just limit it to "x times per month/year" then? Imagine how much bank they make from this it literally costs nothing in terms of server usage.
---
One of your addons is preventing you from entering. Update them, then disable them one at a time until you find the culprit.
---
Europe and the United states? Do i have to explain this?
---
Just fyi hunters in TBC aren't just good for MD, they're actually the top dps.
---
I hope this was you agreeing with me and providing a data point. Cause that's more or less what i'm saying ( 30 hours for B9/R9. In your case 15-25 hours for B7/R7 which is a) a lot of play and b) the last casual rank )
---
Let‚Äôs see. Last week 5 pieces of mage gear dropped. This week, just last night, 5 pieces of lock gear dropped. Boom. Keeping them happy lol.
---
I think the amount of faction players doesn't really matter for progress now that all unstable whiners transferred away.
---
One of your addons. Mine was details. 
---
Use the banner button off your minimap and accept BG 
---
OR
---
Disable the addon (details or elvui)
---
The game is the same but the clients are different region. So you have to recreate an  account and can‚Äôt just transfer between them.
---
I'm getting like 30k xp/hr
---
For the Horde!
---
So since they aren‚Äôt comparable, it‚Äôs not unexpected for new terms to appear, which describe these players
---
Bid-based DKP systems are shit, and any guild that suffers because of it deserves it.
---
Well before phase 1 servers were empty, *tips temple*
---
I don‚Äôt know why this is so interesting, but it really really is. Thank you for sharing this. Love this type of well organized information spread with all the details.
---
- an analyst
---
Yup, agreeing. To go above 9 on a high pop server I‚Äôd need around 30+ hours a week of premades. I can hit 8 at this rate but I won‚Äôt sacrifice my weekends
---
That sucks man
---
You could roll on a different server. What are you on now? And which faction? Could be a seriously low pop server, or on the small side of a seriously imbalanced faction server.
---
Top spots will be less honor due to increased queue times. On NA horde they have gone from 6-8 minutes to 10-15 mins (normally 12-15),
---
Now that your 60, remember...don‚Äôt fight in Kalimdor, or Eastern Plaguelands...fight every battle everywhere, always, in your mind.
---
Also 42 checking in. My guild just got rag down. I think I should hit 60 around February. Not in a hurry just doing what I want. I think I have about 3 days played. Lack of time is my weakness.
---
I also found an off time guild to raid with during cataclysm. It was great.
---
What's that add-on at the top that displays everything ?
---
Why did alliance even win in rush games in the first place?
---
Anyway, the new meta either needs to be the same thing the horde does or you really gotta move as one tight group and kill everything along the way
---
This would be the solution I would try. A nice ups to power the laptop at night, assuming it can get a decent charge from his dollar panel
---
People were getting poached from different servers left and right.   I guess you weren't there doing it, so you don't know.   If I don't know wtf I am talking about, I usually stfu though.
---
Survival hunters with a decent bow can match or beat MM damage at around 350 agi. Melee hunters eat paste.
---
Keep suggesting to my girlfriend that I should use the backdoor and that it would finish quicker, not having any of it.
---
Its not a skill thing really, its just dedication to a stupid level
---
Bartender + xpearl
---
guess its to stop folk hording DKP and saving for 1 major item, rather than bidding on upgrades. 
---
As said, every guild is different, but we've been raiding since 4th Oct on Classic, and so far there has been zero loot drama.
---
Left Earthfury horde last night, got tired of the medium pop and dad server more than anything; getting groups after midnight or before 5pm was often alittle bit of a struggle.
---
Oof that really sucks. Kind of off topic but I‚Äôve had some bad experiences with alliance from Skeram in AV just being nasty or toxic =\
---
Cool.  
---
    
---
Bet you they'd love to hear all about it over on r/classicwowplus
---
I'm Human, I just happened to get the gloves on a pug MC. I'm not using daggers. But they are still decent for what they are for the time being - that's why I didn't want to go and buy devilsaur stuff and wondered about the other legs.
---
‚ÄùSpeak friend and enter‚Äù
---
This is why bid-based DKP systems are stupid.
---
We use EPGP, with forced spending if an item is a clear upgrade. So if someone is trying to save for mageblade at the expense of every other slot they could be forced an item and lose their priority for mageblade. If it's a clear upgrade for multiple people they roll to see who is forced it.
---
‚ô™‚ô™ my *heart of the mountain* is a ghost town ‚ô™‚ô™
---
Dude we have 0 mageblade and 0 staff of dominance for the 2 months of mc clearing. I'm mage.
---
What do guys think
---
Band of Sulfuras (ring off rag) 
---
VS 
---
band of unicorn?
---
If you mean the jump at the tower, you can stay on your mount and spam jump. But you gotta look at the tower, so you jump at a bit of angle. It maybe takes a bit to get the right angle, but if you know it, you can do it every time.
---
Loot council for us. As much as we share the same loot, loot is distributed by many factors (raid attendance, activity in guild in general and such). We each understand our chances of getting that sweet loot, and whenever someone gets it, we celebrate him. Think it this way - each loot goes to raid together. Each loot gives better and faster raid experience. All you need is understanding and then there is not much drama ;)
---
I'm in the anglosphere and 90% of the people I know are bilingual.
---
I've noticed the same. Significant drop in people running endgame dungeons. Used to always find groups for jed/rend now I'm lucky to find a full ubrs run. Seems like everyone is busy min maxing honour.
---
People are going to do BGs, it‚Äôs not worth doing world pvp (at least for grinding)
---
I was on the other end of this recently. Some low level was asking for someone to craft him 3 silk bag, he had the mats.
---
I joined his group went to my bank and proceeded to craft his silk bags and a runecloth bag to round it out. 
---
I opened d trade to give him the bags and the bonus bag and he told me while I was crafting someone had given him a journeyman backpack and another person an additional runecloth bag with some gold as well.
---
Within 10 minutes the guy, asking not for a handout but a craft received a huge upgrade in his bag space and some gold. 
---
I believe a lot of the negativity comes from beggars, I don't believe beggars get a lot on classic where all the 60's feel the experience is earning your way.  But the people who are just trying to help themselves get helped very often.
---
Yea in vanilla I had classes that didnt start till about 11am-noon and then after school worked till like 11pm-midnight. Then I would go home and play, I found an amazing Australian PVP group and we got like 5-6 of us Warlord and 3 of us took turns getting High Warlord. Great bunch of people.
---
I 100% agree with the idea of not changing Classic balance. What im looking for is a competitive scene with everything that WoWClassic is. The thought of WSG and AB with the way current classes are and working around the problems of the balance instead of expecting them to be fixed would be all part of the meta. The idea that warriors will just become stronger and stronger will slowly change how teams work. each new phase almost brings about a change of meta it would be amazing
---
It will get somewhat easier. 1. People are/were grinding AV rep and many have exalted... So at least that's done. And 2. Natural attrition will be wedding people out as well.  I'm predicting a huge drop in the total volume of PvP this week.
---
Get devilsaur.
---
Dagger will never be slow enough to main-hand as fury. The gloves are for tanking or dagger rogues.
---
instant gratification games are &gt;&gt;&gt; that way.
---
we are not npc's you can just summon to help you, it took us ages back in the day to get shit done, you could never find anyone, solution was to get in a guild and get guildies to help you.
---
you are awful
---
Says he's on Whitemane. That does suck though, takes away from the whole MMO thing...I'd say don't worry about it and keep moving to solo shit. Skipping RFD isn't hindering your experience as you'd outgrow whatever gear you got from there in a couple levels anyway. You'll see alot more activity for ZF in a few levels.
---
I understand I'm looking past bwl/MC. Zg and AQ would be perfect along with arcanite dragonling buffing fire mages. it could buff fire rogues. \^\^
---
I went Troll because at the end of they I'm focusing more on PvE than PvE, and wanted something that benefits both.
---
But oh man, even though my character looks cool, I miss the looks of my mighty Tauren Shaman from Vanilla. Berserking is great and can really make a huge difference at times, but it is a bit bittersweet.
---
Like which ones? Humans have some weapon specializations, but Orcs have one as well. Gnome racials aren't meaningful in current PvE content. Dwarves have Fear Ward that is actually good. Night Elves have nothing for PvE.
---
Our racials suck for PvE. The reason Alliance are good for PvE is because Paladins are a thing.
---
Everybody has days :D didnt wanna do anything insulting! Gl and get well.
---
At one point you'll end up having too much gold to use on anything. Sell now to free up inventory space, and just fucking go on with life. It's just a couple dozen or hundred gold difference that can be farmed in one hour anyways.
---
Cow only is fine: warrior, chaman, druid, hunter... a lack of proper caster however...
---
it'll be one of your add ons. I got that a few times last week. I could reload my ui quickly and that normally allowed me to enter.
---
Whitemane, Horde. A "full" server. The only time I see a lot of people is in Org. It feels like 99% of the "full" population just stands around in Org. The rest of the world feels dead.
---
Well you‚Äôre level 40 and the majority of players are now 60. That‚Äôs your problem
---
Kurinaxx is a great server
---
What is fun about being a survival hunter in PVE other than shit-tier meme status?  Raptor strike and wing clip. Wowee. Traps every 30s? Barf.
---
Doesn't matter once you get nightfall just stand there and press wing clip.
---
Everyone is awesome until you get into AV. Then the angry middle schooler comes out in everyone on raid chat.
---
Nothing against Trolls, they're awesome tbh.
---
But I can't pass up on playing something so fat. seriously.
---
I‚Äôd actually come there but I‚Äôm leveling ally on earth fury with some friends lol
---
If you do DM E Jump runs as a tank is the only benefit the rich thorium? How many are there? How do you then get 40g or whatever per hour and also what is in it for the healer?
---
Why would they though, as far as I'm aware cheat engine cant interact with any memory in WoW.
---
Congrats to OP!
---
But I also love what thrall is saying here. Really shows his character especially knowing what he does in the future (future expansions)
---
I know it‚Äôs my fault bro I coulda got a couple extra games in I learned my lesson
---
Headmaster's Charge is pure RP/meme item and any wielder will still want an actual upgrade from MC.
---
Are you sure it's the casuals who are being neglected or the game trying to adjust to what people want nowadays? Just look at what classic has become after the initial euphoria ran out. Full of tryhards and min maxers.The existence of lfr is testament to how much they cater to casuals. Also the focus on collections, mounts and tmogs.
---
Didn‚Äôt stop TBC being fucking fantastic. You can stop complaining if you simply choose to
---
Oh sweet retail child.
---
That's why no serious progression/speedclear guild will be running DKP
---
I don‚Äôt have honorspy I‚Äôm about to download now
---
So basically since I didn‚Äôt play nonstop the first 36 hours it was out I‚Äôll never get exalted.  And all the people who did will be crying for more content so blizzard will rush the next thing out and I‚Äôll just be behind forever.
---
I did this exact thing and made just over 100g. It was fun and relaxing, nice side grind for my alt. Just wish prices were better when I sold, but whatever. In hindsight, I should have just used them to level alchemy.
---
They dropped significantly too. People looking, asking, and sharing info so readily/easily on these ‚Äúbig money makers‚Äù is actually making them not big money makers.  An example: People expected FAPS to be worth absurd amounts once BGs came, but they are worth a fraction of what was predicted and barely more than the cost of mats because so many people wanted to get in on that game.
---
Its an excuse because they never iterated on it until Cata
---
Thanks a lot man! Awesome to hear! I love seeing this kind of posts as well normally, so decided that I‚Äôd contribute to one instead of only taking in the info. ;)
---
Cheers again!
---
Exactly this!
---
Sell your stuff 1 week Prior to any patch/Phase hitting the Servers and you won't be let down like me with Small Eggs, Larval Acid, Essence of Water etc... :,(
---
Don't be stupid like me, thinking I am smart buying this shit before that patch hits just to realize every 2nd Person on the Server thinks he is smart. And thus bringing the Prices to a Minimum once the patch hits
---
I"m working 3:50am to 12:20pm so I hear you all. My weekends are all sorts of messed up lol.
---
Alliance side? I‚Äôve seen a guild called &lt;night shift&gt; advertising.
---
I am no longer working nights but think of them fondly and would love to be a part of that.
---
The BGs at the bottom of the list are most fresh so you could just both Q for bottom and only accept if you both get in.
---
I love how we are all collectively forgetting the Hong Kong fiasco and Blizzard is back to being "one of the good guy companies."
---
R14 is like farming that teebu blazing longsword
---
I‚Äôm doing that after work today thanks buddy
---
Thanks I‚Äôll look that up
---
I think you missed the reference, there's an in game item called both Unstoppable Force and Immovable Object :P
---
Yeah that's fair enough but if you already have hit cap (6%?) then these aren't of benefit right and my suggested option is viable?
---
I thought flameguard are better than devilsaur set so you'd replace the gloves and then use something like the cloudkeeper legs, or rank 8 legs?
---
I have 6% hit cap from elsewhere; Lionheart, battle wrists, don julio ring, brigam girdle, bloodmail boots.
---
I was looking for how long it would take to 1-300 herbalism, thank you for the post.
---
Does anyone know if hunter tribute farming will remain as the best gold per hour in the game for the rest of classic?
---
This. I just asked one of my guild friends who is 60 to help me finish all the elite quests that I had in AH. 5 total. Took about 1 hour.
---
the lower part of the horde base is pointless
---
getting up the hill between the towers is an amazing choke point for horde that can not be avoided. its the easiest spot in the game to defend
---
Haha well as I said there are more lucrative ways to make money, but maybe I‚Äôve made people more interested in herbalism, if that‚Äôs the case; I‚Äôm sorry. ;)
---
Well yes you often get yelled at in raidchat if you're trying defend or asking for help defending. Basically as soon as the initial Drek-Rush fails the game turns into a 20v40 or worse because the alliance just gives up
---
Yeah I know but 70g is quite a bit when I still need enchants and whatnot. I just wonder if I could save that by my suggestions.
---
I did 300k Honor last week grinding av for total of 3 days in a row and 17-18 hours a day.not even trying to rank as these 3 days Burned me out so hard i cant imagine doing this 7 days a week for a few months
---
Yeah I was hoping to avoid having to to do that lol but it must be done!
---
No ways my mom is from Brno and she hates the beggars here and keeps saying how stuff like this doesn't happen in Czech... lol guess she's wrong. Shes only visited there a couple times since the 70s though
---
Yikes dude
---
Not sure where do you live and how is your solar system installed, but the sun has different angle during the winter.
---
You can check if it's your pc energy consumption increased or environmental characteristics by plugging a electricity meter.
---
We are all Shartacus on this blessed day.
---
On smolderweb, the 5-7am server time crew is incredible. There‚Äôs basically an understanding between horde/alliance that everyone on at that hour doesn‚Äôt have time to PvP.
---
As others said... A guild is quite important when it Comes to getting help.
---
And is the world really this dead? I played my alt before BG's hit up to 47. It felt great at that time. Then again I guess a lot of People are now farming BG's...
---
It will get better again...
---
When you don't know what to do just grind Mobs for 2-3 hours :D It is boring AF BUT you are progressing at least until you can do the elite quests alone ;)
---
Do you need mining to make DM East worth farming as a lock or stick to Mara?
---
This was my thought also
---
I haven't found any resource for wich pet skills to use but i've found a very usefull tool to calculate the pet talents.
---
Usually i change them based on the content i'm doing (PVP, farming, Raid Etc.)

&gt; A rogue rolling on healing items or a mage rolling on plate is a ninja, we get it
---
Nah, a mage rolling on healing or plate isn't a ninja. That's an asshole.
---
A mage looting an item that he didn't win from a chest is a ninja.
---
&gt; but a hybrid rolling so he can play the way his class was designed shouldn't be met with such aggression.
---
If I'm healing an instance, I'll roll on healing items and will pick up offspec stuff if it drops and nobody else needs it.
---
If I'm feral-ing an instance, I'll roll on feral items and will pick up healing stuff if it drops and nobody else needs it.
---
Also, if I'm tanking an instance because a tank was needed, but only need healing items, I'll ask the healer *beforehand* if it's okay. 
---
If I'm healing an instance and only need bear items, I'll pick them up because nobody else will need them. Unless the tank is feral, then I'll also tell him beforehand.
---
Titan panel im pretty sure :)
---
Awesome! Yeah I had the same, my alt had 220 alchemy already and maybe I should‚Äôve just funnelled the herbs through, but then again I also wanted to simply make money, and I can always buy the herbs back if it‚Äôs really needed! Thanks for your reply :)
---
Yikes man. That would have been so much better for a rogue, pug or not.
---
I am one of the people. I want it. Therefore, people want it
---
Big grats, now go spec Holy ;-)
---
I originally palyes rogue w my brother to about 50. Hes not playing much this month so im letting the rogue wwait. Started a war 30, mage 15, lock 18, hunter 10, priest 30.....
---
This is literally why Classic was made. Give it a shot. For the small fee of $15usd/month you too can develop an addiction.
---
problem is my server dont have one :( but ty anyway.
---
Hey! Yea, he's toggling between Berserker or Battle stance now, we're usually on Discord so it's easy to communicate that he's taking too much damage at some point and so forth. But at least for last boss, the higher damage output the better, since if you drag on for too long, it seems you can get another Imp wave on your later, which is annoying as hell. 
---
Better to do as much burst as you can there, I'd say, and healer just be vigilant about curing Poison/Disease and, if possible, Purging/Dispelling Thorns. In Tree form he can also HoT himself (Wild Growth?Regeneration?Wild Something) and it seems uninterruptable, at least as Shammy (nature damage). Other than that, the Disease he casts on tank does some \~700 dmg, normal hits are \~300-400 dmg and he hits harder in Wolf form - but that is about it. 
---
So I'd say Zerk away as long as you can heal it.
---
&gt; Dude, you're the one who happily starts cleaning toilets if they call the job "Chief Cleaning Officer", right?
---
you make a comment like that and then ask about relevancy? 
---
lmao
---
Seriously what realm are you on and what time do you play? I literally stumble over people nearly 24/7 and this is not an exaggeration.
---
All of the shared loot is around equal prio, aside from a few specific cases- Mana Binding Cord to mages first, as warlocks get one that's fairly close in Sash of Whispered Secrets. Robes of Volitile Power to warlocks first as the mage tailoring robes are alot better than warlock's (shouldn't reward non tailors for being lazy with gearing). 2nd ring of spellpower to mages as warlocks get a nice shadow damage one in BWL.
---
It's definitely one of the worst yes
---
You should be fine unless You‚Äôre Reckful.
---
A lot of us have split our MC teams into 2 25 mans as well.
---
You‚Äôre not supposed to but if it‚Äôs being played at your place it‚Äôs doubtful anyone is gonna notice
---
Resets.
---
Anytime mate! Seeing you‚Äôre a hunter I‚Äôd say it goes even quicker since you got Cheetah to run from herb to herb when they‚Äôre close, instead of mounting up all the time!
---
True goldilocks experience. Good server
---
t.b.h. our guild is very close, so we give away our arcanite transmutes away for free, to guildies.  
---
that doesnt mean you need to give them away mandatory.  
---
luckily we have alot of Alchemist, so its not that a big of a issue.  
---
&gt; Do you give guildies 5g every 2 days just because they are trying to farm an expensive item? That is effectively what you are calling the guildies "really lame" for not doing.
---
  This makes no sense.... there is an 48hour cooldown on the transmute.  
---
that 7g is just a bonus, but if you realy need that gold, i can imagine you want to sell it.  
---
It might be the case that our guild is a little further in the total progress, so nobody needs gold for an epic mount, transmutes are given away for free to guildies, MC clear in 90minutes.   got 2 Hand of Rag's....
---
You‚Äôre allowed to account share as long as it‚Äôs not for any ranking reason, I.E world first, PvP titles etc. So yes they can go on it
---
Yes I have been seeing increased activity in the 30-50 ranges as the first large batch of alts are coming up through as their mains are raid logging.
---
Azuresong here!!! Feels like such a small server I never seen anyone from there on the subreddit
---
I just wanted to know if he was human and unfortunately my suspicions were correct :(
---
Morgraine is fantastic and more alliance will get the server close to perfectly balanced
---
Guild Discounts are always very good :D
---
I'm also noggeinfoggin on eu
---
Ravager question:
---
Where's a good place to farm for gold as a 60 arms warrior (horde) with ravager? 
---
Also, does dragonbreath chili proc together with it more often since it hits several targets? 
---
Is there anything else I should think of that can increase my aoe together with ravager? 
---
The classic version of the game breeds this kind of good behavior with its mechanics in my opinion. That guy messaged you because he at some point had to rely on other players to help him get stuff done. If you are planning on progressing without a lot of struggle it‚Äôs a necessity. Some classes it‚Äôs a necessity from level 1. People who play classic are in general nicer in my experience.
---
Damn, the victim complex salt is still going?
---
Any reason to still be whiny after finally having faction imbalance in your favor, if it's such an advantage?
---
it is account sharing, it is bannadble, but it is almost unnoticeable if done like this
---
Create a problem, sell the solution!
---
Then no. If you want to melee and actually contribute to raid dps then roll a Warrior or Rogue
---
fill your guild with adults
---
works wonders
---
I needed to train my polearms from 1-300 and had the brainwave to level it in Deadmines instead of WPL or something.
---
Saw a lowbie warrior finishing the traitor escort and offered to boost him as I was there already. Tearing through Deadmines was fun enough, but seeing Smites hammer **and** cruel barb drop for him gave me some strong vicarious feels.
---
I played when the game first dropped. Saw maybe 20 players total from lvl 20-60. 
---
Well, unless you count the times I flew zones I'd already finished with and saw hundreds of players just a few levels lower than me.
---
The horde at least double the alliance. As a horde player during phase 2, you hardly could find alliance players and then if you found 4 or 5, 20 horde would wreck them. If you want balance, kirtonos is not the way.
---
Talk to the top rankers and start organizing?
---
Playing fast and loose with the use of ‚Äòmost‚Äô there I reckon!
---
It‚Äôs an add on that‚Äôs breaking it.  I think it‚Äôs TSM.
---
I am a feral tank spec, and have the best feral tank gear, but I usually cant strait tank a warrior with an epic weapon.   They'll do too much damage to me, so I have to try to heal/  But that comes with a series of other complications, as it involves going into caster form where they can blow you up almost instantly.
---
I hit 60 a while ago. Realized I wouldn‚Äôt be able to play with my friends for quite some since they were still in the 30s. So I made an alt. Just hit 60 yesterday, my friend hit 45. 
---
I did a few weeks of Mc pugs. Joined the guild that hosted the mc pug. Went from 4/10 in 6 hours to 8/10 the week after. Now we‚Äôre 8/10 in 4ish hours. ( from invite to mage port out). This coming week we plan to be 10/10 and get ony down. We‚Äôre behind the curve on our server as multiple guilds have 2-3 full raid teams. But the progression has brought many hilarious moments.
---
Retail is getting a raid in mid Jan.  I‚Äôm doubting they will overlap content launch
---
If 100% successful yes that's about right but I'd say I fail about 20-30% because of something like a feign death resist. But it took me a whole day of failures before I got it down and probably a week to get more consistent.
---
Well Vanilla had a constant flow of new players during all of its lifespan. Classic doesn't: very few new players are joining so besides reroll and very casual players, you aren't likely to find many people doing low level content. 
---
It kinda sucks but... there's not much that can be done beside just grinding your way to lvl60 and then being able to join max level activities.
---
I‚Äôd like to start doing that or 3 ony teams to increase the difficulty
---
Well.
---
You are not allowed to.
---
But how is Blizzard gonna know when they only Play when they are over at your place.
---
You have always played from there. And will still always be playing from there.
---
Also I don't think Blizzard cares since you pay for 2 Subs anyway xD
---
Just go for it. Worst Thing that could happen is getting the 2nd account banend which would be sad. But I have never heard of anyone getting sriously punished for account sharing.
---
You would get suspended for 24hrs or 3 days first. Then again. And then get banned if anything.
---
Were you trying from a pvp or pve server?
---
xD
---
Your post gives no reasoning as to why it is beneficial to xfer to a server where your faction is an underdog. ‚ÄúYou will have more fun‚Äù is subjective and absent any actual support for your conclusion.
---
Everything should be split 50/50 on these runs. That is the incentive. You need mining, herbalism and enchanting for professions.
---
You'll get gold from vendoring boss drops/greens that are worth more than \~2g each (on my realm Large Brilliant shards have dropped to &lt;2g). In addition to this, you can find some decent herbs in there as well as thorium/dense stone, Fel Cloth can drop from satyrs, Demonic Runes can drop for healer, and if you get lucky you can get Arcane Crystals from veins or Essence of water/Librams/class trinket books/Foror's.
---
Make the best happy and replace the bottom half as soon as they leave until more dungeons are out. Problem will disappear once ZG/AQ is out and even BWL helps.
---
Pre 60 dungeons are mostly a waste of time. Pre 60 PUG‚Äôs are less fun than questing, less XP, the gear is meaningless, and are a pain to put together. Why would I do them? 
---
The only reason to do pre 60 dungeons is to group and have fun with friends. If you don‚Äôt have friends near your level, you‚Äôll be hard pressed to find a dungeon group, because of the above paragraph.
---
What addons do you use? I see some interesting in screenshot that I do not know.
---
Make sure you've got a decent amount of +int gear, and it's not so bad. I love swapping forms, so I took the talents to reduce cost by 30%, and that helped a lot too.
---
You're right to a limited extent. Brackets are percentile-based, and just extend with a normal distribution. As are ranks, but ranks have an effective hard cap due to the 20% decay.
---
You gain a number of RP per week, directly proportional with two things: Standing, and Pool Size. You get more RP if the Pool is larger. 
---
R14 needs 60000 RP. You can get ~13000 RP per week max (standing 1), depending on Pool Size.
---
At R13+ 20% decay means you lose 11000 RP per week, leaving you with a net gain of ~2000.
---
The effect of this is (with mostly made up numbers, because the math is pretty hard): If you're on a realm with a Pool Size of:  
---
- 10000, you MUST maintain a Standing of &lt; 500 to rank past 13 ( albeit very slowly at 500, as you'll net 5 RP per week or something )
---
- 5000, you MUST maintain a Standing of &lt; 200 to rank past 13.  
---
- 1000, you MUST maintain a Standing of = 3 to rank past 13  
---
- 500, you MUST maintain a Standing of &lt; 1 (!!) to rank past 13 (Making the rank impossible to achieve)
---
So yes, the large pool size is a boon, for less than obvious reasons, and it's just a lot easier to think of it in terms of slots than in terms of RPin - RPout.
---
GrEaT cOmUnItY

Interested in the answers, I'm a big miner but have no idea the ins and outs of spawns etc, however what I have read is that RTV is on around 30 min respawn and only a certain amount of nodes (usually one) Will be active in one small area if it hasn't been mined
---
Somehow the game feels nostalgic to me, despite me having never played before late MoP/early WoD. I guess it just forces me more to play WoW like I did at the very start where I really cared about every little quest I did.
---
you mean quality over quantity?
---
not all R14s account shared. because i sure as fuck didn't
---
Meh, too much running and you have to go somewhat out of your way when compared to the other quests at that level.
---
I work 3rd shift. The only plus side is when I log on there are no queues. Downside it takes forever to get a group to do dungeons.
---
I love it haha. Do you think that 2 ally defenders could stop horde players to take the shortcut? Might be quite an impressive slow down
---
I have two accounts to have a bank-mage online while waiting av queue, so it doesn't seem far off :D
---
Horde has no chance to win. Horde has been circumventing the race by having people defend and stall.
---
Sorry, but all of you brainless guide-followers are the personification of low IQ.
---
Don't act like you ever tried something yourself or actually spent a thought on anything. All you do is celebrating yourself as omniscient - after *reading one guide*.
---
Fuck off.
---
Undead and Tauren never really do Hidden Enemies, it's never really on your path when you're low level.
---
Me neither, whenever horde defends and stops the ally rush all I see in bg-chat is "gg, let them win"
---
Ya that was only for like week 1-2 of PVP system. People went ‚Äúno way in hell we‚Äôre keeping rank to use the items‚Äù
---
Bingo
---
Current distinction is based on how you prioritise your game and life goals, e.g. game time and other activities, thus can be applied not only to WoW, and doesn't take player pool size into consideration.
---
Yeap when I worked Nightshift during WotLK, I raided with Military Guild. They had 3 raid teams one was for Nightshifters.
---
Chain lightning everywhere!
---
Meh, at least they may have some places for a boomkin ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
If you are HSing in raids with proper gear and consumables you're going to die a slow and painful death to overaggro.
---
Current meta heavily implies warmasters will get a little help with snowballs.
---
Nope, brackets are the reverse of ranks. Rank 14 is the highest rank, bracket 1 is the highest bracket. While it is semantics, it has been known as this way since vanilla.
---
peddle yourself elsewhere virtual hobo
---
Good to know at least. I‚Äôll probably make a Prot Warrior and get it to 19 with as much dungeon gear as possible and just work on profs
---
Find a good leveling guild on your server.
---
I'm on Dreadmist and part of one of the largest leveling guilds there (Tide Pod Survivors) and it really makes a huge change when it comes to finding groups and people to help out with lower level quests n stuff.
---
There's always several people going for SM Cath/RFD/Ulda runs as well as lower level and even higher.
---
If you're using a 2H weapon in a raid, you're still going to be Fury.
---
Due to the debuff slot limit, you won't be allowed to use Mortal Strike since it would push other more important debuffs off.
---
Whilst 2H Fury Warriors can compete (especially Horde side with WF) I'm pretty sure that DW Fury just has the highest DPS numbers.
---
I think if you want to try 2H DPS seriously, then you need [OEB](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18822/obsidian-edged-blade), HoJ, Sword Spec and Windfury Totem. Then you can get some crazy burst. But sustained DPS wise, you'll still probably lose to the DW Fury Warrior.
---
Yea you can
---
Thank you!  This is his first 60 so we were dueling and just messing around with eachother. Do you happen to be on earthfury?
---
From what I hear by the number crunchers if you're not rank 10 this week you're actually behind the curve for getting to 12+ any time soon.
---
&gt; bash -&gt; entangling roots -&gt; healing touch.
---
Trinket, WW, MS, Execute
---
Bad warmaster pulls are so common and so, so awful.
---
Using hellfire and rain of fire, would it be better to stack SP or fire spell power or just to stack stats as I can imagine the cooefficent will be rather bad
---
Why
---
Chill out dude, there weren't any rogues in the pug
---
Insert Cotton-eyed Joe joke here
---
I left Blaumeux PVP with my Locks becauase 68/32 H:A split turned into "Boats are Horde Only" and "Thorium Point is a Horde town" now. I went to pve Pagle as I'd already rolled some Boomkins there and haven't regretted it.
---
&gt;how you prioritise your game and life goals
---
Which is completely ignored in your hardcore definition.
---
Clown of the day üòÇüòÇ
---
I only know about Eastern Plaguelands having several zones where the rich thorium veins share a cooldown. So every ~15min you can find one vein in one of these zones.
---
This was part of it for sure to a point. Around 38 horde side there are a lot of people leveling healing or dps halts. Which is why the whammy slowed down.
---
The rest are still in that range were you can get a few levels in a couple hours. Once you have a quest pattern to follow it goes quick.
---
If I understand it correctly, all of them (gf and friends) would use your account from your home (IP adress) right? In that case nobody can prove account sharing, unless you are streamer and provide evidence against yourself :D
---
I'm *interested* in rank 8, but not trying at all.  Got rank 3 this week, didn't even expect to get that.  I figure i'll never get there.
---
I don't know much about tanking while leveling but I do know a great deal about Warlock Raid tanking played on for many years.
---
Two questions
---
1: in AV, what should I be doing as a rogue? As Alliance, it‚Äôs rare to see a Horde outside of the offensive death ball or the defensive death ball, and even then it‚Äôs not a guarantee that I kill them. 
---
2: where can I find AV premades? I‚Äôm getting tired of the uncoordinated pug play the Alliance has to offer, and I‚Äôve heard there‚Äôs a Discord server somewhere for this purpose.
---
One would hope that majority of the player base realises honour is worthless at this point so lieutenants arent worth killing due to time investment
---
Cat DPS is best used for levelling.  Beyond that, feral is useful for bear tanking dungeons and to some extent, raids.  Those that play druid seriously in PvP tend to be constantly switching between forms depending on the situation rather than staying in just one.   They also tend to use a full resto or hybrid feral resto build and then stack gear that has both high stamina and high healing/spell damage.  Doing so can make a well played druid the hardest class to kill in the game in the right hands which turns them into the best WSG flag carriers.
---
Fuck my guildies. I need my own gold.
---
Ayye fuck yasha I paid the other guy to not have yasha's name on my helm.
---
Just like in BC survival was great dps but only once your agility is high enough.
---
Even if it‚Äôs behind though at least it gives me a baseline to check out some servers though.
---
It‚Äôs not at all. I think you‚Äôre just a depressed human being.
---
This is great advice!
---
Imp CoE isn't necessary; and honestly, I wouldn't even take Amp Curse on a PvE server. I'd migrate points from Grim Reach and Imp CoE into Imp Drain Life.
---
Honor was inflated due to a return of players to try out battlegrounds so it was a competitive week though Tbh depending on your server pop rank 10 is achievable while playing 4-5 hours a day no problem the real problem for ranking up is fighting against decay when you get closer to rank 9 even skipping one day of your goal honor would result in lost progress and since were talking about 3+ months of every night grind honor 4-5 hours the real problem becomes endurance and how you manage to not go crazy while essentially working a 30+ hour a week job for a cool PvP set.
---
Personally I‚Äôm already rank 7 by ranking in bracket 9-11 every week since while working etc just that I probably PvP 20 hours a week nothing too crazy.
---
NS healing touch and natures grasp and bear form again. I eat warrs for breakfast, lunch and dinner
---
This happened to my guild tonight. Someone rolled a 99 on Mageblade and was beaten by the final roller who rolled 100. The winner then left the guild and raid after receiving their item. They had been raiding with us since the beginning. 
---
At least this is happening before BWL + this person will need to pay to transfer servers as all guilds on our small server will not let them join. Pretty expensive mageblade!
---
Right so I use Valor shoulders right now even though I have truestrike shoulders. With those, I'd have 8% hit. Should I use truestrike?
---
Yeah, I could aim for the rank 8 legs, and rank 10 shoulders? Gloves I could use flameguard. I'm going from a discord channel's spreadsheet BiS list and this is the suggestion. If it's wrong then fair enough. Should I just go and get devilsaur set next then??
---
I'm human so I have 305.
---
Benediction is very close to 50/50 believe last check it was 47/53 Ali/Horde.   Ever since BG's too even higher level quest hubs are able to be used freely and wPvP feels balanced and fun.
---
Yeah I have a guildie that was rank 3 and was sure she was going to jump to rank 10-11 after reset...I was like yeah no, you're going to be lucky if you hit 5. People don't realize just how bad the grind is.
---
blizzards potato servers
---
Queueing hs provides no extra aggro, only if you screw up and let them go off. If you keep screwing up you can queue cleaves instead.
---
We have four resto druids. Kinda why i wanna go feral so ensure my spot in raid
---
You really think ppl back then just helped other out more? That‚Äôs total bullshit homie.
---
Yeah that's exactly it. 
---
Hoarders will eventually reach a point where they are losing more from the decay than they get for attending. At that point they may as well start bidding on gear they only kind of want.  
---
This forces them to upgrade their gear, even if it isn't the biggest upgrade possible.
---
Alliance wins in rush games because of the shitload of NPC's that Alliance has right next to FA that inevitably get aggro'd. Horde towers are also less effective than Alliance bunkers, but you'd be able to overcome that (roughly equivalent in advantage to Horde's shorter run distance in a pure boss rush). The real problem is just that Horde has to kill like 7 or 8 random NPC's with the same health as lieutenant/commander NPC's. Conversely, every NPC like that in the Horde base you either do not get even close to aggro range of, and even if you do they'll just leash long before you get to Drek'thar anyway.
---
Are you taking about the one that requires jumping or the fucky one where you clip up a cliff?
---
First one certainly not an exploit. The second is pretty odd.
---
I would switch to allied in a second to get dual spec. I‚Äôd do horrible things for it, unspeakable even.
---
Or just level normally and don‚Äôt cry that other people won‚Äôt ‚Äòhelp‚Äô you? As if people are ‚Äòsupposed‚Äô to spend their time helping randoms.
---
Defend, sure, but it‚Äôs a shoddy defense. 5 Alliance will port back in a trickle, amounting to nothing. 5 Horde, majority mages, will port back at one, completely stalling us on Drek.
---
Why is honour worthless?
---
After the update last Tuesday, I had to update all of my add-ons.  They are all working with the exception of one task bar that has my portals and arcane brilliance buttons on (both of which require reagants).  Even though I have the reagants in my bag, these task bars show zero on the button whereas they used to show the number of reagants before.  Any way to fix this?
---
if you are ali and looking to move come to Kromcrush, we need a cpl more non mem  DPS classes for our raid group
---
Not if you're paladin. :X
---
That's a wierd way to spell GRIZZLY.
---
Requires jumping, not an easy jump, but can be practiced and mastered.
---
Meh. RFC, WC, SFK, RFK, and 4 different SMs, and then RFD - you guys are basically set up easily until level 44-45 conveniently until you have to go to ZF.  I played Horde back in 2005ish and went alliance this time. Was shocking how much more of a pain in the ass Alliance is to level.
---
You know you can guard the back door with one person right? You can't get up the hill or make the jump while slowed and both are able to be hit without a mage being able to be hit back.
---
Pushback is a nuisance for sure. If you end up getting it, your only option is LHW or NS+some heal. I try to heal up the warrior to full just as boss hits 50%, make sure Stoneskin is up by the time they join the fight since then they'll be dealing 1-3 damage per hit - but pushback is still an issue. TC, AoE taunt into totem, then you have a few seconds to fire off 1-3 quick heals as needed. My warrior buddy first popped into Def stance then during our first runs, but with Stoneskin down there is no need at all - he's better off trying to get down the boss into execute range and just nuking him. I also try to get in autoattacks and hope for WF procs inbetween heals or when starting a heal. Dynamite or the like surely helps, or the super weird trinket from Ragnaros that people often don't want - that one is basically made for tanking Imps.
---
This is how i do it.
---
Only spend points on 1 max rank focus dump though. Not both bite and claw.
---
Start the fight with shadow reflector, start free casting frostbolt or scorch if you‚Äôre barrier ignite spec. Then imp cs him and keep casting at him. Grenade him after that and then finish him off with instant casts. Be ready to ice block the death coil.  I usually win against locks when using that strategy
---
That shit was an over reaction which is why no one cares about it anymore.
---
Fucking casual, you sleep more than 4 hours per night?
---
Rep, sorry
---
realm third was last lock out, crazy it took those terrible rp'ers that long
---
Cya tomorrow
---
This backdoor is not the problem. The fact that in about 90% of the games I enter the alliance base, back- or front door, there is not a single alliance player defending. I can bandage up, pull the guards out of tower range, kill them, tag the graveyard. And no one there to prevent this. Sometimes someone returns using the trinket after a bit, but in general I can just leave the flag and clear the bunkers too, all on my own and ahead of the Horde zerg arriving. 
---
The bridge is a deathtrap, and the backdoor can be easily managed by a single ranged defender. But there's just no one bothering to defend. At all. And honestly, I suck at PvP, so any defender would probably be enough to stop me, specially with the base design with cover from the bunkers and all the NPC's in there.
---
If you have one side assigning defender and attackers, and the other side leaving their main objective completely undefended and just zerging into the other sides defenses. Who, most logically, would win? Its not rocket science you know.
---
He did say no competition...so he probably did it at 4am.
---
What? That sounds even worse. The mageblade still goes to the guy with most DKP, but he only needs to spend 200 of it?
---
This doesn't help with hoarding, just makes it worse for people who are willing to pick up shitty items for cheap because it's now fixed price.
---
I'm leveling as a survival hunter and it's really fun,  at every dungeon the frost trap helps, I can crit with raptor for good damage and sleep Alliance Flag carriers in WG. Just spaming arcane shot and aiming shot is boring and i can't handle.

**The Night Witches are a leftist LGBTQIA+ World of Warcraft Classic guild now recruiting, and paid server transfers are now open**
---
 &lt;Night Witches&gt; | Deviate Delight RP-PVP | Horde | US-EST | Medium PVP and PVE | Loot Council
---
&lt;Night Witches&gt; is a guild of leftist &amp; LGBTQIA+ players which has created an inclusive gaming community free of the rampant toxicity encountered in Warcraft guilds and other games. Are you a like-minded Horde player who started on a different PVP or RP-PVP server with a group of friends who all or mostly drifted away? You can transfer to Deviate Delight and join us!
---
Raid Completion: 10/10 MC | Ony
---
Raid Times: Wednesday 8-11pm EST, Sunday 7-10pm EST
---
Raid Loot: Loot Council, with elected class leaders as reps
---
Open Raid Slots, top priority is Mages
---
Others also welcome. Just ask!
---
Always open to dedicated, non-guildie raider allies.
---
Raiders are expected to do the basics: A) sign up/show up on time, B) generally know how to play their class, and C) have a willingness to take instruction and/or constructive criticism. We aren't a hardcore min-maxing guild, however; we want you to choose a race, class and spec based on your interests, and we welcome theorycrafters. We prioritize everybody having fun and enjoying playing what they play.
---
We are also working on (once people finish their AV grinds) getting a team or teams together for 10-person WSG battleground premades. Join in on that!
---
Not a raider? No problem! We're widely engaged in all aspects of Classic World of Warcraft, with crafting, farming, dungeon runs, and world PVP. We have support for new and leveling mains and alts. So even if you don't want to raid, there's plenty of other activities going on.
---
TL;DR: If you'd like to play an MMO with an inclusive, toxicity-free leftist guild, check us out. We are doing amazing things and we need more comrades.
---
[Join our Discord here!](https://discord.gg/8Myfd9R)
---
From what I've seen the meta is players not playing meta. People are bored of zergs and so taking towers and playing defense is more a thing. It turns out a few people want to PvP in battlegrounds.
---
Keep making wands. The mats are cheap and you can get a good profit.
---
Anyone want to create an (A) raid guild for morning runs like 8am realm time...? us east
---
because I want to top DPS charts. Not be terrible.
---
I don't play paladin, but I can see 0 reason why you'd ever have a holy build that doesn't include points in mana back on crits.
---
The vast consensus is rovp is bis until robes of the guardian saint.
---
That's literally about the time or less than it will take to reach Rank 14 so seems fine.
---
On Herod alliance if you want a dungeon you need guildies being nice or find a group running their alts, and they all want to reserve the loot for themselves.
---
Elite quests in leveling zones?  Forget about it if you don't have a friend leveling with you.
---
I've argued *so* many times on this sub why negative incentives, like faction queues, is the most stupid non-solution ever. That shit gets hundred of upvotes all the time.
---
started playing wow with classic. people pretty much do nothing but kick my while i‚Äôm down. went on retail for the first time a few weeks ago, asked if anyone could help me out with my warrior ‚Äúbuild‚Äù, wound up getting 10k gold from 2 different people. was able to purchase heirloom items for myself. i think people are largely wrong about the classic community. everyone is always out for themselves first and foremost.
---
For the Horde. Lok thar ogar!
---
I wonder why do you tend to lump together people who invest more time in the game which heavily differs rewards and ranking based on time invested but somehow make a category of players who invest way less as something exclusive. Shouldn't it be vice versa, given the fact the first category is way way way less than the second?
---
It's a joke, the OP is saying that all PvP servers will turn into 100% of the faction that currently has more players, which is horde on Blaumeux
---
Enhance shaman here, if you‚Äôre talking PvP TuF is better than spinal unless you‚Äôre going full glass cannon( it does more damage but has no stats), with battleshout and mostly blues I can WF crit 1.1k(per extra attack on prof) have deleted mages from existence with 1 auto WF triple crib no gcd needed lol.
---
If you‚Äôre talking pve spinal is way better if you‚Äôre an orc but you‚Äôll probably just convince you‚Äôre guild to help you build nightfall the ultimate enhancement shaman raid weapon.
---
Stop advertising good servers here. The last thing any balanced server needs is a bunch of Reddit spergs joining it. That's why servers like Herod are so trash.
---
A feature/bug is that when hs or cleaves is queued all of your attacks use the yellow hit table, including offhand. Combined with a swing timer this means you can basically never miss with 6% hit (assuming weapon skill). Practically, I'm sure we all screw it up a little here and there, but additional hit is greatly devalued for warriors.
---
Nope, it's available right now, go check the vendor yourself if you want to verify.
---
THIS is what vanilla-wow/wow-classic is about!
---
I think the market is still recovering from world PvP. I saw Silversage as high as 1.5g each, meanwhile dreamfoil could be found less than 25s each. This was because you could not farm in the open world, at least effectively. Now with BGs, herb and other material farms should even itself out.
---
Just like it did the first time it was introduced
---
but who cares when you can make that sweet sweet desperation money from your customers?
---
Hmm! Demographics may be shifting as folks level up alts, but we used to be the least-played class. I've had another druid in my 5 man groups maaaaybe 4 times in 60 levels? But maybe they're a popular alt?
---
You'll have to for Classic
---
i have like 8 g in total hahahah
---
Im new to pvp in general. Im playing on retail and there is a timewalking event where you can play the old AV. I've got my hands on the retail version of AV wich is a loss for Horde most of the time. I was suprised that I won six bgs in a row in the old version as horde. Is the AV in the event the same like the one in classic? Back then, did the alliance always win AV too? Were we just lucky or the alliance players Bad?
---
This is no mine. It's a tomb.
---
And yet horde has absolutely no problem clearing content, and the best guild in the world in vanilla was horde(nihilum). 
---
Absolutely amazes me when horde players think alliance "advantage" in pve is actually meaningful. Plus nobody even plays paladins anyway.
---
The game's literally compatible with the old WC3, which is receiving countless patches as I write this. How entitled can you get? Should they also give you money to play the game?
---
Except it is accurate because horde will intercept ally at bal
---
How many more times you gonna post this ? :)
---
Im just afking with a keysmasher and team viewer from work to get the mount.
---
But you are still missing your main attacks aren't you? Since you have to unqueue it or it will go off. Is that "bug" actually tested in classic or is it a pserver thing? Because this is the first time I'm hearing of it, and most top warriors are using plenty of +hit gear beyond 6%
---
Will probably go up as more bindings get found
---
Thats the luck of the draw mate, you raid, you earn the DKP and can spend it as you see fit. Our Guild leader is a lock and we have 3 others who raid with us, and as said, never been any drama at all.
---
Incendius?
---
I just don't view getting people to stop what they are doing and walk you through stuff that they don't have any interest in for their character as actually "part of the game," at least not when it's functioning well. When the game is working well, there are people doing a wide range of activities and you join up with the people who are doing what you're doing.
---
I mean, if you put zero effort into googling how to do the jump I can see how you could mess it up. 
---
If you watch a 15 second video though...
---
Until i get actual people to notice and not assholes? yeah a few more :)

**[NA][Alliance][PVE with a dash of PVP]**
---
**Semi-hardcore player, with a hardcore mentality, looking for a guild**
---
**Details**
---
* Server: Any now that servers are open but *heavily* wanting to transfer to a PVE server. (Currently based on a PVP server).
---
* Location: EST
---
* Available days: Friday, Saturday, Sunday. Weekend raiding. Sadly, life prevents me from raiding during the week most times.
---
* 30 years old, work a 9-5 job
---
* Class/role: DPS Warrior with a few pieces of tank stuff for when I need to.
---
* Primarily a PVE player however I do love PVP/BGs as well. I made it to rank 10 in the original rank 14 grind and hit 2400 RBG in Legion.
---
* Short history: Was a hardcore raider from the very beginning days of Molten Core and cleared everything to Sapphiron in Naxx.
---
* Classic experience: Nearly full BiS (Save for MC weapons. Viskag and Brutality blade just refuse to drop). Have my Lionheart, Quel'serrar, Onyxia necklace, etc. pretty much done gearing until BWL save for offspec tank pieces. Mining and armor smithing professions are maxed. Grinded out Darnassus rep for my epic mount. Logs available upon request. 
---
Had to take a small step away from the game mid-November due to life changes and now I can really only raid on the weekend but I want to keep going. I want to finish what I started all those years ago and do Naxxramas. While playtime may have suffered a bit I have maintained my hardcore mindset over the years and it has never waned to this day. Retail mythic raiding doesn't interest me much anymore due to the state of modern WoW but the last thing I did before Classic was heroic CoS and battle for dazar'alor. Outside of Classic I have hardcore raided in other games - FFXIV Ultimate modes being one of them. 
---
Hope to hear from someone soon.
---
I can be reached here on reddit or via discord @ Arte#4321
---
Thank you.
---
Hell, WC3 reforged is one of the most customer friendly remakes I've seen in gaming period.
---
You get *all* the gameplay for free, the new reforged version's basically just a justification to keep updating the engine. This is awesome, yet people still find ways to complain.
---
Blizz isn't perfect and their communication regarding reforged is far from even decent, but the model of monetization is 100% fair.
---
&gt;	even after letting him know he was stealing my mobs
---
He did use language to explain what was happening
---
I love how, for the majority of alliance players, every instance of losing one battle means a severe decrease in "game quality".
---
Get ganked? No game quality, transfer away. Threaten and laugh at horde players "because they're stuck on their PvE servers now" or "because AQ opens late", it's their own fault!
---
Lose an AV? No game quality, deny AV. Threaten and laugh at horde players "because their queue times will get worse".
---
Guys, wake up.
---
TIL my sever isn't high pop
---
I've done night shifts here and there and every once in a while I'll have a weekday off where I get on at 6 or 7 am - those are always the best dungeon groups imo
---
We are playing with patch 1.12 itemization and talents. BWL is going to be walk over. Stop hyping the difficulty of vanilla it just doesn't exist until Naxx.
---
No changes
---
Its mostly random. If you start on small number the second player has very minimal advantage.  
---
It about 3% if you start from 5, about 1% on 10 and completely irrelevant on 100
---
Love your videos, keep em comin.
---
Isn't there a limit cap on how many attempts you can get on Chromaggus (sand)? I see that boss being a blocker for more casual guilds.
---
It can be done without mount though.
---
Chaos is a ladder
---
&gt;*one of those people that just believes we should take what we get and that's that*
---
No, I believe you've made a choice and if you don't like it you're free to change that choice. You sound like an idiot if you don't like something but refuse to accept your ability to do anything about it...
---
When I botted I immediately left the area if someone else wanted to farm. Anything is profitable if you bot it all the time (made my guild a fortune with fishing years ago)
---
No i dont remember dota or cs chats, i didnt play competitive games back then and i dont do now for obvious reasons.
---
Like i said... toxicity did exist but it did not exist as much as it does today.
---
Classic is a prime  example of how community has changed overtime.
---
2005-2006 flamelash-situation? never happened. Yet it was the exact same game.. more or less.
---
Infantry Online was the first purely PvP-based game i ever played and this was before Dota or CS was even a thing. Hackers existed,  toxicism existed... but does not mean it was just as prevalent as today.
---
What do you mean, the meta started out with every game being zerg rushes to the enemy base and ally were winning like 90% of games and only losing the ones where they fucked up. The meta changed because Horde realized that sending back around 10 defenders to stall the rush and wipe the ally would give their offense time to win. Sure, Horde has a chance in a rush vs. rush situation just like Ally has a chance in a turtle, but those chances are only due to the other team being worse
---
I'm letting locks have a chance at spell power since I'm denying them mana cord and choker
---
1. Join the deathballs, and as rogue you can try to skip ahead of ur team if they kill stuff and skip past any horde defenders.
---
2. You can't queue av as a team, you can queue at the same time, but not all will end up in the same battle
---
nexus crystals will be nigh on worthless. You only need a handful per raider and by the time AQ is available, your guild will easily get 30-40 per week from disenchanting drops from MC, BWL and ZG.
---
Thank you. Your advice is the most helpful and aligned with what I had in mind
---
Our DKP system goes like this: we get set number of dkp per boss kill, get to raids on time, stay to the end of raid. We have no dkp decay and there is no guild rank distribution (officers&gt;members&gt;trials). 
---
Each piece has a fixed cost of 200dkp (there is no bids) and the item goes to the person that wants the item with the highest dkp. Say even if someone has high dkp enough to get 2 items in a raid they will spend there 400 dkp wich means those who wanted the item but didnt get it will have those 400 dkp more next time around so sooner or later all will have the desired items and prevents loot drama. It works for us but ofcourse  there is no perfect system.
---
I think we have a cap at 300, so you wouldnt go over this.  If you have the DKP, then spend it as you see fit. If you really want an item, bid high, if you dont, then bid low. Its really simple. 
---
Also, not everyone makes every raid, so DKP totals are normally all over the place.  
---
Point is, there is always going to be issues with any loot, as there are 40 players in a raid. But as said, we've been raiding MC and Ony now for 3 mths without 1 piece of loot drama. We're doing 18-20 man Ony's and clearing MC in about 90 mins.  Everyone is getting well geared and getting loot, so as said, so far no issue. 
---
We have about 4 locks, including the GM, and have about 7-8 mages, and so far no issue with any of them over loot.
---
They don't. I haven't set a foot in their as soon as I got my rep and do not plan to do so any time soon
---
Grinding in general is just more efficient overall between 20-40 at least. I got my hunter to lvl 40 in just under 48h played, by only doing the intro quests, Barrens and the rest I just manually farmed.
---
Its mind-numbing, but efficient as hell.
---
Next thing to get input is the buy wow tokens
---
The coefficient is bad so if you wanna stack spellpower you better aim for some breakpoint. Otherwise just stats
---
There is nothing cancerous about aoe farming at all. It's a smart way to level. It's everyone involved who does it that is cancerous. 
---
Pulling mobs, getting opposite faction to destroy them. We had a huge guild war start over two level 30s fighting over aoe lol
---
Skip Galv, rush Drek with full 40 and end the game. Ends up like 600 rep for a less than 10 min game. A ton of people are going for honor at this point and want to do Galv for the extra 1k honor or so, but I have dropped to less than 1k rep an hour the last couple of days.
---
Someone needs to make a premade discord for people with 60% mounts that are trying to get rep and not honor. I might try after work.
---
Exactly. I‚Äôm not linking anything i just want people to join me, like wow god forbid I actually want friends and some content too?
---
which checks out since queues are 15 mins and games are 15 mins
---
People stop caring, after hitting R14 and get the weapons you have no reason to keep farming, some people might even hit R13 get the gear and stop short of the weapons if they aren't a massive upgrade and the R14 race is too saturated
---
Yeah you are right, it does still help with mainhand hit.
---
In our raid PvP need/style need is &gt; any need of a first time participant.   
---
Important drops are only available if choosen as 1of2 epics you can  roll for (will probably replenish about every 3months).    
---
Setpieces are dkp-ish.    
---
Tank/legendarys are loot-counciled by officers.    
---
I like our lootsystem but it took us a while until we were all happy with it.
---
It‚Äôs like 1.5/ea on my server haha.
---
By this logic no DPS class is necessary, also 2h warriors are very good on Horde-side
---
I work 7p to 7a... my guild raids at 6p... i need to find a new one i think. 
---
But i love the nightshift players when im off
---
Any server ~~that is balanced probably~~
---
ftfy
---
I left a guild that did this
---
People are too loyal
---
If they do silly shit like this in MC you gonna have a bad time in rest of classic
---
For a Warlock, mageblade is one of very few itens that is a significant upgrade in MC over what you can get outside raids
---
Others being choker of firelord, and maybe t2 pants.
---
"This isn't going fast enough, I'll just pull them all! Wait why are we all back at the base?! Fucking alliance suck so much!"
---
best place for these was always in Southshore, next the the stables where the Deadmines entrance is. You can fly to Gromgol and run up from there, there are like 6-10 birds all close together.
---
What if you lose internet connection?
---
Uh, BRE.
---
&gt; Ya the top bracket on Fairbanks has a few obvious botters and it's pretty sad.
---
What makes it obvious? I have a hard time believing that anyone would bot on an account they are trying to reach rank 14 on.
---
You can never kill again
---
The warrior was clearly 60 for a while (look at dalrends), he just came to celebrate.
---
I grinded furbolgs in winterspring for eko and firewater and runecloth. When I hit exalted I bought a) epic mount b) 2x crusader enchant + full enchant for my gear except helm, c) lionheart helm, d) flury axe, e) leveled ingi to 300
---
if you can farm them for 1-2h without interruption or others that¬¥s quite a lot of gold.
---
Yeah that method is called forming a premade
---
I've stopped playing with 7k to go. I'll come back later, but for now I'm kind of over the insane toxic mess that is our AV games.
---
What server?
---
If your solution creates another problem and you're not addressing how to fix that as well, then you're not offering a solution, just shifting the problem.
---
Nah dog 12ft tall
---
Are you just posting this same thing then deleting it and reposting it?
---
Yeeeehawww enjoy my man. Great server.
---
"I‚Äôll try to be streaming almost everyday on twitch starting tomorrow 12/19/2019. @soleoTv"
---
Stop playing dumb dude, and fyi your stream is not going anywhere. Your 2 friends might hop in and say hi, but thats about it. Good luck though!
---
Well there's part of the problem: A) It's Desolace, not very popular for anything but Maraudon, and B) You're trying to a Reputation-specific quest and most people don't even bother picking sides, and those that do may not have picked the same side as you. I ignore the Centaur entirely, personally.
---
You can't really judge "inactivity" on an extremely niche boss that a huge chunk of the playerbase probably doesn't know exists and is behind a rep-grind wall in an unpopular lower-level zone
---
Pssst, he just wants a pocket healer.
---
Yea more presents on the 25th
---
&gt;  the fucky one where you clip up a cliff?
---
Is that why I've seen horde appear in the northen bunker at our base out of nowhere?
---
You can track it with TellMeWhen.
---
How is honor worthless? What an ignorant comment
---
I'm like 1/4th that
---
Level 59! Almost at 60. I've played this game for 200+ hours over 3 months, that's the most I've played any game for many years (though I had 2500 hours on my vanilla WoW main character). Since BGs came out I'm finally able to play normally again, questing around the high level areas. Still lots of fun, but will probably quit once I've achieved my goal of getting my epic mount (at 700g now).
---
I get this system but it's just like round Robin. Not everyone is the same on boss fights even though they're there to kill it. I just have a hard time giving stuff to my low performing healers and dps
---
What do you mean by aim for some breakpoint? And some basically the best gear you can do this in would be mostly t1 gear
---
Amp curse is fantastic. Not only does it boost your damage but raid wise, amp cow is popular. Plus coe has it uses. I just leveled sm/ruin and haven‚Äôt changed the build.
---
Yes there is, but its not hard to dispel. Limited attempts does not matter when then mechanics are easy.
---
The boss is most likely not "tuned" for 40 raiders.. you can have 10 players doing nothing but dispelling, 10 players die to random breaths and it's still a kill.
---
&gt; I think that's pretty childish to be honest.
---
sure bud.
---
good thing there's no shortage of DPS'er who won't roll on healing/tanking gear without asking.
---
I did it twice because the first post made it seem like i was ‚Äúself promoting‚Äù.
---
Yeah it was exactly that ahahah
---
All members of the Horde are warriors first. 
---
Even the Clothies.
---
I'm sorry but a server with only one active faction is not a "perfectly normal server from Horde's point of view". You'll notice this once the AQ War Effort starts and the gates won't open even though Horde has completed all their goals. If Alliance is truly dead on Flamelash, Horde will need to create some Alliance characters to complete those goals, or you'll whine at Blizzard until they complete the Alliance goals for you.
---
It's most likely going to be the second option, and Blizzard will do it cause Blizzard has a huge throbbing hard cock for Horde.
---
Paladin mount is 350g + 6 arcanite bars (around 360g on my servers) + \~25g worth of other mats. Plus a couple of dungeon runs (UD Strat, DM W, and Scholo). Total cost 740g. 
---
AV mount is 640g I believe (may require Rank 3 for this price), so likely cheaper. Also being a true mount it has some benefits such as not requiring mana to use, not triggering mp5, and not being dispellable.  It does take up 1 bag slot though. 
---
Overall, since you will want exalted AV rep anyway for offhand, you probably want to get the AV mount.
---
As someone in a loot ocuncil DKP Guild, i can tell you that the constant arguing by "some" people is worse than any Kind of DKP shenanigans.
---
People are perfectly fine with arguing for Offspeccs in our Raid, until they get a drop that some mainspecc could have used and all hell breaks loose. I'm no offspecc myself and i'm annoyed to no end, as is the whole raidlead.
---
But well, our LC tries to be "nice" and "transparent" imho a sure way to create a failure. With the start of BWL we will go DKP with very few rules. Honestly, I can't wait.
---
Plan is to get the boots and arcanist helm and then swap off the star and belt for one of the chokers and a mana igniting cord. I'm aware the hit is probably better in the long run but I just really want stronger raid items to replace my pre bis items.
---
weird question, but im sticking with Feral druid in Classic, doing the "tryhard" hybrid thing, will i be rewarded greatly in TBC? is it still as "punishing" to be competitive vs rogue dps? (if TBC comes ofc)
---
Get honorspy and shoot for bracket 11 every week and you should get it in roughly 9 weeks.  Depending on your server you need to shoot for about 350k honor a week
---
Can I ask what is the point of this thread? 
---
"I was enjoying the game quite a bit, but now I'm seriously considering if I want to continue my subscription. Which feels kinda sad, I love this game, but I can't help but feel so disappointed."  
---
Why do you need external validation to determine whether or not you spend your own money? Seems trivial. If you really wanted to, you can think of reasons why you're having difficulties finding groups. Many people in this thread of listed some of them.
---
Earthfury here too, horde side! #5 on our side had 900k honor.
---
This is my first time playing WoW ever i dunno what‚Äôs wrong with it ahhaha
---
As a 41 Warr playing since launch I have no idea what a dalrend is
---
..?
---
Is the 10 minute respawn just in EPL or is that overall? As I have been reading from a few places it's around 30 mins
---
What do you mean? I'm just looking at a BiS spreadsheet, it says truestrike but then somebody told me if I'm at hit cap 6% without truestrike then use something like Valor.
---
It's reasonably accurate. If you think about it, even with a fast Alliance rush the Horde mages are ready to slow behind Belinda before the Alliance have even crossed the Field of Strife.
---
I went from 30% rank 1 to 50% rank 2. Which is great. I farmed 20k yday and will do this one more night and lets see if I get to rank 3.
---
tame the pet which has the spell you want to learn and play with the tamed pet like 20mins and watch your chat / beast training spell until it tells you you learned the spell
---
meh. d2 would be sick

also RE2:Remake was actually good as fuk. I can't wait for 3:re to come out

Christ you sound bitter.

Dreamfoil prices crashed because of dm east farm.
---
Thanks!

It's cluttered and takes up more than it has too.
---
Look at bartender.
---
Nowadays servers are more or less one time zone only. In vanilla I played on Spinebreaker US and had raided with a US guild, Oceanic and a European guild on the same server depending on my school schedule... I'm afraid that is very difficult nowadays.
---
Thanks! I appreciate it :)
---
Mortal strike on some drakes that heal.
---
I hate to hear that for you man, but I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs an issue with content.  What happens when BWL, aq, and naxx come out at this rate? The entirety of classic will be out before June if BWL was released right now. 
---
We just had our first full 40 man raid, and a 3 hour 19 minute ony through the entire of molten core clear time last night. 
---
Classic isn‚Äôt only about raiding. It‚Äôs a game. If you can‚Äôt build a community that people want to be a part of, you will bleed members constantly. We lose members regularly, but we‚Äôre constantly recruiting and picking up new people. Sometimes we absorb smaller guilds who‚Äôve fallen apart due to a lack of community. 
---
Build a community that people want to be a part of, and people will stick around.
---
correction:
---
25 ppl rush, 10ppl def, 5 people run around sightsee'ing... jerking off in the mine /cave or just AFK somewhere.

Ballpark how many AV runs would get to this rep?

---
Rogues and non-orc warriors worship those and run UBRS for weeks. More prevalent on alliance side, though.
---
As someone who relies on herbing and alchemy transmutes botting affects me in the following way.
---
Lower prices on herbs and less herbs means less gold/h if I farm.
---
Botting has also lowered the prices on certain essence of water, so I make less money on my daily transmute.
---
Me having less money whilst things that I use my money for costing the same or increasing means that I have to spend more time farming money.
---
You have to use the scorpion for a while and eventually it shows up in your list, then you can train the cat.  I may be wrong, my hunter is only 26 and I've been using the rare spawn scorpion from durotar the whole time.
---
If you think you‚Äôre alone mining and things aren‚Äôt lining up, do a /who 60 rogue or 60 Druid. There‚Äôs been plenty of times where I‚Äôve met someone and j the way in while I‚Äôm on the way out stealthed.
---
First time?
---
this is account sharing, but Blizzard with never know. Its your account, and they'll be logging in from the same IP address so absolutely zero issue here.  
---
I have two subs, so I could level a twink also, with out asking guildies for loads of help to do stuff.
---
Thalnos- Full Clear
---
You're right. I personally find the menial, unfun task of leveling to be repetitive and boring. I'll just use a bot to level for me. Making gold for my gear is also an unfun and boring. I'll just use a bot to make me gold so I don't have to worry about it.
---
Now that I think about it why don't I skip all these steps and have a fully geared toon start at level 60? That way in can skip all these menial tasks and start playing the game.
---
These sever transfers are getting out of hand! Haha
---
I‚Äôm new to WoW am I doing something wrong?
---
No need to put hardcore in quotation marks there, just accept it.
---
There‚Äôs pretty much 0 reason to go swordsmithing. Drop it and go engineering.
---
Just buy it on the auction house if you really need it. Money items should always be all need.
---
Sometimes you need to go on snowball duty and send them back with a deserter buff.
---
Sleepless farming? How does one achieve such powers?
---
Also servers in classic are much bigger than in vanilla. So "low" pop would actually be a full vanilla server
---
why would he leave?
---
If you know the pulls and the skips it's not that challenging. Most bosses die in under a minute so it's just getting the trash pulls down and making sure you don't pull any extra trash by mistake. There are even sub 30 min speedruns on YouTube if you're interested. The fastest ones have like 20 warriors or more in the raid though, so it's not really practical. My guild did a 53 min clear last night and we aren't super hardcore or anything.
---
Gearing with the purpose of maximizing ur dmg on hellfire is basically worthless. If you are using it for farming it would only be worth it when you have increased the tic damage enough to bring down the needed hits from 10 to 9 for example. Otherwise for pure dmg crit is probably the most valuable stat for aoe abilities
---
And what exactly does this post seem like?
---
No joke some guy asked in world chat today if it would be a good server to transfer his entire 160+ member guild over to. That sort of stuff scares me.
---
I agree. I barely played Private Servers because I always just had the "They could delete everything" mentality. I played retail from Classic through every single expansion and saw the community get sucked out of the game. The world being a highly interactive lobby while waiting for Dungeons, Raids &amp; PvP pops, even Mythic's got ousted from the community feel with Premade Finder and Raider.io.
---
Once classic got announced I went onto a private server and levelled up 2 characters to 60 to pick what I wanted to level in Classic. I loved it so much I have levelled both of those classes to 60 in Classic, my Mage is pretty much fully decked out and my Rogue is pre-raid bis with a few tier items. The game is quite a lot easier than retail when you compare raid difficulties and the loot system is a lot nicer. I can actually get my Best in Slot items when they drop and not feel bad that it didn't Titan Forge into a higher ilvl equivalent. 
---
I hope this game stays around for a long time because I have made life long friends from Classic, something I hadn't done on WoW since early Cata.
---
Then you are shit out of luck, if you don't get it back before a GM will answer the ticket.
---
Why would he leave after winning the item...??
---
AQ40 might hit people right in the face. The amount of preparation and the cost of consumables goes up enough that at least on private servers, this is where the semi-hardcore guilds get separated from the hardcore. True casual guilds don't really care as they are happily progressing AQ20.
---
What's the gossip on how xfers have influenced Firemaw?
---
Don't go to Grobb. Dead server. Horde steamroll Alliance 24/7 and since they're earning more honor world-farming than in the BGs, they never stopped the roving packs of high-level murderhobos running around. 
---
My level 42 warrior is completely cockblocked in southern Burning Steppes right now. No way out, the patrols of orcs and undead rogues just waiting to murdilate you if you head for Loch Modan. They're probably in ranks five deep from Agamon's End to Uldaman.
---
Not to mention the really shitty culture there. If you don't roleplay a dwarf, prepare  to be the gimp taking it up the nethers. They might even have the hunter pets take their turn in the machinima porn they force you to do.
---
...and don't get me started with the gnomes. I'll never look at a gnome the same fucking way again.
---
Any guild on eu horde recruting for late night raids? Atleast starting at 22 server time
---
Yeah, I get it first time now most games, but it took a lot of finesse to get the angle right.
---
Laughable piece of human trash (:
---
I deathrolled with randoms for up to 300g. Never had someone bailing out.
---
But it doesn't give frostwolfs rep?
---
He literally said "pvp is not something I am interested in"
---
also i've literally gotten 3-5 gold on like 20 greens worth over 1G in AH??
---
I intended to hit 60 before January and I've been hanging out at 52 for a bit, enjoying instant AV queues with little time to play otherwise lately. I have a bunch of time off work coming up with the holidays, so I'm still on track to meet my deadline if I get down to it over the break.
---
Unbridled Animus raids @ 1:30 AM CST on Monday/Wed/Thursday, on Kurinaxx alliance. Add Apollexis#1142 on real ID if you're looking to raid that late.
---
Horde or Alliance?
---
Take my upvote, good sir.
---
I was in a smaller guild that got merged with them recently, and ye they seem like awesome people :)
---
There is a warrior DPS spreadsheet. Where you can pick your gear and buffs and it will sim your dps. Lets you look at upgrades and so on.
---
On a side note what weponds you using? Since there's a chance distracting dagger can do a lot for you since you have the gloves :)

If you do make one, I suggest naming it something that might indicate that you're an early morning guild. &lt;Third Shifters&gt; or something of the like, might make recruitment easier
---
Increased casting range? Is that stemmed from their hitbox size, same as why their leeway range is larger?
---
As a follow-up, then: how do i properly execute the #oneshot? Am I supposed to do the following?
---
- CS right at energy tick: -40 energy, 80 remaining
---
- Hemo x2: -70 energy, 10 remaining
---
- over the 4 seconds of stun, +40 energy, 50 remaining
---
- CB+Eviscerate: -35 energy, 15 remaining, hope enemy is dead
---
You are obviously on a bad server.
---
On horde as a premade all you get are alliance premades. Get one of equal skill and it becomes quite the stalemate.
---
^This
---
When delusion makes you feel intelligent.
---
Not gearing for it specifically, but on occasions when I know I'm going to be aoeing I want items in my bag that will maximising that situation, more for farming and dungs, for pure dmg crit wouldn't be the most valuable as you have 0 chance of critting while aoeing
---
We can only group up because ya'll zerged the horde Race. If queues were even you could form groups too. Ya'll ruined the "Classic Experience" not us lol.
---
I've had one where on the run to Galv someone said "It's already lost, just let them win".
---
I keep telling myself he had to be joking.
---
For some reason, this doesn't work. I think somewhere in the triggers for all of the user submitted ones (they all use a very similar custom trigger), it says to hide the tick if energy is at 100. It's buried in the lua, but I can't code, so I'm lost how to change it.
---
I like to deathroll a bit, after doing it a little the past week I‚Äôve come to know some ‚Äútrusted‚Äù rollers, who I know have payed out in the past. We warn each other of scammers and refer other ‚Äútrusted‚Äù players to eachother
---
if u arent exalted yet then you havent zerged much if at all
---
White Bandit Mask is the way to go for Small Radiant Shards.
---
I was at the tower near galv, waited patiently for the dwarf to run all the way up the top,  and yeeted him down the hill, it was glorious.  The AV snowballs are so much fun.
---
It's true, and its great - refreshing in fact
---
&gt;make the mats more plentiful on the AH. That's a pretty big gain in my book. What do i lose from bots? Nothing.
---
they should just make a vendor that hands out all consumables for free so we don't have to worry about these trivial and inconvenient things that get in the way of our weekly raid which is the only thing that matters
---
I started farming lashers at level 55 on my mage with trash gear.  You should be able to do it at 60 in any spec
---
Going into RFC isnt that nad. Just get all the quests and its and easy level.
---
I cant speak for the alliance side, but benediction horde is pretty solid.
---
Except for that occasional douchebag that drops ony head at terrible off times.
---
I mean if you see that it's going nowhere, you should leave. It's not fun but if you're trying to rank that's how it is.
---
I get such a pure joy from watching people have a blast experiencing stuff for the first time that I've done a million times
---
Hs queue only affects your offhand.
---
What does player interaction have to do with anything? 
---
Instant gratification? No not necessarily instant but a video game is a lot about how it's meant to feel gratifying.
---
To be specific i'm talking about lower tier stuff has slowly been becoming as expensive as higher tier stuff i suppose because of a lack of people leveling and level 60's who are farming will just spend their time farming the highest tier stuff. I love that option of choosing lower tier and cheaper elixirs when i don't wanna invest much in a 5-man but still want to be a bit stronger.
---
It's not just that i want the mats to be more accessible, i also don't enjoy farming mats and have a hard time seeing why anybody would enjoy it. So bots seems like an allaround solution... and u guys thinking that layering or bots is what turns classic wow into retail wow just makes me feel how bad u guys are putting the finger on what the actual problems. You know there's problems but can't put ur finger on what it is, so you take stabs in the dark.
---
¬†'You have not lived today until you have done something for someone who can never repay you.'

I did tailoring and enchanting on my main dude, and was at 160g by level 40! I have spent a ton on alts and my SO (so many minor speed enchants and fiery) but now I‚Äôm level 52 and have about 200g and tons of enchanting mats on deck. 
---
You can totally do it ez if you know what to tailor and DE, and play the AH correctly!
---
It's under the assumption that you will continue the same amount of effort. 
---
If for whatever reason you were chilling in the previous weeks and only now start playing hardcore you will get it faster. Maximum amount of time is 3months from start to finish if you're the #1 spot on your faction on your server.
---
The gods of RNG do not look favorably upon you.
---
Don't you mean since battleground was added? Because once phase 2 hit, it was literally ganktown anywhere you went.
---
Ouro is a douche with that fancy 2Hander.
---
What are you whining about now?
---
There was another post the other day with some statics (can‚Äôt find it). If the games are longer than 18 minutes, horde has a big chance of wining.
---
Ruined honor grind for the people who have a set premade ~18 hours a day. These people had an advantage. Now anyone can solo queue and put in the time.
---
You group with them.
---
There's more streamers with "R14" in their titles than there actually will be R14 players.
---
"I turtled every AV for the past 2 days" lol. Horde don't even realize when they are playing bad. If you're in a longer than 10 minute game you're not winning.
---
Rush galv, burn him fast while pulling as many LT's into the room as possible. AOE them after.
---
Round up the rest of the LTs on the way to Frostwolf, AoE them. Take Frostwolf Relief hut and hold it while pulling warmasters 1 by 1 (unless you're coordinated enough to do the drek solo pull without someone fucking it up and resetting him), then kill drek.
---
It's hard to lose this way. The only way you typically lose is if people just don't stick together and follow the plan, or dumbasses pull too many warmasters several times and everyone gets cleaved to death. Pro tip on that: you don't have to get into combat with the warmasters if someone pulls too many. You can just back off and stay out of combat so everyone doesn't wipe. Let the guy who pulled too many die on his own.
---
Does this mean we can finally migrate characters over to new accounts? Apparently this is allowed in Retail but not in Classic, at least not as of two weeks ago when I was attempting to do it.
---
Or the other three.
---
What's it like having a dopamine addiction?
---
you don't get 1K dps on domo just multidotting.
---
I've fiddled around with it in some of the WAs I've downloaded... Deleting conditions, adding an "always show" one, but I doing something wrong cause it won't work.
---
I think its on every server. I am in it on Atiesh.
---
*tips fedora* I‚Äôm still just trying to level.
---
you have to type the konami code while logging in
---
As a mage, having no competition would be really good. Some farming is impossible during peak on herod
---
I love zoning into AV and seeing a bunch of badass orcs and taurens with shields, means its probably gonna be a win.
---
Has all been done before, if you wanna do it right you will have to do research instead of asking oneliners on reddit.
---
Okay, I'm going to do some tests soon, mine a vein and just afk till it spawns back (or a node around it)
---
Horde wins most often when they rush Balinda and then a quarter to half the raid hearths back to Frostwolf to defend while the rest push for victory. Basically if the horde can backcap while not sacrificing too much on offense they win. If horde don‚Äôt do this alliance wins the rush war.
---
TBH, our tier set kinda sucks for healing but it's good for PvP. Those non-tier leather pieces are sick though.
---
Thus past week literally made me hate the honor system. "It'd be nice to rank up a little and get the pvp blues"
---
1200 HKs, hours and hours of AV, 150k honor, didn't move out of rank 3. I'm just not going to bother. I'll pvp for the fun of it.
---
Yeah, I said for Alliance to come. You‚Äôre always referring to the wPVP phase that is now over.
---
So what are we discussing? Actually there is any interrogatory statement in your whole post ‚Äî what input are you looking for? You‚Äôre just venting/looking for validation, for a decision that ultimately rests on your shoulders.
---
There are so many things that are wrong with av that this one is just irrelevant. If it is a rush game alliance wins if it is a mid-late game usually horde wins. 
---
Also the horde have to put more effort into winning than the alliance by using shortcuts killing most of the marshals when alliance can just rush in and even pull drek alone without the marshals.
---
Why? For what??
---
Alright well it sounds like I'll be going into AV tonight when I get home. Do I just go to the Battlemaster in IF and get like teleported there? Can I queue into it alone? Also my primary pet has been a bear that's level 52 right now, I recently got Broken Tooth but he's still only at level 43, is it still better to use BT for this?
---
Sorry about all the questions, I don't know the first thing about how any of this works. You've been a huge help in explaining what I have to gain from BGs, now I just need to figure out the logistics of getting into one and making sure I'm able to hold my own once I'm in. I'm watching some youtube guides on them, but they seem to be assuming a baseline understanding that I just don't have.
---
He said they have a Ret pally
---
You would get loads of damage from a tier1 3 set bonus balance druid with improved thorns
---
Festivus for Shartacus!
---
Ony Scale Cloaks, look at the mats requires to make them
---
Every raider will need one
---
Yes but I mean the other part of the chain
---
I‚Äôve never stayed at that cave as horde always start at the one beside the horde base. Is the start different in classic?
---
My biggest complaint is it's not pvp.. I'm winning games with like 2 HKs but thousands of honor for rushing the lieutenants and vandar.
---
Bulgarian, afaik
---
The addon it blames is random for me, every time. Sometimes it says Prat is the issue. Sometimes it says Bartender is the issue. Sometimes it says LunaUnitFrames is the issue. And rarely, it just works.
---
To do DM North tribute solo you need 200 engineering to blast the door with seaforium charges, so no.
---
Leveling engineering is actually relatively cheap so I wouldn't be concerned with taking mining to feed engineering, but up to you.
---
Not online so I can't test right now but I'm pretty sure hellfire can crit but not rain if fire
---
I actually enjoy adventuring in the open world, and gathering mats.  Especially when it nets me a big pay day.  Not being able to turn a profit with herbing and alchemy is somewhat disappointing imho.
---
If you only knew the suffering I've been through
---
If you're trying to rank, then you shouldn't defend at all. Any game that lasts longer than 10 minutes means you're losing vs the actual rankers. You're not playing vs Ally, you're playing vs the other Horde.
---
Do you have an Auction House add-on like Auctioneer?
---
If so I'd say the best way to estimate the actual number of horde on each server is to check the total number of AH listings on the Horde side. Compare it to the total number on the PvP server you're on now. That should give you a rough idea of the total number of people playing Horde on that server compared to your current server.
---
The players returning just to try out battlegrounds did not make honor in a relevant amount. If anything, they made it easier by inflating the pool size.
---
Hey which add-on does that for you?
---
Ah ur 1 of those people who dunno how to farm gold in more fun ways. Because i rather not turn off my brain for hours on end like you do while you farm mats... i rather stimulate my brain and improve my mechanics. 
---
As if you don't hope for those arcane crystals when you're farming rich thorium veins... you're hoping for them because dopamine is what everybody's brain relies on to function.
---
Just be ready for your map to blow up with herb nodes. I have herb locations disabled when I'm questing so I can actually see WTF is on the map.
---
"my guild took me 2 times to MC and I almost full tier" sounds like a druid to me, I see guilds in chat basically giving away druid tier because they cant use it, would rather give it to a random player than DE it
---
The lulz every time I see someone in a bg with edgemaster's
---
If you are a prot warrior why not tank galv + warmasters + drek instead of defending. Wouldn't that be more effective?
---
It definitely has existed but knowing how we humans work, people didnt figure it out instantly when internet became a thing.
---
Not everyone has 200IQ and only the geniuses would figure it out immediately and capitalize on it... but then again what is there to capitalize if you are the world first internet-retard? :D  
---
I would say the reason why people werent as toxic back in the day because those people even tho they were kids they still grew up in a world without internet and social network.  
---
Heck im old enough that my first 2 phones werent touchscreen and didnt have internet in them, they were only for calling and sending texts and later crappy photos too.
---
So if you wanted to be mean to others  you had to do it to their face... it was not as simple as just write a message "you  suck" and press enter. If you wanted to do an anonymous mean-prank you had to put some effort to it and dont get caught doing it either.
---
It's all a conspiracy to make Darnassus relevant!
---
Dude I get 200 rep in a 10 minute game. I spend 15 minutes for it to pop. So I earn like 400-500rep per hour.
---
I get 800-1200 rep in a 20-50 minute win. I get more rep in a  2 hour game than I'd get in an equal amount of time spend losing 10 minute games.
---
before you go, whisper someone in my guild "disposable heroes" we are a 10/10 and 1/1 mature guild looking to fill our core ranks.
---
Not saying the server is balanced or imbalanced, I have no idea, but checking SW is not really a good way, since everyone hangs out in IF. SW is to IF like UC is to Org.
---
Put a ton of chili in it aswell. Make it hot... like fire.
---
Wasn't honor as a currency as opposed to a ranking mechanic also a #nochanges option?
---
Did a few last night, and it was all Horde wins.  
---
Both teams had a low amount of defense (5-15 people at most) and horde did a better job of capping the bunkers in mid.  As a horde druid, I picked off stragglers for awhile for the first 5-10 minutes on D and eventually rode north once Horde had a good lead on capping bunkers and the northern graveyards secured. 
---
Defense doesn't mean "wipe the attackers entirely".  To me it means slow them down sufficiently where they can't kill warmasters, or defend the towers.  If you wipe the attack entirely, then they all res further back and may decide to just go and wipe your offense, thus Turtle which no one really wants. 
---
I still cannot fathom why Ally doesn't kill some of hte Horde lieutenants, they're free honor and easy kills and you have to ride right past them!
---
INB4 some "south eastern Europe" govt claimed it was "Against their sensibilities".
---
My pc can handle it fairly well but my laptop almost catches fire in this mess.. I just zoom in and look down and the ground while navigating using the minimap
---
Yourewaifu to make sure you sound even dumber than a guy that naming his character Yourwaifu
---
Shadowbolts yeah.
---
We dont AoE everything on this fight.  We sheep some casters and 1 by 1 the rest, leaving up a caster as the last mob standing then kill.
---
You dont have to beleive me, recount showed me.  Was 5/6 overall damage but crazy dps.
---
Honor resets every week you just have to regrind it all over again !! /s
---
The backdoor is only useful if the game lasts long enough to cap a GY.
---
Let's not forget fishing for the hp/5 or mp/5 food.
---
I agree. I only spent points in claw. Use the left over points for another resistance. For example, frost and shadow resistance is good for pvp. Since molten core is the current raid fire resistance would be good for pve.
---
Anyone explain what this is trying to show cuz horde def do not start in that cave?
---
Add that trinket from Rag, and the Nagerling Ring from BRD, and that fire aura trinket from LBRS for a meta "stop hitting yourself" build.
---
If you‚Äôre a high level you can even get crazy and go to the night elf side in dark shore and start killing owls
---
Shhhhh! I‚Äôm still trying to buy this damn pattern! Don‚Äôt let everyone know!
---
Sounds like Shadow Weaving and Power Infusion...
---
Get a grip dude, exalted takes what, 50+ games of AV and it has been out for two weeks.  That is easily 20-40 hours of time to get Exalted AV and you're talkin as if people haven't sniffed it if they aren't there yet.  Silly take.
---
Alright, I will when I‚Äôm out of work today. Anyone in particular I should whisper to talk it out?
---
Which addon are you using?
---
TBC waiting room
---
Yeah what happened to "will be released by 12/31/2019"?
---
Truly a hero of the people. Thank you for your efforts, comrade!
---
Player interaction is one of the key reasons to play an mmo.  I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt feel the same way.  
---
It is instant gratification.  MMOs have a more relaxed system in place for being rewarded.  Logging out, running a bit and coming back to an inventory of stuff you didn‚Äôt earn is instant gratification.  
---
Lower tier items becoming expensive is because people prefer a budget item and people who have a comparative advantage on the economic side.  People on both sides can profit, creating player interaction.  
---
I don‚Äôt think layering hurt WoW, but isn‚Äôt necessary now.  At the start we needed it for the sheer numbers of players in the game.  Now that we have spread out and less people log on routinely it has been removed for the better.  
---
I‚Äôm sorry you don‚Äôt enjoy improving your character.  I wish you did.
---
Azuresong has a healthy population and everyone I encountered seems to be an adult. I would say most likely a lot of the PvE servers are filled with adults that can't be bothered to deal with the pvp grind.
---
Swordsmithing is quite useless. We currently need an Axe Smith though.
---
sure you're 5th dps in your group with 1kdps and you kill adds one by one.  I kinda hope this is just a joke.
---
this is actually hilarious. i love seeing the world adapt to odd situations.

Alliance players seem to be incapable of doing anything but whine.
---
In the first few days when Alliance was wining 7 minute AVs everything was fine and it was just a show that Horde couldn't win fair fights 40v40, but now that Horde has changed tactics and started to defend suddenly the AV map magically stopped favoring Alliance...
---
Imagine being this wrong
---
The rank seven two piece set is BiS for so many specs and it's reasonably accessible for the average player.
---
Oh man I think you've completely misunderstood me here. I agreeing with you here.
---
It's like how I want to play the 60 WG bracket with different classes. I find that bracket the most fun because each class is at its highest potential with many different builds and gears sets to choose from.
---
Leveling to 60 once was a huge pain like I nearly quit more than a few times out of boredom. The idea of leveling another toon to 60, let alone another 8 toons, so that I can play what I want, when I want, fills me with so much dread.
---
I'll just use a bot instead so I can skip all the menial and unfun tasks of leveling yet another toon and finally get down to enjoying myself.
---
Can you clarify how you pull Drek solo?  I can't imagine how that works.
---
I think every server has that guy popping head just to get their neck piece and not waiting for raid times.
---
The bigger problem is a lot of game start with only 20 Ally zoned in. Horde still turn those games into turtles somehow...
---
Heartseeker Alliance has a few off hour raiding guilds
---
I don't play everyday tho, when new content comes out that's when I go hardcore.
---
I already consider WoW PvP mediocre at best in today's age.  It was far more new age and exciting back in vanilla.  I feel like twink PvP is only popular because certain classes are OP at certain tiers due to reliance on enchants and other items like engineering that are designed for higher lvl play.  So if I'm going to bother with meta gaming a mediocre PvP game I'm going to play at 60.
---
i believe there are some mail shoulders somewhere with a thorn hit of ~40 per hit taken
---
You guys are lucky, I just face premades 75% of the time :(
---
I am a level 60 protection Warrior and am one of the main tanks for my guild. I am curious to know, I see a lot of other Warriors out there that are in MC/ONY gear but none of them are ever hit capped. Is being hit cap not as important as being in full mitigation gear? Even the other tanks in my group have not prioritized hit until I brought it up to them. Am I putting an over emphasis on hit?
---
Theres a party system. 9/10 times if I‚Äôm competing for mobs with the same faction one of us just throws out a group invite. This is social and fun. It gets even more fun when a group of the opposite faction comes around and you‚Äôre put into a pvp battle with a mix of classes, levels and skills, usually unbalanced. 
---
The pve grind can be dull as it is. I can‚Äôt imagine having to watch the opposite faction slow my progress and have no ability to do anything about it.
---
Yep, plenty of herbalist backed out of open world farming and opted to DIre Maul. There was a huge wave once it was released, but another wave and market crash with honor released. Dreamfoil was ~80s each before DM, ~50s after DM, and then ~30s when open world PvP was introduced. Meanwhile Silversage has only gone up, with less people farming open world when DM was released and then even less farmers with open world PvP. 
---
I‚Äôm thinking herb prices will balance out again to what they were before open world PvP
---
Horde has it a bit tough. I pony‚Äôd up 3.5g for the recipe... then saw four of them for 1g a day later. 
---
...then I got one out of a mithril chest a few days later. Failed to sell for 70s a few times. Guh.
---
It's also awful seeing casters/healers standing in their melee range. When they charge people also get freaked out and just need to realize the Warmaster will go back to tank, it's not an agro drop. Also, they can be disarmed I believe which greatly reduces cleave damage.
---
They want to contribute to the *Classic Experience*‚Ñ¢ by rehashing complaints from back in the day on things that have already been changed, leading us to retail.
---
The Alliance side on benediction isn't to bad now that the douche horde have battle grounds and aren't corpse camping you galore.  It still favors the horde in % but it's got to be closer then most servers.
---
It might be because bg's just came out and at this point I think the vast majority of the player base is level 60 grinding honor. Might turn around in a week or so for you.
---
This is a good answer, I'm in a raiding guild with three raid groups (over 120 separate level 60s) but a lot of people are leveling alts in spare time.  if you throw something out there in /G you will likely find a buddy to do something with that may be logged on their main instead of their alt at the time
---
All EU servers are in one battlegroup, including russian servers
---
I literally said I don't agree with the guy, I'm all for reforged. I just said that being against reforge and playing classic isn't the slightest double standard, because it's nowhere near the same thing. 
---
If classic existed all these years and they re-launched a version with bfa models &amp; he bought that while dissing re-releases, he'd lack self awareness.
---
Two to three pieces till done getting my bis gear for bwl. Slow rolling av rep because I hate it. Going to be prioritizing getting my mage to 60 to have a portal/vending machine setup 100%.
---
Now you mean to practice, but then to start incorporating things like blizz and arc exp if needed once fluent in this?
---
Probably the conclusion most people will come to. The math shows that under the current system, the majority of people will not crack rank 4 until the people above them either burn out or hit their goal and leave.
---
Theres something satisfying seeing alliance push wipe, looking at their unreleased corpses, desperately waiting for GY timer to finish.  
---
And then you just walk to them, one by one, removing their insignias.
---
Yeah, we start in that cave, there used to be a time earlier in Vanilla when we started futher north. But that is indeed the correct starter cave
---
&gt; to get decent rank you need high brackets, these brackets are going to get smaller and smaller with less people playing
---
People only need 15 HKs to enter the pool. EVERYONE was doing AV for exalted last week. There are plenty of those who got 300k honor last week but will get under 50k this week with at least 15 HKs.
---
I never understood why people would want to do 49 twinking. At that level, you already have most/all of your abilities/important talents, so playstyle wise, it's really not much different from 60 pvp. The numbers are just smaller and 100% mounts don't exist.
---
Oh shit. I need to level a warrior. Tabking as a druid is the worst.
---
Dustwallow is not heavily populated regardless of the 'life cycle' of the server.  You may want to try STV, Badlands, or Arathi as there are some quests in those spots that are level-appropriate.
---
WPvP fixed it to some extent, didn't try BRM run but Firemaw feels okay (?) for most of the zones!
---
LFM FOR A DUNGEON YOU WANT IN LOOT, LOOT YOU WANT IS RESERVED THOUGH, WANT TO COME ANYWAY? PST
---
I take it you've read nothing on the subject, not even the conversation below.
---
Instead of transfering try making your own guild first, that being said sulfuras seems to be good for alliance.
---
I usually sneak up north and cap the two towers as fast as possible, cant really cap the aid station without help though.
---
If you do decide to transfer, Pagle has been on the receiving end of a ton of PVP imports. We have quite a few Adult only oriented guilds and a strong economy (Alliance Only). Check out our discord page.
---
Oh I see, my bad then!
---
And yeah, it definetly isn't a similar situation, especially since classic just wasn't available for years.
---
Thats a fair assumption, but we are still looking for a PVP guild. We like the open world PVP when its not two armies of streamer spurgs seeing who has the most no-lifers.
---
I can only speak for my guild but everyone who is exalted and not going for rank is not playing pvp
---
Ah I never knew since I started playing wow it was always the back cave next to the horde base. Haven‚Äôt had a chance to check out the classic av yet
---
Oh hey Benediction buddy.
---
How about reading the almost 60 comments here and determining that for yourself?
---
The honor inflation is due to the large number of games in the first day that died off each subsequent day from bg release.
---
These numbers are horde oce but queues for av were &lt;5 mins the whole day and games were fast because fast queues encouraged fast honor farm games. The next day it was 15+ mins for queue during peak and 30 mins off peak and today during peak ac matches have queues of 25ish mins.
---
As for honor the top scoring player on my server got like 1.3 million honor for the week and 500 million of this was farmed on launch day and he spent the remaining 6 days of the week getting progressively less honor.
---
That‚Äôs what I mean by honor inflation and it dried up faster than rep farmers plenty of people still farming rep but none of the tourists.
---
Basically if you‚Äôve seen a gold making trick in a YouTube video with a million views it probably doesn‚Äôt work anymore.
---
If he was an NPC he would be in one of the streamer guilds on Faerlina.
---
&gt; have 35 game days played 
---
The game has been out 4 months and you have a month of /played? wow
---
I love the 29 bracket, i would love the 39 bracket even more if it weren't for Druids having travel form by then, it's just really OP in WSG for flag carrying, very frustrating to play against, and it makes any other class obsolete for flag carrying. I think the reason a lot of people like the 19 bracket is that it doesen't take too long to lvl an alt to 19.
---
1st in dps.  Right outside of top 5 overall damage.
---
Dont know what is so odd about the way we kill him?  Easy sheeps, them easy kill targets, smooth every time
---
Use TUF for BG's, then use Ice Barbed Spear for raids.
---
One doesn't, but a team does.
---
Sounds like a test to make sure the people asking to swap are competent
---
It took like 10 hours as human so, no, it doesn‚Äôt take 20-40 hours.
---
First inn I've seen decorated in Classic. Haven't made it to Ironforge yet for the other holiday stuff.
---
I didnt think AoE could crit. When I run spell cleave groups I throw on my Stam + Int gear to spam hellfire. SP is almost worthless.
---
Imagine complaining about people complaining about obvious imbalance :D  Of course you would whine about people whining about imbalance because it would make things fair?
---
I lost my mageblade with a 99 toll to a warlocks 100 roll. Every since that roll i list I haven‚Äôt won an item again.
---
I'm not a big MMO player, so none. It's simply hilarious to me that Blizzard have no idea how to improve Classic and just ship it as is. I mean, I concede it's just not for me anymore but the fact is they dare not do anything because they have no idea how to develop a game like Classic at this point.
---
They're used to micromanaging the shit out of their games instead of letting them play out, so I guess hats off to them for not doing it this time?
---
No I am eu, nethergarde keep
---
I exclusively help cap graveyards in the back line with other rogues or scout ahead of the group to try and set up kills. 
---
You can also help pick off people at the front line by acting as a CC bot but I find this to be less rogue-ish.
---
I‚Äôm gonna keep saying y‚Äôall.
---
Seems to happen right after the shield goes down that they take increased damage.
---
Thunderfury has been nice so far, we could always use more alliance
---
Or they could just add the Barbershop without being dicks, but we know which route they'll take
---
It all depends on what your guild wants you to be and how you see yourself. Is the extra dps needed or is healing missing? You have to be flexible and carry atleast two sets of gear.
---
&gt;Can't get Ranks as high as 13 or 14 if you have a job and a life honestly.
---
I got rank 14 in vanilla with a full time job. Can't confirm the "life" part though.
---
It all depends on situation. You will not hit 14 anytime soon, nor on a big pvp server if you dont make sacrifices .... but as we get deeper into classic more and more of the most hardcore players will 'rank out' of the system.
---
&gt; What does player interaction have to do with anything?
---
Literally the entire concept of a RPG-MMO.
---
If it wasn't for this, we would all be playing single player games and wouldn't be here. Automation / cheating (botting) damaging the core principle of the game.
---
So you are looking to avoid:
---
* Memes
---
* Bad loot rules
---
You are looking for:
---
* PVP server
---
* Diverse raiding community
---
I would recommend Herod. It's the non-streamer EST server which would fit your current guilds time zone well. While alliance are outnumbered, we have a solid coalition of guilds coordinating world bosses (and with BG's out, wpvp is much more reasonable). Plenty of raiding guilds as well!
---
I can't help you with the memes. Chadrod has some *E X Q U I S I T E* memes.
---
Oh.. i see. My bad... yeah i very rarely pvp so i think that's why we were on different wavelengths there.
---
Never played vanilla but im really enjoying it
---
Are you at least a tank class?
---
Punk rat, top kek.
---
There‚Äôs a website for this that can show you not just a BiS list, but what drops would be an upgrade from what you currently have on. It‚Äôs called 60 upgrades, I don‚Äôt have a link because I‚Äôm on my phone, but it‚Äôs worth checking out and can show you generally where you want to be questing and running dungeons right now. 
---
You‚Äôre still low for mele DPS to get into BRM groups, I think you should run Mara for black stone rings and then sunken temple until 52. That‚Äôs when you should start running the BRM dungeons for loot + attunemnets. Following that up with Scholo, DM, and Strat in the late 50s.
---
No, it differs for the ocasion but mostly is mark frost target and wyvenr target&gt;place frost trap&gt; start with wyvern shot&gt; distracting shot for frost trap &gt; serpent sting to skull and X&gt; multi shot arcane shot&gt; orc racial and melee with raport strike&gt; feign dead inmolation trap or explosivo or frost trap again&gt; take distance and reaply serpent sting multishot arcane shot.
---
In big pulls I will have to change aspecs monkey, use engineering bombs and kiting mobs out of healer.
---
conclusion: more enternainment for me than autoshot, arcane, aiming and multishot.
---
Here we see the conceited Dunning-Kruger know-nothing in its natural habitat. Observe that he speaks first and thinks later, and when his argument is proven invalid, he resorts to insults like a child.
---
Lmao, the guy who has the number 1 dps record on classic mainly uses bre in mc.
---
The adds are level 60 mobs, not bosses. So far fewer resists as well.
---
I agree. I think there might be one on every server. I have one on mine, and this screen cap is not from my server (the capitalization is wrong).
---
I really like the limited toolkit of the 19 bracket. I think my next twink will be in the 39. We will have maxed professions but nobody will have their end of tree talent
---
It shouldnt be considered harassment to ask a guild of friends for some help. My guild likes to help each other run things all the time and most of us have alts at various levels to go run things. If your guild considers it harassing to ask for help with the game are you even a guild or just business partners
---
That's assumptive. I play a hunter. They best way for me to make gold is to do DM. However I don't enjoy that. May favourite ways to make gold are gathering and grinding mobs/low level instances.
---
However bots lower the enjoyment of my farming, because they in short make my human interaction less valuable, in favour of automation, thus i'm basically getting forced out of doing something I enjoy by someone who doesn't even want to engage in the game.
---
That is correct. Especially because the grave yard by alliance cap is right in front of the door. The horde are right there to defend from alliance. 
---
That and the choke points are on alliance side so it is easier for horde to summon lok
---
yikes dude unironically playing a Tauren is pretty cringe
---
IRL there's drunk gambling...
---
Are there any silence effects in the 19 bracket?
---
I noticed the Voice Amplification Modifier doesn‚Äôt have a level requirement but is sortof expensive to make
---
Terrible but also hilarious
---
There's a few. Also they occasionally will run to aid station and deaggro and hide. You can reset agro on top of the aid station like you can on the org towers.
---
I'd like to exceed r7 this time round. But given my investment last week and I only gained 1 rank, I feel like I need to make reputation my priority until bgs stop being the new toy and a few players cycle through rank 14.
---
For leveling I stayed deep holy so i hit mindblast, holy fire while they run at me. Then swp and smite while mindblast cd. Then another mindblast, shield if needed, and then usually wand them down. Everything else is just randomly placed. What‚Äôs you‚Äôre rotation?
---
ty buddy i am currently recruiting &gt;.&gt;
---
Uhm yeah, I wouldn't use random terms that I have no clue about when trying to sound intelligent in conversations. It makes you look dumb.
---
Well now they can be! Paid transfers are here.
---
So I‚Äôm guessing in classic at least horde almost always win?
---
Driving and getting fukt is some top tier shit. And the occasional MDMA. PvP honour can fuck right off compared to the freedom to leave dildos around.
---
What does API stand for? Available Public Information? :D
---
I don't know, but even as horde I'd love to see it. That'd be fucking hilarious. That said, once is enough if you decide to do it, after that it'll just be frustrating :(
---
Spent an hour on IF bridge selling ports / food / water and actually met 2 people who transferred from Faerlina, so people are transferring, just not full guilds just yet
---
It‚Äôs gotta be the most balanced server right? I think Benediction and Sulfuras are the closest to 50/50
---
They should not have to "come back" in the first place if they leave a few defenders at start? So me, as single horde player running ahead of the zerg, can not solo capture that graveyard and the two towers.
---
And you have a trinket to teleport you right back to the front of the main bunker, so not that hard to come back really.
---
We make this joke every time we raid.
---
&gt;Which counter(s) are you specifically referring to? 
---
We are talking about Vaelastrasz, in vanilla called "the guild breaker". Tanks have to work a little here, but nothing to hard.
---
&gt;How many tanks do we need for BWL? 
---
3 tanks is "needed", but 4 wont hurt. Obviously there are probably ways to do it with less, but the popular tactics involve 3 or 4.
---
&gt;Currently have a fury spec tank, a deep prot spec tank, and a feral tank. 
---
All equally viable. 
---
&gt;The deep prot tank seems to have shitty aggro.
---
Make sure he does his rotation correct. Shield slam and Revenge needs to go like a clock ticking every 6 seconds. Then spam sunder armor even if the boss is at max stacks.
---
You can easily see if he does this wrong by looking at logs. Select the tank and then go to the casts tab. He should have both Shield Slam and Revenge as close as possible to 10 casts per minute (CPM). Shitty tanks have less then 6, good tanks have more then 7.
---
devilsaur is a good investment, especially when you are low  in lootprio and not likely to replace it anytime soon.
---
You should enchant all your item,s so it's fine to go for a bit cheaper and weaker enchants, if you can replace the item rather quickly (eg +3 stats instead of +4, +7 str on bracers instead of +9)
---
Join Atiesh and you too can shop at Bloodbath.
---
I already have Blackstone Ring (you said plural, can I equip 2?), so I can safely finish Mara right (PTSD from corpse runs in that place have me wanting out).
---
Thanks for the site recommendation, I'll definitely check it out. Do you recommend just dungeoning in the 50s to get geared, or is questing still better for exp?
---
I think AV would be way more fun if you could at least group up as 5 and form a hit squad for objectives or to pick off stragglers
---
Do yourself a favor. Take a deep breath, step back, and look out up for once.
---
Mage presumably. Mage at ZF is one of their noteworthy farm options.
---
Good luck!
---
Haha. I know it is not really the best spell to use, but can be useful whenever an opponent is low on HP and is trying to LoS you behind a wall or building (if you cast it early enough, the missiles will still hit wherever the enemy is) and finish the job. And someone just told me its going to be useful in BWL, so i guess its not that bad.
---
Go through the backdoor, jump onto the bunkers ledge so you can get into the entrance without aggroing the commander outside there, waltz up, sap/take care of the archer across from the flag, position yourself so the other 3 can't hit you.
---
gg
---
Appreciate the input, thank you!
---
I see talk about populations in this thread. Any way to check PvE populations too? With a reliable tool? I'm not transfering but I can't seem to find a single trustworthy data center for Normal servers.
---
which means wpvp horde deathballs are once again required, and on balanced servers there will be no alliance deathballs to counter them. alliance gank bitching will soon far exceed phase 2, but this time with good reason
---
crossrealm bgs were a mistake
---
Boycotting av
---
Real rankers
---
Pick one.
---
Kurrinax's entire horde population in one photo.
---
Wait there are people who are doing the left strategy?! LMAO
---
The fact they had to backpedal quickly on those choices was very telling though.
---
I just want to say yikes to this exchange. Anyway yea there is a bit of a lull in classic atm. I was always told leveling was part of the journey of classic but now I see the whole "everyone is lvl 60 now or people are doing bgs/pre 60 dungeons are a waste of time" etc. I would just level and do the quests you can, the expectation that you will be able to find someone for every grp quest isn't that viable but maybe desolacr is rely just a zone no one really quests in.
---
It feels good man, wish i had done the same. Even tho 5-man dungeons Arent the biggest challenge having a prot specced tank or a Holy specced healer makes it muuuch smother.
---
What made you do that?
---
Like anybody knows how to solo pull drek in a pug. We're lucky if they don't pull every WM every time
---
Lol the alliance forget on the first day they probably won 90% of their straight Zerg rushes. But now they try to pick up extra honor on the way and end up losing because of greed.
---
If it wouldn't be so funny watching you act like a monkey I had stopped this useless conversation four posts ago, but I actually enjoy it.
---
If you're that much into giving advice, start with you ;)
---
I haven‚Äôt noticed as much world ganking since bgs came out I never kill low lvl alliance trying to quest that‚Äôs just a dick move and I get no honor I will gank a level 60 if I see them out in the world it‚Äôs a pvp server that‚Äôs why I joined the server so I can pvp if I get killed it‚Äôs what I signed up for, I just hate getting steamrolled by a party of 5 but that hasn‚Äôt happened since bgs dropped.
---
The rush strategy only worked on the first day but since the horde can skip a major part of the map by glitches and single pull drekthar also by a glitch its not viable anymore. Its pretty boycott worthy.
---
Don't judge yourself by this subreddit. 4 hours a day is not casual. That's essentially doing nothing besides working, sleeping, and playing WoW. 
---
The term "casual" gets thrown around to a ridiculous extent because there are many hopelessly addicted, unemployed players who like to convince themselves that their 10 hour-per-day habit is normal and healthy. As long as there's 1 or 2 dudes on the server playing 16+ hours a day, they can call themselves only "semi-hardcore."
---
I work 10 p.m. to 6:30 am. I'm not the best player so I've been slowly chugging along by grinding or doing quests. I'm a level 35 Warlock. I'm afraid to commit to dungeons because I get tired and want to just quit. Tiredness just comes over me because I get terrible sleep all week.  I also don't know what it's like to be an active guild member so I don't want to not pull weight, I'll also not wanting to be socially active that much.
---
Like the kid at the court that takes the ball home after he gets picked last.
---
I probably missed that :)
---
Then maybe the devs wanted to balance a slightly longer / easier to defend layout .. maybe not .. 'no change' for the better or worse :/
---
So there is hope ! Awesome to hear that my guild was talking about recruiting ppl from other servers yesterday too so I thought it‚Äôs possible
---
Uh, did you read that correctly? He caps the bunkers but can‚Äôt solo cap the GY.
---
Azshara ghosts next to the FP is a solid no-brain mageweave farm and it‚Äôs usually quiet because there are so few quests in the zone. Lot of bots though.
---
The real problem is that Horde have much longer queues so they're more willing to complete objectives to get the most Honor/Rep that they can get out of each game
---
Comparatively, Alliance get instant queues so it's much easier for them to give up or fall into a loser's mentality
---
10ppl use trinket?
---
&gt;because they in short make my human interaction less valuable
---
Oh i see... u call putting items on the auction house "human interaction". you're speaking nonsense... you do it for the reward, if  you had other sources of gold income and the mats were reasonably priced on AH then you wouldn't be losing anything
---
wait a sec... when u realize ur talking to a very low iq person and wasting ur time... u should probably stop
---
For PvE you should be running a Wolf anyway which can't learn Claw, but should be taught Furious Howl, as per the original response.
---
Any hunters have any recommended videos for the Bow/staff quests to watch? I‚Äôve watched Draaynations video so far as he‚Äôs usually my go to, but I‚Äôd like to study up on multiple
---
Fringe 10/10, 1/1 is currently recruiting on the Blameux (PvP) server, Alliance.
---
We seek dedicated players for PvP and Raiding.
---
We are currently seeking all classes for PvP.
---
We are currently seeking Mages, Warlocks, Hunters, Druids, Priests, and Paladins for raiding.
---
We raid Friday 9 pm server. Raids are usually cleared in 3 hours (both).
---
Let either Kr, Legal, JellyBelles, or Tullius know in game or let /u/Squidfacedgod know on reddit.
---
Do you have what it takes to on the Fringe? Join now!
---
Fringe has been an organized group since Everquest. The core leadership moved to World of Warcraft during Vanilla. Many of our members played on private servers after TBC launched. Our community hails from many competitive games. So come game with the best!
---
Actually - as others have pointed out already - the previous weak could have been the easiest to rank up. If you plan to go for r10+ all the "casuals" that played for the AV rep should be behind you in honor. Thus, pushing you higher up in the brackets.
---
Pretty much just for the increase in agility towards the bottom of the surv tree since its based off your % of agi
---
Thanks! My friends who played wow didn‚Äôt come back to classic and i never kept in touch with my original guild so it was cool to find a new group to recreate the same experience.
---
auctioneer/enchantrix is very inaccurate when it comes to the disenchanting value.
---
and 50% of ironforge rep goes to each other main faction city, it just doesn't show it
---
Faction discount is at Honored, not Exalted. So as long as you're honored with your home city (assuming you stayed in your starter area, you should be) you should get the 10% discount. Additionally, you can get another 10% discount by being Rank 3 in PvP.
---
From what I've heard, fishing is a decent way to make gold if you stick to places like Azshara and farm Elemental Water. But as a Mage, you have way more lucrative farms available to you, like aoe farming graves in ZF!
---
&gt; Highest win% for a pug would be going straight drek and ignoring galv all together.
---
Yet in every game if you point this out people scream at you that this no longer works (it does...only AV's I've won in 5 days have been drek rushes, every galv has been a loss).
---
Yeah this - I just skipped it
---
Can confirm. As Horde when we mirror this same strat without Defense, we lose unless the alliance are really incompetent. With defense Horde wins mirroring this strat.
---
Do they actually say that?
---
Item rack!
---
Lunar Calendar 2019 maybe...
---
I have
---
* Level 60 hunter - fun to level
---
* Level 47 prot pal - horrible to level, this was who I started with but gave up and rolled hunter
---
* Level 39 mage - cause AoE is fun to do - this is who I'm currently levelling
---
* Level 31 Rogue - because I saw how much raw DPS others were doing, I like it, but parked for now
---
* Level 26 warlock - I did enjoy this for a while but the shine has worn off
---
* Level 20 druid - its okay, I'm not enamoured by it
---
* Level 18 warrior - wanted a better tank, but he's been parked for weeks now
---
* Level 14 priest - as druid really
---
Atiesh! But cool to know there are others.
---
Cheapest 100% mount now is av rep mount, with rank 4 it cost 640g instead 800
---
Had the same bug yesterday morning. We had 2 extra players and still lost. ‚ÄúFor the Alliance?! /afk‚Äù
---
So basically, the same as MM. But you use traps on every pull and re-apply dots?
---
Well someone gotta keep the huntard meme alive.
---
You are not my Chef yet, Boyardee!
---
It's gonna take you a month, the grind from 0-3 is nothing like the grind to rank 8
---
why wouldn't you get a faction discount at exalted?
---
You can either go for a normal epic mount, which is 800g with faction disocunt + rank 3 or you get the AV mount, which is only 640g.
---
Fishing is decent, but not all that great, depends on server economy, but on mine only oily blackmouth and winter squids are worth anything, as a mage you are probably better off aoefarming or doing dm runs.
---
Im using both imp blizz &amp; shatter, shatter is very important for flame strike/coc
---
I *did not* read that correctly.
---
Strike everything from me from the record.
---
What's the best PvE server for Horde? I was thinking Mankrik but I'm not sure.
---
One can.  As soon as you snowball someone off, they all stop and are hesitant about crossing the bridge.
---
Yea you dont understand how probanility works. You think rolling 1000 is free but rolling 500 isnt?
---
Yeah I‚Äôm using that as well. But all of the spec that I‚Äôve seen online use ice shards instead of shatter.
---
Someone snowballed drek this morning in a premade I was in.  Ruined the careful positioning, wiped the premade, we all repopped mid (because they didn't bother with fwgy).
---
They recovered and we won but god that has to be frustrating.
---
It's like the classical prisoners dilemma or game theory. Yes if we all agree to do very little we all stand to benefit. But the idea that someone won't play ball means that if you decide to cooperate and someone cheats you all stand to loose out except the cheat. So the only logical way forward is to grind your ass to the bone to the detriment of everyone. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You're right, most guilds on this server are trash.
---
80k a year bartending damnnnnnnnnnn
---
Not if you are playing casually. R10 is pretty easy as a casual, just takes time.
---
Hunter, they are op.
---
Ok ty for info. I'm a disc/holy priest and I wasn't healing at the time, but maybe my threat buildup was also too high. Guess it's time for a threat meter.
---
Recount is notoriously inaccurate. You should use Details! instead, and ideally for most accurate reporting of DPS/HPS, etc. someone should be logging your runs.
---
He isn‚Äôt missing much by leaving your small server.
---
It's a luxury.  Pretty nice to be a le to level up an alt while your main is sitting in 15 min AV queues.  Using second account to farm while you spam for a group on your first account. Or giving your alt a run through a dungeon or powerleveling.  Definitely expensive but I consider it a luxury I'm paying for.
---
You know AV is alliance favored right? Also this complaint is the reason why we ended up getting retail version of AV, which you can go play *right now*.  
---
Seriously all the issues you have with classic are fixed in retail, go check it out. Youre already subbed after all and all those changes are waiting for you.
---
No silence in 19
---
I've literally not thrown one, didn't realize the CD was that long. 
---
Also realizing I need to be throwing the damn things.
---
Lots of noobs likes writing guides, just look at wowhead class guides.
---
Altoholic?
---
I used to think that, have started to change my mind lately though. The biggest factor by far for a PUG victory is sticking together, regardless of strategy. Galv is a good halfway point that lets the 60% mounts catch up. If you rush Drek you get 3-4 people way ahead (why equip every mount speed increase when you know most people won't?), then another group of 5-10, then the 60% mounts straggling in later. Having to deal with another couple of warmasters is a small price to pay for not trickling in and being wiped by a handful of defenders.
---
umm wreckfoo/wreckfu, wystyria, thehawpah, caseoh, most can fill you in/invite so just whisper whoever is on, and they could point you to an officer, etc.
---
Yeah the learning process can be quite draining.. I personally found the more deaths I had the more impatient I became and this lead to more deaths of course.. Ok killing the pack of 3 dogs is the hardest part of the run in my opinion.. They are on a 7 minute patrol cycle and tbh I only tackle them once they are in the perfect position to engage.. Which I find is as they are patrolling on or off the king platform. Basically i'll place a frost trap between me and the dogs, then i'll open with Aimed into Multi and Serpent sting on the lowest level dog.. Then you just kite up and down the outer ring and jump off whenever one is about to get close. If you want to play it mega safe then you can always kill 1 or 2 and then feign to reset... Then tackle the pull again.. If they are patting north then you can grab them again after you've restored health/mana/pet. Let me know how you get on
---
Yeah I'm alliance on Herod so I'm not looking forward to trying to level once I get to Searing Gorge and later
---
&gt;something I hadn't done on WoW since early Cata.
---
Cata is when it all started slowly going downhill. 
---
Classic has made me love WoW again.
---
Herod alliance are pretty much the worst
---
If you had onyxia buff, some of our warlocks were pulling over 1k dps in multiple fights in MC today
---
Mmmhmmmmm...
---
Blizzard is safer, that's all. Also if I remember correctly blizzard damage per mana is higher than flamestrike and CoC and when people were leveling and they made all those guides they didn't have much gear / ability to buy that good gear in the AH.  
---
Indeed, right now, nova &gt; 2x blizzard &gt; nova &gt; flame/coc is better. I too have shatter and I am doing the same. At level 42 you can solo ZF graveyard with shatter btw. You do 3 pulls, round mobs up with one CoC, and then nova flame/coc shatter them and kite again.
---
This nets you really good gold while leveling plus the most insane experience you can get at level 40ish. Next to 120k per hour.
---
Theyve quit
---
Hope you guys make more, this was super entertainment!
---
Wpvp is all but dead since the release of bgs.
---
High value materials are still contested but leveling has been a breeze ever since. Complete 180.
---
Is that an advantage? It's so easy to use the back route which takes you right to the GY.  I remember this being more difficult when I played horde back in the day, but its super easy now.
---
Not sure if you've been playing in 29 brackets at all, but that definitely is not the case. Just two games ago I saw a warrior go 11-2 on the scoreboard. Easily sat mid with Allaince in a group of 5 or 6.
---
Kurinaxx to Bloodsail. Being new to wow on classic release I didn‚Äôt know how pvp would turn out, thanks to p2 now its all clear....and boy am I enjoying pve more! Happy with the move (plus bloodsail is Rp  and more laidback/quiet).
---
most bag mods will show your inventory for all chars,
---
ive used bagnon &amp; arkinventory.
---
This sounds hard to believe. I am sorry to shit on your experience but I had a situation where I was farming rich thorium veins in Winterspring 20 minutes before Ony. I need to get my Lionheart helm crafted this week so I was rushing all over the place. A level 58 or so warrior asked me to help him kill the high chief in winterfall. I said sure and ran up there and saw another group had just killed him. So I told the guy I have no time to wait for a respawn and need to go, good luck and sorry I can't wait. He then went on a tantrum in general chat and in whispers saying how the game is full of assholes and he can't find anyone to help him.... 
---
If you wanted to do most content solo you should've rolled a mage or a hunter. If you wanted instant groups for dungeons roll a warrior but be premade for the hell that is leveling. Like others have said most players are 60 at this point and with their alts they are focusing on the most efficient ways of levelling/getting boosted. Just tough it out or join a guild. The game can be solo'd til 60. it just takes longer.
---
I think this was the one! I don't see a version for classic though but I see some people saying Titan Panel so I'll try that. Thanks!
---
I like the go galv but not do galv, instead do lts and commanders, the take fwgy and rh strategy. Good honor and you may win.
---
I'm saying to are saying bots are good, while behaving like a bot. Logic is hard.
---
Have you updated it recently?
---
&gt; recount showed me
---
Recount is kinda weird how it displays DPS. Try switching to Details!
---
Western Plaguelands- The graveyard area (Sorrow Hill, maybe?) that is south of Andorhal. Kill the undead there
---
Burning Steppes- Kill the ogres in Dreadmaul Rock. Be aware that the pats and mob density can cause you to overpull if you aren't cautious.
---
Tanaris- farm the Thistleshrubs SW of Gadgetstan
---
Felwood- Deadwood Village. Or really any spot in the southern part of the territory should be fine for you at lvl 50.
---
Azshara- farm the naga in the Ruins of Eldarath. I did this through all of 48 and 49 and got some decent vendor trash and a couple of golden pearls. There are also several chests in the ruins.
---
Un'goro Crater- Tar Lords and Lurkers. Mob lvl can get up to 54 so be wary. This territory is farmopolis so be cognizant of your server's ally/horde population and likelihood of being ganked.
---
Feralas- Literally any part of the territory. I personally avoid Feralas because it's filled w/ others that are farming and I don't want to mess w/ pvp when I'm grinding.
---
I thought the discount was at rank 3?
---
Alright cool, I'll try it out. Thanks!
---
Nothing odd about it, it's just not how you break 1k dps, every lock log is aoeing otherwise they are not close to 1K dps since the fight is long and mono target.
---
Call it what you want but PvP in a battleground is the fun way to play it.
---
Awesome, I'll try it out. Thanks!
---
Ah thanks, ill give that a try
---
Feral is BiS flag carrier spec in WSG. Nothing else comes even close. For 1v1, I don‚Äôt know.
---
What's the point now? Everyone is spamming Bgs or raid logging. On a high pop very balanced server (where wpvp was a huge shitshow) I farm daily, multiple high level zones, since Bgs came out I've seen maybe 10 alliance, and it's been friendly in every instance. No FP camping, boats/zeps are clear, etc.
---
come to fairbanks!
---
Dash claw prowl and maybe bite if you dont want to add the rest of the points into stam and resistances
---
people need to learn to run to the rhgy when that happens
---
Well, playing on a balanced server is always a plus
---
Defense was meant to be part of AV.  The fact Horde has to defend isn‚Äôt an unfair disadvantage.  The game was designed to be a turtle, and when it comes to turtling, Horde are favored.
---
Who actually cares, and who cares even more in classic. I shit in a bucket, ordered take out for every meal or had my mommy bring me cheezies for a year, withered into an unhealthy pasty , cretin , is not an accomplishment what so ever.
---
I think we are all feeling this.  But I think future weeks will be better.  Literally EVERYONE was playing AV this weekend just to rep grind.   Now that a lot of people have exalted they will stop spamming and that 100k honor you gained will carry more weight.  Also, the lack of instant gratification will get a lot of people to quit.  I'm hoping ranking becomes easier due to this over time.  It's a marathon, not a Sprint.
---
19 is trash.
---
29 is best.
---
39 is extremely bursty and fun, but still no mount.
---
I'm ganna make a 29 enhance troll shammy stacking AP an % IAS.  It will be a fun experiment.
---
Recount starts *your* dps when you start casting. It tracks others in real time. It's a bug. I can be 10th on damage but 1st on dps which realistically isn't mathematically correct.
---
yes, you need to use that pet till you learn the skill of teaching Claw rank 2. Once you have it, you can then release the new pet and go teach it to your cat,
---
Alright awesome, I see people saying Bagnon and Titan Panel, I'll try them both out. Thanks!
---
Buy the hype, sell the news.
---
Ahh OK, that's good to know then. Thanks :)
---
Why would you transfer from an underdog realm to another underdog realm?
---
Yeah fair enough, I'll look at that next then. Thanks
---
If you're doing it for rep yeah turtle. I'm talking to the honor farm people.
---
Post logs or it didn't happen.
---
I guess... i just don't like the whole name/profile thing on Reddit... i mean it's an anonymous website and it seems so many people forget it is anonymous for some reason. I guess because people can check comment histories and make judgements about you and remember your name... all those things just seem to lead to people being negative for some reason.
---
Cool, I see people saying Bagnon and Titan Panel, I'll try em out. Thanks!
---
I think he means westfall. South shore is in hillsbrad
---
The potions or materials you gather to craft better gear improves your character.
---
  It really sounds like you want a Diablo ARPG hack and slash game.
---
Go big or go home, chump.
---
This reminds me of playing on dial up years ago... PVE? Possible. Seeing what Org looks like from the inside? Merely a fantasy.
---
If you're not winning against warriors and rogues I don't know what to tell you. I eat those guys for lunch and I'm geared but far from full BiS for feral tank. Unless they are Uber geared then it's an even fight. 
---
I spend 90% of my time in bear form because if they catch you out of form with a stun you're toast. I only really come out to heal when I know I can control them with entangling roots. While out of form I'll throw a moonfire and wrath if I have space and then charge back in as bear. FF is top priority against rogues, the armor debuff is amazing but you wouldn't believe the amount of times I've won a fight against a rogue because they tried to vanish and panicked after it didn't work, even if they were just using it to reset fight and not to flee. Having that up against them at all times makes them super uncomfortable. 
---
But honestly 1v1s are relatively rare and my greatest success comes from hanging with teammates and just charging and bashing anyone who is out of position, or to disrupt heals. You're super tanky and you can't be kited like a warrior so I force people out of position and let my casters handle the damage.
---
TUF is superior in every way unless you really need the AOE knockdown from some reason (and I really don't see why you would).
---
I heard it was resto actually.
---
The first few days, yes. I am currently getting around 1k rep/hour with how games currently play out.
---
Well, I guess that depends on what you are buying the HoF's for vs what you think Elemental Fire will be worth on P5.  In order for me not to make money, Elemental Fire would have to drop to less than 15 silver each, which I just cant see happening.  Atm on my server they are 5-6g each.  By P5, I expect them to drop to around 2g each.  So with 500+ of them I think I will make ~2.75k gold.  Even if the arse drops out of the market entirely and they are worth 50s each, I will still stand to make 500g.
---
TBH I'm a troll hunter and I havent seen much use for it in AV. I could see it being useful for WSG, but doesnt seem absolutely necessary.
---
But that's just what I think.
---
Our server the guild leaders plan ony head drops together. We always have at least that world buff going into a raid and we have 2 raids we do in under 2 hours. If you get that buff and some consumables then your DPS should be good enough to clear in 2 hours, most likely.
---
Honestly run a Warcraft log - if there are people parsing gray figure out what they are doing. If it‚Äôs one boss maybe it was a mechanical issue or they didn‚Äôt bring a restorative potion, but if they are gray for the whole raid they were probably watching Netflix while raiding and you should replace them (especially if they do this more than once)
---
Or when the tank sees a horde and charges in at said horde ignoring taunting and existing warmasters. Then the healers die and *gg our healers dont heal*
---
Benediction. Great balance, great population, solid PVP. Lots of 10/10 guilds, I'd say at least a dozen on Alliance side. At this point though, it might be a little tougher to find a guild that can slot in 4 people all at once.
---
Spam fade on cooldown in p2. Her fireball drops aggro on the highest threat and goes down the list. So if lots of people get hit, it's possible you're #1 aggro without doing much.
---
Still waiting on that detailed explanation you referred to by the by. You wouldn't claim you worked in IT for some false appeal of authority on the topic and then dip would you? No that'd be a dick move can't imagine that.
---
thts how it goes unfortunately. I make Wkd Leather headbands and post them to my alt to DE. Once I send 20 WLHs and ended up with nealy 20 stacks of Illusion dust and 1 Greater Eternal Essence. Yet another time I mailed 13 WLHs and I ended up with 10 GEE's and 10 illusion dust. the RNG is mental ;)
---
Yeah I‚Äôm horde so I‚Äôll look for him in org!
---
Am I the only one hoarding moon cloth for phase 4?  I buy it all if it's near 13g.  I have 40 so far.
---
I believe those only works vs crits.
---
Everyone rushing allows alliance to win like 60% of the time. Drek is easier than Vann
---
It would definitely be a weird alliance guild name!
---
I had a few days were we couldn't get it together at all. My exalted grind net me 269k.
---
I dont think I have ever gotten the opener on a rogue.   I have 5/5 feral instinct, but their stealth seems to be far better.
---
I looked at wowhead. And they show 2 specs for aoe. 1 with 5/5 ice shards and 0/5 shatter. The other one have 5/5 ice shards and 4/5 shatter. So it seems like they also prefer ice shards over shatter.
---
Sure, I think? But not everyone raids. Even in a guild of 800 there‚Äôs the possibility that the vast majority of people don‚Äôt raid or haven‚Äôt been in a raid that uses Warcraft logs
---
Then you wouldnt be able to gank ??
---
Most common reaction to this would be, I hope everyone else gets right on this.
---
Easiest 25‚Ç¨ ive ever spent. 
---
No way im staying on my imbalanced server
---
What an atrociously childish attitude. "If I can't win I'm not going to play!"
---
Make sure your mom changes your diaper next time you make an oopsie after writing this sort of garbage.
---
Sure, but it is nothing special at all, just a dynamic group with selected cooldowns. (Druid) But very easy to just add new ones, currently it is set to only showing 6 cooldowns at once to fit into my UI.
---
[https://wago.io/A13PH2kxJ](https://wago.io/A13PH2kxJ)
---
But since Im using this font you also need to get this along with a texture called "pfUI-K" from this shared media lib: 
---
[https://github.com/mrrosh/pfUI-CustomMedia](https://github.com/mrrosh/pfUI-CustomMedia)
---
I dont know if there is a smarter and better way, probably is, but when I add fonts I hijack the addon "SharedMedia" and put the fonts in their folder for fonts, like this for this font it would end up like this:
---
SharedMedia/Fonts/titillium/TitilliumWeb-Semibold.ttf  
---
SharedMedia/Fonts/titillium/TitilliumWeb-Regular.ttf
---
And then you edit SharedMedia.lua and add these lines for it to register, for example:
---
`LSM:Register(MediaType_FONT, "Titillium SemiBold",			[[Interface\Addons\SharedMedia\fonts\titillium\TitilliumWeb-SemiBold.ttf]])`
---
`LSM:Register(MediaType_FONT, "Titillium Regular",			[[Interface\Addons\SharedMedia\fonts\titillium\TitilliumWeb-Regular.ttf]])`
---
That's so ridiculous people do this, why would anyone do this I just don't understand.
---
&gt; farming mats isn't even playing the game
---
Farming is a core part of the game. wtf are you talking about?
---
I mean it's not retail you have to communicate and make friends of your lvl if you roll a tank. Let's take RFD for example. 
---
First you need a healer, so you use commands like  /who feralas 40-45, /who dustwallow 37-45 to find healers near the dungeon ( more chances they accept to run it ) ...if you get no responses or negatives ones you expand your search to whole kalimdor with commands like /who darnassus, /who desolace...If you still can't find anyone you switch to class search and use /who priest 35-45 , /who paladin ...etc
---
When you have your healer, it's much easier to find 3 dps since every players in the right lvl range are potential dungeon mates. So you start the who commands again, always starting from dungeon zone and expanding to the whole server. You can also make a little world chat announce to make it faster ( I stopped doing it since who list is so much more efficient and don't require to spam channels ).
---
After the dungeon, if you enjoyed the run and discussions you add these 4 people to your friendlist. After a few times doing this, you'll end up with a social circle full of cool people in your level range you can play and talk with. You will eventually bond with them and they'll become your ***b o i s .***
---
this is the way of tank
---
As a warrior, I am expected to tank dungeons and dps in raids. With me being broke, and in close to pre-BiS dps and tank gear, is it more ideal to go for 17/34/0 or 3/32/16? As I see, it mostly comes down to Tactical Mastery vs. Defiance, but I can't really tell which holds the most value in dungeons.
---
never seen that happen, we always charge each other and end up a few yards apart.
---
Idk man, at least not for major. I think they are using in game addon and not actual warcraft logs. Because our warrior got a 97 on major and that was middle 500 dps.
---
If the mini map icon doesn‚Äôt work either do a /reload.   That fixed this issue for me.
---
Spinal is better but probably forged about it because every warrior is gonna want Spinal and there is like 10+ warriors every raid.
---
Earthshaker is best pvp weapon for Shamans and warriors usually dont want it.
---
Shhhhhh. Don‚Äôt tell anyone. Incendius is full GTFO!!
---
Am I reading this right ? Kurinnax isn‚Äôt really that horde dominate?
---
Because for 99% of the population they'll never hit rank 10
---
ooo that's pretty cool i never knew that :o
---
To add on to this I‚Äôve basically been steadily selling swiftness pots since release. And the price dropped significantly since bg‚Äôs released. First few days some morons tried to buy the AH out and then gouge then for like 10g a stack. But they‚Äôre easy to grind out and even the herbs themselves don‚Äôt cost that much. So with a huge surplus the price dropped to like 2-3g a stack and those 10g dumbasses never made any money and had to drop their price. Prior to bg‚Äôs I was selling them 5-6g easy.
---
Some people like to do things that are beyond your understanding
---
Ah ok wasn't sure which character you meant... thought the other character made more sense in the context actually. I mean, i do wanna improve my char but i can get gold in other ways i find more enjoyable and i can find the mats on AH generally. I know how much i enjoy getting gold by actually playing the game (using combat abilities) and i know how it is gathering mining/herbs and i definitely would say 1 is more fun than the other for majority of people. My way is so much fun that the gold making is just a side-effect and not even my main reason for doing these things. 
---
So why do people do the less fun way of gathering stuff to make money? Because they don't feel like they can afford not to if it can make them that much money on AH, they feel obligated for the sake of the reward and NOT because it is a fun activity in any way lfmao...
---
DON'T MAKE ME LOG ONTO MY MAIN.....
---
Afaik it's a blizzard issue? Reagents dont show either, portals etc
---
It's not about the task being fun or unfun (to you - I actually like farming), it's about creating value through effort and cheating cheapens the whole experience. Especially in classic, where there is emphasis on LIMITED resources in the world which you are able to fight over. And an in game economy is supposed to be based on the principle that you can exchange your best efforts for the best efforts of others and that each of us is created equal and that only our effort matters, not our wallet (rip modern wow). Bots take away your ability to create value and if you only had to pay vendor price for a hide of the wild or a devilsaur set and any essences that you were lucky enough to obtain were worthless then you would get pretty bored of the game pretty fucking quick - at least I would. Especially when the bots are selling the gold to some scum fuck that you hate and you know his dumb ass didn't have to work for his epic mount but you did for your two epic mounts... I'd say you do lose a lot in a world of bots.

To see how recently it's been updated and how many samples there are, click the status button at the bottom and search for your server.
---
I Wpvp all day in STvietnam still did people forget alts existed or??  I‚Äôm having so much fun 1 hitting smug bastards that try to get an HK while I‚Äôm killing a mob.
---
Here is a thought, let ally win more and then maybe your queue times improve...
---
This is definitely doable if it's organized or you have a guild that is moving with you. If you're solo, it's a bit of a gamble, but just like all gambles, it might actually pay off.
---
What for?
---
I‚Äôm using Dominos and its the same for me recently. Shard counts on spells no longer showing up. Pretty annoying tbh
---
Sounds like it wasn't "your" mageblade, then ;)
---
Wpvp basically non existant, its kinda sad now tbh
---
I've started doing this in some of my games that wind up turning into turtles.
---
I form a small squad of 4-5 people and go around taking turrets and killing lieutenants. It probably makes them last even longer.. but at least we get to have fun.
---
Don't conflate "guild" and "friends." Asking in guild chat if anyone wants to do something is one thing. Asking people to stop what they are doing and run you through stuff is just being a pest.
---
Killing Slow Boys is my favorite thing to do in AV... sometimes I hear the jaws theme song in my head as I run one down
---
Restorative potions may actually be a smart idea since I don‚Äôt think anyone really even thinks of them. But they‚Äôre also far from a neccesary consumable. They‚Äôre barely even a luxury tbh.
---
Can confirm. We are all chinese nazi bee's here on grobbulus. Raiding scene is fully infected and is now entierly ran by the bots. All hope is lost. Run while you can.
---
Majority doesnt care about honor rn though
---
If you get aggro in phase 3, no matter when in phase 3 there's just 1 thing to do: Run to tank position and die. Onyxia is not a dps race. Slow and steady wins the race. Sacrificing a few people overeager on damage doesn't matter much. Even if you didn't do anything to gain aggro, again: run to tank and die.
---
The good way to divvy it up seems to be 100%'ers go into galv, 60%'ers ride past to cap fwgy.  The 100%'s catch up and pass around fwgy and it's a combined rush on rh.
---
You don‚Äôt. You go out and grind gold, buy your epic, then play AV
---
Well I know this post is fake because there are never any healers in AV. They‚Äôre all too busy swinging around their hammers or being all shadowy to heal.
---
I think we call if deviate delight classic side.
---
I committed a shitty pull by accident, underestimating my aggro range.   
---
Should have known better than to peek around the corner at level 51. Dumb of me.
---
prob something wrong with instance server. I was running around WPL and noticed the same. logged out and back in and everything was spawned.
---
That doesn‚Äôt work when you‚Äôre doing a cross realm premade
---
Is this true?
---
I love this. More!
---
Rogues are great at hanging out stealthed at graveyards until they cap.  As a gnome warlock, it's super fun to hang out as the only visible player capping a GY and have 2 or 3 horde swoop in for the easy kill only to have 2 rogues, a druid, and a couple NE hunters de-stealth once they've taken the bait.
---
Also good at guarding the main pve pack killing drek and letting folks know when horde are massing.
---
Ew!
---
Same in the town right next to the dungeon as it is friendly to alliance.
---
Yes I'm agreeing with you. I use iceshards, shatter, and imp blizzard.
---
All they need to do is ghooooost waaaaalk.  Its literally the chillest part of av. You dont have to do anything.
---
The real problems w 60%ers is that A they are in AV when theybshould just get their fucking mount.  I mean come on.  And B as soon as 1 thing gets held up they and everyone else just say fuck it its a loss ima farm hks.
---
Oh shit you're right, never considered cross realm

I really liked the Classy Friday posts. Looking back at the old ones is actually a pretty good resource/insight into a class that you don't know too much. The early threads discuss best leveling builds and typical road blocks on the way to 60. Now that we're into the second iteration of the threads we're seeing more PvP/raid discussion. I'd consider keeping the threads since there isn't really any other in depth class discussion on the subreddit.
---
I think the weekly sticky threads on retail WoW for tanking Tuesday, midweek mending, and firepower Friday are super valuable and this was the closest thing we had to it.
---
Thunderfury has been good to me. Yes, horde outnumber alliances, but there is a lot of guilds with MC on farm and that work together.
---
Alliance still has the advantage at a straight Zerg? A Zerg done right by alliance is a 7 min victory every time if the ‚Äúimbalanced‚Äù horde side does the same. Y‚Äôall just whine because you aren‚Äôt handed victories like the first two days lmao
---
I sometimes farm items I need instead of the most optimal to change the pace up.  Maybe I don‚Äôt have time for a long lasher session so I just go down and fish some deviate delights up, or craft some shirts for the AH.  The great thing is there are a lot of possibilities for gathering materials.
---
Now balanced servers can become imbalanced and the perpetual server transfers begin.
---
"Hey anyone want to run X dungeon?" "Sure let me hope on my alt"
---
"Hey stop what you are doing and come run me through a dungeon, I need it"
---
I'm certain you arent implying that people ask like the latter version. So I'm not sure what you are implying. If you are in a guild and no one ever wants to help or respond to the former version than you are in a shit guild
---
Ah fair enough then, I'm only rank 3 - I've been told it may take 3-4 weeks to get rank 8... so not really that close :) I'll cough up the money when I get it!
---
People keep saying this. But I don't believe you.
---
If you‚Äôre a priest you can farm Mara for gold. Priest and pallys can farm dm e.
---
This post is proof that when people say "tbc killed the old world by funneling everyone into outlands" they are wrong. Its just the way the game works.  
---
The thing is though, while you sorta did miss the boat when majority of people were leveling it made questing near impossible *except* for the elite quests. So ton of people relied on dungeons to level or grinding. You just have the opposite problem now.
---
Try to make it south one more time after you die in a group you spawn with. If you die again then start corpse running to FWGY. It should be captured by the time you make it there so you can respawn with the raid.
---
As a horde I do love waiting behind Balinda for the main push to go by and then picking on the slow people.
---
This is stalagg. I played av so damn much, got about 300k honour and didn't even gain a full rank. Still rank 5 lol. If this is how it is on my server then the dreams dead to even hit 10.
---
This man ganks.
---
Ohhh someone woke on the edgy side of the bed this morning
---
Bash has a great chance to not even land.  5% resist, X% miss, 5% parry, 5-10 % dodge.
---
&gt;*Because some changes are good.*
---
And who made you the arbiter? I don't want the changes you want and you don't want the changes I want.
---
Blizzard literally can't win with the community. "The only winning move is not to play."
---
Yeah, I don't doubt that. But I would assume you're an exception to the rule, and that not every HWL is in a similar situation.
---
Either way best of luck with the grind and a speedy recovery.
---
Defend, take mine / towers.
---
Confirmed over 70 mad zugs as of 12/18 at 11am EST.
---
I fished in western plaguelands for an hour+ last night without a single gank. I tried in P2 and literally couldn't go 2 casts without someone coming by and killing me.
---
Another op that has zero clue on how av works. Delete this mods.
---
So with the launch of BGs most of the player base are now in BGs because of the time commitment to rank. My best suggestion would be to find a big guild that has an active player base. Much easier to make runs with a guild than LFG chat. Guilds are way more important in Classic than in Live. Not just for raiding but for anything.
---
The pants is cheap, just buy mats from ah and ask some guildies to make it for u, i bet a dj band cost more lol

its odd that you have so little sungrass. I have 3 characters that all got 300 herb before level 50 and it was mainly because I just spammed the fuck out of every sungrass node in Feralas because there's like a billion.

Tuesday was my day off from 2005-2009. Played wow the whole time. Hated not being able to play in the mornings. Feel your pain.
---
I wanted to be rppvp or rp, but after surveying my online friends, when I caved I chose a reliable friend on a PvP server. I don't like the server type by my friend and the guild we're in is nice.
---
I'm now bored though. I won't raid because *I've done that* and my life cannot support it. PvP was my plan but the bgs aren't fun right now and the honour farm is brutally disheartening.
---
Imagine thinking AV is for farming honor and not rep.
---
Remember: Account sharing with your child is not against tos

Bloodvine sets i guess.
---
I‚Äôm on benediction. It‚Äôs fairly large, fairly balanced and a nice server. There‚Äôs many guilds but mine doesn‚Äôt need anyone ;/
---
Probably 60-80 with quests. About 20 hours.
---
That can work if you have a good percentage of 100%'s and the horde  doesn't try for Bal. If you're in a DPS race, though, you need those 60% folks to burn Galv quickly.
---
LIP won't do anything for breath, so if you get aggro in P3 as a clothie you're likely just gunna die.  I wouldn't bother.
---
I‚Äôm a resto Druid. Only thing I‚Äôve found to be fairly lucrative while grinding is Jadefire Run for Felcloth/greens but I can usually only get about an hour of grinding there a day before Horde players move in and take it over. I‚Äôm still below 500g for my epic mount üòî
---
So if I want to get another mount not from my home city do I need to be Exalted?
---
A discord

You need to build a generator dude and start collecting car batteries as a power store.

Warlock no clue
---
I very rarely play without my guildies and buddies on discord for this reason. I can just say ‚Äúrogue on, need peels‚Äù in disco and it‚Äôs very satisfying to see 3 or 4 friends turn around and blow them up. 
---
I keep them safe, they keep me safe :)
---
It only takes 1-2 players to completely ruin this for horde. Typically only about a group shows up. They pull the guards and tap. All the while being under fire from the archers. A single pair of dot classes can roast them and stay out of reach.
---
I‚Äôm not sure if they‚Äôre raiding yet, but I know that‚Äôs their plan.
---
I don't know the pull strategy but if a player knows it they can pull drek solo into the doorway and just kill him.
---
Alliance on Herod stands strong. We won‚Äôt be bullied off our server!
---
it's war man, it's warrrrr. people need to understand this is no hello kitty. Let me tell you again.. WARRRRRRRRRRRR
---
All of my AV‚Äôs were full of Prot warriors each time.  I got tired of people constantly wanting to taunt off me.  After about the 30th Balinda/Vann rush.  It got old and I wanted to have a little fun.  I was still more effective than the ones fishing.
---
Neither works. You can't transfer into Faerlina from any server
---
Prioritize what will be the biggest upgrades stat wise. 
---
Like in the current content, as a mage, the biggest upgrades for me are things like ring of spellpower, mageblade, ToEP trinket. I'd rather take those than the pieces that only provide a marginal upgrade over pre-bis
---
Unfortunately I'm one of 8 mages in my raid and we also have 3-4 warlocks so all I've got so far are the marginal upgrades lol
---
You're playing differently than me.   Horde are forcing pvp in my games so much so that I'll get kills that are 0%
---
8-9 hours a day is still a second full time job, more cause you're doing it on the weekends. 
---
I'm taking christmas off from pvp, I'll get 7 or 8 after the holidays.
---
Ive been trying to find this discord you talk about, no luck yet. Im i too dumb to find it out?
---
With the 15 min queues on Horde side, gotta make games 20-30 mins to be worth the rep.
---
Playing a video game for 16 hours a day is just sad and an addiction. It's like having tanks for meth heads
---
Doesn't really matter if horde get to the base 30 seconds faster as it takes horde 2-3 minutes to clear the civilian/guard aggro before they can cap the GY. This also causes a huge downstream issue: when doing the rush strat neither team has an offensive graveyard fully capped, so horde dying to ally civilians get sent all the way back to the cave while alliance really have no reason to die inside the frostwolf base.
---
i would guesstimate between 80 and 100
---
you are a source of honor/rep for the opposing faction.
---
you are very usefull, don't let your friends tell you otherwise.
---
on a serious note... over half of the lvl 60's have their epic mount now... and horde are also intercepting people on epic mount regularly. go farm gold and get it.
---
I recommend Herod too, only if they are alliance tho. We are horde dominated, so an alliance guild would help.
---
Didn't Alliance used to cap Snowfall every game ? Since AV released on Classic I see Horde sperging about not caping SH GY ever because it'll cause a turtle. But that used to never be the case, Horde would SH GY and Ally would take Snowfall. What happened ?
---
I was wondering if there is a list like shadow panther for fury warriors. This infographic is something that was posted in my discord and wanted to know if it was true. https://i.imgur.com/YM4EAX8.jpg
---
As people have said before me, there is no need to stress. As a player in one of the top guilds in the world on Horde (according to Warcraftlogs) things looks like this, atleast for us:
---
* Raids every second week (to minimize respecc costs), clearing Molten Core in roughly \~40 minutes casually (all worldbuffs + basic consumes, no requirement for flask at the moment  for DPS/healers). Clearing Onyxia on reset (20man). No plans on any speedruns anytime soon.
---
* In-house PUG every week for socials/alts to get some gear, keeping a fast phase, usually around \~50-55 mins with Onyxia straight afterwards.
---
* Mainroster, those who feel like it, started their ranking process (no guildwide requirement) with the honor system being release. Multiple people are aiming for R14, so with AV/WSG released in-house premades should start getting organized. People aiming for the higher ranks (12-14) will probably join up with other BR1/BR2 pvpers for premade instead. Personal goal for me is \~400-450k honor/week, going for R10 to start with. Depending on the premade situation and IRL stuff (such as work etc.) I might consider going higher, but won't go for R14.
---
* Maybe 75-80% of the roster is done with their AV rep as of last sunday, but people are slowly getting there.
---
* Plenty of instances are being done still. Usually no problem to find people (in-house or pugs) for 55-60 instances.
---
With that said, just enjoy the game as you wish and have the ability to play!  
---
But please, don't turtle in AV :(
---
One thing I learned is to not run too far away from Warriors. They have a dead zone where you're too far away for melee and too close for intercept.
---
And don't forget, you also get a trinket to cleanse intercept stun.
---
A missed opportunity for sure
---
I also noticed killing  enemy seem to give 1 rep, is that only the first kill (or the first 3 kills, like honor) or is that all the time? Might as well hit horde right in field of strife and non-stop battle them for half an hour for hundreds of +1's.
---
i think the lowest level bracket for silence at all is 29, but that requires the mage to go full arcane, so I don't think you really have to worry about silence till warlocks get fell hunters
---
Here I am, a casual in PvP terms, just trying to hit rank 3 and exalted for the budget ram and coming up short of that.  I fully underestimated the grind to get even rank 3.  I regret not no-lifing AV on release with 8 min zergs. Especially being off of work that day.
---
I'd love it.
---
Alliance generally won AV more because they have the better side and most servers had more alliance (all the young legolas kiddies picking NE hunters and no knowledge of pvp talents). For months BGs weren't cross-server so it mattered. 
---
The horde starting point was also set way further back meaning Alliance could cap snowfall for free and start pushing the captain without any real chokepoints for the horde to defend
---
They're releasing all the old content step-by-step, nothing new.
---
Go for PVE. That way you can choose how you want to spend your time each day.
---
Really? Without aggro any of the 4 warmasters??
---
&gt;an
---
this was my experience aswell. my pserver guild got pretty good at killing aq trash and downing ouro but we still required world buffs and consumes to kill cthun even after we got good at phase1 and usually 35 people survived into phase2. meanwhile the top guilds on the server (which now are the top guilds of classic) one shot it.
---
I‚Äôm on a west coast server, and can‚Äôt even find a guild to raid with because I‚Äôm on the west coast, and everyone raids too early for my schedule. Even the ‚Äúlate night‚Äù guild starts at 8pm my time.
---
&gt; What you do is talk to your est players about what their plan is. if they do want to move to a timezone that raids closer to their preferred time, you start recruiting heavier where you can and start picking up players below lvl 60, maybe even help them with leveling and attunements.
---
You should have started doing that when they dropped BGs and also announced that they would be implementing paid transfers sometime in the future. They didn't give a set date, but it's not like you needed that in order to plan ahead like you described.
---
A lot of the horde seems to raid log. Also 2/3rds of the healers on our side seem to not know how to cast spells on people not in their party.
---
just delete those :P
---
still.. i think twink warrs trully shines at 49 with intercept MS and improved hamstring and ofc if you have money for kang the decapitator than you wreck.
---
Me and my cousin were talking about this ui and couldn‚Äôt think what could be there but you got it on the money
---
It's pretty close but even more indicative of some base human nature. For the vast majority of players, this would be a smarter thing to do even most other players do not follow suit, however, I think that knowledge that work you're doing is benefiting others slightly more than you is a hard pill to swallow for a lot of people. 
---
If you told people if they loaned you $100 that you'd pay them back $200 tomorrow (and they know you're good for it), they'd take that deal in a heart beat. But if you gave them the same $200 back but you were also going to give $250 to someone who didn't pay at all, I bet a lot of people would say fuck that.
---
More like 80%, as that's what you need to hit rank 10+ honor brackets. But that's per week. The rush right now is making brackets ultra competitive, as those hardcore get their ranks, the bracket caps will slowly fall down.
---
Trueeee
---
On pve servers no you cant.
---
We can only hope.
---
angelarena!
---
Do not go fury prot for 5 mans. It is terrible for 5 mans. Tank 5 mans in your normal fury dps build. You'll be fine, just slap a shield on.
---
Watch this video to hopefully save some hours debating trinkets... https://youtu.be/Ws_erQr6zdU
---
You didn‚Äôt do about 4 hours a day. You can get 100k in ~6-8hrs.   Casual sit down.
---
Whatever the meta, the most cohesive/well-led side wins.  The teams who articulate a clear plan, mark people, and tell certain groups to follow certain people have a much stronger chance to win.  The teams who designate a clear puller, and tell others to wait outside, will methodically take out lieutenants before calling all-in on the leader.  This is just as true for a rush as it is for a methodical destruction of towers/GY control.
---
What 15-20 minute wins? If I roll with a big premade (20+) the game is super easy. If I roll with a 7-10 man premade it's a lot harder. This is because once we get some kind of preasure going in the horde base... freaking 20+ horde TP down forcing us to cap the hut before we can even think about doing anything. I wish the horde would get 15 min wins. Just kill Drek + LTs, then AFK. Sadly they don't in my experience.
---
Dagger rogues in loot council guilds are typically last to see bloodfang for the simple reason that they must continue to use aged core leather gloves. This means a good loot council will award boots of shadow flame and some off piece to offset the delay in acquiring t2
---
I'm horde so I dunno, but that's what I read in the comments section somewhere on here this morning.
---
No you‚Äôre too casual
---
Smolderweb represent. 
---
Happy I was finally able to find a guild that raids sat/sun at 10am. The PUG's were killin me in repairs and consumables for little reward. (Last PUG only managed 3 bosses in around 3 to 4 hours along with 3 failed attempts at ony. Don't know why I stuck it out.)
---
Most guilds tend to do 5 or 6pm which isn't possible for me. And we just did a 1 day MC last week. Hopefully we can keep that up and get the times faster to get in some Ony runs right after. Currently they do it at a weird time of 6pm ony and forget what weekday they have been using.
---
That matches how it felt in mc tonight. Had the tank get punted for the first time in a long time.
---
PVP!
---
It's not normal. My mage has 445 frost damage and I top out around 450-500 dps with a greater arcane elixir. They are using addons that produce bloated dps values like recount. The only way to get that high of actual dps is to get lucky with crits and be in such a minmax raid that the bosses are dying in very short time periods. The shorter the fight the less "lucky" you have to get.  Locks also have to waste GCD's on lifetap typically. Also, I haven't seen many tanks generating 1k tps.
---
DFT can desttoy guillds
---
From what I heard on private servers, once the horde figured out and reliably used the back door, they could reliably win the race.  Then alliance has to stall.
---
I got mine in Darkshore.  The moonkins are near the center of the map, and have 70%+ droprate on small eggs.
---
Blizzard took out the API call used to dismiss totems in the latest patch. So unfortunately, it's probably never coming back.
---
What about the Elite?
---
You do realize that if you waited 3 minutes and ran as a group none of these problems would happen right? It's usually only ~10 people who mess up the entire rush by defending mid once the epic mount people run past.
---
‚ÄúQuarter and compassion should be given to friend AND FOE ALIKE.‚Äù I guess undead rogues didn‚Äôt get the memo in P2.
---
It's really bad sometimes man lol. Specially when they late comers all have 60 speed mounts. It's an auto lose. or Insta turtle which is a loss for everyone.
---
Not everyone is doing the 13/14 grind. I'm doing rank 10 and the more efficient honor farming means less time spent pvping. Getting rank 7/8 for 2/4 piece is also pretty good for a lot of classes.
---
&gt;Server balance is an unsolvable problem because the huge majority of people who want to play on pvp servers prefer to play horde.
---
This is the main issue. You can't fix this and still stick to #nochanges.
---
https://www.engadget.com/amp/2008/06/12/oceanic-alliance-characters-to-get-free-pve-to-pvp-transfers/
---
I will! Because fuck it.
---
- The Horde
---
Now this all may not be exact, but it should cover the general idea.
---
The game is a modified version of the retail(bfa or legion) and not a remaster of vanilla. This comes with good (better optimization) and (debatable) negatives (legion targeting system).
---
The idea is they run the game off of patch 1.12 but release the content in phases. [wowhead has an article on phases](https://www.wowhead.com/guides/wow-classic-six-content-phases)
---
I hope I understood your question.
---
Most our top rankers on alliance on fairbanks get their honor this way, 3K+ for a 10-20 minute game win or loss.  WSG is only better if you can maintain 5-10 minute wins, which we all know WSG is mostly pre-mades, so the majority of wins/losses are more like 20-40 minutes.
---
Yeah, right now, no problem if you are in a guild that is 10/10 MC every week, hunters are not there to top DPS charts, needed for tranq, and some utility/CC.
---
But, once you get to progression nights in BWL, gonna need big time DPS from everyone, so it might not work.  I had a friend that raided in survival in vanilla, and he was always near the top DPS for hunters, he was super dedicated and amazing as a player.  I was just an MM scrub with my flower bow.
---
I just spec shadow outside of raids now for PvP
---
Trying to heal AV in pugs without guildies is just no fun at all as Alliance 
---
Too many times I‚Äôm the only healer South and the lack of care for my mana while 15 melee take endless leave damage is fucking insane
---
Then they have the audacity to complain about lack of heals
---
I wish that were the case on my server. Devilsaur has gone down a bit fersure yet still little pricey, luckily i never ended up needed it.  But Hide of the Wild is most definitelytly not "history"...in fact its actually gone up in price. Personally never understood why people buy crafted items instead of the mats, for most cases. But even here the mats still come very close to the same cost
---
Playing too much AV will have you lose all faith in humanity and realize that, yeah, we really are this stupid.
---
Yes, but if you tell people that R13 gear is BiS and then don't give alternatives for people who aren't suicidal, your guide is shit.
---
You missed step 4) allow paid server transfers.
---
Yeah, it's really the people looking only forward and never back that are causing your losses.  As Horde, every game for days now I've been going to mid and waiting with a few other Horde well out of combat range for the main Alliance zerg to pass by.  Once they've gone past, we leap in and engage every straggler we see.  Usually half the stragglers never even bother to dismount in a vain attempt to blow past the interceptors.  The other half are usually too disorganized to offer real resistance.  And the main zerg practically never comes back to help anyone behind them.  So you lose from 1/4 up to 1/2 of your raid immediately and inevitably get bogged down regardless of whether you are going to Galv or Drek.
---
If he had been raiding since the beginning, he probably was quite decked.
---
Even DPS warriors start to get poached, once they get brutal gear and would be an addition to another guild.
---
He probably was already poached and just raided couple IDs to get some more items before ditching the guild for BWL progress.
---
u/botlaneandchill Expected nothing less from a bot laner... Probably an adc ... they complain a lot.
---
Is AV no longer the best honor farm in the game?
---
On this sub someone posted related timelines of reaching different milestones.  
---
Exalted AV was first and exalted WSG was somewhere around reaching Rank 10, IIRC.
---
Damn your 3ft?
---
Assuming you took the precision talent for 5% hit, you hit% needed from gear to cap yellow attacks is 1%. Rogues tend to value hit over the hit cap much more than warriors because you have no way to convert your white attacks to yellows like warriors do, so going over the hit cap is ok. I would think you want to prio crit over hit at this point though. I would seek out the rogue class discord for a more thorough understanding of proper stat weights.
---
No...
---
They're releasing the content from Vanilla in "phases," currently they're in phase 2 and have enabled the honor system and a couple battlegrounds.
---
The one caveat of the way they're doing it is that they've started with the 1.12 version of the WoW client as the base, instead of 1.0, so there are talent changes and optimizations in place now that weren't implemented until later in Vanilla's lifespan. Basically, they're running with the arguably most "complete" base client, but currently providing content that's limited to the earlier releases.
---
Eventually they'll go through the originally-released Vanilla content in order, adding the newer raids and things, AQ and Naxx, all in good time. From there they haven't officially announced what they'll do, between continuing Classic as only the Vanilla content or providing something like the outdated expansions (BC, Wrath). So other than everything Vanilla originally had on offer, we don't necessarily know what we'll be getting down the line.
---
My premade goes galv, commanders, fwfy, rh, pull 2 WM, get drek, win. Only lose when pugs cap IBGY or get dumb and chase horde into the room pulling WMs
---
thank you, no idea what my post got deleted so idk if you can read this, but thank you!
---
Travel form is level 30.
---
Both matter, the field of strife of where the forces are meant to meet.  And that push takes them back into the one base or the other.  The alliance can push directly into Gav, that‚Äôs an advantage.  But I think the larger advantage goes to Horde as they can pick where they want to fight the alliance
---
I transferred a level 40 rogue from a PVE server to a PVP server in Vanilla.  I'm positive of it.
---
??
---
This sub told me alliance would turn into PvP gods once BGs get released, what happened?
---
I‚Äôm on alliance side.  Thalnos.  Fucking terrible server.  Anyone want to recommend a better one / half way decent one with a majority of English speaking players?
---
Except that av is the best way to grind honor currently .  Keep parroting your little imagine quote like half the idiots who still run directly to drek and die though .
---
Moo
---
Darn I am on a pve so can‚Äôt xfer over.
---
Thank you! Got too busy with raid last night but gonna try this route out tonight and see how it goes.
---
So this is probably the worst "proof" you could have shown me. This is from 2008, 2 years after BC was released. So not vanilla. As well as only implementing 1 PVE server to transfer to one PVP server. In the article it also states: " we also know that [Blizzard is still firmly against PvE to PvP realm transfers](http://wow.joystiq.com/2008/04/12/don-t-expect-pve-to-pvp-transfers-anytime-soon/), which may be preventing Thaurissan from getting the influx of new blood they need " so thats saying that in 2008 blizzard was still against normal PVE to PVP transfers. 
---
So you have proven my point in saying that PVE to PVP realm transfers were not available in vanilla WoW.
---
Bagnon lets you see your alts' bags/banks.
---
Saying ‚Äòvanillas *wasn‚Äôt* like this‚Äô is the exact same thing..
---
Rushing Drek is basically correct though.
---
Looks dope.
---
/cast Charge
---
/cast Defensive Stance
---
Since they are seperate GCD's, it gives the rage once I am in defensive stance.
---
Whatever I guess it doesnt matter, your guild is casual af. But your gearing is TERRIBLE. That much defense is just not needed at all in MC. You should gear more for threat.  But since your guild only does like 300 DPS max, I guess you don't need it.  Won't make it through BWL with that guild and a pally tank though.
---
Looking forward to this.
---
Yep, as an Ex-HWL the key to the grind is playing with a nice premade who gets honor at such a pace better than people not in the group that they can coordinate to stop pushing. If there is no coordination required, the push continues. There doesn't seem to ever be a reason to leave AV(except on a BG weekend when they come out). r14 was one of the most social gaming experiences I've ever had, AV grinding with no ability to party queue is the opposite.
---
There are a few of us who try to get people to kill them. Too many won‚Äôt change unless a streamer does first.
---
You should always stall. Defending isn't the same as stalling. Also, the horde meta is different because of longer queues, activities that gives less hph but allow them to spend a higher fraction of their time on them as opposed to queueing is more worth it for them.
---
Here's someone going through every item in BWL and discussing it in depth. Top comment has timestamps for each individual item.

I'm not an expert on either class, but off the top of my head though, for warlocks:

They are, I win 9/10 AVs, and they're in under 15 minutes each, fastest I've had is 6 minutes...so....

Before each raid use /combatlog to start logging data. The command will list where your log is being saved, remember that.
---
At the end of the raid use /combatlog again to end data logging, then close your game. Upload the log file from before to Warcraft logs.
---
Delete the log file so you have a clean log for next raid.
---
What do you mean you‚Äôre not minmaxing? That‚Äôs illegal
---
It's always better to invest in items not gold. Gold is always depreciating. You're making the right call.
---
Yes.  If only the Ony/Nef buff would go off there it'd be perfect.
---
So, people winning against you using viable strategies and not cheating in any way are ruining the game?
---
Running a Loot Council is just a big YIKES from me.  On top of that it looks like they are funneling gear to a select few players, that's a second YIKES from me.
---
I went hunting for felcloth with my priest friend (both 60) and we coexisted peacefully with the group of 52ish alliance that were questing. A warlock pet attacked me once so I killed it and emoted /NO. The warlock did /sorry and we never fought again.
---
Go to the website, download the client. The client will extract and read the log file. You have to enable enhanced combat logging or whatever it's called in your wow network settings. When uploading make sure to list as public. You can make a guild page on the website too.
---
Wait you are in games that the alliance wins? Jesus I feel bad for your teams. I won about 80% of my games. The only two we lost was because our offense would cap a base and leave immediately. And would get wiped constantly for trying to go to fast
---
Precision, not weapon expertise, my b. 
---
Thanks.

&gt;Ethics and business don't mix
---
They legally can't be, under [Dodge v. Ford](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dodge_v._Ford_Motor_Co.) corporations are legally required to operate with increasing shareholder value as their top priority, regardless of the means to achieve that.
---
The world is actually dangerous and if you don't go out with your complete adventurer kit, it's going to bed bad. Goblin Slayer bad.
---
Blame blizzard for not splitting premade groups from random pugs, don't blame horde premades for being better than you at WSG.
---
Also, pretty sure the pants aren't in the game yet anyway.
---
OH YOU HAVE ALL 3 OF THEM HUH, QUITE THE ENVIABLE POSITION HUH, PRETTY BAD PROBLEM YOU GOT THERE HUH. Ill just go back to crying over here don't mind me.
---
If you happen to find one please send me a pm. :)
---
Dear Opposing Faction,
---
Please stop winning.
---
Upvoted
---
I mean you have to inflate the 80% as there are some people who will just not participate in PvP at all thus not triggering the brackets.
---
Same on my realm, but tbh 300k isnt that much, that's like two days of going ham. I'm gonna try go less ham but play all 7 days this time around.
---
We dont have a bug, no. We can have 1 MT on drek and 4 OTs holding a warmaster againt each wall tho for much the same result.
---
Exactly. They are gonna be insanely costly that tuesday. The price will absolutely plummet afterwards.
---
I don't think anyone but the most hardcore of guild expects raiders to get pvp gear from rank 10+, you can safely ignore those kind of items in BiS lists.
---
I tried to queue WSG with a friend as horde and faced 6 ally premades in a row. Now I never queue unless I'm in a full premade.
---
classic....badum cha

---
Lol wsg
---
what program or site do you guys sim with?
---
Most people are there for the easy XP.
---
All good Alliance players that knew what theyre doing are either in Premades or theyre already exalted and dont play AV Anymore unless its just to fuck around or fight people in mid that isnt WSG. People got Exalted in the first 2-3 days when Alliance won games in 7 mins using the Drek rush to Rep farm.   
---
Now Alliance is left with trash pugs who dont know what to do, dont really care/are casual. The only way youll find them winning a high % of games now is if its led by a premade. My guildies premade was 10/10 wins using Drek rush strat yesterday. The only time you can lose at that point are bad Warmaster pulls.   
---
AV is mind numbing tho.
---
While correct, people do have a point considering how this all came about and the shit job Blizzard has done in getting to this point (no server caps, faction specific, etc.).  ALSO, these transfers came at the *end* of the Vanilla cycle just before TBC NOT before BWL.
---
You do pull one warmaster, but the other 4 standing opposite don't come.
---
The trick isn't really a trick.  You just hug the wall and shoot a dog.
---
Maybe it goes both ways, I don't know.  But premades vs pugs suck and drive players away.
---
You lack complete understanding of the system and are very stupid.
---
There's a cap on how much you can rank up per week, and a DR on honor earned in the week and position climbed...
---
In other words, nobody...even if biggest sweat lords can reach R7 or R8 without waiting 3 weeks minimum...still VERY easily achievable with NOT much work...just takes waiting.
---
i made this
---
I saw more people in westfall than I did in SW the other day, everyone on my server is all Pre-Bis'd out leveling alts until there next raid.
---
That's not the answer to how are you going to call 16+ hours required for R11-13 or so.
---
If they are worth a lot of money its usually all need. If not then nothing special.
---
At least alliance gets to pseudo group queue to AV... I am stuck with complete randoms, half of them wannabe rankers who start yelling "jUsT LeT AlLiaNcE WiN fAsT, Ez hOnoR pEr hOuR," before the gates even open.
---
Honestly the biggest factor that nobody talks about for Alliance is the people on lvl 40 mounts..  Horde crashes into them and alot of those people never make it down to FW if they die in that initial ride. Horde peasants get left alone and can catch up anytime.
---
Yeah, that's right.
---
hahahaha, wow. Heaven forbid that a group of competent players get together to win games. 
---
\#literallyUnplayable
---
make me
---
i stopped playing my main and rerolled on earthshaker.... i couldn't even find groups to get my pre raid BiS on my priest, weirdly i found it easier to get into MC though there is still raiding guilds.

---
Not that I think this is the sole problem but don‚Äôt you guys think part of it has to do with queue times? As an ally, you just keep rinsing and repeating. As a horde, each av is valuable. You are more likely to premade on horde. I know when I did vanilla av as horde when it got to this style, I always used the premade addon. But even then ally rolled pugs. Now no one has any patience and there are so many ally that get auto queue that they just mindlessly go in and don‚Äôt try and get better
---
Well, you are worth about 75-100 honor solo. It sucks, but it‚Äôs just a reality
---
No wonder there were so many alliance players whining about world PvP they‚Äôre terrible at PvP!
---
That is also hardcore, it‚Äôs a range not an absolute number
---
It seems like they are introduced in p3, no?  I'm getting conflicting information from different places.
---
Or when there are 7 warriors there, but I'm the only one spamming disarm on cd. I love it when that happens too.
---
They didn't forget - this is Horde territory now. Consider this your warning to leave peacefully before me and the boys storm it.
---
Question: how do you get into a premade? It‚Äôs hard enough to get our party of 5 to join the same BG, let alone a whole team
---
It costs 25 euros to transfer?? It isn't adjusted to equal $25 USD?? That is some shit if true.
---
Min lvl 30 for priest silence
---
the highest dps kills are always achieved with short kill times. this maximizes the uptimes of damage boosting cooldowns such as PI and TOEP for casters, and death wish / reck for warriors.
---
to achieve short kill times, the top guilds practically all elect to kill all 8 adds at once. No sheeps, just pure AoE.
---
thus, he is very skeptical that you achieve dps that would rank you among the best locks in the world using a very conservative strategy that doesn't aim to shorten kill times at all.
---
One mention for the defense of the pallies - for them +7 int is a big upgrade.  
---
Actually they would gladly exchange +healing to +int because of their passive.
---
Dang idk what to say then :/
---
Idk tbh, read 25 euros somewhere but might've been dollars
---
Not at all.  Just not interested in suffering so someone else can enjoy their viable strategies.  So I won't.  Enjoy the queues.
---
Speed doesn't matter at all in 1.12, damage range does and the damage range of Spinal Reaper is higher than that of Unstoppable Force, with a significantly higher lower end and a slightly higher upper end.
---
True story, but it doesn't negate him being a coward.  I have no respect for fools that spawn camp griffon riders.
---
I played the version with the strong npcs and the mines on a private server and it was way more fun than what we got now.
---
someone needs to hook me up with that discord.
---
My survival hunter is 31, leveling definitely. 
---
I know it's preferred raid spec when AQ comes out, I don't see why it wouldn't work this phase, probably not optimal, but play what you enjoy.
---
You evil bastard!
---
I was in a premade last night, we played against mostly alliance premade. When I played solo it was similar. Don‚Äôt blame horde players for playing together. This is literally the only pvp mode where you can queue up with your friends...
---
&gt;Even if I found and ran with alliance premades (my guild isn't interested in acquiring cancer in this way), it would still be a rough grind.
---
Ok? Why should everything be such low effort few day grind? They aren't cheating or exploiting, they are just playing the game... better than you are.... so they reap the rewards.
---
I hear retail is a great place for instant gratification and pure linear progression.
---
I farm SFK as well as a pally in order to farm twink gear. 
---
I don't do the entire dungeon as single pulls because it increases the risk of failure and isn't all that much faster. 
---
The biggest risks I've come across, and I'm curious how you're mitigating them here, is the silence preventing me from consecrating or healing myself(lasts 5seconds I believe) and the steeds knocking you down/stunning you.
---
It looks like you're skipping the steeds, but how are you avoiding the silences? 
---
Also, and this is completely anecdotal, but I've seen better than average assassin's blade drops off the mobs between fenrus and arugal. I even got 2 in 4 runs at the boss before arugal. 
---
Maybe it's just me, but I always full clear the while thing for that reasons. The biggest annoyance for me has been vendoring to make it truly worth it. I typically do 3 runs, hearth to mail things to bank Alts and then run back. Due to this and the horrendously low drop rates on shadowfang(still haven't gotten one and assassin's blade, I agree this is not great gold per hour overall.
---
Good way to spend a few hours aoe farming for twink gear as a pally though!
---
Pure luck on my part.  When friends are trying to AV together we use dbm 5 sec pull timer and all hit first available on the "pull now" audible ding.  This largely eliminates the lag of human coordination.  Most of us get in the same AV if we time it right, the ones that don't manually queue for the same id as there's usually a few spots left and some people dip.
---
Glad there‚Äôs a post about Warcraft 3 in the classic wow discord
---
So why you happily lump together 6-8 hours a day and 16 hours a day (10 hours difference) for "hardcore" yet refuse to lump together 2 hours a day and 6-8 hours a day for "casual", especially since effective pvp ranking in classic leans towards 10-14 hours daily grind or maybe even more? Stop applying retail values to classic, it's different here.
---
As warlock, prio on non tier should be :
---
1. Nelth's tear
---
2. band of forced conc
---
3. Staff of shadow flame
---
4. Mish
---
As rogue, I'm less certain (I main mage) but I would assume CTS is number one, DFT is also insanely good ofc but it is not forever bis, which it is for warriors.
---
I'd say 
---
1. CTS
---
2. Maladath
---
3. DFT
---
The alliance don't need a back door, the front door of Frostwolf Keep is WIDE OPEN.
---
I play a healer and think allowing healers to get the choker before all dps get it is moronic. Even if you use dkp you should not be allowed to roll for it.
---
As for your third point I think its ok for the guy to give it to himself if you are using LC. The point of the system is to use items the best and according to you he somehow clicks frostbolt better than anyone do he deserves it.
---
Didn‚Äôt say horde don‚Äôt have their own probs too, just talking in reference to spawn location ‚Äî something that game wide favors the horde.
---
My experience in vanilla/bc says it will stay this way except for the occasional bored rogue camping folks or low level 30s/40s messing with each other. at this point I probably won't fight you unless you start it or there's a lotus/patch of ele water between us
---
Bro you sub /r/asmongold
---
it's very dependent on your gear and target. It's very rare that you can one shot someone in a CS unless they are undergeared clothy.
---
Atiesh Horde side here and while the alliance may outnumber us, there is still an active horde community on the server, at least it seems like it to me.
---
Really... I had no idea. That's interesting.
---
It wasnt so bad on my alt.  Week one of release it was actual fucking AIDS
---
It's the only fix though.
---
Idk if you played like 3 AV's and defied all odds and won 2/3 but yes Ally has a much better time at zerging, why im not sure but of the 30+ games ive played ally wins 80% of the time. When they dont Horde needs to play crazy defense and it always ends up taking 30 mins a match
---
Ironically enough, most asian mobile mmos went this way.
---
Afaik you can shoot the dog and drek is the only linking agro.
---
Warlocks and Priest both get a silence at level 30, so realistically silence isn‚Äôt a concern till 39 bracket
---
In other words, the smaller servers got fucked, and it killed the end game raiding aspect of the game.  Which was 99% of the game.
---
And I didn't even mention that the paladin healer that got the choker, got Mageblade over a ton of caster DPS that needed it badly.
---
I dont think this is true, especially if you consider AV premades. Every single player in the top bracket for both factions on my server was AV, and we had WSG teams who went 300 games without losing averaging well under 10 minute games.
---
The 2.5 patch increased the render distance significantly. I had to go from max graphics down to almost minimum to maintain a decent framerate üôÅ
---
Play horde, can confirm. The few times alliance met us at Bel it was a total shitshow. Can be done if horde doesn't string LTs to the fight but we always do and it creates a ton of chaos if alliance defends Bel.
---
Shit, I haven't heard a space Odyssey reference pass the first book in.... Ever! Solid shit. Prolly need to add the series to me reread list now. Thanks for the comment!
---
That sounds horrible. I'd quit the game if they did that and I was the 20% when I otherwise would have kept playing. Meaning your method would kill the server even more.
---
I would send you a link but the discord is closed to new members at the moment for whatever reason
---
:(
---
I‚Äôm standing 27 on my server as of last week (small server but still) so I was playing AV the moment I got home from work. Maybe played 10-12 games. Lost 2 in 15 minutes, the rest are wins. If you wipe the alliance Zerg before they cap relief hut or FW gy its a horde win.
---
That is the good advice trifecta boys!
---
I highly doubt its premades being cross-realm. I queue back to back to back facing different groups, and have just come to accept that AV is just much easier for the Ally side to zerg
---
Whoops, missed that in the OP. Edited the list, thanks.
---
Yeah I'm looking at server transfer. Between the low pop of my server and that loot disaster last night I need a change.
---
Oh is THIS why Salfa in Winterspring is missing on Herod? I can't turn in any Winterfall Spirit Beads because she's just... gone. It's odd, because she's completely unattackable and doesn't get into combat with anything. Interesting, hopefully we get a server restart soon to resolve this
---
That's just false. The most efficient rankers are doing AV premades and no alternative comes close.
---
&gt;Yeah I'm looking at server transfer. Between the low pop of my server and that loot disaster last night I need a change.
---
In general I‚Äôd say ‚Äúcan I need?‚Äù
---
Horde Skeram is so damn boring
---
It is but people still don't understand that honor is only compared to your own faction.  Whether horde gets more honor or not is irrelevant yet there are many who gets really angry that horde gets more honor.
---
That's fair, it definitely does
---
Orc warriors have better and easier to obtain axes. Rogues can't use axes.
---
Going to hit 49 relatively soon. Is it worth it to grind WSG rep so I can get access to gear now or just wait until I hit 60?
---
Wait, is it true that killing the second captain kill doesn't net bonus honor/rep? I've never noticed that to be the case.
---
No offense, but what galaxy do you live in where people will drop existing characters to reroll on another server to help population imbalance?
---
BG's are not about being "PvP gods" or pvping or even winning right now.  People want their rep, and try strategies that try to maximize that.  I am sure over the next few weeks actual PvP'ing might start going on.
---
That's not the point of LIP.  Chugging a LIP makes her move to the next person on her threat list and not target you for 6 seconds.  If the next person is right next to you and gets breathed on, that sucks, but the idea is that it takes you off her threat table for 6 seconds and allows a tank that time to gain enough threat to surpass you.
---
I think I'll stick with my Hunter for now, I seem to like the progression and the rate at which I level, compared to my warrior.
---
You just make sure they can't cap the gy. If they ever try to start killing the NPCs you just kill em.
---
If horde caps SHGY which they often do, it's all but guaranteed to be a 40+ minute alliance turtle.  I farmed over 700k honor in AV last week and this happened quite a bit.
---
The regular public never had an opportunity to go from PVE to PVP. There was the 3 exceptions that are mentioned here in that article but those aren't great things to base allowing PVE to PVP realm transfers in classic off of. 
---
Bottom line is that PVE &gt; PVP Realm transfers were not available until much later in wow development.
---
Your damage numbers don't affect rage generation, just your white crits.
---
Sure, they changed it to allow you and the other players to essentially collect mounts.  
---
The current iteration you have to buy a mount for 1000g.  That was deemed excessive and didn't allow for any customization.  Also, anytime you purchased a mount and got tired of it, you had to spend months making back that 1000g to purchase a new one.  One exception was if you were able to honor grind to rank 11 you could get some slight customization in the black war mounts.  
---
The new iteration you trained a level of riding skill for 1000g.  That allowed you to purchase multiple mounts because they were 10-100g to purchase from a vendor.  You could change what you were riding to match your gear and even though you still couldn't customize which horrible poligontal face you had on your character, you could customize the cool mount you would ride into battle in eye of the storm or blade's edge arena.
---
Seems some random NPCs are missing on Kalimdor aswell, first aid trainer in Orgrimmar, Salfa in Winterspring, possibly others
---
That sounds like people using the system in bad faith. I would bring the issue up in the guild and leave if not resolved.
---
Just encountered exactly this. Very toxic
---
Thanks for the well wishes Nols and Happy Holidays.
---
Badass! If only undead weren't such pricks in game.
---
I am sorry, what is the point of your post again?
---
Probably ppl actually working together instead of bickering over what start to use like the ones ive been experience since server restart this week..
---
Big dead titties.
---
I love that skarm is also knowledgable enough to say "jesus christ fuck loot councils I dont want to have to deal with this shit"
---
In that case (which happens more often than not), what's the play?
---
I've always used star for shackle but the rest is pretty standard. I see a moon, I sheep.
---
Hell yeah, up at 7pm, sleep at 11am
---
It is.
---
So anyone that wins loot has to stay in the guild forever?
---
Or the horde play defense and kill your Zerg. As what I‚Äôve been doing all the time these past couple days. A fuck ton of honor and a win for the horde
---
i tried it years ago and it didnt work tf
---
Git gud
---
Did it update today?  I had no update and it worked fine yesterday.
---
FWIW, if you use the Twitch client to update, there's a tab where you can easily install previous versions.
---
This dude definitely killed his fianc√©e and absolutely made her relapse. What a piece of filth.
---
And lastly, earn less Honor than the losing team.
---
Lvl 38 here, playing since lunch :-D
---
invite expired unfortunately.
---
Right, exactly where I saw it.  This is why I said "but not here" as in WoW Classic.  It is a shame...
---
ehhhhhh idk about that
---
Ah it's stuff like this that keeps it interesting, instead of it just being a mindless rush from tower to tower. Keep it up!
---
Anyone can write a guide, there's no prerequisite besides making an account on the website. My aoe build utilized shatter, imp CoC and ice shards. Later I also specced into arcane conc for clearcasting procs. If you want, I have a deep frost aoe build that also makes you potent in MC. Pm me if youd like me to share!

---
Murloc heads in Southshore sucks too. I never realized there were so many headless Murlocs running around the Eastern Strand.
---
You only need to consecrate every 8 seconds, but you also need to not die. 
---
What are you doing for heals? I'm typically spamming heals trying to get one off while waiting in consecration to come back up. Also, those fuckers tend to chain silence. Only times I've died doing this was getting 2 or 3 silences back to back. 
---
For reference, my typical pulls are:
---
* Entrance to cell, kill while door is opened. 
---
* Courtyard, stables and ramp
---
* Kitchen/dining room
---
* Ramp up to commander room and commander(beginning of silencers)
---
* Rooftop pathways with even more silencers and bats
---
* turrets and mobs up to fenrus
---
* Everything else
---
Any issues I encounter generally occur in commander room or out in the rooftops so I try to split those up.
---
Yup, handful of horde doing that now. As alliance, I grab snowballs, toss up the standard, and start fishing. They come by me, and while if they start fishing, they get to live, fighty types get rooted, snowballed, and generally fucked with. Those I kill end up some distance back, while I respawn close, and I can definitely go more than 1 for 1, and delay more. And when it's quiet, I get fish. 
---
Alliance does not adequately appreciate defense. But those handful of people staying north are often saving the game for the mindless rushers.
---
Last update was from 4 days ago. I checked a couple hours ago. Im looking fir a version that compliments the new key slots!
---
I don't know about private servers, but the majority of people are definitely using the backdoor by now, and yet I've not once won without a good number of defenders.
---
Baked.
---
Shaman can‚Äôt use polearms
---
When were the games played? The first few days alliance won almost always. Now I'm seeing the horde gain advantage because the alliance are still doing the same thing every game and the horde easily counter it.
---
I think, personally, AV is a good example that #SomeChanges probably would've been better.  
---
I've been having fun in classic, but AV grinding to exalted came very close to killing my soul...lol
---
You sir are the filth. I‚Äôm best friends with Jennas mom to this day and still call her mom.
---
Enjoy your freedom. 
---
Live your beat life for the rest of us still trapped in the valley. It's only getting worse here.
---
He's a tank... 2 months ago he would have got group for any instances in 2,3 seconds and if you had waited near an elite mob on any big servers, it was more likely that you had to wait for respawn than spending 30min to find somebody.
---
Faerlina &lt;vampire clan&gt; is the best guild in terms of progress and speed
---
The future holds a slow death. There is no influx of new players. It will slowly turn into a total ghost town.
---
Alliance doesn't D because we want to win or lose ASAP.  It's better to lose fast and instant queue into the next game.  Winning is just gravy.
---
Did you manage to find an invite? I'm pretty much the same gear as you and rank9.
---
WSG rep is pretty slow unless you have a premade that wins consistently. If you aren't in a rush to hit 60 and can get in a high 40s premade, the rep grind could potentially be easier at 49.
---
Improper use of a meme that‚Äôs been beat to death and it‚Äôs against the rules to post it since it‚Äôs not even Sunday. This topic is 100% cursed. Mods please delete.
---
they reaped what they sew
---
let us servers with balanced pop and good tidings, rejoice
---
I agree. I very much enjoy the memes and this sub has been very bland ever since the restriction.
---
The best games are ones where we have a leader spamming the same strat over and over so everyone goes the same way, the more detailed the better as Pugs seem to resemble processors for the 1960s...more than 1 or 2 commands at once and they can't process.
---
Usually, the one they spam the most is "Rush Galv and Rush Drek, me and my 3-4 friends will cap GYs", that seems to be the best one...sometimes they'll even be descriptive enough to say "run by this building" or "take this path", but yeah.
---
To sum it up in one word, "leadership", would be the one thing that's consistent in all the winning games.
---
NO KEK RUSH DREK
---
Mageblade on paladins is perfectly fine. A lot of int and crit are exactly what paladin healers need. Crit is #1 stat for palas as every crit is a clearcast.
---
Also people need to understand that there are no healer weapons in classic. The first raid weapon in the game which has exclusively "+healing" instead of "+damage and healing" drops in ZG with a 5% droprate. That weapon is barely better than mageblade. AQ and forward there are actual +healing weapons and you may start complaining about palas rolling on +damage weapons. Give your palas the blade, at least you will have a reason to deny them the weapons in BWL which are also "+damage and healing" which they will inevitably roll on since &gt;There is nothing else.
---
Hum. What if they made it where the cities were independent. All could have a ony head turn in and buff. But on diff timers.
---
In P2 alliance dominated all the pvp hotspots on Herod. Like it was insane how much more well coordinated they were.
---
But unconfirmed at this point and someone is silencing the ony buff bug
---
Lol not at all. I left my enchanting at 298 and then I got my spellpower recipe out of mc.  I needed a runed arcanite rod and level 300 enchanting to use it. So I spent about 2 to 300 gold to make the rod and hit 300.
---
There are a lot of enchanters on my server and most people just get their enchants done in guild anyways. I've spammed orgimmar to get customers but nobody responds and the ones that need work need crusader but I know if I farm that I'd prob make more money just selling the recipe.
---
My healing is from the lifesteal off ''skullflame shield'' and ''demon forged breastplate'' scaled up with a bit of spellpower.   
---
&gt; I'm typically spamming heals trying to get one off while waiting in consecration 
---
Keep in mind that you cannot block, parry, or dodge while you are casting, so you will be taking a lot more damage while doing it.
---
Yeah it disabled itself constantly. It's useless in it's current state.
---
Absolutely man.  Find a guild that runs some type of a EGEP/DKP system, or hell, even a roll system.  Loot Councils very rarely, if ever, work out fairly for everyone in the raid.
---
Ah man, you lost out on your 25 likes? I'm sorry, bro. That really stinks.
---
Because the masses are talking about normal transfers and not outliers that‚Äôs are exceptions to the situation. 
---
Stop trying to be technically right just for internet points. You‚Äôre wrong.
---
Anyone got the real gehennas discord link? can't find it.
---
Seconding Herod.  While Alliance is definitely outnumbered, there are still a ton of strong Alliance raid guilds, many with multiple raid teams.  And we held our own in pre-BG P2.  Since BGs released, you can again safely leave IF solo to farm and do other stuff that was impossible without a group previously.
---
Unfortunately, no matter where you decide to go, I would expect you're going to find it very difficult to find core raid spots for 2 tanks, a ret and a mage, at least in a well-established guild.  If a raid needs even 1 tank, let alone 2, they're probably struggling somewhat.  And again, if they haven't already filled their token Ret spot, they're probably still growing and/or struggling.
---
What's your ultimate can have any item as a sword rogue post BWL launch BiS list? I would honestly probably use it. Right now I have 2 piece Bloodfang (obvs helm &amp; legs) and 4 piece nightslayer. Hoping to get 5 piece soon but after that pretty flexible until BWL. But looks like going for weapons and certain items way more key than just most the bloofang pieces.
---
agreed, having memes restricted to one day a week is lame af.   Can someone explain to me the reasoning behind this?  I feel like this restriction makes r/classicwow boring
---
I normally tank 2 at the same time and they charge the healers and cleave them. I also have people trying to taunt them off me when i can tank 2 just fine.
---
Warriors and priests.
---
titties
---
I‚Äôm not surprised. There are no secrets here, it‚Äôs a game that is catered to hardcore players if you want to be competitive.
---
I wish you luck finding an adult guild with posts like this as proof of your maturity.
---
RIP
---
My 1/10 though are like 45-70 minutes turtles...I sometimes ask myself why I didn't just leave them early, eat my deserter timer, and then queue and win another one in the same time but yeah.
---
I had to camp single mob spawns during the first step of that quest as a priest so it was pretty bad. Though inexplicably the next two steps had to competition at all.
---
I've noticed this as well, it's the most baffling thing. Maybe 1 in 100 times SF will get capped. They all just run right past it as if it's not there, even if they're on a 60% mount and can't zerg fast.
---
Super annoying since I'd cap it for the alliance if I could, it's the biggest factor towards stopping turtles from happening. Both sides can still win, it'll just happen in a reasonable timeframe instead of 40+ minutes.
---
Big tead ditties
---
New strat, turtle at baelinda with like 10 people and all else rush galv. Has worked 5x in a row so far.
---
Titan panel
---
Memes getting removed is a step in the right direction, since memes are fucking stupid and the world needs fewer of them.
---
Bagbrother comes with Bagnon.
---
&gt;*it seems that they can be convinced to waive their restrictions on transfers, but that a chance to do so may only come up once every 2 years*
---
See y'all in 2021!
---
u/evidentlynotoriginal But ... they have such a cool subreddit banner and organization. I was regretting not having rolled there early on, but all I have heard is that it is a cesspit.
---
Oh absolutely agree.
---
I've won with Balinda defense into Galv and slowpush, Galv/LTs/RH, and just a straight Drek rush. Strategy seems to be only as useful as either team morale or team cohesion. I'm going to start asking people to stick with our 60% mounters so that, while slower, no one dies.
---
Some of those marks are messed up. It must be regional. Star was always shackle, diamond was sap, circle was a general "case by case basis".
---
The games in your screenshot are about an hour long each. No thanx to your cancer strat.
---
Yeah, we've taken notice and some of us try to alert the raid to this happening. The feedback we get is "dOn'T bE a KeK rUsH dRek." If you even suggest a small group defending to slow horde/retake bunkers/retake Aid Station/Stormpike GY, you get mocked. I wish there was a vote mute option on some of these people.
---
Warriors have intimidating shout which is most similar to howl of terror, and priests have pyschic scream.
---
I think SR is a warrior weapon, unless none of your wars want it.
---
*But if we whine long enough the exception will become the rule!*
---
I have only had one nut case experience. A player I don't know sent me an in game letter demanding I return the 10g I "scammed" out of him. Later the same day, he started whispering me about it, saying he was going to "report me if I didn't send him the 10g I scammed from him." 
---
I have never met this player, I have never scammed anyone out of 10g lol. I tried to explain this to the player, like "I'm sorry, but I don't know you and there has to be some mistake, how did you come to the idea I scammed you out of 10g?"
---
He went on and on and finally I told him to just report me if he was that convinced I had done something to him. I didn't have his money and I wasn't about to send him 10g - that would be letting him scam me lol. I put him on /ignore and moved on.
---
Or so I thought.
---
Later that week I was talking with my friends on discord and one of them was like, "hey guys, you know those beggars in org asking people for change? I sent one of them a CoD for 10g and they paid it!" Then they all laughed and laughed and laughed, until I whispered my friend and found out it was indeed the same player who had been harassing me all week about scamming him out of 10g. Apparently my friend had somehow used mail I sent to him in the CoD letter he sent to the beggar and that's why the person thought I was the one who "scammed" them.
---
So, my only problem now is figuring out which person in this whole thing is the nut-case scumbag.
---
Because they have those in addons.
---
Dont listen to this guy. As a night elf spriest on flamelash you can shadowmeld and then surprise all the horde with your new pvp shadow priest!
---
Legit after AV came out I made it my top priority to get my epic mount, getting picked off as a warrior isn‚Äôt fun. Just got my epic last night can‚Äôt wait to play AV today after work. I‚Äôm hoping I can finally join my server premade discord.
---
What the hell is a shaman "hex"? This must be from after BC, I don't remember hexes at all.
---
My favorite to farm with Ravager is SFK for the high value twink items that drop there. Ravager also just destroys the mobs in there. Ive tried going to ZF and the ravager proc seemed to only tickle the mobs in there, I couldnt pull packs of more than 3. SM GY was kind of the highest dungeon I could farm with ravager at a somewhat steady pace. SM Arm/Cath were just plain rough.
---
Is the Wowhead Bis list accurate?
---
Keep getting mixed feedback on this.
---
I would it was
---
&gt;the most cohesive/well-led side wins
---
But when you lose every game on your side no matter what you do, there is more than cohesion.
---
We just try to play smart. Example, for rag as a DS/Ruin lock, I set up with a shadow power elixir and a greater arcane power elixir, as well as prepotting a GFPP. I also take a second GFPP during the fight. No flask. I DS my felhunter for the mana buff. The effect of all this is that my individual DPS is slightly lower than usual, due to the DS buff and lack of access to a major mana pot. However because I do all these things, I only need about 1/4 of the healing that I normally would while still doing 85% of my max dps, which frees up a lot of healer mana to go to other targets. These kind of decisions are made raid wide leads to success.
---
To answer your other questions, it takes us about 3 hrs with 25 people. We push rag to about 5 % before submerge and deal with the add phase. We push lower each week though so we'll skip the adds again soon.
---
‚ÄúPut up the good fucking fight‚Äù man it pumps me up to see a horde thinking this. I‚Äôm Alliance on incendius here. Horde would roll us everyday until night time, then there were some good fucking fights at time. 
---
Server seems about as balanced as you could ask for (in today‚Äôs pvp server climate) with somewhat of a horde lean at times
---
I love when they do that and then get put on blast by the raid to go back to retail or being called alliance scum
---
Yea def have to kill any defenders. As a shaman I can spam bolt the tank or heal Drek while being safe from attackers if they do that. Often can get some melee DPS to rush over to deal with me only to pull out the warmasters.
---
Can some Atiesh folks like myself come join your discord for premades, I'm so tired of horrible pug AVs.
---
The constant question...
---
In all those wins, was a consistent strategy responsible or just group cohesion?
---
If we remove the meme restrictions then they will cover up all the super high quality posts that are so frequent here.
---
it's not an argument, it's a fact
---
I have so many questions
---
Get an add on for this.
---
Nah mate, I said it‚Äôs possible in less than 4 hours if there‚Äôs no competition. I started at 13.00 and was 300 around 23.00, of those 10 hours I gathered effectively for about 5 of them!
---
I sure had competition, which is why I switched to dungeons to lvl the last bits!
---
Doing it at 4AM is by far the best option though, so if you have the possibility to do it at that time certainly go for it! :)
---
Any of Vurtne, the one and only, videos.
---
Where is the blind video at by the wall?  Ive looked multiple times but cannot find him.
---
Oh absolutely agree. I guess my point is that we haven't seen these particular items drop much at all and that's twice now out of a hand full of times that these two items have gone to the same paladin healer over the 10-15 caster DPS in raid.
---
Yeah, I just listened to it and he was all "It's just a 15 minute inconvenience".  Bitch, you said that you were winning AVs in 7-8 minutes.  It is therefore a maximum inconvenience of 7-8 minutes to YOU.
---
oK bOoMeR... HURR DURR.. get back to retail when you like 5min games.
---
People that say wpvp is dead have no idea. 
---
People are trying to rank now. It‚Äôll be peaceful for about two months. 
---
Then, horde are gonna get tired of waiting half an hour for queues. They‚Äôre gonna give up on high ranking placements and just start queueing WSG and going to the plaguelands to dunk on alliance with shiny BWL gear. 
---
Alliance are gonna be pissed, but for the most part there‚Äôs pretty much nothing they can really do. Well geared/high rankers immediately get into pvp games, so it‚Äôs up to the pve players/levelers to band together to fight off the far better geared players (and quest while they‚Äôre at it). 
---
Won‚Äôt be nearly as bad as it was before but still not great. Get to 60 now if you can, else go on a pve server
---
You and me both
---
Deaddies
---
mods are taking this too seriously. If users come up with a meme and want to post it, and sharing it would bring joy, why do they have to hold their pee for 6 days? ridiculous
---
Thanks for the reply!
---
My main is a warlock though so it sounds like I can safely skip this whole event
---
I'm having the total opposite experience on fairbanks. Tons of people doing groups while im leveling my alt.
---
RFD is usually skipped by alot of players, do ZF or SM Arm/Cath
---
EA makes some difference. It makes fighting other mages significantly easier: the deadliest move a frost mage can do is nova+CS into shatter, and EA denies that easily. If you're caught outnumbered and slowed, combine your racial with blink and a speed boost - and you're just... gone - uncatchable. Enemies will be forced to give up the chase, but without a gnome racial you'll find yourself hobbling after a blink, still easy prey within reach. 
---
in PvP specifically the extra mana often makes all the difference as the fights often drain out your mana pool. Extra crit and level 63 summons are nice just the cherry on top. 
---
Meanwhile perception is largely invalidated by being a mage(AE spam, frost nova on top of a vanish) and level 63 summons... that's the only useful bonus of being a human. I guess you recover slightly more mana, but spirit is never a priority stat, so 5% of int is a lot more int than 5% spirit, and more useful too.
---
 Truly, the short end of a stick when it comed to racials. Gnomes, I would say, make the best mages. Undeads and Trolls get some good stuff of their own, but humans just really don't get anything at all. Except their good looks.
---
Ran into this last night, we (Horde side) were super confused at first for about 10-15 minutes then it ended up a 90 minute Horde win
---
Sell now. BWL is still easy mode.
---
Cool, reminds me of darkest dungeon.
---
The problem is you have to spread your premade incredibly thin to pull all that off in 6-8 minutes, and the horde meta these days tends to have enough D to disrupt that pretty well.  
---
Like I said, for horde it is completely impossible, the 10-13 minute queues ensure that.  Alliance have a chance to pull it off, but I doubt they can do it consistently enough to legitimately(not botting/account sharing) get 360k honor a day.  A good premade can hard rush drek and the horde D squad won't be enough to stop it most of the time(but the honor there isn't great), but since they have started spreading out sending some to recap towers, some to take galv, some to take towers, some to kill lieuts/commanders they have really spread out and the 10-15 man D squad can start carving them up.  
---
That has been my experience at least, I haven't lost to a premade since Wednesday of last week (When they were all still full rushing).  The last three I have played against have all left the game and taken deserter because we were able to force a turtle because they spread out to take everything.  It is one of those have your cake and eat it too situations, in an attempt to take everything they end up losing everything.  I think alliance would do better completely ignoring towers and defense, and going for just galv/lieuts/commanders then rush drek with no WM's.  The towers (in my opinion and experience) are one step too far.  Not to mention by ignoring towers entirely they actually make it so in the event the horde D stops them, horde will end in ~15 minutes game time, instead of 25+. I have yet to see a game where horde denies the initial drek rush and lost, so in my experience it would be better for the alliance to basically admit defeat, farm what HKs they can in mid for a bit of honor and let it end as quickly as possible in the event they get stopped rushing.
---
&gt;set a foot in their

What's the point of pre-ordering a digital product? There's no running out of copies, like we had to deal with in big box store releases of video games in decade's past...
---
Yes, a very valid question.
---
I already answered it [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/eccmtg/alliance_guide_to_alterac_valley/fbayq0n/).
---
Yes you want 5/5 bloodfang using ns shoulder aclg and boots of shadow. So even though bf hood is small downgrade it‚Äôs smallest downgrade, you want threat reduction. No matter how good your tank is, without thunderfury+offhand malath you will pull Aggro as rogue if you are buffed correctly
---
Yeah I think I liked the guild so much that I trusted them to be efficient with loot council, but man was I wrong.
---
That sounds like a fun AV game tho. I'm so tired of these 10 min games and I imagine horde is even more tired of it since y'all actually have queues.
---
Do you have a link that shows they increased the render distance? If this is true I think that‚Äôs great. When did that happen?
---
If you are trying to sell the leaf you would need to invite the hunter who is buying the leaf to the raid group before you down the boss.
---
Perhaps, just maybe, there are no healers because everyone in AV treat them horribly and if you‚Äôre horde you can just run around and lose
---
Youre in one of the most unused zones in the game lol.. go quest somewhere else
---
Except it wasn't considered hardcore back then and shouldn't be considered hardcore now unless you bring retail mentality in classic. For hardcore one might  want to try eve or UO grind.
---
I had a 60 UD rogue gank, teabag and then cannibalize me in duskwood about four times in a row. Good times.
---
Huh?
---
i still got the likes i'm just sad that this is North Korea anti-meme China communist KGB russia
---
&gt;with over 25 likes
---
Whoa dude, with that kind of following you should start your own classic subreddit, with memes and hookers.
---
Actually forget the memes...and the subreddit.
---
This has nothing to do with retail, this has to do with working adults having a life outside of wow.
---
As a 60 Arms I would think it‚Äôs better to get a new weapon and use SS&gt;cleave to aoe farm.
---
We pretty frequently have an alliance priest come in and MC the turn-in NPC so we can blow him up. It resets the timer and his spawn timer is like 5 min
---
Do they need to be inside the instance as well or just in the group?
---
Also ally bigglesworth, I think there is about to be a lot less of us
---
In a perfect world, the game would only have four graveyards. Two North, and two South. Spawning in the middle is a negative for both sides. All members should either be defending or attacking N/S.
---
Neither side should ever cap IBGY, SHGY, or SFGY. If the other side happens to cap one of these, let them have it. Their loss.
---
I was gud at this game when you diden't even shit in your pants.
---
Whereever you go in this game... I have done that long before. What ever you do on Horde or on Alliance side... I have done that.
---
What ever reputation you farm... I have done that. What ever boss you kill, I have done that.
---
What ever class you play, I have done that.
---
Whatever proffession you skill out I have done that.
---
What ever "efficiency" you think you have discovered, I have done that years ago.
---
I have years playtime on this game.
---
And now you little whelp are telling ME to "Git gud"?
---
Sure. \*smiles\* and gives small imadude\_00 a friedly pat on his whelp head :)
---
I can't fathom why anyone would kill 30's for honor anyway. If you're in your 30's you should be leveling, if you're 60 your'e not getting honor anyway. I guess... people are just ass holes.
---
Yeah, herod is pretty dead. RIP 2nd biggest NA server. This is the bracket ceiling good bullshit once again. Assuming his server is not dead still more spots open.
---
As an alliance on heartseeker. I hope you horde keep your numbers up. I‚Äôd like an even server.
---
Yeah, I think the first area of the quest acts as such a bottleneck, that once you get past it, the next two areas are typically wide open.
---
Yes, this is 100% true. If a guild is selling the leaf/eye, it's important to make it clear to the buyer that they're purchasing a reserved spot in the raid for that fight and the item will go to them *if* it drops. This may take a few weeks. And, FWIW, I'd offer the hunters a bundle that includes both the leaf and the Mature Black Dragon Sinew from Onyxia as well.
---
/Flex
---
DO IT! JUST... DO IT!
---
No, you just straight up lose stats - youd be losing 1 hit and .4 crit to gain 2 ap. You need gloves and bf pants to break the set because its just so well itemized. Theres more subtlety as daggers with aclgs, though.
---
That could well be true.
---
It‚Äôs not about affording it, it‚Äôs about missing out on real life. But I‚Äôm not here to tell you how to live your life, just here to tell you that half your waking life isn‚Äôt casual by any sane definition. Continue to label yourself as you want though.
---
I'm looking for a pvp server to level an alliance alt.  Is Blaumeux decent for Alliance, or should I look elsewhere?
---
Nope. Try another non-insult.
---
Usually the cooking quests are the worst. And the alliance has a lot of those
---
It's from his book Sapiens if you're interested in reading more. It's been quite an interesting read. Kinda makes you rethink some of the things we all take for granted.
---
What you have the on horde site too?
---
DAmn I guess that was an ally thing only!
---
Sure, you don't care, but if your guild starts selling they should make sure the buyers understand.
---
this is basically your list for lock; BWL is our first chance of getting hit gear that'll last. It's important to get Nelth's as a lock because it will be used as part of your tanking set on twin emps - let your guild know that or they'll experience future headaches of you getting resisted and someone pulling aggro ;)
---
You're really selling yourself here, honestly seems like you're already in the right place with your current guild.
---
The priest one is really bad imho.
---
Bitch please, i have a 59 twink
---
You could join a west coast server to get 3 more hours
---
This game was releases in 2004. These aren‚Äôt new revelations of the map being imbalanced. How can someone be this fucking dense?
---
No Horde has advantage they are have a 45second shorter way when they rush !
---
I prefer the method where you join the tryhard cross server discord  pvp rankers premade by sneaking under their radar as a casual pvper who's only in it for the rep and has connections with some of the high tanking members. Then play games with 25+ people in discord voice chat who call out objectives and kill any horde opposition, kill galv, then all LTs, take snowfall, rh, then kill battlematers then drek for... About an 85% win rate averaging at 3k honor a game with the average game being 12 minutes. If one of those 15% of games is a loser and it's past the 15 minute mark 2/3rds of the raid completely stands down for an instant loss so that no time is wasted. 
---
That is the strat that I use for AV. Got me exalted in a weekend. Haven't been back since.
---
Oh btw, what server is that from? Can't find any server with those numbers last week.
---
it seems like most alliance don't even realize they HAVE trinkets.  Ive been in at least a dozen games where Aid Station gets ninja capped and flipped by 3 people causing a hilariously unwarranted loss.  I recall but its normally 2v1 or 3v1 and if they know where I'm going to spawn... well gg.  Even after asking 2 more to stop zerging mid and recall, we usually lose for lack of those 2 people.
---
Horde or Ally, what's your guild name?
---
If they're not taking shatter then they are only using blizzard and not flamestrike / CoC combos. Flamestrike / CoC combo is far better from a damage/ mana efficiency, however also much riskier and difficult to control than just blizzard spam.
---
Fiesta!
---
He doesn't even understand you're mocking him because he cares about them so much.
---
That was pretty awesome, although I generally detest Shammy pvp vids :P
---
Iirc I think I still tried to run him but he pissed me off by going afk forever so I left
---
I played shaman in TBC, quit the summer before wrath. I do not remember hexes at all.
---
Hell yes! cheers to the Kirtonos survivors, WPVP's been hell
---
Most of the time we're able to stop the horde because they're not expecting it.  Once in awhile the horde stops, gathers and does a bum rush into Balinda which can make things difficult and we just have to hope that the other team managed to kill Galv in time.
---
You don't need any points in prot at all to tank dungeons, just make sure you have a hotkey to assign a skull because managing your dps is 90% of the difficulty of tanking 5mans
---
The best is when You have an item with a 10% chance to give you dust and 37% to give an essence and in the end you receive 1 Dust....-\_-
---
This doesn't surprise me. The beta is still quite rough. I'm actually surprised it was only delayed an extra month.
---
Dude it's the fucking worst. Like ya it's cool to be the one getting to distribute loot and all, but then you realize you have to hold yourself to a higher standard than everyone else in your class. I'm in a semi/hardcore guild, so we distribute good items for progression, but roll off everything else. I've taken 3 pieces of gear in 11 raids. I've got mages greeding out over t1 shoulders/pants, choker of enlightenment. All subpar items, yet no one has the patience to just wait for actual good loot. But you best believe someone will get frustrated if I give myself choker of the fire lord, even though I haven't given myself any gear in a month and half, in favor of giving everyone else more gear. I can obtain 3 spell power for 600g outside raids via freezing band. Yet I have to justify why I think I should get choker or mana igniting cord after passing on all loot for a month and a half. Yet I have to justify my choices to people who won't go farm a 30% drop out of brd. Loot council is necessary in terms of consumables/damage ratio, but fuck is it stressful trying to make everyone happy in a systems where each player only deserves 2.5% of the loot.
---
Does anyone have a guide around maximizing dps (Warlock) using the Talisman of Ephemeral Power? I want to make sure I‚Äôm not leaving damage on the table.
---
Former Knight-Captain - played a priest in 3x GM premade groups in my guild, never had interest in getting R14 myself, but clearly, I was along for the ride a couple times. We *lived* in Warsong Gulch, and it was always the same core group of 15 of so people that would rotate in and out around the folks actually going for rank.   
---
You earned a *reputation* in WSG - people would queue in, see that it was our premade, and just forfeit the match.  You developed feuds with opposing faction guilds and players. Hell, you even end up making friends with some of them by the time it's done.  
---
AV/AB were largely ignored unless it was a bonus honor weekend since the matches weren't as efficient. What I'm seeing right now in no way resembles the way R14 was earned back in the day.
---
It's one opinion.  I can't speak for all their class guides, I can say the druid is generally accurate.
---
However...it's extremely difficult to say that X piece of gear is THE best....as it may depend on specific factors for each class.
---
Which class are you most concerned with?
---
It's condom for sap because sapped mobs can't say no
---
How geared will you need to be to do BWL once phase 3 comes out? Should you have most BiS pieces or will full prebis still be close to strong enough? Specifically asking about druid healers.
---
Yea, I notice now how much ive missed it.
---
I just want to move my alt character to a 2nd account.
---
Fuck you if you want to transfer from PvE to PvP. You made your choice in an effort to make the game easier so you have to stick to that choice.
---
Lmfao you still need items in a instances üòÇ.
---
On Grobb we have Dawnbreakers and Duskwalkers. No affiliation.
---
Damn that‚Äôs rough! Well I can always advise you to pick up herbalism ;).
---
WSG is almost exclusively premades, soloq WSG is an insane move. AV by default layout favors alliance, this is why zerg vs. zerg first day was usually an alliance win. Horde later adapted and alliance continued their zergs which results in a horde win. Instead of adapting, alliance complain on reddit. Classy.
---
My main wish at this point is that Alliance at least recognizes the value of LTs and Towers in a loss.  So many games where the horde turtles turn into the Alliance whining and getting farmed mid or trying and failing over and over again to cap FWGY instead of grouping up to at least take LTs or IBT/TP.  
---
I hate when folks give up right away, but y‚Äôall can at least give up in a way that still maximizes honor and rep...
---
Just checked, Hex was added in Wrath.
---
Most random alliance players are just bad. The only times we often win are during the week in the morning, when only the try-hards play...
---
Worst in name it seems
---
I think its just for lightning reflexes. The rest of the utility just makes you better in pvp.
---
Try Icy Veins and SixtyUpgrades. Sixty upgrades is great because it gives you a list of every item for your class/spec, and ranks the items with a number. So you can tell if it's worth farming a super rare item or just getting the second best piece that is only slightly worse.
---
Do not listen to the guy above you. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs going to take you a month‚Äù is a fucking lie. That would be the case if you are pushing bracket 13/14 for a full month. From the sounds of things, that is not what you are doing. If you put all 6 of your hours each day into grinding honor, then maybe after 2ish months you‚Äôll get to rank 8. Since dont forget, if you are in the projected bracket 8. It will take a minimum of 3 weeks to go from rank 7 to 8. 
---
Also the most likely scenario, you will not reach rank 8. Since if you don‚Äôt put the effort week over week, the grind will take longer an longer to achieve. I would not put these legs in items you are expecting to receive in the near future and plan around that. 
---
Source: it‚Äôs the 6th week of phase 2 and i have been pvping hard (both BGs and open world). I am rank 7.54 (projected bracket 11/bottom of 12). And that took me a month and a half
---
There‚Äôs two now, one public and one private.  You need 100% mount for both
---
Wait lol.. Alliance complaining about the AV map?
---
Not expecting it is definitely the key
---
Several event only recipes. Check the wowhead article on it.
---
I dunno what kinda condition you have or whatever, but have you tried ^(*cue joe rogan*) vigorous exercise?
---
Your body will literally shut off because it is so exhausted and needs to repair itself.
---
Yeah, theses guys (always be pulling) are well know to grief horde attempts.
---
I looked up discord, it means "lack of concord or harmony between persons or things". 
---
That does describe battlegrounds in general, so I understand what these rank 14s are talking about.
---
Stop misleading the guy. 1 month to get to rank 8 from 0?!?!? Do you think this guy is going to be pushing into the top bracket week over week? I feel like you are delusional with how rank is achieved
---
ok zoomer
---
Same goes for horde, but it's
---
1. Rushes balinda
---
2. Stays outside balinda an pvping
---
3. Cap sh gy

4. GuYs Go TuRtLe inThE bASe
---
I usually do 5 mans with a group of irl friends on discord, so thankfully I can manage them in real time. The other times tho it is noticable how much difference mark vs no mark in groups are.
---
Full or close to full preraid BiS should be enough especially for healers because the MC gear is not that much better.
---
Yeah I think it requires all towers to be intact for alliance. When things go smoothly, it looks so easy, and I was seeing these types of games all the time the first day or two. Now it's just a disaster
---
I agree. 
---
Memes &gt; Dumbass Complaints.
---
There's no "BiS" list that's fully accurate. Gears are still situational and you need to look into which stat is the most useful for which situation. Blindly following these lists can cause some loot drama in raid, for example including Ring of Spell Power, Choker of the Fire Lord, and Talisman of Ephemeral Power in BiS lists for healers directly pits them against caster dps.
---
You can easily top dps charts in Classic without min/maxing every aspect of your game. Bring every consumables, press the 4 buttons you need to press and know when to pop shit. You don't need parsing and gear lists to do this, and if you do you are terrible. Sorry.

I don't need to sell myself to stream spergs who think asking for fair and consistent loot rules is somehow immature lol. Stop trying to stand by the water cooler before you've even had your interview.
---
I'm a little altoholic and I wonder if my server got any future. It's horde dominated with like 65:35 ratio. As alliance should I transfer my main (25eur it's not small amount of money for me but still better then leveling) or stay here. I wonder if they ever gonna offer free transfers again at this point.
---
Greatwizard
---
Heh, half of the guilds probs don't even log :) But yeah, it's annoying af. I personally don't have the in-game knowledge to try and get the guild going alone. Organisational part is something I'm good at (kinda in that field of work) so I suppose that's why it's triggering me this much...
---
Ya if the game starts to go south half the Alliance quit because it's honestly not worth dragging the game out past 20 minutes. Horde would probably try to salvage the win at the expense of time because they have to wait in queue.
---
If we're going USB, OP would need a USB-C powered laptop, and the power bank would need to be a big, expensive, purpose-built laptop charger.  Anything else will likely fail to provide enough wattage (most USB-C banks only put out 30W).
---
Best bet is probably something like [this](https://www.amazon.com/Jackery-Portable-Generator-Explorer-Emergency/dp/B07FYJVFNK).
---
This was exactly my experience on the horde. Obviously, from a mathematical perspective, your experience is probably slightly more indicative of reality, but hotspots (DM BRM were inaccessible for horde as well. Like I can remember like 2 or 3 times I actually got to raid without dying 10+ times. Like I don't care about diminishing your experience or saying mine was worse, but I was constantly farmed on my way to any dungeon. I had a similar experience to you. Like I don't know how I could have been camped more, is the point I'm trying to get across. The feeling appears to have been mutual of the other side having more control. But I also wasn't one to participate in farming the Alliance because I didn't want to contribute to a mass exodus.
---
The oomtank is real, that's why I bring 3 casters and pull thicc so everyone is oom by the end and I drink faster so it never seems like i'm the hold up lol
---
The expectation is that you don't leave once you have your loot. That guild helped you get geared, so you should do the same.
---
We had a few people leave because their work hours shifted and conflicted with raiding times. We wished them well. If someone left because they didn't need more MC loot, I'd be pissed.

I guess I should have!  Thanks for your feedback, it was clearly wrong for me to want blizzard to announce an actual date for a new feature launch instead of just launching the feature.
---
well you are ranking with the absolute "pros" in this case. a rocket league pro or halo pro plays more hours a day than 4. 
---
And now its a rush. later it will get more casual once the big wave is done. sadly ranking takes so long that you might have to wait half a year till the huge initial wave of rankers is finished
---
Can I get some of that salt for my fries?
---
I dont play retail
---
Hey,
---
Please try to see it with other eyes... You just lost gold - so sit down think about it again and try not to be stupid like that with real money. It was a good lesson for you. Just remember about this when you are in the same situation again. I cross my fingers for you and hope you can resist gambling. My father was also addicted to gambling - he lost everything, went to jail and was not a good role model for me - but its the best that ever could happen - i hate gambling - so not everything is bad about this.... You can do it.
---
Just play the game like nothing happend - have fun and on 60 you will get enought gold only by doing instances and farming.
---
Best wishes from austria
---
A bad english speaking person ;)
---
This is a pretty decent explanation of why. Although I do want to point out that it gets a little fuzzy for the people in the higher brackets. It would only hurt them if the 2-6 hours of alt character pvp a week would cause them to drop more standings than the bracket would expand. It's possible that someone could drop from standing 10 to standing 70 from lost potential honor but still get into the same bracket as before due to bracket inflation. It could go either way, just depends purely on what proportion of the active ranked pool is participating in this practice.
---
I mined un'goro in off hours (very tight rich thorium route) and did DM:E jump runs with guildies when I could. It took a while but involved very little actual farming for gold.
---
My best un'goro day was vastly better than my best dm:e day, but dm:e was far more reliable.
---
Upvoted solely because I was told not to.

Nice that's good to hear.

What's good is that this happened in a video game instead of real life. Perhaps if you did not have the video game to feel this regret, you could have eventually made a poor choice with actual money
---
Some silver lining, I hope

Sure, enjoy them over your queur
---
&gt;If you are trying to achive an early rank 14 or 13 on one of the larger servers, and you are not in this discord, you are probably working twice as hard

If you're working on rank 14 and not already aware of this you're working towards an unobtainable goal.
---
Grats in that stuff man!

I seem to only get luck drops on my alt. I‚Äôm leveling a hunter right now. I ran brd with a few buddies the other day, and the chest out of the arena drops. I‚Äôm the only one that could wear it in the group. So....  üòÜ
---
Don't watch, ignore and reject everything that happened after ROTJ.  Do it for the culture
---
Horde here, i don't even know what in the fuck is going on half the time.
---
Did have a fun match where we managed to corral them into SH GY while people split between defense and offense
---
How dare you have fun in AV.
---
Why don't you want to complain about AV just being a rush, and not actual pvp, and how it is so terrible that blizzard **FORCES** you to play this way despite 95% of the players in AV will never see anything beyond rank 10 let alone beyond rank 11.
---
Why are you not one of those people who is so excited to never enter AV again?
---
Seriously good for you. Let's face it pony ride simulator really is not enjoyable.
---
Ha, bet that's about as rare - running arena and being the only one to need the chest!

I understand people who take ice shards without shatter in their aoe spec if they are gonna do some raids or dungeons and don‚Äôt want to respec all the time. But I don‚Äôt understand why wowhead is prioritizing ice shards over shatter in their AOE guide.

Good sports on you though
---
It was throwing errors for me after the patch.  I'm assuming its latest update was an attempt to fix that but may have ended up breaking it.
---
Yes, most likely there are some people who are in this possition, and that is why I'm making this post, but I also just want to inform people about the weird metas that classic has to offer.
---
Yeah I've been raiding for about a month and really the only good raid pieces better than prebis dungeon blues are T2 helm, legs, ony trinket, and maybe a couple others. 
---
I have about 5 BiS pieces, 5 prebis, and about 5 that are good but have one other upgrade I could use over them.
---
Just trying to see if I'm on pace to be geared enough for it, as I've only been raiding MC and Ony about a month now. Druid loot has been pretty much non existent though so I have been a little worried I wouldn't be geared up by then.

---
Dwarfism, amputee, or some sort of other medical thing?
---
I miss the old R14 grind.  I never did it myself, but I did ride the coattails of some really good players in pre-mades.  Luckily for me I was a healer available at odd hours because I was living in Japan at the time.  Totally agree with it being the most social gaming experience.  Being in a group with the same 10 people for hours on end really creates an opportunity to bond.  I really hope they do something to slow down AV to bring back the WSG pre-mades.
---
I prefer to leave the bait on the hook
---
And alliance has the advantage in AV?
---
Pffff!!!
---
Don't play horde but thanks I guess.
---
Pagle is the best RP server in US East outside of Bloodsail Buccaneers and Deviate Delight.

Damn.. I get off at 8am that woulda been perfect.

WotLK was 80 buh

Still all those characters would take a shit ton of time, including raiding
---
How do I joined these AV's? Because mine are 6 Horde run up to the Alliance zerg and just start killing people. And the alliance crumble shortly after. Somethe group stop to help. Half the group keeps going. Some of the group tries to go to Frostwolf and take towers(and die) and then the next 45 minutes are 20 people complaining. 15 people AFKING. 5 People trying to do something.

Hi- just wanted to say that you might want to get in touch with your therapist or sponsor about this. This kind of episode can be triggering (as you‚Äôve seen) and you need to protect yourself. Seriously, best of luck to you!!
---
I'm piss poor at PvP and AV. But I play a horde mage and apparently I can help the inevitable horde loss by slowing the alliance zerg. Can someone give me the rundown on this works? I just start blasting my AoEs? Usually I'll get stunlocked or silenced immediately. Can an expert mage give me some sage advice?
---
Is there legal action going to come from this? Did the disclaimer not say available by December 31, 2019?
---
That makes it even worse lol content gatekeepers policing your wow classic info access.
---
You haven't managed to go 24-0 stop lying
---
Well they are BiS but your loot council would have to be insane or corrupt to give those weapons to Hunters as stat sticks before all the melee DPS.
---
My GM has confirmed with me that he won't give me those weapons until everyone has them, and to enjoy my barb blade for a long time!
---
Thank you for your kind words, sorry to hear about your dad. I am making sure that this will never affect my real life ever again as it has in the past that's why I'm stepping away for a bit

That isnt a meta though.
---
My pint is main tanking MC is a joke compared to other contebt and I have 0 clue how you will manage certain bosses and mobs that require taunt, nor hold aggro against the dps requirement of vael. 
---
By your own admission, youre completely unaware of the future content and what is required ro complete that content. So your confidence in your ability to tank that as a paladin is not justified at all.
---
Using success in MC as a guage for how the rest of raids will go is completely foolish.
---
Their point was what's the point to the consumer? Apart from maybe an early purchase DLC, I have no incentive to buy early as opposed to the day it launches.
---
I really just don't understand AV. As a lvl 56 and with a 60% mount I never make it to the first boss alive. 
---
I always ask what the plan is what I should be doing. The only answers are pretty smart ass. Everyone acts as if everyone knows what should be done, yet it never gets done and we lose...again.
---
Horde on Herod here. It was impossible to get into BRM quite often and raiding was also difficult. Searing Gorge was a hellhole for us as well, and getting to DM was also often difficult. Both Horde and Alliance on Herod made it miserable for the other faction. That's what made Herod different, it wasn't just Horde dominating Alli, Alli were also fucking up Horde on a regular basis.
---
I'm not lvl52 I'm struggling to get any dungeon groups. How is earthshaker?
---
Ill take scenario #2 plz
---
A week and a day =/= 2 weeks...
---
Wow had no idea
---
Super boring. That‚Äôs why I play WoW.
---
had someone come up to me to craft them hide of the wild and asked me to give them collateral so i wouldn‚Äôt steal his mats, so maybe because they don‚Äôt trust people? idk
---
If doing WSG over and over for eternity is your thing, I suppose, go right ahead.
---
I'm glad you're logical cause I'm not doubting you got camped, but those experiences are so miserable that you never forget them, so it feels equally bad in your heart vs what you're reading (unbalanced server). But for every terrible experience the horde had, we had 5.
---
I'll give you another example to put it in perspective. People stopped doing brd and ony attune cause brm was so horde controlled, especially the entrance to brd. Nobody had time to die 10 times from IF to zone into brd. It was not if they controlled brm, they almost always did.
---
So one day it was trade chat news and discord news that alliance had control of brd entrance (not brm, just brd) so we all raced over there to confirm or do our brd runs, and when we had control, you can bet your ass I killed horde for revenge, maybe you too. We lost it less than hour later, and for the next ten plus hours I'm sure.
---
You mentioned DM too. Our multiboxer had significant trouble getting to DM every day during the day cause of how many times he was attacked. He never reported he got there safely. No doubt you died, just not nearly the same amount.
---
IF would be best if it had Ony buff.  It doesn't though.
---
Sounds like you need a boyfriend
---
I'll second this.
---
Yeah I used to work the night shift at a nursing home. I'd get home at 630 A.M. and play. Pretty much everyone was cool.
---
Mods on this sub aren‚Äôt the best. 
---
I don‚Äôt know what you expect, this isn‚Äôt the best sub either.
---
This is true?  Anyone else do this?  Seems strange it wasn‚Äôt widespread information.
---
How there are tens if not hundreds of thousands of people who did not see this coming is beyond me.  Honor grind for 95% of the people investing their time in it was always going to amount, at MOST, to some decent pvp blues.  Everyone was warned repeatedly.  Everyone was warned that their pre BG honor would ammount to literally pennies on the dollar for their time in comparison.  It seems most did not listen.  
---
Now, the grind for AV might make sense if you want to save a bunch of money on your ~~car insurance~~ epic mount by getting the 640G one at exalted.  The ring is cool too!  Willing to bet if that same population that is not hardcore to go for high honor rank just spent time running dungeons for pre raid bis or farming live strat you could have the gold difference of 260g in a FRACTION of the time though.  The ring alone is...well...incremental as an upgrade at best.
---
That being said, if you have it all and have done it all and AV/WSG is all you have to do...well...I think by now you realize just what kind of rat race you are in.  Prepping for BWL is probably STILL a better way to spend that time.  Even though it will probably be on farm within a week or two of release.  Sigh.  We were never going to be able to go allllll the way back to the vanilla experience were we?
---
IMO until/IF they implement the honor currency route, none of this is worth the time invested for a vast majority of those currently doing so.  In Vanilla I never really did hardcore AV until I had to re-roll a hunter (because guild my friends were in wanted one for raids) and the honor currency system was live.  I was able to skip a tonnnnnn of pre raid bis dungeon farming by just grinding AV to r14 for the weapons/armor while saving money on mount to boot.  It honestly did not even take that much time.  If I were to look...my Hunter is probably still wearing a bunch of it since I never really went back to him in the times I returned to Azeroth.  
---
(PS if you are a hunter and you are not thunderclapping large groups with a Gorilla pet trying to zerg/cap, are you even doing AV right?)
---
i think he is saying you got Hex at lvl 75 in the WoTLK expansion
---
I believe some of the ccs got their designated shape due to the color. Light blue = mage yellow = rogue purple = warlock
---
Honestly, I don't see what the issue is. Nothing prevents anyone from hanging out by the portal and running in when they do, right?
---
I guess if you are on a smaller server you might not have people from that discord to prompt a queue. However every server is large enough to create your own premade of 40 people and run in together.
---
If this was cross faction to have some unwritten understanding to straight zerg or for one side to purposely lay down for the other side to farm, I'd see an issue. That doesn't sound like what you are explaining though.
---
Afaik the first instrument was released in june of 2013, almost a year after the release of GW2.

You're not horribly gimping your gold income in the way you think. Essentially what happens is doing engineering wastes a lot of extra time. Alchemy in my opinion is a waste. If you join a half decent guild they have someone with every recipe who will craft you what you need free of charge. My personal recommendation would be to just level with mining/herbalism, and sell everything you gather. It takes a few hours to gather the gold and power level engineering or alchemy as a hunter. It takes 10s of hours to track everything and manage the bag space while you're leveling. It's more fun to do it while leveling, it's more efficient to just sell everything and make money while you're leveling. Hunters are easy levelers, but they have a lot of costs while leveling.
---
/u/thepiratewizardking, obviously.
---
Yeah, any group that sticks together, moves slightly slower, but doesn't abandon all the 60s to be murdered midfield ends up doing far, far better. 30-odd people will trash Drek with very few problems. 5-10? Gonna get wiped by NPCs plus defenders.

---
It really depends on the WSG premade. AV premades only require following the same strat every game and takes very little coordination.  WSG premades often match up against other premades and take forever, killing your efficiency.   AV premades almost never face each other, but even if they did, their goal is to kill LTs and end the game quickly, which benefits both sides. Some WSG premades can be efficient most of the time, but AV is more consistent and still king for ranking.
---
Bracket 14 is the highest, 1 is the lowest. Just to be clear you will never reach a rank if you have never reached that Bracket. You can't casually make your way to Rank 10. You can slow play it at first and then go hard to reach it, don't get me wrong. But in order to reach rank 10 you will HAVE TO be in Bracket 10 (top 6%?) for a few weeks in a row.
---
I just turned in the 25+ agi bl buff with dragonslayer buff on me, and didnt recieve the +25 agi. So i guess those dosnt stack. I wonder if moongoose potion stacks with dragonslayer
---
1. This discord isn't the only one instant queueing.
---
2. There exists a business for leveling characters on dead realms/empty faction sides to wintrade, get ranked, then sell them. IIRC not the only one. Paid transfers wrecked them hard.
---
3. There exists a community now designated to mess up with fake spy data on realms to assign their own transfers in order to get ranked there. 
---
This list isn't exhaustive by any means. Still, the drama around ranks is going to be hilarious since every side is going to report each other as hard as possible with tickets, calls to support, preventive blaming and whatnot.

Is there a light well should be : Yes - tell them to go respec
---
Welcome to the best server friend.
---
Before bgs I would have gone instantly but now it's really not bad
---
No, that isn't how that works. If the Alliance always get 3K, and the Horde always get 1K. If I am Horde, if I miss out on 10 AVs, I am still 10 AVs behind in my average honour ranking. The honour rankings are specific to faction, Alliance and Horde do not compete. You get compete against your peers, if your peers get the same number of honour on average as you per game -- it doesn't matter how much more or less the opposing faction is getting. Just the number of games you do...

This has always been the case, and it seems pretty logical to me. Unless it's a BoE you have to be part of the kill in order to be eligible for loot. The DM tribute chest is a unique exception.

It seems the consensus on skeram has been to stay.  The guild that's leaving is headed to sulfuras.  The invitation also goes out to stalagg.  We have good players on both factions on skeram.  Seven guilds under 45 minute molten cores.  Three alliance and four horde.
---
man remember in halo 1 where we played the same game for thousands of hours cause it was fun af and the continued enjoyment came from improving your own skills, building friendships, exploring new novelties...
---
babybrains like you who think progression is a required mechanic have ruined gaming
---
Stopping the interception doesn't slow ya that much, though. Usually only a handful of horde are intercepting. 10 at most. If Alliance dealt with them in a unified fashion, it'd be a few seconds, then everyone is back on the road. We'd do fine. 
---
Whereas if you lose half the raid before you even cross the field, it's probably a loss.
---
He did help people get gear.
---
Its easier to compare a bracket to a rank by counting up tbh. Gotta be Bracket 14 to get Rank 14, etc. It doesn't matter but that's how I see/use it.
---
Do this pull but then pull the warmaster outside and kill. Drek will reset. Repeat the pull again and fight Derek just inside the entrance. It's still quick and less risky of a wipe too.
---
Actually, the base miss rate in pvp is 5%. Weapon skill in PvP increases your chance hit hit(among other things) by something like 0.04%. so with +5 wep skill you have a 4.8% chance to miss. Since you can't get 0.8%hit you still need 5% to be hitcapped. Basically making weapon skill pretty useless in PvP.
---
Being able to organize 15 people to do all one thing (especially all one guild) is an Alliance concept.  Not even being sarcastic, its mechanically not available to horde because of the imbalance impact on the queue system.
---
&gt;anyone who doesn't play the game the way I do is a "babybrain"
---
Unhappy with your servers faction imbalance so youre are going to further scew another server? Sounds about right.
---
Yea, finally have a real reason to make my arcanite rod. Nearly there now. The last one i had put on my staff cost me 25g charge so even if i made 10g per chant id be happy.
---
I recall seeing damage done/healing done in bgs...maybe this was in tbc?
---
Yes, but not my much. Fire ruined grimoire is my pvp offhand. Provides .33% crit. I don't know warlocks exact ratio but roughly 60 int = 1% crit.
---
Not my problem really
---
Man would have infinite immunity on my server. What a legend
---
Do artificial sunders generate additional threat?
---
I'm a prot paladin currently using Silent Fang but recently picked up [Bashguuder](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13204/bashguuder).
---
Interesting thanks for clarifying!
---
You do realize you're moving the goalposts, right?
---
Yeah but you still had to commit more than average time to break that Exalted wall. Exalted + 8 hrs means you had an advantage. Anyone less or equal to probably saw negative results last week.
---
We're not, but that has nothing to do with our problem.  We get no Mage drops.  So when the rare set piece does drop, it goes for such an insanely high price that it fucks us for competing for any non-set items.
---
We've had incredibly terrible RNG on Mage drops.  Out of 10 MC clears and about ~12 Onyxia kills, we've had a total of 8 Arcanist/Netherwind drops.  And if you add non-set piece drops, that only adds about ~6 more items (2 Mageblades, 1 Ring of Power, 1 ToEP, 1 Sapphiron Drape, 1 Sorceress Dagger).
---
It's kind of incredible.  We've had a shitload of Warlock and Paladins drops, so they're all geared up and get their set pieces for minimum and can flex on all the non-set pieces.  I keep waiting for the RNG to balance out, but it hasn't.
---
Upvoted so you can have another post karma
---
Ya, ur just bad
---
We  are all cheating. All us nerds started out playing this in college and now have PhDs in  AI and shit.
---
What is happening here?
---
Dunno on my server we used star for sap because rogues class color was yellow. Diamond was usually hibernate/shackle because they were used for different types of creatures.
---
PAID SERVER TRANSFERS EXISTED IN VANILLA
---
Overall healing does not constitute well how a healer is doing. Yes they should be doing something, but that is not their only job,, Shields, removing buffs, removing debuffs, protecting the party. It is very hard to quantify mathematically how well a healer is doing because they have to adapt to the situation around them. You will sure as heck know when you have a good one though.
---
Do something you love and you will never work a day in your life
---
I am Horde, took 18 matches for my first win, so wouldn't be that shocked. That was when AV first dropped on patch day though, the last 10 or so I did before hitting Exalted the Horde seemed to dominate.
---
aaaaactually, if you go all the way back in their video histories, Silver used text the first time before Womble used text the first time lol. Silver totally was the first person to ever use letters and text in the history of youtube
---
Premades are a joke, good thing I don't have to compete with them for honor.
---
Those are great names as well
---
Debating the definition of meta.  That's gotta be the most meta meta to ever exist.
---
fucking blizz stealing the npcs
---
He did not get to do it yet,  out of the entire city  with 160-200 raiders waiting, just 2 warlocks from the same guild attacked and killed him, they and their guild are now server's pariahs xD. Quite the drama, thank God we raid the next day.
---
You won't replace TUF until Draconic Maul/Herald of Woe in BWL. Assuming of course that Eye of Ragnaros doesn't drop.
---
In classic a lightwell is pretty much unbeatable in terms of HPM if people use it correctly.
---
That's what I did - I feel more at-ease already.
---
Yes i know. You have my rotation in the post. And for me, it must be worth to prioritize shatter first.
---
We do win a lot. However, that doesn't mean we lack for idiots. There are a lot of folks who hold on to the one true strategy and scream at everyone who wants to do different. Or people who use raid warnings literally constantly to shit talk everyone. 
---
Even numbers helps a lot for pvp, and the map does offer alliance a few advantages, but sometimes you can't overcome a zerg of idiots.
---
I always ask for paladin blessing of freedom when pulling warmasters for exactly this reason. I need to buy more FAPs too.
---
No one is debating the meaning. 
---
Op can‚Äôt say ‚Äújust want to let people know about this meta technique that only ~20 players are doing in a game with millions‚Äù
---
He's not saying horde vs alliance, but alliance vs other alliance.
---
Same. Don't understand
---
I believe it for an alliance premade willing to play 40-80 minute games
---
I personally wouldn't call 30hrs a week casual, but by the time the gen 1 rankers are finally to a stopping point, I could definitely see someone getting Rank 10 with 30hrs around April/May.
---
It was the original "Anti-streamer" server, so it was filled with the elitists who were more toxic than the streamers that they bitched about.
---
Yesterday for the first time both ally and horde summoned as we had a huge battle in the middle with both summons going ham. It was pretty glorious
---
Nope, pvp server and as I said somewhere above, only got ganked once during all my levelling (while I was semi afking).
---
Invites are closed atm, but ask around in world chat
---
weak auras works
---
https://wago.io/jMD8pQ6ZP
---
Yes, mages. 33% faster casts for 20 seconds, possibly the best trinket in the game for us. Makes up for our abysmal DM:N trinket.
---
See I had only experienced the DM chest so I only knew the exception for this
---
How she got no mouth but got some plump supple titties bro, that ain‚Äôt how death works
---
It's not a ranking mafia, it's literally just a BG premade creation platform for people who can't do it with their own guild.
---
There's zero incentive to use that thing if you have a guild that's interested
---
I don't understand.  What's the point of playing and getting this gear if we're not playing to win?  When did it become okay to lose?
---
Its clearly because they aren't defending FY GY....
---
If you take damage while the hot is active it gets canceled. It's pretty much useless. The only raid encounters where it would be good are ones where constant damage is going out.
---
this is fuckin hilarious
---
As a warrior try to get r10 and a ragnaros weapon. This compared with 2 private heals should be fine for some BG fun
---
I just use a #showtooltio macronand put it on my action bar to show me how many flash powders i have left.
---
But i am curious as to know why they went from being visible to not
---
When buff goes out it takes 6 hours for another one to be possible. This buff went out at the wrong time so raid night was missing an important Onyxia buff. Lots of guilds want that. 
---
So you have to kill the NPC who gives out the buff and then the cooldown is reset. It‚Äôs a priest so he can MC the guy and then everybody murders him. A few minutes later another head gets turned in and buff goes out.
---
BG's are cross server. A lot of people were complaining about imbalance b4 bg's. But bg's are cross server so does the server really matter for pvp? if anything you want a low pop server to have less competition in your faction
---
Yeah they added it in v2.0
---
Imagine making fun of people for role playing while you're playing a role playing game...
---
Yeah I bet if you play for that ammount each day, you're pretty much home all the time.
---
Hear hear! I'm Horde, but you all are fine folks who gave us a hell of a time during Phase 2.
---
Stick together. Probably marginally better to do Galv and LTs. Means fewer pulls at Drek, so as long as you take things down rapidly, you do benefit from clearing as much as possible. Likewise, holding towers means fewer warmasters to deal with. 
---
So, while you don't want to waste time, there is a large benefit to both clearing more and delaying horde.
---
How did you queue as a group?
---
I doubt that. All of the faerlina pop was due to people wanting to play with streamers
---
Any server with late night raiding guilds? Horde
---
Yes, but if you want to get the buff again you can just kill him.
---
Looking for the same thing in horde eu, priest heal 3/8t1-headT2-2/6pvp r9 atm
---
That‚Äôs fuckin awesome. I had no idea there was a way to reset cooldown
---
Rep for Horde Bigglesworth!
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre getting mad about. Just because you don‚Äôt understand doesn‚Äôt make those reasons for making twinks any less valid. Sometimes people want a break from the progression that comes with being level 60
---
I always tip starting at 5g or more depending on enchant. Seems fair to me.
---
How much rep do you get from each of these games?
---
The NPC that drops the onyxia head buff can only do so once every 6 hours.  If he is killed however,  he is capable of dropping the buff again as soon as he respawns regardless of how recently the last buff occurred.  The alliance priest is going to mind control the NPC so the assembled horde can kill the NPC and thus get another onyxia head buff in time for their raid.
---
What realm? My brother is looking for a morning raiding guild.
---
Dragonslayer buff has a 6 hour cooldown, usually server guilds negotiate who places it each Wednesday and Thursday, one at 1pm to prevent sabotage and the other on 7 pm, before everyone starts raiding. This time head wasn't placed at 1 pm so one person sabotaged the buff by placing it on 5 pm. Through the magic of discord, a heroic dwarf priest decided to help by mindcontrolling the horde leader that places the head and restarting it.
---
The ones without jobs or priority schedules, that can afford to play wow early early in the morning. (Obvious night shifts and graveyard excused)
---
Why? You gain no advantage coming from PvP to PvE.
---
thanks! I need it.
---
Because you are playing the game for "X" rep (or "X" honor) to get "X" item.
---
That's not fun to a lot of people. That's a grind. If I got into one of the AV's the OP is talking about I would love it.
---
Yeah, this strat only works with aware players lol. We have explained this so many times in every conceivable way and people still don't get it.
---
 I'm guessing that alliance and horde have separate 6 hour cooldowns so an alliance could technically turn in their head in Org and everybody would get a new buff.
---
Why do you think they aren't getting loot lol. Also his friend mains a ret pally and "heals when motivated" aka pullin that hot 150 dps
---
Swords use evis but what do daggers use?
---
&lt;3
---
Thanks for spreading the awareness to horde to use the backdoor More, more often than not I am usually solo there.
---
Loot Council = Let's let random people artificially dictate gearing. This is concentrated Drama-fuel. Every desirable piece of gear is a match.
---
Yes. Over half the people in AV are below 60.   
---
Makes sense.
---
Let me guess, your home?
---
Someone had just ganked my groupmate in STV and then got onto the boat. They thought they could escape by jumping off once it reached the other side, but I got them and still managed to catch the boat back to STV.
---
Generally people put a shorter version of the question in the title of a post something that has to do with the post maybe not a full-length explanation because they assume that people are going to read the post and if everyone read this post they would know that the question is will I get banned for this
---
Nah it doesn‚Äôt depend on any of that, it‚Äôs 8.
---
Yes I know.
---
The real issue here is that it is complicated.  Especially for some classes like warlock where lifetap extends mana, lifetap scales with spellpower, factors like the length of the fight can have a big impact, and combinations of gear can interact differently.  Sometimes just 1-3 seconds shorter or longer fight might change what is truly best. 
---
Crit%, hit%, and spellpower all have a complex interaction.  1% hit might be worth more than 10 spellpower, but only if the rest of your gear is really stacked with spellpower.   Adding in elixirs, world buffs, and pots can again change things.  
---
WoWhead was not great for a while, but they finally added some of the big +spell BOEs so its not horrible.  Last I looked they were still missing or or two key items.  Crimson Felt Hat is overvalued for both locks and mages.  Sapphiron drape as well compared to the +20/21 BOEs.
---
nice
---
First side to kill Galv/Bal get rep *and* honor.  And the 20% health buff for some reason doesn't get the whole raid, seems random, so just because you didn't get the buff doesn't mean you didn't kill them in time.
---
The second side to kill them does indeed get no honor or rep BUT you stop the opposing team from getting random health buffs as they will periodically call out to charge if they are not killed.
---
Yeah, that bridge is a great choke point, particularly in conjunction with snowballs. 
---
If you ran into a druid endlessly snowballing horde off the bridge with a macroed /bye, that was probably me.
---
[deleted]
---
Yes inside part of the raid ID. Even if you just invite them for that one boss. That's normally how it is. The purchaser will be invited for domo and then removed after.
---
Personal argument: If Healing is sufficient (nobody is dying), gear going to healers is entirely wasted. More DPS is always beneficial as it reduces overall clear times. More healing than the threshold of people-not-dying does not help clear times.
---
I wanted to actually play the game, getting corpse camped by alliance in ungoro is annoying
---
Hmm, as a rogue, would it be a good idea to stealth into the Horde deathball headed to Balinda and sap a few of them?
---
&gt;The one thing I truly dislike is this mentality of "our strategy failed, let's roll over and let the horde win". 
---
I hate this mentality.  I mean, I get it, I understand, this is not the most effective Honor/hour which means other people are outpacing you, but I play to win.
---
I will play to the end. I don't care if its a premade and we're down 2 flags already. I will still play. Hate to admit it, but we lost to a half premade when we were up 2 flags to none playing a little cocky. Won't make that mistake again.
---
If you're alliance I'd love to join or apply
---
Just have to practice my friend, if you look he has pretty good gear and already has the DM buffs in that video.
---
Someone with the name meaning ‚Äùturned into a slut" talks about being a slut. I can't understand why you fail to see why that should get a "Username checks out."
---
Replace "often" with "always" and that's the difference.
---
As long as horde isn‚Äôt in there losing on purpose, couldn‚Äôt care less.
---
I took mining/engi from lvl 1 and had 105g by lvl 40. A lot of the ore and engi related stuff sells well on the AH.
---
You'll be 60 by dinner!
---
Now imagine if AoE looting was a thing lol...
---
oh, was that also the highlights + floating text over the speaker style that SW does or just like texts?
---
I know there is plenty of youtubers who did either highlights (a ton) or floating text, or even just text emphasizing funny stuff but not floating.
---
This is how I feel. I've been in plenty of drek rush games where we have won or easily could have won but someone pulled wrong or got feared into all the WMs and wiped us. I've also been in ones where we go galv-lieutenants-fwgy-rhgy-drek with like 10 defenders slowing horde down and won. I feel like the main thing is not trying to control 39 other people but sticking together for whatever the group majority decides. Theres more than 1 way to win, we just actually need to stick together for a change instead of half rushing galv half rushing drek.
---
Somebody give that dwarf a fucking medal
---
it's funny how the arguments always involve "everyone who plays X is just better, it has nothing to do with balance"
---
If you log out with a BL buff for an hour and try to use a 2nd buff when you log back in it will replace the 1st buff. So cooldown is not the issue.
---
That Tauren high warlord with several pockethealers one shotting people to Soil breaking me down.
---
6om?? Holy shit, this guy is nuts!!
---
Of course not.  What a ludicrous suggestion.
---
Don't worry yourself with such things.
---
Ironically Ret Palas do a lot better with AQ release. First you get Black Grasp of the Destroyer which allows you to cast consecration and Hammer of Wrath almost full time, 2nd the mobs aren't fire resistant/immune anymore. Which allows Fiery Weapon and Dragonbreath chili to do a lot damage. Which is important for spelldamage ret palas.
---
I'd definitely say 1h/OH, because the OH is a guarantee and I've honestly seen the mageblade drop more than the staff and that's a better combo anyways.
---
100% yes.  will anything happen? 100% no.
---
How can I play with you guys? I need this.
---
Flip + Charge = OP! Night elf warriors FTW!
---
Randomly after a hotfix my reagents reappeared. Anyway they were never supposed to show in the first place. In vanilla your spells didn't display how many reagents you have.
---
What this guy said.
---
Because some alliance MC'd Runthak and killed him. So the 6 hour timer on not being able to get the buff was reset. So they were able to get the buff again without waiting.
---
Is this potato? Was in one of these games and thought it was amazing, keep up the good work.
---
A tale as old as time, a song as old as rhyme...
---
Not a legal name on RP servers regardless.
---
all is possible under the shade of Treesus...
---
lol wtf is this "consent" stuff. people played the game because they remember enjoying it or wanted to try it out. if you want to feel good for winning with horde - great - but i imagine more alliance will get sick of the balance and just make your queues worse when they quit.
---
I remember skipping this!
---
No their is just Alliance/Horde guilds coordinating to kill the turn in guy to reset the timer
---
Oooh.... + Hit Mage boots.
---
Are you guys in the guild potatoes? Did 2 AVs with them and won and got around 1700 rep for 45-50 mins of AV. I wish we could do that every game.
---
If you're done farming rep the queue is actually welcome because you get a 15 minute break between every game during the honor grind :V
---
What REALLY sucks is anyone on ally trying to rank and having to queue back to back games in order to keep up.
---
That's true, the horde queue times make it nearly impossible to premade but 40 horde pugs seem to organize far better than 40 alliance pugs.
---
Not everyone cares about rank. Some of us just want exalted rewards for P3 BiS
---
Actually that‚Äôs true, overall population imbalance is a problem. Would be better if this was present from the beginning than introduced now, to be sure. 
---
Funny though. Under the current system some alliance players just can‚Äôt play because not enough people rolled alliance on their server. But let‚Äôs arbitrarily agree that locking them out of playing and keeping faction imbalance is fine, but fixing faction imbalance is a terrible problem because people would be locked out of paying, which totally doesn‚Äôt happen now. Because they can log in and be camped for no or, which is completely a different thing from not being able to play at all.
---
After all, they can always reroll on the other faction.
---
Check out Incendius (EST PvP). High population, but no queues and a good faction balance. If you end up rolling there, DM me your character name and I'll send you some stuff to help get you started.
---
Wait, every character has their own bank?
---
So if Orgrimmar is the most populated city on Horde, then Undercity and then Thunderbluff...would the order of Alliance cities be Iron Forge, Stormwind and then Darnassus? or would IF and SW be flipped and SW would be #1?
---
He deleted it. But yeah he should've said, "Will I get banned for account sharing?" Also, I'm surprised the Mods didn't take it down. I see them saying shit like, "If you can easily google it, don't post it here."
---
Oh, thanks for clearing that up. I‚Äôm not into donkey stuff, but I‚Äôm not one to judge. You do you.
---
What?? I run with both every week and they stack. What class are you
---
It works on the DMT chest.
---
It requires some effort, but at a level that is far more acheivable compared to 14. Pretty much everyone will get rank 3-4 eventually just by playing. Decay is not a big factor in the low ranks, and even playing BGs casually will get you some honor, so you eventually get there. So, it requires a fairly modest press to get to 7-8. BGs erry day for a few hours over the course of a few weeks will get you there. 
---
In comparison, R14 requires complete no lifing for many months, consecutively. Even a single poor week can screw ya.
---
What was your point then? To bring up one random exception on a custom server to a rule that has been in place for 15 years?
---
How do people coordinate this stuff anyway? How do you know when they go out?
---
Because they're not rep, and ally is there for rep.
---
"Iv never seen anything like it."
---
Try
---
It isn‚Äôt a method that‚Äôs at the bottom of reddit and downvoted lol.
---
there's a neutral auction house??
---
As Alliance: 
---
Most of the geared players are done with their grind, and have either quit AV or they are doing premades for max honor.  A good premade can kill galv, LTs, Towers, Drek in under 11 mins for max honor and the win.
---
A few premades follow the 'give the horde nothing' philosophy and defend Balinda and slowly grind their way down to Drek for the win, typically summoning Ivus for the extra push power at the end.  Way more fun than the zerg for max honor, but also 40+ min games so not super great for honor farming.
---
Pugs are a shit show.  People cannot stay together, no one listens to the people who know how to pull drek, and at almost every point in the map the alliance lets 5 horde steamroll them.  Rogues however are capitalizing on the 30 min pug losses to pickpocket both mines for hundreds of gold on their slow grind to exalted.  Also fishing isn't bad either.
---
Yes, but you'll never get caught and nobody actually cares
---
Spawn at the GY, not your body
---
I wish my guild factored in consumable use. Out of 6 rogues theres like 2 of us who always have mongoose/firewater/juju/agi food up. Also I'm the only rogue using sharpening stones when fighting elementals etc. I also spam lesser fire pots on trash to avoid dying to big packs and stressing out the healers. Fuck I even farm fire res  jujus for rag.
---
But guess who got core hound tooth? The rogue with the worst gear, no enchants on weapons, annoying in raid chat, lowest dps and who constantly ass pulls extra mobs and bosses. Also started with the guild several weeks after me.
---
I hate /rolls with no oversight.
---
That would save me so much time x.x
---
Agree. Op colors are on point
---
Then it sounds a lot like you have a guild problem, not a 2hander problem.
---
I‚Äôm thinking of transferring there myself as horde
---
anyone interested in the Mods adding flair to this subreddit? Seeing if people are horde or alliance, or what class they are would be cool in comments. Small QoL change forsure, but think it is something most people would be for.
---
I can‚Äôt speak for them, but I just had a 30 minute game like this where we got 700 rep from a win (which capped me to 999 exalted), turn ins, and kills.  It‚Äôs not as much as day 1 with 8 minute games, but it‚Äôs not bad.
---
I KNEW MOON USED TO BE POLY
---
Mp5 is a lot less useful than it seems.  When you calculate it out its miserable.  But maybe boosting int could be worth it?  The larger the mana pool, the longer you can sustain high dps without going oom.  On 8-10 min fights, no, but on a normal raid fight (1.5-2mins) it seems even better than +dmg, no?
---
Yes, we're from &lt;potato&gt; on Pagle.  I'm glad you had fun :)
---
No changes dude. Idk what you don‚Äôt get. Classic was PERFECT the way it was, and nothing needs to be changed. Not. A. Single. Thing. GOT IT?! You‚Äôre so closed minded! God. Wtf. Go tO ReTaIL bro! 
---
Sorry, figured I‚Äôd get those out of the way. But yes, I agree with you :)
---
Can someone explain to me why Alliance bothers to go left immediately (up the hill) rather than at Stonehearth like before? I've tested going the normal route multiple times and always end up in the exact same spot as everyone else at the same time. It's not like Horde are going to cut us off THAT early.
---
You aren't playing AV, you are suffering AV in order to attain your exalted status to buy an item so you can go play the aspect of the game you enjoy.
---
This strategy is for people who enjoy playing AV.
---
Top guilds could easily just park their own priest with MC in the city using a second account..
---
Hunter is #1 level. Druid is #3 leveler. Not much difference in that. Question is, do you want to tank 5 mans and heal raids? Or dps? Because as a druid you will definitely be heals/tank.
---
All the Goblin Cities have a connected neutral auction house.
---
Idk why there are so many guilds that do this. Pserver culture I guess, but I distinctly remember it being a thing in Vanilla too, just not as often.
---
But what if #2 happens and everyone dumps their stock crashing the price?
---
Late classic? So like I said, right before bc lmao
---
8month redditor, 200karma, people really seem to enjoy what you say :DD
---
&gt;Kuney
---
Haha it was low! When the guildie won it, we all went crazy on Ventrilo. He tipped the guild bank quite well by donating 10% to it.
---
And then what?
---
Was gonna reply "Anything by Greatwizard"
---
EPL used to be like something out of terminator.  You had to sneak around but youd inevitably get spotted and slaughtered by roving death bands.  Now its a ghost town.
---
This happened on Pagle and it was like this in the Undercity too. We were raiding MC and midway through they shutdown the server to fix it :(
---
Pretty sure that was Pat. Fun fact, he actually replied to a Reddit thread about getting HWL. I asked if he'll be playing Classic and he said nah. Life happened.
---
Im gonna go ahead and say the one who downvotes another ones comment on a 9 days old thread is the sensitive one :DD
---
Hey man...you...you alright?
---
I'm not into either, but I know it when I see it.
---
cheers
---
Bagnon has all of this built in.
---
what add on you got for your unit frames there? always see that but have never found it
---
Earthshaker is a nice mace too. I had one on my arms warrior. The Stun procs quite often too
---
That‚Äôs just the blizzard raid style party frame, using class coloured health bar
---
10 hours/week and aiming for rank 8 are mutually exclusive.
---
Blizz wouldn't be the wiser if 3 mates living together all worked hard to get that 1 (ONE) character to rank 14. Tis the only way, a blood pact must be made under a full moon. For these gents will sacrifice everything.
---
It's not based on in-game differences but outgame similarities. You can be a productive member of society and still no life wow player or you can be an onproductive member of society and be an even more hardcore nolifer but if both don't have a life they are both nolifers, even if they are just hoping around stormwind being lvl 1 in-game.
---
In the game menu?
---
Great work. Nice!
---
No way, [this is way worse](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=7728/stolen-smithing-tuyere-and-lookouts-spyglass). The tuyere has 4 enemies that drop it, with a low chance, and the respawn time is not fast. It took me hours to get it to drop with all the competition.
---
I don't think it is. I think that most people like winning efficiently. I think most people like being reasonably rewarded for their efforts. People that like AV don't like slogging through the same AV for an hour because as time goes on enjoyment dwindles. 
---
There are plenty of things that people like, but not for extended lengths of time.
---
Only you can decide that...
---
Keep doing what you are doing and youll be struggling to find a guild on your server. You are ignoring everyone telling you your wrong. You ARE WRONG.
---
Agreed, but it also describes how well they do to some extent.
---
You can‚Äôt be sure they are supple here
---
I currently raid as a 0/21/30 suev hunter and I STILL out Damage/DPS most of the people in my raids. I'm not paying for a respec every week for 48 hours so I just raid in my PvP/DMT farm spec.
---
Your bread and butter are aimed shots and multi shots anyways. The extra agility from the Surv tree offsets the 15% multi/volley talent anyways.
---
If you absolutely have to min-max then Marks is still best but I don't think it matters too much if you know your rotation and enemy boss timing/positioning/mechanics.
---
10 hours a day isn't casual. You're one of 'em.
---
Losers with no lives or girlfriends or friends?
---
That is what they have to be to play 8 hours every day.
---
Is it not now?
---
Detties
---
I definitely thought about going down the prot tree a little, but since my focus is mainly pvp, I like to have eye for an eye when I'm trying to burst down a mage or shaman since they deal a lot of crits and the speed boost for chasing people down is nice.
---
Do you use 1h or 2h in pvp? I've read pros and cons for both. 1h seems to be more consistent damage with SoR if you can find a good +spell damage one with offhand, but 2h seems to give a better chance for burst damage with SoC and chance on hit procs
---
&gt;*to balance it*
---
Flair checks out.
---
*Overruled!*
---
I have about 8k rep to go before exalted and i'll probably never set foot in AV again after. Or atleast until the queues die down enough to where i can actually queue up with my friends.
---
This isn't an opinion thing. You are objectively wrong and YOU are the one with the personal attack here.
---
When your rank is in relation to everyone else's honor gains, you have to go where you can gain the most honor.
---
Felwood just isn't it right now.
---
How much xp do the people you‚Äôre boosting get and what levels do you boost them through here?
---
Interesting interpretation of hte Black Mageweave set.

Well, I'm not a #nochanges'er, anything to save time!
---
Either adapt or fall behind. Those are your options. You won't find any sympathy here.
---
Is this on an RP server? Who fucking cares
---
This was available in Strand of the Ancients too: you could waterwalk as defense and run into the offensive team‚Äôs boat before they even landed. Huge advantage. Does that BG even exist anymore?
---
Still is as far as i know.
---
well if you do open it up again and want someone who isn't a racist/thrower send me a msg :)
---
Okay, it may be fixed now. I'll know later!

Are you a lock? Yes. Dot everything and run for the exit üôÑ
---
Are you guys able to kill Rag in P1 with only 23 people? What's your strat on Domo to make it through with healer Mana? Thanks!
---
Does sound like a total boomer!
---
Not wirth, just note that at 60 it's going to be mostly premade so make sure you have a group to play with.  49 probably won't have premades, maybe some twinks, but will possibly be more enjoyable if you are solo.
---
And it's not as if you hit level 70 and were immediately given a full PvP set.  You still had to do a lot of BGs to get both the honor and the marks to buy your offset PvP gear, and arena gear would take weeks to get without a decent rank.  It's nothing like the R14 grind, but it's entirely doable for a normal casual player over a few months.
---
Im not sure, you migh be right.
---
The rank system isn't set up as a skill competition, it's just whoever can spend the most time playing. 
---
The system was already a joke to begin with from a competitive standpoint.
---
I farmed this, foolishly expecting it to work like it did on pserver. Sadly, it does not.  
---
It will only ever attack a target if you've been engaged either through a physical attack, spell attack, or a debuff application. It will always heal you though if you dip below a percentage.
---
Has anyone figured out how to forcefully trigger an aggressive stance with the Timbermaw for PvE situations? I.e. pop it on Ragnaros and it will DPS instead of standing there?
---
AFAIK, yes. Apparently just using the right letters in /y to say stuff like "go back to retail" is consider cross faction communication.
---
&gt; However every server is large enough to create your own premade of 40 people
---
You mean 40 shitters
---
Alliance no longer auto wins: ITS A DISASTER NOW
---
What? AV is cross realm and you aren't allowed to que as a group. You'd have to be in the discord to see how it works. I'm not sure what OP's issue with the discord is, R14 has always been political. You cannot solo to R14, you'll be inefficient and pushed out rather easily by other rankers.
---
Want an invite to 2 of the 3 discords?
---
Thanos was a druid, confirmed
---
WELCOME
---
I COULD go into why your first comment is totally wrong, but the fact that you're making it when it's totally irrelevant and pedantic is much more pointless.
---
Naw, but bailing midraid after getting loot is certainly bad form anywhere. Even in a pug, bailing after a boss doesn't drop the gear you want is a bit rude.
---
Think he meant lorewise, but yeah, Undead is the perfect race for griefers. Not a whole lot more you can do to piss off someone you gank than to eat their corpse.
---
Well my honorspy after yesterday is currently showing I'd drop from rank 9 (1%) to rank 8 (1%) lol. Which I'm pretty sure I'm accurate.
---
And the reason why most people pushing won't care is because it never impacts them.
---
" follicles "  
---
Only a word a dweeb would use.  GTFO of here greasy nerds.
---
Can I also get an invite, almost BIS raid geared mage, Epic mount.
---
I have a Warlock, Druid, and 2 Hunters in the 40s and all other slots filled lol
---
I don't even really care what gets to 60, I just play whichever one I am feeling like that day.
---
All these flavors and you choose to be salty.
---
How is queuing at the same time an exploit lmao
---
No it was me :)
---
-	Watch newer videos from classic rather than vanilla 
---
-	find the ‚Äútree trick‚Äù video for the BS demon
---
-	be aware that since October, aggro link for the Un‚ÄôGoro demon changed. Some strats you will see no longer work
---
Happens all the time in Stalagg SW too!
---
ahh, I see. I think the browser I use at work does not support the flair as I can't see any. Thanks for the heads up. I'll take a look at the options when I get home.
---
As long as people keep paying they have no reason to change.
---
Start the revolution my man. Unsub and watch the change!
---
I'm on AR hordeside. It's probably 60/40 alliance favored. The server isn't overpopped, but some might think it feels dead if you compare it to something grossly overpopped like skeram or herod. But gathering resources in the world feels reasonable. There are 5ish raiding guilds and some leveling guilds, so you should easily be able to find something for the content you like to do.
---
Am a rogue, it's for OUR protection, you never know where those trash mobs have been.
---
We all queue at the same time, and type in raid chat which number get each get.  Whichever number has the most we all join and the rest of us queue into that number which is typically at the bottom of the list.  (The BG's sort from Oldest -&gt; Newest)
---
for a brief moment, it was.
---
Dang I hit level 60 on thanksgiving and I felt like I was a little bit behind the curve, but damn. 
---
Idk about Arcanite Reaper but I play horde on a Old Blanchy, West coast PvE server and I love it. While I was leveling I was in a guild called Trinity, had like 1000 members and it was super focused on leveling. I eventually left for a raiding guild but I looooooved that guild why I was leveling. There were always people on to help with quests and run dungeons with. Also got a pretty nice tabard too haha
---
That mc is piss easy and better dps means faster clears
---
As long as there is a steady supply of the mob to kill, I love quests like this. I get a ton of experience killing as well as gold from selling trash all while not having to run around the world getting no experience running from person to person.
---
It's not an exploit. When you queue at the exact same moment with 30 people, for example, one of the queues that pops will probably have at least 15-20 of those people together. The others may be together or scattered between different instances.  It's not rocket science. My guild does this without the help of an addon or exploit. If you have a dozen or so well coordinated people in a BG can carry the rest of the group as long as they listen.  This only works because of instant queues. Once Alliance starts seeing actual queues, this method will be extremely hit or miss.
---
whoa whoa now, u think it will?
---
The US one has around 6k in the discord.
---
What...? Just queue up at the same time, and dodge if you don't get the same one...
---
Honor isn't a pool, its a scaled point system that is relative to the total amount gained by your faction for that reset, IE - if the alliance is getting 3x as much honor, that just means their pool is 3x as big, however, each individual contribution is weighted the same if they would have been getting 1000 per game and the pools were the same size.  
---
I wish people would stop thinking honor is a "resource" or currency. its not.
---
Just because you play with bad warriors doesnt make 2h fury good for alliance or mean you get to steal pvp bis under the pretense of using it in pve
---
They gave him metal, all right
---
I'm having some serious Super Saiyan hairstyle vibe there. Great work mate!
---
Moon is always sheep. Always.
---
If you don‚Äôt moon it, I ain‚Äôt sheepin it.
---
I'll second this. I'm a healer that doesn't have my epic mount. 99% of the time when I try to head south with the initial rush, I get picked off fast.
---
It‚Äôs in menu interface options action bars, just a standard feature
---
Where are her organs?

Better 400 wow gold than 400 real dollars.
---
Gambling addictions are seriously scary. I used to work at a Casino and I wont bore you with sob stories but I knew people who would stay awake 48 hours and gamble that entire time and leave the Casino more broke when they came in.
---
Just dont gamble. You clearly might be predisposed to gambling addictions so for your own health, just avoid gambling from now on.
---
Rogues can kill the 4 mobs solo as well. Sometimes I chug a pot, sometimes not.
---
I think 'excelling at' is poorly used here.  What you consider to be 'excelling' because you just want efficient (arguable) rep, may be boring and a chore for other people.  To some people, the most wins is excelling, to others, the most HKs, the most heals, etc.  You are casting quite the large net with your statements.
---
From your replies it honestly sounds like you know what you like, and what you don't like.  And unfortunately this approach may not be for you.  Luckily, you have a choice.  Just like people who prefer this approach also have a choice when they enter a zerg game.
---
I personally do not understand this 'hurry up, then wait' approach but hey, its just like.. my opinion..man..
---
Most of the mobbs are between lvl 18 and 23. Ideal starting level would be like 17, but the minimum required lvl to enter is 14, it depends how much you value the loot here over the slightly higher xp you could be getting from say deadmines, and in there i wouldn't even bother looting. If you wanted to optimize XP it would probably be best to switch over to Stockade at around 23, personally i would stay for a few more lvls just cus i really like this dungeon and the loot.  
---
As for how much xp, it's hard to say, depends on a few things, what level you are, and how many people are in your group cus of group bonus xp. But i think it's usually around 4 runs per level.
---
Realize horde pigs are just as bad
---
But you wont do more damage with a spinal than dal rends  single target. Thats the lie your spinning.
---
The healing and damage actually doesn't look too bad, but how long did the rep grind take?
---
The difference is between joining an instanced environment, kicking (or getting kicked) out of it, and camping someone in world PvP.
---
Camping someone on a PvE server is actually a ban-able offense, however I dare say it happens very rarely as you can toggle PvP off.
---
On a PvP server you signed up to potentially get killed repeatedly, but if it's targeted on you as a specific player by a different player, who is deliberately tracking you down to camp you, that's harassment and is also banable.
---
300k honor at 330 standing got me from 6.2 to 6.7. Saw a duo of rank 9s who had 1.1M honor each last week standing at 26 and 31. Disgusting lol. I got 43k rep 0-exalted and another dozen wins on top of that last week for only half a rank. I may have fucked myself because of brackets? Prior to bgs I was hitting alot higher standings from wpvp and was already rank 6 before bgs came out. Very surprised I didnt get rank 7 this week
---
I see a lot of mentions of Bagnon. Will that change the looks of the bags as well? I'd like to be able to see this info too, but I want my bags to look purely default UI.
---
For The Horde! It‚Äôs the UBRS rend blackhand quest in the onyxia attunement chain
---
If you don't feel like you are getting your $12.99 worth, than stop paying for it until you do.
---
Yeah I've seen rogues do it, probs too hard as dagger
---
As I told my wife: I finished the first 1/4 of the game.
---
Exalted brings you to rank 3 which allows you to buy mount (including alterac one) cheaper haha.
---
false
---
&gt; These thoughts push you and make getting to level 60 so much more rewarding. 
---
No, not really. It might have been your experience, but it's not a universal feeling.
---
If i learned one thing from twinking i classic: Everybody is a twink. Theres no ibnocent levelers queuing up, its twinks vs twinks
---
Does anyone care?
---
Pagel you said?
---
Zombie boobies.
---
It will ask you to change your name. Before any server transfer it requires you to log onto the character and clear the mailbox. Not just read everything, it has to be empty.
---
We did this in Vanilla with our guild on Ventrilo. Its not a new concept by far, the only difference is, we did it only a handful of times for fun, and never as a consistent way to get honor. 
---
It's not a 100% guarantee, to get everyone, but its fun having 20 or so people that you know in the AV.
---
(note that I haven't tried this yet in Classic, but we do intend on doing this one day for fun)
---
I'd rather just pvp for fun in my tier 1 than kill myself going for rank 10 gear. 
---
It's a little different for tanks and healers who's tier sets are not designed for damage I guess.
---
You can be a puny gnome. Who wants to get killed by something you could punt across a football field?
---
I played PvE in vanilla with the thinking of "ugh, why bother fill the world up with smarter enemies who are competing with the same resources you are?"
---
I started classic on a PVP server and it's been incredible. When BGs started up and I started Pvping against clearly PvE players out of practice it was one of those "I was born in the pvp. Molded by it." moments where it felt like I had the advantage
---
Yeah what a tool.
---
You're welcome!
---
Rip me I guess I should have kept grinding.
---
Top guild in BC and start of Wotlk was &lt;vodka&gt;. They were alliance on Mannoroth. Server transfer was active during that entire period.
---
Good point, I use swords currently. Opener would kill 1 but it may be tough unless geared.
---
Thank you so much kind sir!
---
I mean i dont do any discriminations; orc/troll/tauren/undead. I accept them all
---
what is the end game on PVE, like what do you have to look forward to?
---
Armory did this too, plus you could see their profession info and other stuff. Basically everything they had or could do, you could see it. It was the ‚Äúother‚Äù mod if you didn‚Äôt have/want Altoholic. 
---
I have no idea if it even exists anymore or has been ported to classic if it does.
---
Huh? Don‚Äôt retail servers lag too when a lot of ppl are in same area? That‚Äôs pretty much why they utilized sharding from my understanding. 
---
More like, never bothered to optimize in the first place
---
As I recall last time I transferred it will not let you if you have mail in your mailbox. And yes, it will force you to take a new name. (Actually it gives you a default name and the ability to do a one-time change free before you log in the first time.)
---
If it works the same as boosting, I'm pretty sure you have to empty your mailbox first. Never transferred though so I'm not too sure
---
Because there are very limited spawns, and a relatively low drop rate of the quest items. So just about any competition makes the quest a fucking nightmare.
---
It attacked whatever you were attacking on summon. It appears that may be TBC behavior though, but I'm not entirely sure. For all we know it was scripted incorrectly as well.  
---
Too bad too. It was roughly a \~115dps increase for the duration of its summon. If you find a way to trigger it to DPS like Barov, let me know!
---
Go to heart Seaker. Alliance dominated with insta bg queues woot
---
As a hunter, 8 piece T1 is best at the moment. That's for both pve and pvp.
---
I don't advertise but I respond to 50g offers for the blues in /1, never seen Treant's. I see other hunter's advertise 25g often though. I understand it but I'd just rather do another run than wait to advertise and sell at that point.
---
What is the purpose of getting gear if not to parse better
---
So a hunter which can't prevent a mindcontrol past feign death should be punished for meeting a priest at any given time in a BG, that decided to not only kick him out of content for 15 minutes, but also put his entire team at a disadvantage?
---
Same can be said for shamans &amp; warriors, however they have a few more tools to prevent this.
---
Or what about classes that nothing left to prevent a mindcontrol, should they be punished because one guy decided to play a priest and seek to gain an unfair advantage for his team?
---
It was quite the ride
---
Great job!
---
Bullshit. Pure bullshit. Calling the top players of this game meta sheep is fucking insulting. People work very hard to figure out whats optimal in this game. You havent worked at all on the theorycrafting but feel content to take a shit on it as it suits your agenda.
---
Every shred of data, logs, theorycrafting says that dual wield dal rends beats all 2 handers alliance side. 
---
Your arguments are handwaving while disregarding every shred of evidence available. All while providing 0 evidence or arguments in favor of 2hander.
---
Youre just trying to find a way to justify getting BRE prio.
---
its always been 6hour cd until now, so we would pop head at 13:00 to secure the buff at 19:00 but today it bugged for some reason and was up after 5 hours
---
You seem to be under the impression that PvP is somehow the main focus of Blizzard? 
---
It's not, it's comparatively a small part of the game. 
---
And yes, it is all about money. Is there any other reason, ever, anywhere, to have a business?
---
How do you suggest they fix it?
---
It's a PvE server, so probably not a lot? I'd say there's maybe 500 trying to rank rn
---
That's definitely good enough for BWL.
---
Raiding, BGs, farming gold/mats, helping guildies gear up in dungeons... literally all of the same stuff in a PVP server except you don't get ganked while trying to do it
---
&gt;\#showtooltip  
---
&gt;/cast \[mod:shift\] Frost Ward; \[mod:ctrl\] Fire Ward
---
Couldn't get it to work.
---
I completely agree, but there is no point in making a post about, other than to vent. They don't care.
---
Do you like sex? Do you like sex after an hour and a half of fucking and your dick is rubbed raw and you're tired but youre just trying to get your nutt off and you're almost fucking there?
---
Like pizza? Like eating nothing but pizza for a day because that's all you got to eat?
---
Do you like rap music? Do you like rap music that's been playing for 8 hours and it's 3am and you just want to sleep?
---
Do you like raiding? Do you like being stuck in molten core for 4 hours with a bunch of incompetents? 
---
I like AV for about 20 minutes, and then it becomes a chore...and I feel like most people share this sentiment. So the 3rd time in a row that some RPpve server weirdo tries to intentionally turtle a game because "it's fun" I'm fucking gone. And I feel like you people making excuses for his actions, actions that effect 39 other people in the raid, are bullshit.
---
Pretty sure Horde has it faster to Belinda, then Alliance to Galv. But I think Alliance is faster to Drek then Horde is too Van
---
Thanks I need that
---
Ill take a 100% win rate, with 40m - 1hour games - re-playing a game I have already played over and over, for years min maxing everything - spending time with good people and having good laughs. 
---
10 min zergs where people bail on you if someone overpulls the warmasters and then complain so relentlessly about (because lets face nothing is ever anyones fault at all.. it's always everyone else who is bad right?) that the game inevitably becomes a toxic dump ..ill pass on that.
---
Post one log proving it then.
---
For me the game is the journey, not the ending. I want to see and experience as much of the world as I can.
---
If you have insta-queue's and your group queue's at the same time, you will pretty much always get in the same game. Because alliance population is so much lower, they generally have insta-queue's
---
You obviously haven't done AV as alliance with randoms. It happens all the time because people are clueless. The best is people waiting for FW and RH to cap, then rushing to Drek, leaving no one to defend. Horde come rushing from those GY's like orcs coming through the Dark Portal.
---
Which is also not allowed.
---
It‚Äôs venting because blizzard should care about the faction balance in its servers it‚Äôs a crucial part to classic. It‚Äôs venting bc blizzard now only cares about making a profit
---
Is dual wielding or using a two hand better for leveling as a warrior
---
clearly sex and wow are the same thing..
---
Didn‚Äôt seem to the focus of the games when blizzard was a younger company. What a poor argument, ruining your product for more dollars is a terrible thing.
---
what do you gear up for, i just cant wrap my head around it. Just to be more efficient at doing what you have been doing since level 1
---
Not when you consider their queue times.
---
It's just a buff.....
---
Not that I know, fighting in mid severely delays wins /losses which give a lot more rep.
---
Since this game has already been played for 15 years and there are so many guides on min/maxing, a lot of the player base think they have a chance for rank 14 without knowing how much of a time sink it actually is. Since bgs and the honor system are still relatively knew, I dont think people will realize this until rank 14's are reached by the people that dont do anything outside of this game every day. I bet it'll die down when those hardcore players get their rep and ranks for the top gear and move over to WSG or other bgs that come out.
---
Also AV is not meant to be a zerg and take less than 10 minutes. The honor is a lot because it's supposed to be a long objective based game. Sides are already adjusting strategy to prevent the zerg and people are whining about the matches lasting so long because of it instead of actually adjusting their own strategy and completing objectives. Half your team ends up giving up and leaving or just sitting afk until its over while complaining about how they shouldve done the other zerg strategy instead because you suck and they dont.
---
all that work to showcase pressing chain lightning lul
---
I would be a lot more worried about AQ gates and economies at this point, wpvp is dead.
---
Not irrelevant at all. Dal rends is better than BRE so how does your guild benefit from giving bre to waeriors for pve?
---
After this past week it should calm down a bit because people are farming just the Rep for it.  But you might want to get honorspy and that might help you figure out how much to pvp a week at minimum
---
Absolutely! Finally, another genius gets it!
---
I had the same issue, but then after I downloaded the new Bartender4 update the amounts started showing again. Hope this helps!
---
You have no shot at hitting those ranks playing 7 hours a week sorry
---
Kind of defeats the point then, doesn't it?
---
Yeah it feels like awhile but I guess only that long. Yowza.
---
But they had to waste 2 hours to get a 5 minute faster mc run! Duh!
---
Dafuq are you talking about? Paid transfers were in Vanilla. **ADDING VANILLA FEATURES TO CLASSIC DOESN‚ÄôT MAKE IT LIKE RETAIL**.
---
300IQ
---
Yes, quite.  Faster kills means less shifting to heal, which means less downtime overall.  And you can tank in your regular quest gear for fast group invites.
---
Yes this is who I mean.  There's one in each tower (4 towers), one at each GY (3 GY) two with Galv, and a few that patrol around.  Each gives bonus honor and a tiny bit of bonus rep, plus it's that much easier for your team to move around in enemy territory without the risk of getting roflstomped by a wandering elite
---
Businesses like having customers. Customer complaints carry a lot more weight than people who aren‚Äôt giving you their money.
---
I don't think it was claimed as 'new'. It's just one way to do it which is not the 'zerg drak and afk if we wipe' approach.
---
How reading must be hard for you. Paid transfers were adding in NAXXRAMAS. With a 6 month cool down, not 4 months into the game during MC pre BWL.
---
It was hilarious, check the whole thing here

OP is a toxic child. Look through the comments. If you‚Äôre an actual mature guild please move on and don‚Äôt entertain this dude.
---
Torso shortening surgery. I no longer have a torso. I am just legs, hands and a head.
---
link?
---
You‚Äôre a real problem solver. You have ‚Äúmiddle management‚Äù written all over you.
---
Yeah, fuck those guys who are trying to hit exalted so that they only need to pay 640 for an epic mount instead of 720. How dare they try to get something more affordable, despite the fact that they're obviously poor and don't have an efficient way to grind gold.
---
This is likely true. But if you were serious about ranking, would you not have your own premade?  Is it even possibly to rank at 12-14 solo queuing?
---
That's not true. You absolutely can have them on different accounts.
---
It's more money for Blizzard, remember. They're not gonna ban something like that.
---
‚ÄúWhat am I gonna do with these big ass dead titties!?‚Äù
---
PvE servers are horrible and these people don't know what they're missing out on.  Pvp in warcraft allows for emergent gameplay IE. gameplay that was not designed but instead arise from the ruleset of a game.  Example: You're getting ganked by a 60, you call your bois, the ganker calls their bois, until an entire full scale war unfolds with 100s of players.  That is the part of the pvp experience that they will miss out on.  
---
Warcraft was designed to be Pvp, it's at the very core of the game.  People that play on PvE servers are babies that need to be in control 100% of the time.  They play on the 'containment' servers where they've cut a huge portion of the game out so that they can remain in 100% control.
---
Literally came here to say this.
---
Silicone doesnt decay I guess.
---
What point you trying to make?
---
A pve server is the same as a pvp server
---
But without being ganked in the world or capital city
---
If you want to pvp go to a BG, have a duel, or flag pvp and go find the opposite faction
---
I really like Inventorian
---
can you give me a picture of the 20 you have?
---
Should of rolled horde on Faerlina instead. Majority of my guild members are about 30 years old
---
Haha no mate not pissed :)
---
Yes... Co-ordinating when to join a BG and getting matched into the same one (which isn't even guaranteed) is an exploit.
---
It did not kill the endgame raiding.  Larger populations of a single faction on the same realm means a larger pool of talent to draw from for raiding, which means huge swaths of people doing content they otherwise would not if they were stuck on a lower population server.
---
If you'd have played during vanilla after paid transfers happened you'd understand this.  You clearly didn't.
---
wow thanks for that excellent comment, i sure know how to get more of them after saving the reindeer once
---
Atiesh is awesome. The cities are always full and there‚Äôs always tons of alliance out in the world if you need help questing.
---
Hop aboard, we‚Äôd love to have you.
---
Bruh, 10 minute farm breaks in between AV with Astral Recall is the fking best.  This last week I managed to farm 4 Arc Crystals and level fishing 1-225 in the time between queues.  I honestly kinda like that we have a queue time lol
---
Probably but didn't need a dead horse meme to say it. Also I have four totems that have to stay in my bag at all times, or I can't use entire schools of totem spells. Since level 30 I have had 4 dedicated bag spots I never get to use. It's hard out there.
---
Yeah after release it was rough doing that one. The NPCs were either always dead, or if you were lucky enough to snag one it wouldn't drop the thing anyway. 
---
I didn't complete that quest until it was almost grey for me. I did almost all of the other quests in the zone and killed a smith whenever i found one in passing, shit took forever.
---
At this point apparently not.
---
alternately just kill the 2 people who stay behind to defend fwgy and recap it
---
this causes ally to lose basically instantly because they all afk at the slightest sign of resistance
---
Nice
---
blizzard has a storied history of exploits involving people giving them more money being perfectly OK lol
---
You shouldn't use edgemaster's as a Human.  Against level 63 mobs, you would want +6% hit as a human wielding swords.
---
I can't recommend herbalism enough. There are some seriously lucrative herbs out there. I'm leveling a fresh character on a new realm and have around 75 gold at level 34. Over half of it I've gotten just from herbs. 
---
Swiftthistle occasionally drops from Mageroyal and Briarthorn nodes, and a handful of them can sell for a few gold on the AH. People use them for some PvP potions. Most lower level herbs don't sell for a lot, but Fadeleaf, Goldthorn, and a couple others are great. 
---
And by the time you're level 60 you should have found plenty of Dreamfoil and Mountain Silversage which can sell for 40-70 silver EACH depending on the time of week.
---
Link?
---
At least we get one of those back with astral recall.
---
And Ragnaros died 150 days into vanilla versus 6. Do you have a relevant point?
---
Meanwhile over here on Skeram Onslaught usually has an entire raid logged at the spawn location for the next expected raid boss spawn and it's rare for one to last more than 15 minutes. Even at 4am spawns, it'll be dead within 20 minutes at most.
---
They other day they killed Azuregos literally within 5 minutes of the spawn.
---
A few other guilds have gotten kills but mine has basically stopped trying.
---
I also find this interesting
---
- a random dude
---
Pretty sure he meant transfer to another account so have 2 subs.
---
Some people use it as a way to compare themselves against others in their class, in order to improve. Some use it to compare themself against their previous weeks logs. Again, to improve as a player. 
---
Not everyone who looks at parses is an idiot who does it for egotistical reasons.
---
The joke is more of a nostalgia reference then anything. People have been complaining about WoW for 15 years and yet it's still making money.
---
Killing the quest npc, resets the buff timer so you can get buff again within 6 hours.
---
Uh. Not super amazing lol. I just sort of have to soldier through and pretend I'm not exhausted a lot of the time.
---
Salty? More like honest. I'm going to reach rank 6, get the officer tabard and then completely stop ranking. 
---
For one, Warcraft does not reward skill, only a time commitment. Two, I play other games competitively and never intended to play WOW competitively, and in those games you can play a lot less and still rank up if you are good at the game.
---
It doesnt matter how good you are at PVP or duels in WOW, your skill has almost no bearing on your honor rank, its 100% about time.
---
And I honestly dont know why you would want to waste literal days of your human existence grinding AV like that mindlessly. 
---
The items are not worth it. They are barely better than raid gear which is about 1000x easier to get.
---
If you play any kind of video games 8 hours a day you're probably a lifeless loser in general but people who get into challenger and MLG status actually could get into tournaments and even make money off their skill.
---
Literally nobody gives a fuck about the rank 14 except other wow players and even then most people just call you an account sharer and wont give you credit for then work.
---
A few hours a day is one thing, 8 hours a day like it's a full time for virtually zero reward? That's a loser.
---
I was too much of a sissy to delete my hearthstone. The old school shams did it back in the day but my first toon was a priest so removing the HS feels super weird.
---
I'll check on it when I get home from work tonight and update.
---
You also don't know which other rogues have been digging through those pockets...
---
You can get geared fast if you're lucky. Doesn't mean you've helped others get geared equally as you are.
---
Server crashes will also reset it. Happens on our server.
---
I shared back in Vanilla with a friend who was PST, I was EST. We got to R13 and quit weeks after. Absolute burn out. Totally pointless. 
---
Biggest regret was not ebaying the character.
---
I had read increasing +skill reduced glancing blows, increasing threat you're putting out?
---
He had been warned a month ago when he took T1 pants out-of-turn (master looter wasn‚Äôt concentrating) and refused to open a ticket to xfer to the correct person. Obviously something was festering because he was very inflammatory and abrasive during that raid but this guy never communicated his grievances until weeks later where he would bring something up and everyone would be like why didn‚Äôt you say something at the time rather than weeks later. 
---
Something obviously snapped that night which is why he left after winning it. The guy was the most geared by far out of all the mages but was always argumentative when it came to the loot system. 
---
Anyway, good riddance. He made a huge mistake doing this, no guild will pick him up and considering there are only three other oceanic servers it won‚Äôt be difficult for the guild to warn the other servers about him if he does decide to jump.
---
Locks and hunter should get extra bag slot for shards and arrows too
---
Two hander. You get quite a large chance to hit penalty for dual wielding which is made up for at 60 by having %hit on your gear. Using a two hander is also better for aoe (dungeons) due to cleave and whirlwind scaling with weapon damage.
---
That's why he said "don't upvote"
---
fell for the oldest trick in the book, smh.
---
Always downvote these posts.
---
Maximizing personal rep is what matters to me. I'm not stepping back in this version of AV once I hit exalted.
---
IDK why you would delete your hearthstone, it doesnt share a CD with Astral.
---
It definitely is 6 hours, unless they changed it last patch.
---
&gt;What do you mean by moving one character from one WoW classic subscription to another on the SAME account?
---
I assume he's referring to the ability to have multiple WoW subscriptions attached to a single battlenet account.
---
Can't imagine any serious rankers took a transfer anyway. Balance doesn't matter when you never leave the war room.
---
The influx of everyone coming back for BGs and spamming them means a lot of people aren't really moving much in rank for the next few weeks, I'd imagine.
---
Once all the PVEers have their AV rep or reach whatever rank they were trying to get without going too HAM, it will get a bit easier to progress each week
---
Yeah in my guild we usually use 2-3 per MC run depending on our potion cooldown timers.
---
I appreciate the sentiment, but I've tried so many things over the years. It is what it is. I do my best to live with it.
---
Oh sweet - I presumed a brighter screen = more power, but all good.
---
Hi you need to track buffs as a guild or coalition and get them on your own if you want to compete. 
---
Ony buff is not needed for casual guilds though so it's NBD anyways
---
Only thing ony head is good for is neck slot item, don't know why people insist on saving them for the buff.
---
Yeah we have a mage in my guild that logs in every Tuesday, rolls on every open roll, then we see him next Tuesday. He's in greens and tailoring blues. The other mages call him Asmongold.
---
Okay. That is your opinion.
---
Dont forget the ogres in burning steppes.
---
It's a wasted bag slot. You will never use 5 hearths an hour (4 astrals plus HS) I did that exactly once the entire time 30-60.
---
Is this good money, how much did you make per run?
---
Nope. This was never possible in Vanilla. When they released classic instead of using the old vanilla api/script/whatever system they used the modern one and attempted to alter it to match functionality. They weren't perfect, so there were several things you could do now that you couldn't then and others you could do then but can't now. The totems is one that made it through, but they caught it and fixed it in that patch, removing a functionality that was never available in vanilla.
---
Might want to include your class. As a mage you are the absolute king of soloing instances for raw gold, meaning that you aren't dependent on valuable drops. As a paladin you also have a few options for aoe grinds.
---
I remember trying to do that quest and being relatively ahead of the curve and everyone and their mother was doing that shit and the drop rate was awful to boot
---
He only has 3 other servers to go to if he leaves so unless he changes his name as well he will discover transferring servers will not be as beneficial as initially thought.
---
Why do you care about the time zone when you play so little?
---
LMAO @ people who complain on reddit to solve problems
---
If that's the case Blizzard wouldnt ban anybody since no matter who they ban they'd be missing out on the sub.
---
or... wednesday 8pm instead of thuesday 8pm...
---
huge sacrifice, indeed...
---
Nah, that gauntlet is clearly plate...
---
I think that my problem is that I havent been using the auction house...I'm a newer player, so I just sell everything to vendors like green gear, herbs, fish, etc. ;-;.....thanks for opening my eyes to that :/
---
I did, I said I was an enhance shaman. Any tips for that?
---
lol yeah no way he made it out alive after mc'ing that lady...
---
What organs?
---
it's an addon that lets sammy totem timers work again (it's not a full replacement of the old API that got removed)
---
Undeath do be like that sometimes.
---
I've used my hearth twice in the last week because Astral was on CD lol.
---
So I guess different strokes for different folks, depends how often you are using Astral.
---
it's an addon that lets other totem addons work again (it's not a full replacement of the old API that got removed)
---
I always wanted the quest reward, so I always do the hidden enemies chain on every character.
---
You can only use one food buff at a time, but alcohol is separate so you can use nightfin+grog or omelet+rum, for instance.  You cannot stack nightfin + runn tum. 
---
Elixirs stack as long as it is a different stat.  Frost, fire, shadow, and general spellpower ("arcane") count as different, so frost+arcane or shadow+arcane are good things to pop.
---
Our guild makes everyone eat a restorative for lucifron to prevent people dying to cleave dmg
---
Best.
---
As a warrior, when do i need to switch to Protection to tank the highest 5 man dungeons (UBRS, Strat etc)?
---
Focus macro?
---
/thread. Only thing I'll add is if you're truly a noob and plan to heal look into healing addons (i.e. clique) and start using them when you start running dungeons. This will give you a lot of flexibility for key bindings. I have all my healing spells tied to mouse buttons. Don't forget about shift click, ctrl click etc. Also dispelling magic and disease when you get the spells is very important. Make sure to read the negative affect as sometimes you don't need to dispel and can save mana. (I.e. a negative magic affect that only takes away mana on a warrior you can leave) hope this helps and happy healing!
---
Rogue here, can confirm, 100 bars sitting in bank
---
Anytime.
---
Sure, but there are so few opportunities to use it correctly. Either the dps isn't taking a lot of damage, or they're taking it often enough the effect gets canceled early, or they're just nuking and it would sacrifice a good bit of damage to go over and click.
---
Yea, PvE server players are usually terrible in BGs. But that's to be expected. Those types of players don't really have a competitive mindset, they just wanna faff about in the game and chill.
---
Isn't there a +healing mace that has like +84 healing or something like that from Nef in BWL?
---
you can use the buff for other raids.
---
Name and shame
---
haha totally agree with you, we have some like that on horde too :D
---
not familiar with that one srry
---
Every game we've won wasn't because we wall jumped, its really easy to  take alliance base if alliance don't defend at all. I've never seen more than 2-3 alliance on defense ever. Every time horde do it we send a min of 10 people. 
---
The biggest problem horde have is they don't listen and get sidetracked and go for balinda/LTs. I couldn't tell you how many times I would say in raid chat "Head to aid station I'll heal, only a few stay for bal" in a bunch of different ways and I almost always get 3-5 DPS but 0 tanks showing up so we get the aid station but we never have tanks. So we end up losing to alliance who have the opposite problem, too many people zerging and not enough defense. 
---
Recently because horde have gotten higher queue times we've learned to adapt to make the most of it so now I almost always get people to get to aid station, its still only about 5 people but its enough to gap the GY and once we cap it everyone starts rezzing there and we win. 
---
I have a clip where a ton of people listened and as a pug finished an AV in 6 minutes.
---
It all depends how you value your time.
---
its not that you cant beat ony or MC without the buff, its that you can beat it faster, makes your epeen grow big time!
---
The function that tells an addon how many of an item you have was apparently changed. Bartender was updated 12/15 to fix it.
---
shit, yeah you're right. it is westfall. thank you
---
Rod of Ogre Magi goes for maybe 25-30g.
---
Traditional lock picking sets are too delicate
---
Except your rank is weighted against the rank of other players on your server, so if you transfer to a server with far less people ranking, then it gets vastly easier to rank up.
---
Isn‚Äôt left at Belinda faster for the alliance?
---
I almost have 100 ony scales in my bank... check the ah... we will be selling extras lol
---
Sapphiron drape is a dps loss. A +21 frost cloak being replaced is -7 frost damage +17 int. Mages who understand their stats know this. That's like giving up 24 spellpower for 1% crit. It makes 0 sense for a mage who is trying to min max dps. Like, it's a minor dps upgrade for the people still wearing spritecaster cape. Like he gave up 6 damage per frostbolt in order to get an extra crit every 330 casts.
---
Bis for warlocks for sure(because of hit%), and i'm pretty sure most mages that havent had BWL on farm will be getting it for ZG and preperation for naxx.  I could be wrong, someone smarter to chime in about mages.
---
R/popularopinion
---
A lot of people are about to come in here and tell you to not spec prot.
---
But I would say any time after 50 is appropriate.  You really really want to be able to have any 31 pt to use, and stance dance rage retention in arms.
---
I wouldn't recommend prot spec at all under 40 though.
---
Thanks for clarifying! Sorry for posting :S
---
Altoholic is the one I use on Retail for this never looked into it for Classic
---
"Worth it" is only a question you can answer for yourself.
---
What are your issues with your current server?
---
What would be gained from transfering?
---
At such a low level would you rather spend the $25 or spend the time to level again?
---
Will that $25 affect your ability to pay real life bills?
---
These are questions we can't answer for you.
---
If you are financially secure and 25 dollars doesn't make a dent, then why not. 
---
Think of the work you put into X character and ask yourself if that's worth 25 dollars of work
---
Just like almost everybody else here is basically saying: it is completely OK to do this in WoW with virtual money that won't get you into trouble IRL. It is the perfect place for me to let my addiction flourish and see what would happen if I "just did it". 
---
I ended up going from 300g to 6000g in a day, had a blast and I'm not gambling in real life. No worries.
---
Just like I don't massacre boars in real life either.
---
Oh, I was under the impression you couldn't turn in the quest at all if the head was up, even without buff.
---
In the back of my mind I thought of this, but didn't mention it because that's only for the most serious of poopsockers. Like, what type of obsessed do you have to be to transfer just to rank up, then transfer back? That's the height of sad, not even worth bragging about.
---
Nah I was talking about content. Everyone answered well
---
Ya got me, unless....
---
But no seriously this cant be real
---
Multiple separate subscriptions ALWAYS mean multiple separate blizz account.
---
You cannot transfer to different regions. But the US servers are in the same region.
---
It depends on how much you value your time, getting to level 30 takes probably 30 hours of playtime lets say. If 30 hours of your time is worth more than $25 than yes. I name changed a level 14 shaman back in BC because i had put 12 hours of work into him and was doing professions and decided that 12 hours of work was worth $10 to name change. Depends on your financial situation
---
As a dagger rogue I would prio:
---
1. DFT
---
2. Boots of the Shadow Flame
---
3. Tier 2 chest
---
4. Tier 2 bracers
---
5. Prestors talisman of conivery
---
Nef head gives a good reward but everyone will get that eventually so there is no need to prio that.
---
...a-a-and downvoted.
---
üòÇüòÇ
---
You sure they're hers? Maybe they're a fresh pair taken from a corpse
---
There is always an advantage when transferring from PvE to PvP... Everything in the game is easier on a PvE server so a PvE player always has the advantage over a PvP player.
---
Yeah it allows you to turn in the quest so you can still get the quest reward, usually it won't give you (and the rest of org) the buff though if it has been less than 6 hours since the last one.
---
Nah, that's just a poison, they remember all their prejudices.  Wallace was born blind, not a prejudice bone in his body.

---
What is the benefit of hover casting instead of clicking?
---
I was going to do that actually, but I prefer Qing in alterac for the cheap Mana pots and WPL being right there for herbs. But good point, shamans are A/S tier farmers, just behind druids Id say (not counting dungeon farms ala mage and hunter) but Far sight/water walk are OP.
---
Can anyone pm me a link?
---
if you are dedicated to getting rank 14... that paid server transfer can be a gigantic save in time and effort.
---
I don't know if it's truly pre-raid BiS but I've seen some rogues (sword or dagger) get the devilsaur set, and then go 6/8 on the Shadowcraft set for that set bonus and they do absolutely silly damage in that gear. 
---
The downside is that you have to farm the chest off Drakk, and the head out of Scholo. You'll probably need to stack +hit in your rings/trinket slots as you can. But were I running a raid and a rogue in that gear wanted to attend, I wouldn't hesitate to bring them. That energy regen proc from the 6 piece shadowcraft bonus is nuts. (also, it works on druids too.)
---
Alternatively you could look at getting the 3 piece set from the craftable Stormshroud set, and then farming your pre-bis stuff around that. Either way the energy regen proc is a nutty bonus to have.
---
There are always new people leveling. I make devilsaur for people still so this is not true.
---
Thank you, also are there any specific professions I should get as a priest?
---
Sammys has been broken since the bg patch... it doesn‚Äôt track the time of my totems anymore.
---
It's called a bracket leader.
---
these kids lol
---
Ah, yet another person who never read the rules but heard about the rules from someone who never read the rules either.
---
Would you be able to provide a separate guess and estimate?
---
Faerlina :) popular server with streamers so you know it won‚Äôt die
---
Citation please.
---
This is awesome, thank you for the help friend!
---
Imagine being in &lt;Aanrecht&gt;
---
Easily worst alliance guild on Herod.
---
np definitely a good spot to farm them.
---
No you‚Äôre able to have them on the same BNET account.
---
Yeah, the only grind I would shoot for is the full rare pvp set.  That would still take soooooo much work but from everything I've seen is that it takes atleast 3 months starting at 0 honor to get to rank 14, and to be able to do this you need to be playing like crazy. Like quit your job. Gotta play freckin 16 hours a day. Lol I get bored of BG's after 4 hours like you do. However I usually only do BG's about 3-4 nights a week for 2-3 hours.
---
True on debuffs for raid wrt Coa+Corr. 
---
You'd only want to shadowburn if the debuff count was low.  You have to be paying attention.

What a beautiful crotch.
---
That's not true at all.

The ratio of hit to spellpower value scales on how much you already have. 1% crit is better at 20% crit and 500 spellpower than it is on 40% crit and 200 spellpower.

the game allows you to Q for a specific AV number. If the game devs didn't want you to BG with friends why give you that option?
---
So which ones are you going to sacrificr? Wife, kids or job?
---
What the hell is misdirect?
---
IDK about solo and duo leveling but if you want to hit 60 then I suggest run BRD for your BiS gear then Scholo at 56+ for nice xp and BiS gear. If you get those then hop over to Strath for money, Void Robes, and more BiS gear.
---
The Langoloids are coming!!
---
TitanPanel
---
Hahaha Blizzard... fixing anything... Hahaha
---
You'll still be bad at any foresight if you think asking in a public forum / board like this will get you anywhere.
---
-you will 100% still be able to catch up. Once 60, gearing your pre-raid gear will be difficult as fewer people will be running these as most people will be raiding. However many dungeons will still be relevant and as a healer you won‚Äôt have much trouble. 
---
Many of the first raids (MC) will still be on farm for months to come. There are many rare pieces of gear that guilds will want enough to continue to raid these weekly. If you join a guild who needs a priest and they already have established healers who have been getting geared, they will funnel you gear and it should actually be a quick start up. The trick is to show your loyalty by being online and ready when you are needed. Gearing a toon is an investment and they will want to know you  plan to stick around if they gear you.
---
-priests are great. If you go Alliance the best one would be a dwarf as their racial is in high demand for raiding... but in the end play what you want. It a game :)
---
-as for your skill. I would say pvp requires skill. To understand other classes and their weaknesses well and your full toolkit. Even then, grinding rank is more of a time constraint. 
---
PvE is more about knowing mechanics, understanding threat, managing your mana as a healer, and good teamwork. PvE in classic is less of a challenge mechanically in raids then retail as it‚Äôs an older game but still requires 40people to be doing it right and to all show up. Gear is also not as abundant as retail. Don‚Äôt expect to be in full purpled after a month of raiding. It takes time when you have 40 people and you only get 3 pieces of gear per boss, and sometimes that gear sucks.
---
Maybe I‚Äôm blind but I don‚Äôt even see the dwarf in the pic.
---
quick and easy. dl that and drop it in your add ons file same as any other add on. then rename the file and just remove  "-master"
---
Spell cleave.
---
Mage Mage warlock priest and one other.  Often a mage but depends on preference.
---
52 is low for last boss but a spell cleave group usually just clears trash.
---
What level do you recommend starting BRD?
---
I'd punish him for roll in as a hunter. Cases closed, Next!
---
If I've understood it correctly being hit capped is absolutely the priority. I've sadly vendored my Rune of the Guard Captain a long time ago meaning I'm only able to hit 8 and not 9% hit until I get band of Accuria. We have three tanks in my guild, the main tank and I being 9 and 8% hit, and the third tank being at 4/5% hit. It definitely shows, as I it is almost always the main tank or I grabbing threat first off Ony in p3 and me often being able to pull aggro from the other secondary tank.
---
like 18
---
I'm gonna have to go back to IF and look up. lol.
---
Alliance controlled the roaming areas, horde, being the lazy min maxers they are controlled FPs, menenthil, theramore, boats, ironforge, brm. When it came to world pvp horde werent organized they would all just group up in one spot and not move. This is why some horde think alliance killed it in p2 on herod, they just werent the horde that pvped because the pvpers were literally camping alliance in their homes which a pve player doesnt notice any of.
---
Use any totem addon, like samys and then install:
---
This replicates the API that blizzard removed, allowing you to see timers again.
---
You can use a mousover macro. This would allow you to sheep whatever target you are currently moused over without dropping your main target. I believe the macro below will work but if it is wrong feel free to correct me.
---
#showtooltip polymorph
---
/cast [@mouseover, help, nodead] polymorph
---
no 52 is just right for the spell cleave/aoe farm.  you usually do the early mobs and reset.  Hardest part is that people always want 4x mage + 1 priest, but you could form the group.
---
Yet, it seems perfectly ok to completely abuse game mechanics so you can have a completely pointless buff for your MC raid.
---
For the same reason that you cannot use mods whicj translate speach across factions. Cross faction collusion is against ToS.
---
Correct. Most use for MC not Ony.
---
Samys can be fixed with the API replacement addon:
---
I use it myself and timers work again.
---
There is a degree of artistic freedom :) might not be 100% accurate
---
So when you click one time on an innocent normal person who didnt cheat like you have and they die with no effort on your part, does that feel bad? They just instantly die, and they obviously are simply not allowed to pvp whatsoever until they either twink themselves or reach max level, do you feel any guilt about that? Guilt for absolutely ruining pre-max pvp? What is wrong with all of you that you don't feel guilt for ruining other people's games? 
---
I am looking forward to when blizzard once again puts you all in your own horrible little bgs and you all instantly quit when you cant one shot everyone. Gonna be some good tearful reddit posts in a couple years. Arent you all embarrassed about when that happened in retail? Your shallow desire to delete innocent people who did not want to participate in your dumb version of pvp was exposed. You clearly all had no desire to fight other twinks. Lie to yourself more.
---
So two people want to get rank 14, one goes to a dead server and gets it with playing 4 hours/day for 8 weeks, the other is the *hardcore* player on the mega server that plays 18 hours/day for 8 weeks.  
---
Yes... the one that transfers is the *loser*... lolz
---
&gt;It doesn‚Äôt make sense having a name that‚Äôs a bunch of random trash words.
---
Okay, SpoojyCat
---
[you're not even allowed to communicate with the enemy faction, let alone organize the killing of your own faction npc, aka treason to the horde](https://imgur.com/a/kF930k8)
---
With faction imbalances being such a thing I would consider a PvE server. They seem the most stable and healthy although smaller. 
---
Battlegrounds can give you pvp fix. If you dont want the thrill of open world pvp, go PvE. Remember, that thrill comes at a cost when being camped by horde/alliance.

Also it sucks if you are constantly Focus fired down or sheeped / sapped / feared and are dead half the match because you dont have DPS peeling, or going for their own healers.

None of the bloodvine pieces have even a close competitor.  But you can wear them without tailoring, you just miss out on the 2% crit set bonus.

Exactly, Choker FL lasts DPS much longer.
---
Now, look at the date.
---
Nope, the Barov Trinket gets more bang for the trinket slot you are giving up for this.
---
All praise the real Warchief of the Horde Advertise-SP!
---
Yeah I usually always form the groups anyways, and I have a lot of experience with eye pulls. Are eye pulls viable in BRD?
---
Do you have skinning or buy the leather?
---
You on Thalnos?
---
Still, I don't think I ever looked up. : D
---
Coords please?
---
Ironically, the ban on mods that translate cross faction is what people misunderstood to mean cross faction communication was not allowed.
---
What the TOS said was you're not allowed to circumvent ingame measures taken to prevent it.
---
For clarification he wasn‚Äôt poached by any other guild. He has been blacklisted by guilds on the server now.
---
Are you saying the Horde is outnumbered by Alliance or the other way around? I always thought there were more Alliance 60s on Grobb.
---
Nice source, look at the date please.
---
I think there's room for varying degrees of loserness in this hypothetical lol
---
Thank you for sharing! I have done this many times on previous severs i have played. On classic i've only done it a handful of times so far since i'm still pretty broke.  If i see someone 40+ without a mount and i'm currently well off i'll sometimes pay the rest of it for them or give out enchants. It can really turn around someones day... and for me... its really nothing.
---
No, they said they would not be in classic on numerous occasions. They said it wouldn't be fair to add them and then remove them so quickly, they didn't want to force people to do the grind.
---
Show me a top log without godlike rng, please.
---
Have a link? Im certain they said they would not be in. We‚Äôve known that for a long time.
---
If you're assigned to a particular mob, like say in Majordomo fight, you can try this:
---
/target &lt;NAMED MOB&gt;
---
/cast Polymorph
---
/targetlasttarget    (I think this is in Classic. I'm at work so can't test)
---
It sounds like you don't know what the word means. It has nothing to do with popularity.
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metagaming
---
(See the "any approach" part.)
---
Hmm that doesn't look like thunder bluff
---
This is from 2012. It even says old ToS.
---
But they're *real*.
---
Alliance also has a better choke point.
---
If you think Ony buff a pointless buff then I don't think you understand raiding lol
---
so if that was the issue or the case, how would I get round that? make a ticket?
---
The fact that your able to recognize how this is a trap for you is really good, it means you didn't fall too far down the rabbit hole and you arr able to control yourself if you need to.
---
Taking a step back is a good choice and now would be a good time to revisit any CBT you may have done in the past. If you haven't done anything in the past, [here](https://www.gamcare.org.uk/self-help/self-help-resources/) are some free resources which may help :)
---
You need to press your council over this.  There's no universal council or strategy here to give you. 
---
Some GMs are just shitty nerds and people who no true leadership skill who work day jobs flipping burgers and cursing their own boss cursing under their breath, "I'd do it better, HRMPH!"  Some are chill and trying their best, but just follow the "squeeky wheel gets the grease" so whoever complains the most gets loot.  
---
Do you guys log?  You should.  Warcraftlogs will track attendance, rank parses, etc.  You can link when you make arguments, show your attendance is good and you've been with the guild a long time, show your parses/DPS are good, etc.
---
Wait, when you transfer you take your rank with you and can potentially be way above the top player on that server?
---
No, you want mana igniting cord, choker of the firelord, and toep. Those are the 3 best items a mage can get in MC. Those are the items that will help you out a year from now. Rings and mageblade are replaced. You can do without toep if you get mind quickening gem and neltharions tear from bwl. Claw of chromaggus replaces mageblade. You want to be the mage getting priod on that shit because you're still using a witchblade. There are hit rings in both bwl/zg. Don't look at biggest upgrades right now. Look at the upgrades that you don't replace until aq.
---
21.6 percentile average performance.
---
I took some advice and installed the SellJunk addon, which helps a lot as long as vendors are near. Sometimes I have to delete junk if I've been out for a while or I'm in a larger dungeon. As soon as I buy a mount I'm spending money on larger bags. 
---
A while ago I stopped carrying the blacksmith hammer and arclight spanner around with me, and the two extra bag slots feels like a huge bonus. Which is really kind of pathetic.
---
But yeah, between the ammo, pet food, and needing to carry healing items because there's no self-heal power, the lack of bag slots can be annoying. 
---
One other thing that really helped was taking engineering. I can carry a stack of powder and a stack of bars and make ammo on the fly. Burn those two bags slots and I more than double the amount of ammo I can carry. My ammo bag is always topped up. That was a huge win.
---
Could always MC them and explain if they don't do this for you then you will scourge their cities on raid night instead.  No collusion, only tactics.
---
I'm having fun while new content is coming out
---
there is a good epic robe you can make for yourself if you go tailoring.
---
then pair that with a gathering prof, eg herbalism.
---
More napkin math for bigger raid numbers / more gear.
---
BASELINE: Each frostbolt is dealing 800 dmg.  Hitting 90% of your frost bolts (aka 0% bonus hit) and critting 9% of them for double dmg. Total 100 frostbolts:
---
\[Landed frostbolts out of 100\] + \[bonus 800 dmg from critting 9% of those landed frostbolts\]
---
\[800\*90\] + \[(0.075\*90)800\] = \*\*78,480dmg\*\*
---
\*\*5% Bonus Hit:\*\* Each frostbolt deals 800 dmg, hitting 95% of the time (5% bonus hit) and crit remains 9%.
---
\[800\*95\] + \[(0.075\*95)800\] = \*\*82,840dmg\*\*
---
\*\*Correlating Spellpower Increase:\*\* "X" is bonus dmg required to equal 5% hit increase at the 81.5% coefficient for frostbolt.
---
\[(800+X)90\] + \[(0.075\*90)(800+X)\] = 82,840dmg (above)
---
78,480 + 98.1X = 82,840dmg
---
X = 44.444 / 0.815 (dmg coefficient for frostbolt)
---
X = +54.5dmg = 5% hit
---
\*\*1% hit = 10.9 spellpower\*\*
---
what is reasonable about this ?   
---
What are you asking, you need help with something ?
---
&gt; You get quite a large chance to hit penalty for dual wielding which is made up for at 60 by having %hit on your gear.
---
No one gets enough hit to overcome the offhand penalty. They just abuse the heroic strike bug, which also works at lower levels.
---
Um... so you think the inflation rate is less than 4%?
---
&gt;Who else is just waiting for AQ to launch
---
OP, after bwl releases
---
they are a great guild, i'm horde side on Faerlina. &lt;TehBox&gt;   
---
I see yesterday they just did the server first immortal MC run, big congrats if you're in that guild. Whoa is that first in Classic?! Our first MC run we had 12 deaths and i felt pretty accomplished lol.   
---
Once i get my raid core together we will battle it out for future content   
---
Doomtroll  
---
&lt;TehBox&gt; GM
---
Does this exist on the horde in na?
---
To add on to that: at night they turn to Worgen so I usually sell at Ambermill as Alliance once they turn.
---
Sad that people are more concerned about getting a digital reward than actually playing the game to win and have fun.
---
Earthshaker is comfy
---
How is that any different from a fresh lvl 60 who just capped, to a maxed out lvl 60?! They put in time to be the best... should fresh lvl 60s just not queue for BGs anymore?!
---
&gt;It's actually not that expensive at all by today's standards. People are spending Thousands of $$ on micro transactions for pc games, mobile games, and even some consoles...
---
I just want Naxx, and if I'm being more honest, TBC.
---
I never got to play endgame classic but loved TBC for the raiding. So far thoroughly unimpressed with MC.
---
All the top guilds on horde formed a coalition, we all bring our raid teams out and choose 3 players from each guild to go in to the "tag" group which gets the loot and those 3 from each guild can roll on the drops. All other raids other than the tag group go kill the alliance.
---
I mean, that's a completely logical explanation for it. It makes sense.
---
"play your character for most of the week". You mean like 1 to maybe 2 hours before raid?.........
---
What‚Äôs your time zone? Maybe switch to a server in a different zone that matches up
---
Yeah, I'm really keen on not falling into bad habits again. Thanks for the resources :)
---
It's completely relevant.
---
Feel like I'm in the twilight zone... Alliance win 90% of AV games when I play. That's how it's been for me in classic and how i remember it from BC to panda. Was the most annoying part of battlemaster for me
---
Good gear + good rng = great parse 
---
Shit gear + good rng = good parse 
---
If you want to be godlike you need both the gear and the rng lol you have no idea what you are talking about.
---
You sir, you over there! Thank you!
---
k? Link the new one where it says cross faction collab is fine?
---
They get one WM with him without any towers down.   But one isn't too bad to handle.  Horde cannot pull with less than two in the same situation though, and two is significantly harder(more than twice as hard imo) because double WW can be instant death for the squishier of the melee, and with no GYs capped yet it slowly bleeds the horde out until they wipe.
---
I would disagree.  The worst quest in the game to me was Guile of the Raptor in Arathi Highlands.  It took me nearly 2 hours to get 12 raptor hearts, and I was the only one there farming them.  I can't imagine how long it would take if others were there too.
---
Is there a Discord I can join to queue up with you guys?  My Warrior's almost eligible for AV and I'd like to play out some real games rather than grind zerg fests
---
Lmfaooo deathrolling is so stupid the amount of times I‚Äôve won and been ignored is unreal you should‚Äôve kept the gold it‚Äôs a straight scam sorry man
---
Holy shit I think I played with you guys. One of you was named Mut. And you called some random guy Doug. The game took an hour and a half and we won. Good times m8
---
My guild allots 4 hours for raid time.  If we do mc in an hour it looks like we have plenty of time... though i guess we‚Äôre wrong for having fun by speed running.
---
"clever use of game mechanics"
---
How much you want to bed that sometime in the future; we will see paid character customization, race change, and faction change. As much as I enjoy the options, something tells me that Blizzard will see the option to make money and this will devalue the social element.
---
he's wrong
---
Play retail?
---
*slow chant*
---
Reagent bank... reagent bank...
---
Damn I don't think anyone on my server knows this.
---
We've had the buff get fucked twice now by new guilds who weren't on the same page. This would change everything lol
---
Ony buff isn't pointless because any positive to stats is good, but it's just MC &amp; Ony. People are acting like this shit is way more difficult without any of the buffs. By the time groups wait for this, they could have been done with Ony already. 
---
And yes, I understand raiding. I've done it since the beginning, and we ran vanilla raids plenty of times without the Ony buff. It helps sure, but nobody cancelled or delayed raid because they were missing the buff to end all buffs.
---
Thinking a rogue is going to get it before your MT lol
---
Yes. You would have to contact Blizzard Support.
---
First make sure you have to items in the auction house, or bids on any items. Then wait an hour.
---
If by that point you still can't transfer make a ticket.
---
What is the respawn time on the npc?
---
come on westfall! we need more horde!!
---
if else :

---
It's been like that for a while. I started playing this game to clear Naxx, the stepping stones to it are rather boring, but I expected that.
---
Warriors should only be able to change stance in a capital city.
---
Blizzard should have kept the language skill in game. Like, if you read a lot of the \*unnecessary\* lore books you start to understand/speak languages partially...
---
Yeah not mage only. But mages should have priority on it.
---
You're not wrong, I really enjoy progression raiding but once somethings under farm it gets dry quick.
---
Whats new?
---
Scuba Cops, High Charity?
---
I'm having fun with my pace just cleared MC last week for the first time and it was awesome. Still have some dungeons I haven't done completely yet such as Dire Maul and I still need my Hand of Justice so BRD will keep me busy for a while.
---
You could also run your lower level guildmates through dungeons and just hangout with them and socialize.
---
It's a fist weapon
---
I do understand. It's why I know that 40 people can rofl stomp MC in blues without the buff.  If you still need it this many months in, you are fucked later on.
---
This, along with the Barov trinket, would be good to bait Princess' dust cloud if you are soloing Mara without a pet. The downside is giving up damage stat trinkets at the expense of a smoother, but longer, run.
---
Lol, that was all Prieston.
---
Everybody likes thicc and booby so I didn't mind at all.
---
Use the twitch app. It's much easier
---
Enchanting is so miserable without Vellums.  I've had it on every one of my characters (vanilla, WotLK, Cata, MoP) and I can't bring myself to go back to spamming in Trade
---
thats pretty cool, never heard of something like that
---
Materia, but our log got screwed up last night, so it doesn‚Äôt even really count imo.
---
I thought about it really, but it would take a while to get geared farm parses in order to get into a decent guild then raid Mythic...
---
I'm just playing PoE/LoL in the meantime!
---
Those extra adds out front aren't even the problem.  Alliance can pull Drek immediately and only get one WM, the best the horde can do at that stage is two marshalls.  Two mobs stunning ranged, and randomly wrecking the melee with WW's is incredibly difficult compared to one (because of their abilities I would argue more than twice as hard).  As a result horde pretty much has to kill a side of marshals before pulling Vann (and they will still get one marshall with Vann after killing 2!).  
---
Alliance get a super easy mode boss once they get there, but it takes a bitter longer to get there.  Horde have a crazy hard boss situation, archers that actually do something to them, and potentially the adds near the GY (they can be avoided, but are inevitably pulled), but can get there a bit quicker.
---
if they can build tanks and airships, they can craft fake tiddies.
---
Scuba cops has like a 39 minute run which is pretty sick
---
Try this  [https://classicwow.live/leveling](https://classicwow.live/leveling)
---
Sulfuras alt roller here. I went back to my main because of how rotten this server is. Unhelpful neckbeards everywhere. It's like a 90/10 horde split. Griefers everywhere. Murlocs have taken over Stormwind. King Mrrrgrrll is a dictator.
---
to stay left going around bal bunker
---
Never
---
Cool and I can tell you about the time we dropped a head 5 hours after another head and got no buffs. Every 6 hours has worked 100% of the time. So unless it was changed Tuesday, it's been 6 hours.
---
Mining pick and lure aren‚Äôt class specific and on you.  Similarly with pots, bandages, and buff food.
---
Yes, but you can do that either way.
---
Regardless of retail, talking about classic. You think there is more $ spent per month by "casuals" than the "hardcore" players? How much more? Honestly curious.
---
Some hardcore players have 3-5 different accounts (subs), contribute to exposure/content creation on YouTube/Twitch and are driving the health of high profile servers. My point is they are not going to punish the most dedicated portion of their player base.
---
Even if the total dollars from casuals is more, I think my point has some validity. They are not going to go after the "elite" who are breaking minor TOS rules that's hard to prove when they contribute so much to the health of the game.
---
People did get gear, he was just the most geared (by a few pieces) compared with the other mages!
---
Did you even look at his gear before posting this?
---
Tig bitties
---
Queuing into a battlground together is a weird meta?
---
Mine was fixed Monday morning.
---
&gt; Mining pick and lure aren‚Äôt class specific and on you. 
---
I never said they were anything but in my bags.
---
&gt; Similarly with pots, bandages, and buff food.
---
Since hunters have no self-heal powers, carrying pots, food, and bandages is absolutely required.
---
Fellow horde windseeker here. Yep this servers pretty dead horde side. If your LUCKY you can find a 50+ group during primetime. I have a 30 priest but dont know if I should bother transferring or just start a new character.
---
I feel this was definitely drawn by a man.
---
&gt;Some of my friends however, wants to migrate to a pvp server where alliance is more than 50%
---
"I only want to play if I win."
---
nice, we need more people like you that to just log to raid.  Officer of our guild are looking for them, make sure they dont get anything first in bwl! Prio to those staying active and overfarming stuff for bwl and upcoming
---
In classic too? I'm not talking about retail at all, just classic. See expanding point above. Open to being completely wrong lol, just don't see Blizzard going after members of the elite guilds with 3-5 accounts for coordinating with Horde.
---
Classic Doug..
---
Tailoring for the truefaith vestments (a good epic chest you can make) is good then i'd probably take a gathering profession like herbalism to make some gold with on the side. Once you make the vestments you can drop tailoring and level alchemy or something else.
---
Dwarf priest is the best alliance priest as they get fear ward (a dwarf only spell that's handy for alliance raiding), that being said going night elf isn't going to be the end of the world or anything.
---
A trade chat pug isn't going to be much more effective than a battleground queue pug.
---
Kirtonos
---
There's 2, but the more known one became shit because literally everyone would join and then have shit games
---
You absolutely can on PvE realms.
---
2H because until level 30 overpower is the only damage ability you have, and after 30 you can do multi-target damage with sweeping strikes, cleave, whirlwind. Then MS at 40. All of that stuff works better with a 2H. 
---
with that said, some people can‚Äôt stand the slow 2h. if you‚Äôre one of those then go ahead and DW if you find that more fun. 
---
Try out 2h with sweeping strikes and whirlwind in the SM though - it‚Äôs awesome.
---
BoObS
---
Bigglesworth
---
And not milk as much money out of their subscribers. LOL
---
Probably not - you would have a better idea if you knew which bracket you have been falling into these past few weeks within your server/faction.
---
I think most of us are, but enjoy only raiding one day a week while it lasts. Because it only gets worse with every raid release.
---
Consider playing other games. I know once we start raiding 3 nights a week, it's going to be brutal farming so much. So I'm taking 5 of my off days to play other games. The last day is a wow alt day. Raid with my alt and or level a toon to 35 to be a crafter.
---
Good raider regardless of class carry all those things.  Healers also bandage themselves mid fights to ensure they have more mana for the rest of the raid
---
About 90% of those options are "here are some tedious boring things to grind for no reason".
---
I enjoy challenging content. I've got a twink, i've got 8k farmed up, guild is set up for BWL opening day, don't want a max lvl alt, don't want baron mount, we "optimize our MC runs" not really speed runs per say but we're just coasting.
---
Outside of the current set of content there isn't much to do in the game...
---
By the same token I can't ever take resources from people. I have to watch them mine a node. You can say WoW on PvE is easy mode but I've leveled to 60 on both and the only difference is spontaneous fun. PvP is far more fun but I can't possibly say it is any more difficult. On PvP we are able to control large AE areas because any Horde that come near us get shattered.
---
and social skills
---
Not sure about classic, but retail literally has a potion you can take to talk to the other faction, and a few races share a language across the factions.
---
Seems silly for them to have that for one version of the game and then be pissed if the other version communicates.
---
I switched to prot around 50 and didn't regret it. Anger management (and keeping fury points between stances) is probably the most useful tanking skill though.
---
 Use the [self-service option](https://battle.net/support/help/wf/wow/197/834) to move your character.  I think for Ally it sends you to the Westfall GY.
---
God we have people like this in our guild. And they wonder why they aren‚Äôt at the top of everyone mind when loot decisions are being made. Well maybe if you helped the guild a little more, the guild would help you with gear. But this is typical retail mentality Of give me my stuff now when I want it
---
You posted this before and then deleted it for more karma
---
No problem. Thats up to you for whatevers fun. If you're running out of content in the game, make up your own content of what you wanna do. 
---
I enjoy just shooting the shit with my guildmates in runs and if they're excited about getting low level dungeon loot, I'm excited when they get it.
---
Same in MC raids. If I was full BiSed out, I'd still enjoy raiding with my guildmates and getting them geared. Its a boost for the guild not for me and thats still fun.
---
350k? That's bracket 6 or 7 on my server
---
"basically in prebis gear"
---
Sure, if you forget about Lionheart, ony neck, Striker's Mark, T1 gloves and Cloudkeepers, most of which are BiS until Naxx, and if you forget that &lt;Progress&gt; had every world buff despite them "not mattering".
---
Or if you forget that he used every single CD on that fight, including Cloudkeeper's, Death Wish and Recklessness, while other warriors didn't do that.
---
Nice try though.
---
I have moon in my polymorph macro and people act like i'm fucking up every time
---
That is both the dumbest and coolest thing I've ever heard.
---
Kudos to that dwarf.
---
Earthfury. Smaller pop too so there aren't a million people competing for mobs everywhere. I just rolled there this weekend and it's been great.
---
If you wanna play PvP, reroll.
---
We were happy to have low-pop and pve for a nice world leveling experience, but getting groups to do any dungeon has been hard all the way through, and now that we're 60, we CAN'T. Literally days in a row, no one will group for anything, PUG or guilds. If I were you, I'd pick something to change now, because it sucks when your night is "log on to wow, sit in city for a bit, log off."
---
That‚Äôs fair. I guess the idea of having multiple accounts is the core of my amazement. I get that people do it for various reasons, but they all seem excessive to me.
---
Yeah haha, thats a big yikes. My guild has a near raid BiS hunter that parses 95+ on most fights that is almost never in the top 15...
---
Does transfer carry over raid resets? I remember in vanilla entire raids were transferring every week to get double raid loot
---
Gratz!
---
This happened to me as well. Main tank decided to go out with some chick on a raid night. Left binding dropped. It was defaulted to me and now i get the first Thunderfury and have taken the position of Main Tank. Sometimes stuff just works out in our favor.
---
Yes this is true, I prefer to hit Bel and LTs HARD, then recall 10 or so to Keep, while O pushes icewing, SP gy, then onto Van/base.
---
I'm an officer and the raid leader of my guild, we've already have everything set for bwl. Get the fuck off your high horse.
---
tru
---
If you wanna play PvE, reroll. See how easy this is?
---
I have a feeling he got slaughtered just as he was done
---
They have access to Warcraft 3 also. 
---
I kinda got in the mood to play it a bit after the announcement, and I couldn‚Äôt find my CD keys anywhere.
---
I may consider making an alt and getting the bare min 15 HK's a week to see what the floor is.
---
They should have to pay their class trainer to change stance.
---
There is nothing in the tos that says you cannot have two accounts on the same server with characters on different sides. There is also nothing that says you cannot list or buy items on the neutral ah. Personally i have done this as its a great way to make money as some items have wildly different prices on horde/alliance.
---
Great question! The difference is that a fresh 60 has a goal in their life that they are aiming for. That goal is to be a powerful level 60. So if their role model stomps them, it is literally an inspiration. 
---
In contrast, if a twink kills them while they are trying to get to their goal, that is just some pain in the ass person who has used some technique that they want no part of because they have more important things they need to do first.
---
&gt; Because it only gets worse with every raid release.
---
I'd rather have something to do every day than nothing.
---
Level an alt?  Complete all your quests if you haven't?  Farm herbs or ore for gold?  Or maybe even just challenge yourself and try to solo some instances (not sure of your class).
---
Lastly - maybe level an alt?
---
Just 16? I think I found your problem
---
Well it was 11 on mine. Lucky me I guess
---
first i explained to him that using serpent sting multiple times doesnt add any more damage, and to use it once and let it do its damage over 15 seconds. next one was challenging, because i had to teach him how to use pets which IMO is not a simple task especially at level 10. i reccomended he macro'd his pets attack to mouse wheel up, and his pet passive ot mouse wheel down, so to send it on foes he mouse wheels up, and to bring it back put it on down. i also taught him how to teach his pet abilities, so we went out and learned bite rank 2, and then also got his pet taunt! this all in return fixed the melee hunter. he sent his pet in, gave it a few seconds to attack, then he shot from afar. he stil wasnt great but he had learned the basics, 2 weeks later he is level 30 ! :)
---
Play more
---
Wait what are you asking?
---
Possibly a stupid question, but how does the paladin have taunt?
---
I know, in retrospect it seems so dumb not to have realized this, plus we didn't even care about doing it that much. Lesson learned and there weren't hard feelings fortunately.
---
Agreed
---
I agree it's a pointless waste of time, and I don't agree with the rando who turned in the onyxia head as being labelled "rouge" and "a saboteur" without more context (not everyone in the game is here to serve your guild), but it's hardly an abuse of the game's mechanics. If blizzard decided to tie the respawn to this dude, that's just the game's mechanics. Engaging in a diplomatic mission to enlist a dwarf to kill him and make use of this mechanic isn't abuse, it's clever play.
---
I guess he's wrong, but I still think you should take a lesson from this. You should really state clearly what loot rules are in plain English, at least at the start of the raid, instead of just assuming your interpretation of random gamer lingo abbreviations is the same as everyone else.

Happy birthday to me

Happy birthday swiftekho

I had this conversation in my healing discord. In short, priests should not take any healing weapons from BWL. The upgrade is too marginal and paladins have mage blade or pre raid to up from. https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/642957770060201985/648999273727524894/20191126_133106.jpg
---
The song lyric needed to be completed.
---
Yeah, I'd say transfer over but you can't from a PvE server :(
---
Premades with quick AV's is my guess.
---
&gt; I'd like to know a source of on that, every serous rogue/warrior on alliance side has a lvl 20+ horde alt on the same server.
---
Why?  What advantage does one gain this way?
---
I imagine most of them are utilizing premade groups to streamline things a bit easier. Make some connections and you should be good.
---
Link for the na one?
---
If you don't wanna do tedious grindy things make your own fun. Maybe try some RP even if you're not on a RP server.
---
Stand in the middle of Org and hand out NoggenFogger Potions for deathrolls. Bet on what effect you get. You can advertise as a gambling potions master.
---
Maybe you could organize a slow mount parade and show off in the lower level zones.
---
Shit man get creative and do more than what the game offers.
---
Level an alt to just get bored doing the same thing again? No thanks, I've got my warrior and a twink its enough of the same shit, I'd just like to not be raiding MC sooner rather than later.
---
This 100% every time I respec I have to relearn all ranks of FF (feral tank) or Natures Grasp (resto/boomkin).
---
This site only records raiders from guilds who log there raids.
---
Yeah that guy is an idiot.
---
I don't know how ever could have possibly thought that was the interpretation or that it would actually work out better for him if it was.
---
lol @ Pat with Death Wish and MS. The greatest.
---
Yea I thought I was lucky to get a sentry cloak in my 20s, "I'll hang onto this until thinks are a thing and get my epic mount money"
---
Currently hovering between 25g and 50g...
---
Boat to Wetlands, swim south avoiding murlocs on the shoreline, when your map says dun morough, drown and release. Spirit rez at the gy. Take train in ironforge to stormwind.
---
Any Benediction guys out there? Buddies said that's where they're thinking.
---
I don't :) It's just a macro i have that i gave the taunt icon. It will cast blessing of protection on my target of target, so if i lose threat while tanking i use that and the mobb will go back to attacking me again. (unless it's a caster mobb)

Ming Rank 14. The Absolute GOAT.
---
You mustn't have done it during the first weeks
---
ITT: salty horde players mad that the people they're camping inside of ironforge on 80% horde servers don't enjoy being camped inside of ironforge.
---
You also get dinosaur bones for another quest (Roll the Bones) from the same mobs, I finished up both around the same time. What bothered me is that dimetrodons are synapsids, not dinosaurs.
---
You are not wrong, on elysium/lights hope all horde were using the backdoor strat, it actually gives them the edge in the rush game. Not many people know about it yet but you can expect a meta shift when it becomes common knowledge.
---
Forgot how good Benediction was, if only we could trade lol. I'd glady take 29 less healing on my holy pally for 13 more int and 2% spell crit.
---
God I would hate to be in your guild, truly shows that the leadership doesn‚Äôt care about helping new 60s or help raiders get their gear if their raid leader couldn‚Äôt be bothered to log in each day because he has nothing to gain out of it.
---
NO CHANGES
---
standing 19 is bracket 2 which is good enough to hit rank 13. The best way to get honor is to get good solo/duo fights in AV while your team does the objectives.
---
How many hours a day is your definition of 'casual'?
---
This.
---
Thanks gamer!
---
Yeah the fastest way is alliance, but you have to compete so hard.
---
the point of the discord is what you were doing, but with 100-200 people queuing at the same time. this nets you around 25-30 people getting into the same av.
---
My guild actually transferred off Skeram, between Heartseeker and Arcanite Reaper, we with the the Reaper.
---
I think it would have been cool if we could have organized more than just our guild to transfer, enough to balance out Heartseeker.
---
This right here. One of my addons is breaking it but a fresh reload fixes it.
---
Oh, really? Bad example then haha. But hopefully my point got across for OP.
---
Only downside to this macro would be you'd need to change the &lt;NAMED MOB&gt;
---
Dm me homie
---
i heard they r the best PvP healers and the reason y alliance &gt; horde in BGs, and blessing of freedom the thing making warriors the wrecking balls they r
---
Hell, I might transfer there just to take several weeks off my rotation, hah!
---
Can we do the same for Art posts? That makes r/wow even worse of a sub to browse, where it is just a ton of art and no actual discussion about the game.
---
I reported the leader every time someone did that. It‚Äôs crazy that it‚Äôs an option in BGs
---
Alliance. Please dont do this. This sucks for both parties
---
eh, the blasted lands quests are more like the juju farms in winter spring than actual quests, you can farm them but if you want the buff item its more realistic to buy the items from AH  and do the turnin rather than farm all the bits for it (although now with pvp being moved to bgs i guess BL is less of a clusterfuck)
---
your definition of 'rofl stomp' must be a 4 hour MC run then, but some people like to do it in 1.
---
And alliance is rly a nolifer. So stressful, no time between Qs. Pain in the ass
---
Who else is just waiting for TBC to launch?
---
It ain't short, but if you can't get or pay for a portal, that's one route.
---
I hate that guides like these exist.
---
That being said it's really well done. I expect to see more parasites in my AV now lol
---
What word would someone as cool as you have used in its place?
---
Yes, this is true.
---
*laughs in medium pop realm* No lag here! :D
---
The reason they barely moved is because AV came out this week and every single player was sitting in AV all week trying to get exhaulted. 3 weeks from now when everyone has exhaulted on their main and their alt the number of people farming av and honor will plummets. I had 215k honor last week cuz I got exhaulted with AV this week I probably won't break 10k.
---
Should keep a few of the windows dark.
---
I mean, the alliance spawn is definitely better than the horde spawn in AV. 
---
This is not an example of spawn locations favoring the horde...
---
Surprised they were /gkick'd
---
Wow you really don't understand top end raiding at all
---
Were not talking about raiding, and yeah it might have taken that long if we started classic on the same patch as vanilla did. NEXT
---
Like someone else said run to the west side of icewing bunker (where balinda is) and nova the mounted slow alliance coming through the choke. This can slow down the initial Zerg rush enough for the horde to move up and take stormpike graveyard. 
---
If you want to play defense use the teleport trinket after balinda goes down and hold the choke at the base. A few hunters and mages can shut down the rush there as well.
---
Hand of Rag dropped for my buddy on the last night before TBC came out. I was sitting there watching him.
---
He rolled a 98. Guy rolled a 99. Last guy rolled a 100.
---
We were in awe.
---
The only other choice in some of those situations was to not play the game at all. I want to play the game. I pay to play the game. I've been waiting for this for years while I played on private servers. Blizzard's CHOICES were the ones that put me and many others into that predicament. You're being pedantic, of course everyone has a choice in what they do, that doesn't mean someone should be forced into making said choice by the choices of others.
---
Kromcrush, currently split 42-58 horde in favor. I play alliance and it doesn‚Äôt feel too bad in open world now that p2 is over
---
what kind of loser care about imaginary internet points ?
---
Said no one.
---
The math checks out. If he‚Äôs getting a little over 800 thousand on 16 hours if he would up that to 24 hours he would net a little over 1.2mill right in line with what the others are netting
---
I can see that. Eventually that person would be fully geared and stop rolling, but i can see how that would be annoying.
---
4 hours in rocket league is not hardcore.
---
Yep sounds like mid 2000s
---
Twitch is trash. Jesus Christ
---
But that's not Undercity?
---
/who mage 20-60 darnassus. 
---
Copy/paste this and whisper each one: ‚Äúhey can you teleport me to stormwind for free?‚Äù
---
Guaranteed you‚Äôll get there faster this way.
---
Imagine caring about getting "25 likes" for a meme you posted
---
I do it as daggers, no need for prep evasion, just 1 evasion is enough.
---
I'm pretty geared tho so YMMV
---
What? And who is this
---
But that's not Undercity? O_o
---
Just like the WoW subreddit, were moving onto art...
---
It should be at least $20-$25 per month, easily, even with your stats. I personally think inflation is higher than that because the government doesn't account for many important goods.
---
Nah just lose it when jumping down the shortcut to "save time".
---
I actually got out fairly easily after the fact.
---
One weird trick the mods don't want you to know...
---
I'd recommend Kurinnaxx, has a good H:A balance and a good mix of hardcore with more casual guilds.  It's the server I'm on and it's been quite enjoyable.
---
Apparently the guy who made it is working on a classic version but says he's busier now than he was in the past.
---
Mage get power level groups
---
Or get the FP in Menethil swim til you‚Äôre in Dun Morogh zone and drown yourself. Then Rez at kharanos.
---
If you're PST, choose Bigglesworth server! The faction ratio right now is \~60/\~40 Horde. We can use more Alliance players to help improve the balance! :)
---
Can't say I have any empathy for your queue times given how you guys farmed us for weeks now... I would literally die twice going from AH to the flight-master INSIDE IF on a server that is only slightly horde favored. 
---
Getting AV premades with 16 min queue timer is probably impossible.
---
I am in a guild that cleared Ragnaros on start of week 2 of classic. As a way to prepare we did a 36 hour push at the start, then we played 16,5 hours a day the first week coupled with a 24 hour push towards the end. Obviously our "grind" only lasted 9 days and this PvP ranking hell will go on for months, but I genuinely think   16 hours a day might be to low for bracket 14 the three first months or so. People are seriously cutting sleep over it.
---
It's an appreciable buff to make MC easier. If you can manage it without too much of a headache, why not. It's not needed, but same can be said for potions and stuff that make things easier.
---
This has nothing to do with raiding, it's an example of how accelerated/ridiculous the playerbase is now compared to what it was like in Vanilla.
---
I never managed to get a portal I had enough money for, so I said fuck it, I'm walking.
---
Grats on the binding!!!
---
Nah, queues wouldnt be any faster. Queue times are not a product of game length, but a product of population imbalance.
---
&gt;If every Horde tried to get shorter games, they'd all get shorter queues because fewer Alliance would get trapped in extended games..
---
This is just flat wrong. Fewer horde would be trapped in extended games too ya know
---
You find a Horde character with Ironfoe and have them duel a dwarf priest until it procs, at which time they tell the dwarf of your dastardly cross-faction scheme.
---
Thunderfury horde here. West coast server with a really good balance. World PvP before BGs was insanely good and still is on weekdays. Early morning ally/horde leave each other alone in contested areas for questing/farming time.
---
Yeah, that would probably be quicker. I just looked at the map sort of conventionally, but I probably should have died and then rezzed in Khanaros.
---
It‚Äôs not tho. It‚Äôs closer to Belinda than alliance is to galv. The alliance BASE, however, is definitely better.
---
Benediction...about 48 Ally 52 Horde
---
Okay, no idea who is this, but okay.
---
They're not mutually exclusive, either. Maybe you should get a firmer grasp on what 'meta' is.
---
well, it's a clear violation of the Terms of Self-respect, you Horde deserter.
---
Smolderweb has been good since BGs
---
That's not how Blasted Lands works though, there could be 0% of the beast you need or 100%. All the beasts share spawns, you just have to run around killing everything. You make a bunch of cash from drops and you can turn in all the buff quests and sell your leftover quest items on the AH.
---
It is the best server IMO. Great community and balanced factions.
---
As a mage, I always parse gray for the decurses fights
---
16 hours no breaks for nothing. Be one with AV.
---
We've ? I see so many from same server having AV premades vs Horde pugs is so unfair (cause horde cant get premades :D )  In my experience pugs vs pugs end up for longer horde wins most of the time
---
They‚Äôre not bringing an FPS mentality into an RPG, that‚Äôs physically impossible. They‚Äôre playing a Role Playing Game with the plot of a war waging between two factions and thus as players on two different factions, they wage war against each other. It‚Äôs essentially against the RPG mentality of the core heart of WoW which is basically war between two factions.
---
They‚Äôre not bringing an FPS mentality into an RPG, people who choose to play on PVE servers simply choose not to participate in specific aspects of the RPG mentality the game was built on.
---
&gt; btw the best loner class is warlock for sure
---
I've found my hunter to be far easier than my warlock. The hunter pet holds aggro ten times better than the voidwalker.
---
??? You used numbers as a way to show how meta it is.
---
I still got the karma and that was never the point of the post u dimwit ho
---
16 hours a day? Filthy casual
---
Maybe both? Mind control is a hostile spell that puts you in combat with the NPC.
---
Azuresong
---
Ya that call to arms video was a meme. It was meant to be cringe-worthy.
---
Wooosh
---
It still comes down to individual skill and team coordination more then anything. However there is some truth to what you are saying. Paladins make especially BG premades slightly alliance favored.
---
The majority of the top performers don't do any sort of theorycrafting at all. It's a small fraction of people who do and then distribute the knowledge, and not all of them are top performers themselves.
---
&gt;Your arguments are handwaving while disregarding every shred of evidence available. All while providing 0 evidence or arguments in favor of 2hander.
---
It's elsewhere in this comment tree, but BRE/SR do have higher damage on paper than the Dal'Rends do. It's a fairly simple equation, too, as you just add up the weapon DPS of the Dal'Rends and compare it to BRE/SR: `41.43 + 0.625 * 41.39 = 67.3` vs. the BRE's 75.9. It gets a little bit more complex, though in the two-handers' favour, when you factor in the fact that dual-wielding adds a 19% hit chance penalty.
---
There are some other factors involved that muddle things up:
---
- Rage generation is a direct function of auto-attack damage (so a slow two-hander will generate the same amount of rage pound-for-pound as dual-wielding, but just do it in larger more spaced out chunks) -- so it shouldn't actually be a factor.
---
- Unbridled Wrath generates more rage when dual-wielding, but the difference compared to a 2-hander over a boss fight will be less than 30 rage.
---
- The Heroic Strike/Cleave exploit lets you partially avoid the dual-wielding hit chance penalty.
---
- Dual-wielding benefits from more Crusader procs (which can stack, too) thanks to being able to put it on the off-hand as well, though it should be noted that Crusader is 1 proc per minute and therefore won't, on average, proc any more often on a fast weapon than on a slow one.
---
  - This isn't as big as it might sound: on average it'll result in 1 extra Crusader proc per minute, and since Crusader lasts for 15 seconds it'll on average have 25% uptime. 100 strength is worth 200 AP, which in turn is worth 14.3 DPS, which divided by the 25% uptime reckons out to a 3.6 DPS increase
---
- Slow two-handed weapons get more mileage out of the Flurry (and Enrage, though it is not very relevant in PvE) talents, as well as of Sweeping Strikes.
---
All in all though, these differences are relatively marginal and partially cancel each other out.
---
I think the biggest hurdle with 2H is the fact that you can't use Heroic Strike as a rage dump because it'll ruin your rage generation more so than with dual-wielding, and Slam is garbage to the point that you should probably avoid using it. 
---
here's a couple of solutions to this: the first one would be pooling rage until you're near 100 and then dump it by chain-casting Slam, as this way you minimize its negative effects on your rage generation. The second one is using that newfound spellbatching-related Slam exploit that lets you use it without clipping your autoattacks, but I honestly don't know the details of how that technique works.
---
We are still ~9%
---
Unfortunately finding groups for later level dungeons (BRD or higher) have been an issue for me.
---
there is a new mod out that fixes em.
---
If your standing is 19, what is the problem?
---
Lol true enough man
---
You just gotta believe in the heart of the cards my dude
---
You can reset cd ? Fucking hell man never knew that
---
On my Windows task bar, if I'm alt-tabbed from WoW, if someone messages me or attacks me the WoW icon in my task bar flashes red. I'm requesting they do the same for when a BG que pops.
---
Was looking for this.
---
No you‚Äôre not able to transfer between separate subscriptions (commonly known as DIFFERENT WoW accounts, which is why people were getting confused) regardless of them being on the same BNET account.
---
I see this made it to reddit. The editing could be better. Why would they play loud music over my already excellent music? It is what it is! Level 60 soon folks.

I have some more I can link, just at work and this is what I gathered off the top of my head.
---
Yeah, saw the succubus thing but thought I'd chime in seriously anyway just in case.
---
Why not
---
I'm running 6/8 SC and 2/8 BF with +3crit from rings and my bow. I experimented with a lot of gear combinations, adding in +hit NS pieces. For now, that gear combo I'm using is the best for now. I'm not sure if 6/8 NS is going to be worth switching but, once i get those god damn BoEs to drop, I'll test that out.
---
From my experience playing back in the day, I remember seeing rogues wearing SC in BWL. Like I said, I'm not sure when/if NS will overtake SC set bonuses. For now, it seems SC is the way to go.
---
I did that.  Your ignorance isn't my problem.
---
??? I did? This is my first comment in this thread.
---
They're fantastic healers, especially in group content.
---
They suffer when they are solo
---
Jesus you angry man?
---
You can of course do whatever you want to, but if you actually want rank 12-14 gear then you'll have to do what's the best grind or you'll only drop in rank.
---
Unless someone can correct me afaik battleground are not just cross realm but the entire region. Blizzard was too lazy to pair servers for balance and the whole thing got fucked.
---
So you had an in game random queue functioning putting you with complete randoms. You identified the issue with this, and attempted to create a solution for this.
---
\- Invite anyone and everyone to a discord, to queue together. With no filters?
---
Genius move
---
Fear ward is good on a handful of fights and that's it. Stoneform is not a game changer in raids. It doesn't REALLY matter. If a guild is rejecting an otherwise good applicant because they're not a dwarf, they suck.
---
You have a problem with tits but not walking dead casting spells?
---
It is harassment.
---
Over what? Edgemasters still is bis due to the increased glancing dmg. It's not until gloves of enforcement, anni gaunts, or the zg gaunts if they come out that you would replace.
---
so exactly like warriors in that regard
---
Earn more gold is what I am focusing on
---
The "puncture armor" skill that it procs does not seem have the "generates additional threat" flag that warrior's sunder armor has. It likely causes very little additional threat, that being said it still is a very good tanking weapon, the AC debuff will increase all physical damage the target takes
---
Play something else? Thousands of good games out there.
---
Most servers should have at least 1 r14 per week it was achievable.
---
Sylvannas gang approves.
---
According to the chart it takes 2 months to get 13, if you get bracket 14 every week, and 3 months at bracket 13.   I am the top third of bracket 13.

Maybe you can google and search if something like that works with classic

---
Just win your way back up
---
You don‚Äôt get the loch Moran fp but that‚Äôs not so bad.
---
No, all weapons are 20%. The reason slower is better is that things like storm strike are instant and give you a 20% chance at a free attack every 20 seconds. So if I only get to use it every 20 seconds regardless of my weapon speed, then I'd rather have a 20% chance at a swing with the unstoppable Force than the lobotomizer.
---
That's why warriors in raid with windfury totem want slower weapons as well.
---
Farm some more
---
Just quit the game
---
Congratulations, you got less honor and faction per hour than running past, capping a few things and going for the boss, commanders and lieutenants.  
---
Yep, in that same time, you could have lost 100 AV matches and came out ahead.  That's the problem with AV.  
---
Also, it doesn't always work.  We had the alliance try that recently.  We took SH, split their raid in half, destroyed all the towers, turtled ice blood, and then slowly pushed into the base while their O failed over and over to make further progress.
---
Obvious jokes aside, the particle gives the picture some nice depth. Great job.
---
Bracket 14 = 12-13k rp - 0.3%

Bracket 13 = 11-12k rp - 0.8%

Bracket 12 = 10-11k rp - 2%
---
Bracket 11 = 9-10k rp - 3.5%

You need enough players to get those %

Based on what I know, Bigglesworth does have pugs that clear full MC 10/10 weekly. I personally do not run pugs as I‚Äôm in a raiding guild.  But I‚Äôve heard there are good options.
---
Parsing and clear times are important to a lot of raiders/guilds. World buffs are very important for that. People have found an extra layer of complexity to add longevity to playing a game which we all enjoy, what's wrong with that?
---
Except the fact that you can already PvE on PvP servers?
---
Just stay on your easy mode server, bud. You‚Äôre safe there.
---
Take my downvote
---
Thank you, I'm having a blast!
---
But leaving the BG earlier = you get in queue faster.  Sitting around to farm HKs may be better for horde than it is for allies, but it's still less efficient than ending the game earlier.
---
Maybe don't get a power bank or bigger battery then, if the plan is to connect more with nature adding the ability to play wow all day may kill that plan!
---
Skin falling off but those tits are perky af

Searching "Night Shift" on warcraft logs brings up 3 guilds that are raiding. Probably plenty of more night shift guilds who don't name their guild Night Shift too

You could play classic wow on your microwave if you didn't give a shit about it looking terrible
---
title explains it all.
---
Why wont u stop complaining about people ''complaining'' u grumpy grandpa bitchboy?
---
Yeah we've gotten real fucked on caster loot over the last 2.5 months.
---
Feels good to be in a guild that prio's mageblades to warlocks.
---
Work 40hrs a week and have a wife and kid, this game really isn't time consuming unless you're wandering around aimlessly, since there's nothing to do.
---
" Yep, in that same time, you could have lost 100 AV matches and came out ahead. That's the problem with AV. "
---
Yes.. this is the problem with AV..
---
I really don't understand why players try to maximize the efficiency of AV to such a degree.. that they never want to go back?  There is nothing wrong with min/maxing..but if it comes to a point where you loath the very thing you spend hours each day doing... is it really worth it?  If the game turns them off that much that they simply can not stand to enjoy this massive BG blizz designed for us, for more than 10 min at a time.. is this really a game worth playing for them? It seems like they want an Idle-ish Mobile game at that point. "Don't you guys have phones?" Once you grind out these quick zergs, what is left? What is the AV end game here? Grind out rep and simply write the entire BG off?  
---
I feel this type of mentality of 'zerg everything' is one of the largest reasons each additional expansion got less and less fun..the whole reason to 'bring back classic' was to play the game how it was originally designed to be played no?
---
Oh nice, I didn't see that one when looking through the boss drops. Looks like it's a trash drop?
---
It's def not nice and all but some context wouldn't hurt you know. How do we know you don't actually deserve it? (prolly not but you see what I'm trying to say)
---
so you didnt play shaman in classic. yet giving your opinion on shaman in the classic wow subreddit...
---
well that is good news thank you!
---
I agree 100%. They are gonna suck as much money as possible out of classic. If they cared about maintaining the integrity of the game and it‚Äôs social atmosphere they wouldn‚Äôt have done what they did in the process of making retail.
---
Far from it eh? Ever think about not being so addicted to a game where youve farmed the majority of of the content before 75% of the rest of the players? 
---
More power to you that your life affords you that kind of opportunity, but i honestly have no idea what you think a bunch of people on reddit are going to tell you when you post something like this other than maybe take a break because the amount of hours you've put into the game in such short time is probably unhealthy.
---
It will run on anything. You just have to lower the settings.
---
He‚Äôs already playing 16hrs per day. He has two full time jobs playing wow.
---
I don‚Äôt think you understood why it almost killed my soul lol. 
---
Wasn‚Äôt because it was long, was because it was mad boring and repetitive
---
\&gt;using ony drop on prime time on most popular raid day on the biggest mega server in EU with huge horde imbalance as an example
---
But sure you are right. Anyone who says that classic is dead unironically is brainead. Still there are plenty of servers that are completely ghost towns before 4pm and some are relatively dead even during prime time especially if you are on the unfavored side.
---
And the popularity during launch was something monumental with all servers having long queues that compared to that the downtrend is very evident. Which also is completely expected since retaining that amount of players is unrealistic.
---
Yup. Back in my day on Hydraxis there was a guild named Sumlime or submission.............something likethat. All aussies.

whos the douchebag in this? and why is he a douchebag?
---
exactly. "i dont think 2h shaman is good in classic, but i never played it" lmao
---
I love my paladin. Just me tho, I find mage entirely dull at a core concept. Considered making a lock eventually. At the core class concept I find paladin and druid the most fun. Such high class fantasy
---
It depends? under exactly what circumstances is 2100 equal to nothing?
---
I thought it was clear that Greatfather Winter worked for Smokeywood Pastures which is a Goblin enterprise out of Booty Bay.
---
Yeah my friend plays on a really old Mac laptop and has to have the graphics set at like a 2 or 3 but still runs it fine and enjoys it.
---
You hear more sheep these days saying 'WoW cLaSsIc iS dEaD' than people actually claiming it's going to be dead
---
dual wield isnt a talent at all in classic wow. which is the sub you're posting in right now.
---
Feel your pain mate ;)
---
Because that's the way it is.
---
Yes. That's right
---
Don't we have the pre-BC patch talent trees?
---
You say those things, as if they are a positive for everyone... That just sounds fucking annoying to be focused on something and suddenly you can't do it and their is fuck all you can do about it, and have to get a bunch of people together to help you do this one thing. And vice versa when you are called on you gotta go out to the middle of fucking nowhere to gank someone for guildies or whatever.
---
You see fun in what I see as tedious and annoying barriers from what I want to do.
---
&gt; Had the Mageblade drop last night... went to a Healing Pally. Not sure who else was being considered. 
---
I would ditch that guild if I were you, any guild that unironically loot councils mageblades to paladins over mages and warlocks does not know what they are doing and will collapse in AQ / maybe even BWL
---
What‚Äôs the best way to host an anonymous spreadsheet for officers to contribute without compromising their personal identities?
---
is the video dissing the guy in the video or the multiple voices talking?
---
The source is logging into wow, selecting a PvE server, and making a character on both factions?
---
This would be big for me if the answer is yessss... &gt;,&lt;
---
He's not doing it full time, he is still sleeping at night.
---
Seems legit. I'll try it out tonight.
---
Can the low levels just stand at the entrance and receive the XP or do they have to follow the lvl60 through the dungeon?
---
There's no reason for it not to be added other than Blizz refusing to commit the resources to implement it (i.e. it's not gonna happen)
---
Incendius is great. Well balanced
---
You remember the weirdest things.
---
What? What I said was sometimes its 2100 honor..sometimes it's over 5k..
---
I'm glad you liked the video :) And 12 min is not bad, your still hitting the cap of 5 runs per hour with that.

do you realize how stupid that is?

This is why I PUG

No, I broke the dam

Bro - a Tauren calling a troll hunch backed? Seen your back lately?!

You did not.
---
Sell, the mad dungeon rush is basically over so new gold entering the economy is happening at a much slower rate.  High prices cannot be sustained if relatively no one is out making money.  For the most part there isn't much to do but raid-log so I see a deflationary economy in the long term.

First dwarf priest to show up without pants on while holding flowers gets an escort. The second dwarf priest to show up without pants on while holding flowers? You don't want to be that guy.
---
I don't think everyone wants R14 just for a "video game title". The rewards are pretty good.
---
Or you can turn on PvP and be ready for anyone to come up and take a shot at you.
---
still working my way to 60. Shaman is 52, hunter 45 and rogue 30. Not really in a rush, enjoying the game before I raid.
---
What‚Äôs bad about this?
---
Google docs
---
If you manage to coordinate 15 people in AV you shouldn't lose any games no matter the strat lmao
---
EPGP all the way
---
Don't skip the chests I got Shadowfang from one.
---
May want to read further in this comment chain to realize im not stating what you think im stating.
---
&gt; And Horde quit playing it completely.
---
Of for sure. I remember the two hour queues because I had to use script editor to write a command that made me jump every few minutes so I wouldn't get AFK-kicked while waiting for the queue to pop.
---
Faerlina :) tons of Power leveling guilds too such as Faerlina unchained which bounces at 900 members (before purges) with 150 online
---
&gt;Tauren are literally the best looking class in the game.
---
Lol moo
---
It's actually a bad strategy to wait for 60% mounts unless half your raid is comprised of them
---
To kinda go off this, I am in a similar situation. Human war with Edge but I am using Deathbringer axe (because I won it and it beats trashblade)  from Ony. Would going 9% hit and not using Edge be worse off then Edge with 6% because of wep skill affecting white dmg?
---
It takes a bit to update sometimes, it will show up eventually
---
Delete this
---
Drama in a 15 year old game, yikes!
---
The guild leader Phaded keeps calling the streamer who I believe is in this guild obscene names.
---
Products and services especially those relating to entertainment are based upon what a consumer will pay in regards to what will provide the producing company maximum return on investment. There is not a 1:1 correlation between inflation and the cost of a WoW sub.
---
I‚Äôm even cool with earning that honor. I‚Äôll have to check when I get home, but I think I‚Äôm at about rank 3 with 300,000 honor points.  If I understand correctly I‚Äôm at like 350 or so.  I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs more than a few grinding hard for honor on my server.
---
your "legal action" means you get to cancel your preorder.
---
You got to be kidding me? No one deserves to be called those obscene names. That is just wrong.
---
So why do you do it... to be better at killing players? 
---
It is a game. A lot of people are just experiencing the content and doing what they want. You are over analyzing one side and failing to see the exact same argument can be made about your ideal way to play.
---
&gt; Sad that people are more concerned about getting a digital reward than actually playing the game to win and have fun.
---
Which is a rewarding feeling from playing a digital game...
---
OOOOH i thought we were trying to say the streamer is toxic and he seemed totally chill to me haha. and why did they even blow up on him in the first place?
---
Damn makes me think there could be a market just selling herbs to people from other realms in BG‚Äôs ^^. Probably not possible though I guess?
---
inb4 never gets the right binding
---
you're alliance and you lost 21 times??? lol
---
For my trip to R14, in original game, getting max honor per HK was what seperated me from those running pre-mades. Could just solo queue WSG and pick off people and solo them 100-0 without any other Horde around to split honor with. Personal deaths didn't matter to me.
---
I figure this method would work better thanks to battlegroups bringing in fresh players who aren't on the daily HK diminishing returns. I was on a PvE server with a huge pop imbalance, with over 50% more Alliance than Horde, and could hit 800k without that much time investment.
---
Far from addicted, I'm horribly bored of the game.
---
The preorder gives you beta access
---
what about rep?
---
I played Classic on a Windows 10 tablet from 4 years ago that still runs at 60+ FPS even in dungeons and raids, the game is 15 YEARS old, anything can run it, it's great!
---
You're missing the point.
---
Ali can pull drek while killing or not even killing one warchief. So it evens out
---
Clip was deleted by the original streamer for fear of having his channel banned, that‚Äôs how bad Phaded‚Äôs language was. The streamer is a great dude so I don‚Äôt want to do anything to get him in trouble. Sorry everyone but I hope that the message at least gets across to avoid Funhouse and avoid Phaded. This isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúscorned lover‚Äù type scenario where I didn‚Äôt get something so therefore I‚Äôm posting this. I genuinely want to help people avoid this person because I‚Äôve never in my life encountered a person that awful. At the end of the day, this is a VIDEO GAME and a 15 year old one at that, gotta enjoy it for what it is and allow others to do so.
---
Im already exalted so i can‚Äôt tell you
---
Yeah this post is made to seem like the dude who turned in the head is the bad guy....why? Becusse he wanted to finish his quest? OHH no all of raid night is comepeltey ruined now!
---
It's because the alliance base is curved around the corner, so the distance from start to base is still about the same.
---
[https://i.imgur.com/6CnTjFN.png](https://i.imgur.com/6CnTjFN.png)
---
PVE AH
---
is there any mirror?
---
In the contrary, it is actually easier to find MC spots/pugs now that most people have their gear from it and the MC progression stage is over. Everyone is farming it now with complete ease, basically handing gear out to those that need it.
---
I can‚Äôt find anything confirming whether or not faction changes for Classic?? It said in the announcement that they are allowing that, but the option doesn‚Äôt show up in the shop, and we want to turn our horde characters over to alliance. Please help.
---
That's where you're wrong. I know *exactly* what I'm talking about.
---
You're talking about an extremely niche case which *might* eventually become a concern in the Naxx patch when everyone is pushing the limits of buff stacking.
---
Nobody cares about this in MC, and it's certainly not something you tell someone who isn't even 60 yet and will in all likelihood experience raiding for the first time through a random pug, not some guild who's trying to push the limits of speedrunning. 
---
If the buff cap ever becomes a concern, it will be for an extremely small fraction of the playerbase in an extremely niche situation. It's not something 99% of players even have to think about right now.
---
Making blanket statements like "putting a hot on a tank in a raid is a terrible idea" is just silly.
---
So without the head buff the whole raid night was ruined?
---
Yeah, but unless it's following them around, they're probably still not going to use it. I say this as a former main spec healer and now a main spec warlock. Lightwell was a neat idea, but the execution needed work.
---
That's oddly low, I wouldn't even bother making them for that kind of profit
---
me too pls. r7 almost full bis gear ofc epic mount
---
/s?
---
I've lost the last 5 in a row.
---
It sounds to me like you don't after that shitshow of a previous post.
---
I'll see if I can dig through old files when I get home from work.
---
So you don't have mirror?
---
Yeah I'm sure you feel really good like you really accomplished a lot. Great job, congratulations on your great accomplishments. I am just wondering why you don't feel horribly guilty when you destroy the game for innocent victims who are now unable to pvp because of you until they get into the 60s. You ruin the entire concept of pvp battlegrounds for them and you don't seem to care. 
---
Blizzard destroyed your concept of twinking and every player except for you people cheered and laughed at your pathetic misery and you learned nothing from that. Oh well I guess it will happen to you again and we get to laugh in your face for a couple months again, but what a tragedy that we all have to suffer until then. Very sad.
---
Sweet fancy Moses! That is cheap. 1g here on DD.
---
&gt;NOOOOOOOO SOMEONE SAID BAD WORDS OVER THE INTERNET AND RUINED MY SOCIAL/LEVELING GUILD NOOOOOO OMG WHY GOD WHY DO BAD THINGS HAPPEN TO GOOD PEOPLE NOOOOO WTF WHY WHY WHY IM SO FUCKING MAD UPVOTES TO DA LEFT XD
---
&gt;The reason slower is better
---
You're both kind of actually on the same page here. Except you're saying "slower is better" when you actually mean damage range.
---
Slower will generally have a better damage range. But not always.
---
It was to a lot of people a week ago when you could get yelled at on Horde for not just killing every lieutenant/commander you could until Ally inevitably won so you could trade as fast as possible.  I'm personally very glad the meta has changed.
---
Also, I wish we had server-only battlegrounds or at least battlegroup battlegrounds.  I play Horde on Pagle and don't know the potato guild.  It would be fun to be able to face them in BGs.
---
They are kind of a waste for troll with bow or dwarf with gun. 305 weapon skill gives you 3% hit vs lvl 63, but 313 doesn‚Äôt give you any more.
---
A lot of PUG raids going on Thunderfury alliance side, for MC and Ony. Stories of non-60s getting gear from them too.
---
I played priest to 45 or so on it, and found a number of players who knew their class well and weren't the type to be too competitive (nor the toxic competitive type that would berate a casual who didn't know how to play). People were pretty chill about deaths, taking them as a classic experience. Had some lag issues with being able to chat, but nothing moving on screen, and needing to restart, but that might have been my own connection.
---
Some stats:

Seemed to be a tank shortage for 5-mans, despite the number of Warriors.
---
This is what wows all about brother , love it
---
Excellent, thanks.

You're not wrong....but neither is some random who wants to turn in Ony head whenever he feels like it.
---

Doesn't add up.
---
You don't want to be putting out your dots during your ToEP. The ticks are amplified if you dot before popping it.
---
It will take a lot longer to get rank 13, if I only get bracket 13 each week.  Like 50% longer.
---
Pretty good advertisement, NGL.
---
Yea what a bunch of assholes for not participating in cross faction collusion and PvPing in their home city. /s
---
I think the kind of player to dismiss world buffs like that is not the type of player that will be clearing MC in 1 hr.
---
Not bad at all. 1g a pot here on DD server. Certainly a game changer if you can chug 10 free actions a match vs 1 haha.
---
Head was placed at 1pm.
---
Moon is always, has always been sheep. Across numerous private servers, across numerous retail servers and expansions. What weirdos are you running with that disagree, because they're completely wrong and need to learn better.
---
Paladins are strong duelists, but they still lose to good warlocks/spriest/mage/druid. As a paladin, you really need to have your gear &amp; strategy down for those matchups
---
Yeah I am, thanks.
---
Literally the same shit you do on PVP servers, with a very brief exception having taken place in November when there was honor, but no open world PVP. Obviously when everyone is blue you can't do roaming gank squads, so PVE players did Hillsbrad.
---
Nothing incited the blow up, that‚Äôs what this Phaded dude does. Loses his mind on people for no reason.
---
Right? No rules in love and war!
---
I still have prio on the Right binding, as i am now the main tank. Most gear has been funneled to me at this point. He went Fury/Prot and i do all the boss tanking now as Deep Prot.
---
Yep, for an unknown reason it‚Äôs now a pain to win as PUG on alliance side, it‚Äôs been the same for all my guildes today. After galv it can be very chaotic and then it‚Äôs done once too many people die
---
Don't. 
---
305 puts you to 6% hitcap
---
315 puts you to 5%.
---
So anything about +5 weaponskill is basically useless for hunters.
---
I actually respect that.
---
But first make sure a rezzer has soulstone.
---
I love that alliance complain that they need to join a premade or they lose to horde pugs lmao.
---
13 bucks for anyone that has a job is practically nothing, but when you take the amount of people that are playing the game and multiply it by 13 bucks, you get a big number and that is monthly. I know they have costs in terms of employers etc to pay, but it's really sad that practically none of the money is going in to making the servers better.
---
I don't for the life of me understand how it's possible for a couple bums to host a server in russia and crowdfund 2,000‚Ç¨ monthly and make it run smooth as hell and having 15,000 people online concurrently. There was never lag in big fights or capital cities while popping heads like there is on classic now. 
---
Please someone reply here why this is? What is blizzard doing different? Can't they ask the private servers how they were able to come out with so good servers?
---
Really? I've been tanking BRD runs pretty much non-stop since lvl 53 or so. What role are you trying to fill?
---
It's important if you want to log.
---
This is pretty fucking rich given the "PVP" meta right now is grinding NPCs in a battleground against the clock.
---
There is √† beta version with keyring support
---
Don't jinx it!
---
Could use an invite.
---
Thank you, I was thinking going high pop so that there‚Äôs more of a chance to find better players cause sounds like we‚Äôve had similar experiences. But going low pop or alliance sided servers as horde might be something i‚Äôll look into as well.
---
pick pocketing mines huh?? im gonna try that right now sense im in a long ass AV atm.
---
Ty!
---
Look at twink items. Everyone thought they were a market genius and planned to hold them until bg‚Äôs released and now the market is flooded.
---
Unfortunately not
---
Yes you're right, now we're writing things out and announce things again before the raid starts to be safe. Thanks for your response
---
hmmm, clever karma ploy.
---
My pc is 9 years old and runs dark souls 3 (I upgraded the graphic card but only to a level I could‚Äôve gotten back then but was useless 9 years ago)
---
Important goods, you mean like a wow subscription that hasn‚Äôt increased in price in 15 years? Sounds to me like the data reflects 0% inflation. 
---
What goods did you use to buy in 2004 that now cost 30% more?
---
If you aren‚Äôt in a socialist state like California gasoline for example is cheaper, now, than it was is 2004. You can buy a dozen eggs for 80 cents. The average price for a new car still hovers around 30k (and quality/features are better than ever, compare a something like a Hyundai Elantra from 2019 to a BMW 3-Series from 2004).
---
If honor spy is correct our top 1 got over 520k honor, and then the next couple of places were in the 400s. I was around 200K and (again according to honor spy among the 800+ people scanned) was put around the low 100s and rank 8 or 9 kind of range.
---
I didn't look to see what my actual rank was at the end of it though.
---
He's posted this like 5 times. I'm fairly certain he's just "explain pls" Trolling at this point.
---
horde outnumbers alliance, so they cant pick and choose their queue pop times
---
that makes this coordinated stuff way harder
---
I‚Äôve checked like 4 days in a row, several times each day and not 1 on ah. Weird!
---
There were character ‚Äúcooldowns‚Äù on transfers. How would this have worked?
---
Not many people are... Which is why there are less than 20 on the AH.
---
Yeap. It has a cool down of a few hours.
---
I do. Go cry somewhere else
---
Yeah those people literally said "let the alliance win" so their opinion means nothing to me.
---
It's important if you want to log out?
---
Yeah, it's not like you don't get sent there at like level 12 anyway.
---
vs L63:
---
- 300 skill = 8% miss (-1 to +hit%, need +9% to hit)
---
- 301 skill = 7.8% miss (-1 to +hit%, need +8.8% hit)
---
- 302 skill = 7.6% miss (-1 to +hit%, need +8.6% hit)
---
- 303 skill = 7.4% miss (-1 to +hit%, need +8.4% hit)
---
- 304 skill = 7.2% miss (-1 to +hit%, need +8.2% hit)
---
- 305 skill = 6% miss
---
- 306 skill = 5.9% miss
---
- 307 skill = 5.8% miss
---
- 308 skill = 5.7% miss
---
- 309 skill = 5.6% miss
---
- 310 skill = 5.5% miss
---
- 311 skill = 5.4% miss
---
- 312 skill = 5.3% miss
---
- 313 skill = 5.2% miss
---
- 314 skill = 5.1% miss
---
- 315 skill = 5% miss
---
It's usually half the raid, and having half the raid never make it to Drek is a loss.
---
Not to discredit your struggle (it sounds shitty) but \*fuck\* that 30% BRD drop.  The fat fucking ogre only spawns 1 in 6 times, currently up to 58 Arena runs and I haven't seen it once.
---
Come to Windseeker.  Good balance, nice pop level.  Plenty of guilds recruiting.  Look up Chaotic Neutral if you‚Äôre a priest, Druid healer or boomkin or healing paly
---
You also need to start logging when entering a raid. Downloading an add on called AutoCombatLogger will do this for you so you don‚Äôt forget.
---
During my grind to exalted on my rogue, I did not see the Alliance summon Ivus once. I saw Lokholar four times. One game, the Horde used a strategy similar to the one you outlined, and it was a blast. Makes it really easy to ignore the whiny people in bg chat who want to optimize all the fun out of the game when you're escorting an ice god into the enemy base while he congeals their corpses into his own body.
---
Don't pop your ToEP until you see 5 stacks of shadow weaving. Put your dots up before you ToEP. Make sure you're casting it between mechanics so you lower the odds you have to move or rebanish (eg right after a dampen magic, living bomb, physical shield).
---
If it's a long fight and you'll have to lifetap, try to sneak in a tap if you don't have enough time to finish a cast before talisman expires.
---
I‚Äôm on benediction and there are lots of great alliance guilds. I‚Äôm in Westfall Park Rangers. It‚Äôs a pretty chill group run by great, fair officers. 
---
There are a fair number of pure leveling guilds too that you could hook up with.
---
I‚Äôm Davion, paladin. Message me if you guys want an invite if you decide to roll there.

Ok mate.

Dude I totally get that, arena is pure rng struggle for a lot of people. I was referring to boreal mantle. I tell every one of my mages I'll farm their prebis with them. The belt Is a 7% drop rate roughly, I'm not that unreasonable lol.

Oh, so you literally didn't read the post? Great job!
---
Same. .....
---
Totally upvoted before i read the edit, and yes.
---
My work laptop runs it and it doesn't even have a dedicated GPU. You're good!
---
Because then you could level to 69 without fear of getting ganged and then at 60 transfer to a PvP server and gank people. That sort of thing.
---
Stop using horde strategies against us.
---
Please explain
---
I mean kinda, playing any game that hardcore isn't for me new or old.  But everything that can be done in classic has been done, and perfect strategy on how to do it can easily be googled. Newer games haven't been "solved" so there is a bit more of an accomplishment.
---
Every time you respec it costs 5g and increases by 5g every time you respec again up to a cap of 50g. No decay.
---
Clearing is already easy, its all bout dat parse
---
In what world is MB better for a mage than a warlock?
---
Youd have to tailor your spec for each encounter. You can run around with 250 shadow res for example and all a spriest can do then is cast smite.
---
Also, full ret can really pack a punch when fully geared, and ret reckoning is a rogues worst nightmare. Rets biggest strengths are access to healing/dispels, immunities and 2 fairly strong instant cc options. The drawback is that their damage output solely relies on command procs and crits.
---
I started Classic just like you in August, as a complete newbie. By the time I became more and more aware of how nooby I was but it was fine, I kept learning new things and had a lot of fun. Now I am at the point where I am level 55 and to some degree start regretting my choice of race. I'm a Priest too and only now realize how nice the Dwarf's racial spell is, I still love my Troll though. My point being you might thank yourself later if you picked a Dwarf now but might enjoy the game less in the beginning, which would be kinda sad too.
---
Ahhh ya that's much easier but does require convincing people to go to the vault. On one of the arena reset runs 3 manning every 5th run we cleared to the vault to get this guy since we were way ahead of the timer.
---
What gear can a rogue get for being exalted with AV?
---
Take this shit to LSF
---
Can confirm, Ouro is a super doucher.
---
Awesome !
---
I'm sorry if me having a conversation on the internet with someone else ruined your day.
---
Yea guess I assumed people weren't still relying on 15 year old memories to form arguments. My bad.
---
I actually never asked for peoples opinion or suggestion. I was asking if anyone else is just waiting like I am.
---
Unfortunately, I think you need to learn how to read.
---
Because if you wanna play on PVP server you gotta put in the time and suffering leveling through one
---
I've been getting around 4k healing a fight from it on fights with intermittent AoE damage (ony/rag/luci come to mind), not bad for 1.5 seconds and 350 mana, although not "full" 8k potential if people use it and no heals override the HoT and no double clicking to waste charges and no damage breaking it... that's definitely a pipedream.
---
But I think the quality of player is higher and people aren't staring at their floor cause of framerates, so it's pretty useful.
---
And it means I don't have to cast Divine Spirit :3
---
Ouch, can you trade plans after they've been given to you? I managed to trade BOP gear before atleast.
---
Then why post?
---
It's pure laziness dude, also if you saw them in AV, Edgemaster's is a good choice there.
---
weird way to spell "perfect solution to all faction balance issues if paired with a faction queue"
---
so what, this whole honor system is big pile of shit, av is big pile of shit if youre doing it for honor, thats why it was changed so many times after vanilla, rank 14 means nothing today, aswell as raiding naxx, because everyone knows everything
---
... So it would seem
---
good analysis
---
Death rolling is a thing? Lol,  I thought everyone pretty much bailed if they lost the roll
---
Now is the perfect time because you can snowball afk people in the tunnel out of there so they get nothing but a deserter debuff. I hit exalted and just spent an hour doing that last night.
---
Frog Vendors
---
I wasn't looking to be of worth, I don't need that from reddit. I was just asking if anyone else was in the same boat. Sorry that you have reading comprehension issues.
---
Its similar but you have a pay 25$ because we suck a balancing servers. HF and thank you for you money. Activision/Blizzard
---
Nope, I actually enjoy playing the game.
---
I'm pretty casual and I'm considering it. I really want R11, but I don't have time to no-life it. If I can pay $50 and save myself 100 hours, that seems worthwhile.

IF is #1

I just think if you‚Äôre going to go chasing items there are better options to chase.

Good luck! hopefully you avoid the problem I had with bartender, which is that a paged bar still has to get the new page from some bar, which means that your list of 10-12 bars suddenly turns in to 4 or fewer actual bars once you start to account for 3-4 forms.

Im sure you can google this.

But heres my advice. Do quests and dont grind

What if you create a horde character on the PvP server before transferring an alliance character. Then I think it might have to be horde since you cant have both? haha
---
Can confirm head was placed at 13:00 since i was the on who did it
---
Yeah if games actually end up as turtle games then everyone ends up with terrible honor, but very few of these games where Horde defend actually turn into true turtles.
---
Horde has 25-30 minute wins now instead of 10-15 minutes losses. It's way better honor, that's why Horde is defending now lol
---
I mean also people probably just dropped the first one and never did more.
---
More like all these people with two accounts üòÖ can't make opposing faction on a PvP server.
---
Engi was quite cheap to level to 200 on my server, was like 20-30g and I had no mats, granted I'm a gnome so I get a bonus, but the higher levels are what really cost
---
Why Mankrik or why are we transferring? We chose Mankrik because we have Horde alts there. We are transferring off Benediction because, as alliance, under 60, we literally couldn‚Äôt play the game because of Horde camping.
---
Bruh, you gotta work on your grammar.
---
How does "afk" in AV work? I always see people afking in the cave at the start, not even trying to hide it. They sometimes get reported afk and get "inactive" debuff but they are still getting rep and they don't get kicked. What does it take to actually get kicked from AV for afk?
---
 28-33 Worgens in Duskwood.   
---
33-38 Farm in Arathi Highlands    
---
35-44 Mirefin Murlocs in Dustwallow Marsh   
---
45-51 Southsea Pirates in Lost Rigger Cove Tanaris.
---
Altoholic is defunct but you can find Armory on curseforge which accomplishes pretty much exactly the same thing. I find it easier to use than altoholic actually, once I got used to it
---
The redridge one is terrible, the rest really aren't bad.
---
This is so true. At first I was a little concerned about the queues, but if all the horde have queues then we're still all on the same plating field when it comes to honor gains.
---
Seems like they're either funneling, or don't understand loot prio
---
Thanks everyone for the answer! We got this! :)
---
If you're a high enough level you can actually pick up bones off the floor in like Terror Run. I nabbed quite a few from basically one location after I found the drop rate lacking.
---
Someone might get banned in the making of this post :P
---
Well it takes more than one, sap is a bitch in classic.
---
You mean mage 40-60?
---
I dont know man, i got a 60 mage and a 60 rogue, the rogue is allmost full bis :/
---
Personally I find the totem tracker a bit easier to look at on Samy's but the other one has a bit more customization and also it can track the other shaman buffs/cooldowns  as mentioned.
---
This one is correct
---
Look up zones by level and then experiment a little at places where npcs are tightly packed, such as the undead fields in WPL. Anything that drops cloth will be amazing to grind as you can lvl tailoring and first aid and a lot of greens to DE
---
you get dandruff ?
---
Obvious troll is obvious
---
I am on a PvP server?
---
Can I get her number?
---
Arcanite Reaper is pretty damn fun. Chill player base. There is some drama between competing guild masters but outside of those guys everyone is nice. H:A balance seems pretty good - I think with a slight favor is towards alliance. Some people claim the server is "dead" but I don't believe that to be the case, but if you are coming from a full-pop server the difference will be noticeable. Hit up Saga if you come over!
---
So i am currently a level 47 Human Arms Warrior. I would like to spec into either Fury DPS or Fury-Tank builds at some point. 
---
At what point do i want to make that change? 
---
Is it dependant on me finding a certain set of gear? Or when i get a high enough level?
---
Any suggestions for BiS before and after 60?
---
At level 30 your best AoE grinding spots will be the Murlocs in the Dreadmurk Shore off Theramore. Just keep in mind that there‚Äôs usually a few mages waiting in line. You can also try the Murlocs in Southshore along the Eastern Strand.

Came up with this
---
Whitemane is pretty balanced. It's a mega server and occasionally has short queues on Tuesdays and the PVP scene is fairly competitive but the balance is good, slightly Horde favored but there are a fuck ton of Alliance and they frequently contested zones and BRM during P2.
---
And since BGs the PVP died down a ton.
---
Perfect.
---
I don‚Äôt have a true gambling problem.. I don‚Äôt gamble much. I do have an addictive personality. I was in Vegas for my first time... but 900 on black and won... came back the next night and put 1800 on black and lost. Didn‚Äôt go back after that. I have issues with stopping and I did the over under game a few days ago before a raid the other week.. started off with 20g and was up to 100... ended up quitting at 15g. There was a time though I vendored some items to get enough for the minimum 5g roll .
---
Gambling is jacked. I have 400g now and haven‚Äôt gone back to him.. don‚Äôt feel down on yourself. Got to start from the bottom again, but probably best to not even start
---
I would laugh so hard if I ever saw a hunter play like that :D
---
Anyone got knowledge about the addon "moveanything"? I wanna move the spot where my buffs and debuffs are, and the addon is perfect for it. But my poisons doesn't follow at all, but buffs goes to where I used the addon to move them, and the debuffs, but no poisons doesn't bulge at all, they stop at the top right corner no matter what I do.  
---
Anyone know why? or how to fix it? thanks!
---
I could easily afford it, but I just don't want to. I cashed out 5m retail gold to play classic, a game I bought once already, for free.
---
Due to fight lengths, variance is so high that improving your average is essentially meaningless.
---
For instance, I'm sitting at 36% ish crit raid buffed and I've had fights with literally 0% crit on aimed/multi shot and I've had fights where both were over 50, I've had fights with 0% uptime on iaoth and fights with 80%, I've had fights where my 1% miss chance caused me to miss several of my aimed shots.
---
That's all down to RNG and you *have to* hit top end of your variance in order to get a good parse.
---
So far Smolderweb alliance side has been awesome. No problem getting a group together for anything and the faction balance is only slightly horde leaning.
---
Would not make much sense if you could make a bunch of honor and then transfer on a small realm to get a higher rank...
---
Will give sfk a try. Any luck with items thus far? 
---
Do you pair it with anything to increase you aoe dmg? 
---
Dragonbreath chili and the likes
---
Act like an adult and do neither because upvoting and downvoting is juvenile and stupid.
---
Just play how and what you want to.
---
No stress... really.
---
Also it encourages rmt which is seen as less of a problem in Asian countries. If blizzard had a foolproof way of catching rmt this would be better, but they aren‚Äôt perfect.
---
I would guess around 20 minutes tops, plus you get a bunch of flight paths you need to get for later anyway (menethil harbor, loch modan). Really not that bad. Weird death skips will likely take much longer, and at level 10 you don‚Äôt have enough money to pay a mage for a portal.
---
Horde back doors the bridge now
---
To kill the other faction. Real players.
---
This happened on Mograine-EU tonight. Some ass clown popped it at around 5:30pm
---
Oh I've tanked. I also know how incredibly annoying it is to healers to have to play ping pong with the tanks, having the mob constantly turning to cleave anyone attempting to stay behind it on top of the whirlwinds. Without taking the players skill into account, a single tank is going to do more threat and control the mob a lot better than if it's bouncing around between 2-4 of them, especially in a pug environment.
---
It‚Äôs actually mind blowing how few hunters use freezing traps, and even less that use feign macros. I was really hoping the huntard thing was untrue but by god people are hellbent on making it a reality.
---
Found old article on wowhead from  2009/07/20 when character transfer cooldown was reduced down to 3 days, so it was actually during WotlK.
---
Now that I think about it the butthurt was around Heroic Icecrown Citadel as it was used to reset limited attempts counter (and gear up too).
---
I literally said I'm trying to hit rank 6, not rank 14 you illiterate moron.
---
I once fought a paladin outside onys lair as a feral druid.
---
... it took long time
---
&gt; It is not a significant burden on the tank since Battle Shout already generates more threat than Sunder against single targets
---
what?
---
Is the Bloodvine herb in the game now? Thought it dropped from elite trolls in Hinterlands but apparently I'm mistaken.
---
Oh yeah teleport is 20. Portal is 40.
---
It‚Äôs hard to tell. I think tons of people are stockpiling materials for later phases since it‚Äôs heavily known what will be needed. I can see that potentially driving the prices lower with the market flooded with them. 
---
Hell even think gear on my server is drastically lower than it was before BGs
---
I approve this gift.
---
Not unless a hordie brings his alliance alt from another account...

Moral of the story don‚Äôt use world chat
