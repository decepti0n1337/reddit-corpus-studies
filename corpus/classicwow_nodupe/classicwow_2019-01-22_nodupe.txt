My wife‚Äôs first mmo and 3rd game ever was wow. She wasn‚Äôt a god, but she picked it up. 
---

---
I think as long as she‚Äôs willing to put in some learning and you play with her she will be fine.
---
I would maybe try a private server with her if you are really concerned, but tbh it should be fine as long as you are patient with her and maybe pick a pve server.
---
---
---
Pretty sure it's sit crits in general that don't work so that means no easy reckoning.
---
Druids are an amazing class. My point was not to tell you not to play them. My only point is Druids are a Surly, unruly class. That will ask a lot of you and, not give the returns of other classes for your efforts. As in lets say you find a way to make "boomkin" work for you. Basically all that means is you will being putting out 100X the effort of a mage. Just to do what he can do with his core stuff. That is the story of a Druid over and, over.
---
That is why my core point is. Unless you are absolutely in love with the idea of playing a Druid and, are the type of stubborn goon. Who is going to do things his way regardless of the adversity or haters. Druid is not the class for you. If you are even asking the question. Then at some point while playing your druid in the future. You will stare at him in resentment or frustration. Just wishing you had taken that easier more reliable path. 
---
I say this as someone with over 380k honor kills on my old Druid. It's a wonderful class but, she's a fickle mistress with a million reasons to hate her. For me my love came from being a bear. I was 16 at the time and, freaking though being a bear was the coolest thing ever. A second option never entered my mind. Believe me if it did I would have taken it because, being a druid sucks ass and, I say that with love.
---
And having to rely on others to do their job and do it well enough for your OWN survival! And not just tanks and healers! If that mage sheeps the target and keeps it sheeped until the tank is ready to take it on...
---
Yes, which is what i said i‚Äôm against it being in the game.
---
I would much rather a ‚Äútough shit‚Äù policy by GMs 
---
I thought I‚Äôd just leave this here. And which faction I‚Äôll play when classic comes out? I think it‚Äôs quite clear already üòèüòé
---
&gt;Not the content tho. Also because blizzard doesn't wanna put resources in applying changes per patch like original game did. 
---
The content is all using 1.12.1 itemization and balance, the only difference is they're doing an artificial content gate.
---
&gt;Nah, Lolten always had way more. Also the reason for that was the pserver boom that happened with WotLK so there was just way too many of them and they were all trash. If you only have shit to compare to, mud will be viewed highly. 
---
lmao that servers population has always been under speculation, they've had the same pop as nost had for years, before nost even existed, yet their servers felt like a regular pop server. 
---
&gt;So the only faults you can name is something that does not have anything to do with massive pop but rather poor hardware? 
---
You can only throw so much hardware at poorly optimized software before hitting diminishing returns. If every single server has lag/poor render distance with higher pop that doesn't really indicate hardware issues (unless every server is using the same host).
---
&gt;The only thing that could not handle more players was spawn rates and servers. Everything that can be easily achieved and solved today. 
---
How can you handle more players? Dynamic respawn isn't really a optimal solution as it ends up damaging other aspects of the game (having mobs spawn to fast, screws up the economy etc.)
---
&gt;Actually, it does. If you create fewer servers but with bigger caps it will make sure they stay healthier after tourists are gone. If you make low cap and make a bunch of servers then they will obviously fall low since population gets too spread.
---
No reason to have to merge servers when you can prevent such situation from happening for a long time. 
---
Blizzard has no idea how many people are going to be playing the game at release, they run the risk of having not enough servers for everyone or too many. You're not going to fill every server evenly even if you have a high pop capability. Some are just going to be low population, it's just the way it works.
---
I used to know this gnome back in the day who was a damn god. He KNEW exactly which enemy to sheep, every.single.time. Seeing him fail was actually something very rarely seen. He was that good.
---
Aye this is the main issue with that system which is why i was asking if they‚Äôre using the later system. 
---
Yep, gonna 100% be taking 7-8 days off during release. Never going to have another classic release in my lifetime so fuck it lol
---
My robes of the exalted üò¢ couldn‚Äôt agree more! 
---
I thought azjol nerub was going to be between Ulduar and ICC but they replaced it with ToC due to timing constraints? Or am I remembering wrong?

---
Warriors have a talent that gives them hp regen and a dps boost when they take a critical strike. By macroing in the /sit command, warriors on private servers were able to force a mob to crit them, keeping the talent at high uptime and vastly increasing their leveling speed.
---
If I remember correctly, there was an interview with a Blizz dev whee they confirmed that this sort of stuff would not be in WoW Classic for a couple reasons: firstly, the WoW Classic client is an updated client on which seated critical strikes do not trigger talents; and secondly, oversights in design (like the Paladin reckoning bomb) were being fixed as they were by patch 1.12 when Vanilla was live.
---
The /sit crit abuse is limited to private servers and will not be in WoW Classic. Everything I have read/watched from experienced warrior players has pointed towards leveling as Arms with a big 2H and using talents like Sweeping Strikes and Mortal Strike to boost your kill rate.  Additionally, leveling arms allows you to not be a wet blanket in wPvP, if you're leveling on a PvP realm.
---
Also to your point if you‚Äôre there with friends wouldn‚Äôt everyone know in the first place. The situation doesn‚Äôt really make sense to me.
---
Same might as well make the most of it.

I get 3 weeks of paid vacation annually, resetting in May and I'm debating whether I should use 2 for launch and save one for sometime after I hit 60 or keep it in the bank in case I wanna go somewhere irl...
---
Id much prefer seasons and a reset or fresh servers every ‚Äúvanilla life span‚Äù so every 18mnths/2 years, seems to have been well liked in pservers 
---
Do you mean after BC as in Wrath, or after BC launch? Because BC honestly made dungeon trash stupidly hard, especially in heroics. It got so bad in Wrath though, the only way to have fun in PvE in Wrath is to raid, because heroics become so easy.
---
I would argue that there are moments where bears shine. Perhaps dungeons like Uldaman, where having an AoE ability helps take care of some more clusterfuckish packs. Also, places like Zul‚ÄôFarrak, where you can take advantage of both roots and hibernate. 
---
Reddit, never change. If you give us who know how to actually play this game endlessly entertainment, LUL.
---
Well even looking at the comments, you seem to still be getting a lot of wildly inconsistent comments. If you're running 5 mans with people are are appropriately geared for it (and not wildly overgeared, like a warrior using thunderfury), you're gonna be better off with a druid because they 1) will be tankier (because having higher HP and armor is better than the ability to avoid crushes and crits when the opponents aren't raid enemies who don't even crush or crit you that much anyway), 2) they will do AoE damage much better, and 3) they will deal significantly more DPS (which is significant when there's only 5 of you) and 4) generate more threat.
---
Yep. I set my own schedule so will probably do 1 week off and 1-2 weeks only working 12-18 hrs to keep a little bit of money coming in. 
---
No girlfriend or other commitments so 28 year old me is going to do what I wished I could in 2005. 
---
Haven't done a pserver run yet...not sure that I want to. I think I'll keep the magic f R e S H.
---
I think an arms warrior in tanky dps gear with a 2her is probably the best for most 5 mans.. 
---
I used to tank like this in retail vanilla all the time, I rarely used a shield and all it took was decent gear and you were a machine.
---
I remember my raid leader tanking Ony like this a few times, after we finished BWL progression.
---
There‚Äôs a spot in Cenerian Hold where you can peel off enemies without the guards seeing you. Cooldowns, a 2 frostbolts and an instant 3rd has em dead. It‚Äôs always funny seeing the warriors panic set in after the first bolt goes flying, there‚Äôs almost nothing they can do. :/
---
I want to make a guild of alt rogues in Classic. We log on every once in awhile and enter Org. Find flagged members, the more well known the better, and put 3-4 rogues on each person (underplayed alt = bad gear).  
---
Gank them, and then log off outside the gate and back to our mains.  
---
We only log in every once in awhile, maybe 4-5 times a week, and do our business. The rarity of our attacks make it to where horde never know when it's going to happen, and standing in Org flagged creates a sense of unease.  
---
I don‚Äôt believe it‚Äôs full duration. Or at least not just f you leave combat.
---
I don‚Äôt they they‚Äôve clarified any details yet.
---
Personally, this is how I‚Äôd rank my preferences for how they handle it.
---
Nothing (keep it simple)&gt;Loot trading only with Master Loot&gt;Basic Loot Trading.
---
I‚Äôd hate to have uninhibited loot trading like in Retail, but if they were to copy paste the system over, it would also likely have the armor type limitations, IE paladins can‚Äôt roll on cloth... which would never happen. So it can be assumed that no matter what, it won‚Äôt be 1:1 to the system that exists in retail.
---
yeh its very overpriced on nd atm, but mainly coz noone is even doing stratlive anymore. it was much cheaper 3 months ago, saw it for 50 once and resold for 80.
---
I‚Äôll probably take 2 days off and play somewhere between 10-15 hours each day then go back to work/playing when I can. 
---
Wow man that sounds so cool. I wish I knew how to press sheep too
---
no
---
That certain classes have a faster GCD (i.e rogue and cat druid). For druid this is interesting since you essentially have 2 GCDs one for cat and shifting during your dps rotation.
---
IIRC sit crits do work just the procs that work with crits don‚Äôt work with sit crits?
---
Any normal job in Europe would be my guess.
---
&gt;The content is all using 1.12.1 itemization and balance, the only difference is they're doing an artificial content gate.
---
Yea cause they don't wanna put money into this, more than needed.  
---
&gt;lmao that servers population has always been under speculation, they've had the same pop as nost had for years, before nost even existed, yet their servers felt like a regular pop server.  
---
They definitely did not feel like regular pop servers. I dont know what "regular" servers you visited that had places crowded like that. We all know they faked portion of their pop, but they still had the most people pre nost.  
---
&gt;You can only throw so much hardware at poorly optimized software before hitting diminishing returns. If every single server has lag/poor render distance with higher pop that doesn't really indicate hardware issues (unless every server is using the same host) 
---
Well that's why they are gonna use the latest tech and infrastructure as opposed to old client. If they end up using bfa (same tech as retail, so they get updated at same time), its gonna be even better because they are making lots of optimatization stuff lately.  
---
Either way you can't compare some random server providers' trashcan coupled with spaghetti code from some kids' basement to megacorps' latest and strongest devices (inb4 bfa's trash servers; that's sharding issue)  
---
&gt;How can you handle more players? Dynamic respawn isn't really a optimal solution as it ends up damaging other aspects of the game (having mobs spawn to fast, screws up the economy etc.)  
---
It doesn't, because there are more people that consume it. Supply and demand would still be the same if properly implemented.  
---
&gt;Blizzard has no idea how many people are going to be playing the game at release, they run the risk of having not enough servers for everyone or too many 
---
That's why there's sharding at start. They are prepared.  
---
Most of these answers are horrible.
---
You can tank with 2handers up until 60 dungeons which take some gear but only requires pre-bis and a good healer. If you arms you should always open with sweeping strikes WW (if you can get it out fast enough) for threat then swap to sword and board.
---
You really racked your brain on this one buddy. Fucking retard.
---
I'm very seriously considering taking one or two days off, but not launch day. It'll be like 3-7 days after launch to ensure server hiccups aren't an issue and the main crunch of levelers is gone.
---
Release BC Heroics had insanely tough trash. Once you were geared you could just pull the whole thing, sure, but that applied to vanilla instances as well. Once you were geared you could just pull a pack and tank it. Raiding being less common in vanilla maybe not a lot of people got to that point and BC had other options for gear besides raiding, so I guess for most players this was more common in BC. 
---
I took off a week for Diablo 3 when it launched in 2012. Biggest disappointment of recent years. Servers were lagged to hell or down most the time. At the midnight launch I don't think I even got connected until about 5am. After a week I don't think I was even max level yet. Was pretty mad and have not used any vacations for new launches yet.
---
This was really insightful and will help deal with the dread of leveling that class... but I'm still rolling my childhood Tauren ;) 
---
Raided very hardcore in Vanilla (clearers C‚ÄôThun and up to 4 Horsemen in Naxx).
---
The game is no joke and is tuned much differently than wow is today. There are hard gear checks throughout the zones. It will require min/max and massive consumeable / wiping to get through. And that‚Äôs across 40 players.
---
We were raising 6 nights a week at 4 hours each and most weeks 5 of those nights were spent wiping on a progression boss. It took months to down C‚ÄôThun.
---
When we went into Naxx we were almost all full Tier 2.5 and you could still barely squeak out the DPS for Patchwerk.
---
If Blizzard truly delivers the same game and I hope they do people will realize very quickly that getting max gear across 40 players is very challenging and required for certain fights in those instances.
---
It‚Äôs not just a ‚Äúpeople know more now so they‚Äôll walk through it‚Äù type game. It was tuned to be only accessible to those that were completely dedicated to the game AND knew a ton about their class. There was just as much theorycrafting and analysis among the elite groups who were doing that content it just was not as broadly publicized as it is today. 
---
Vanilla at the highest level is a commitment even Mythic raiders in today‚Äôs game are likely not doing. It was months of grinding content - not weeks. It took the top guilds in the world 4+ months of wiping on C‚ÄôThun w/ a number of nerfs to be able to down him. You just don‚Äôt see that today.
---
I‚Äôll take a week. My company has a generous PTO policy, and I‚Äôve been there 14 years this March, so I have some days to burn. I will probably do it a couple of weeks or a month after launch though, to get past initial rush, see if servers stay stable, how they handle the large rush of people (busy servers with queue lines? Sharding everything like crazy?), etc.
---
Can‚Äôt wait though. Looking forward to it.
---
What makes you think that their design decisions don't stem from limitations? If they knew that realistically they can handle up to 3.5-4K players, Designing with 2.5K players in mind is very reasonable.
---
Ibwish I had known I could lava hop out and stay alive in retail. The first time I tried to do brs I was mind controlled into the lava and died an extra time getting out. Then I got back up the chain, only to get mc'd again by the same priest. Then someone else left the group, because I was taking so long, causing it to fall apart. 
---
I was pissed to say the least.
---
Ah, I only reached end-game on private servers and was forced to min/max. In all honesty, if it's a fresh experience for a player, I'd recommend just playing for fun and learning what works best for you and your guild.
---
Give it time, if we can't find the old ones there won't be a lack of new ones popping up as we get closer to launch. A lot of private server players are probably going to try to jumpstart their own sites or content by having that information available.
---
This how it was on Dragonmaw during vanilla.  Your server must not have been high population or something?  I was never much of a pvper myself but I remember the epic battles at BRM.
---
Says the guy who, I'm assuming, never actually played a mage. OP is correct, sheeping correctly is a skill, like most CCs. To maximize your damage, sheeping has to be perfectly slotted in your rotation or you sheep to early or to late. Also knowing who the greatest threat to the party is without spending 5 minutes before each trash group. And, you have to factor in terrible dps that love to break the sheep with aoe or dots. 
---
Or, you know, just "press sheep"....
---
Is everything okay at home?
---
Don't forget the Herbs!
---
Ah I see!
---
Do you have a video of you guys attacking? would love to see that.
---
One of the things that I think was the beginning of the long road or short sighted and ultimately terrible QOL decisions was making AOEs crit. I remember when we were doing Hyjal in BC when that patch dropped and, from that moment on, all raid trash was trivial. As much as I initially loved the crazy spike in damage my frost mage was doing, in the end, it was one of many "improvements" that killed the game. No more talking about CC before the pull. No need whatsoever for communication for trash at that point. Tanks charge in, casters AOE, single target dps watches with shame as they fall to the bottom of the DPS meter, and voila, one major aspect of vanilla wow is dead. 
---
Yeah, sheeping isn't that hard, mate. Just press the button when you see the tank start to all with his gun or bow, wow so hard. Also knowing which mob to sheep can be considered somewhat impressive if it wasn't the caster 99% of the time. Syncing yourself with the pull to spare the tank some positioning trouble is the hardest part and if you can't do it perfectly after one dungeon run you're just really bad. By the way, if someone puts a dot on the sheep you can't do shit about it. Good or bad.
---
TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION INSTEAD OF SOAPBOXING
---
No information from blizzard on this. It was not present in vanilla, but I expect that blizzard would want to implement it for the same line of thought as their loot trading. But again that is my assumption, and there has been no official statement.
---
Absolutely not, Druids have troubles holding threat on multiple mobs.
---
Except that is actually not true. Plenty of AQ and even some BWL gear was not easy to replace before 70 in TBC. Not to say that Naxx gear wasn't OP, but the dungeon itself was hard as balls, so if you could get a full set, you have the right to be OP.
---
Trying to be realistic here: unless you are already in a hardcore guild that wants world firsts (or seconds since this was all done 14 years ago), the first 2 weeks will be a nightmare of latency errors/disconnects, difficulty in clearing any of the 10-30 quests (since those won't be sharded), and bugs. My plan is to take off work only if my work schedule conflicts with the actual launch time. I'll reserve my names (on two servers) and I'll be done. Then I'll play at my own pace. I'm not racing to 60. I want to take my time. 
---
You'll like BFA then. Trash is way more deadly than most of the bosses.  
---
Naxx won't be at launch. It will be released several months later. Moreover, even when it does get released, only a handful of hardcore players will actually manage to do more than a couple bosses. Even if eventually the early servers become a shitfest with unkillable warriors in Naxx gear, we will still have maybe a year of fun in Classic, and at that point we could roll to another server and start fresh.
---
IT in US Higher Ed. 2 days PTO per month.
---
Alternatively, roll the more fun faction and cast lightning at them mutha fukkas
---
If a horde MS warrior charges at you with a crit and proc's WF from his shaman buddy, you'll die instantly if you're not plate.
---
The vanilla is odd, where some fights (i.e. druid vs paladin) take forever, where some others (rogue vs mage) the fight is won in the matter of seconds, just depends who kills who first.
---
Technically Tauren Druids could war stomp, and a lot of (I think most) caster mobs do actually take a couple steps before casting.
---
Lol?
---
Since 90% of the mages I played with either never sheeped or were terrible at it, my personal experience is it's hard enough that most don't bother or never practice. It was bad enough that after wipes where the warrior jumped into a massive pack, I'd actually have to suggest that we, you know, USE THE BEST CC IN THE GAME.
---
Personally, I never found it extremely difficult. Mostly just dealing with players who weren't used to CCers in their group. But I did take the time to play around with that spell a lot and I'm sure that helped. 
---
I'm not looking forward to playing with retail players since they will mostly be huntards (not hunters, per se, but acting like them).
---
Druids can MT all of MC with enough fire resist. 
---
For real, CC is immensely important in higher keystones and in some raid trash packs. It's interesting having it back, tbh I didn't miss tough trash, I prefer the bosses being the hard parts but that's just my opinion
---
**If 4k or less is the cap**, your concurrent player numbers at peak will settle *below that* (after the tourists and initial surge of release). 
---
That gives your population numbers very little room to endure residual player fall-off as patches progress. Your server's population come AQ and Naxx won't resemble its release numbers. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
What level do you think you're going to reach that first week?  I'm thinking about taking a week off too (Tuesday through Friday assuming the typical Tuesday release..)  Depending on how much I can actually play without falling asleep I'm thinking I can get somewhere between 40 and 50 that first week.  If I neglect everything else in my life I could probably get 55+ but I think that's going to be pushing it.
---
Oh crap dude you're giving me nightmares and flashbacks
---
or arcane in one case. we had bear farm runs from time to time.
---
There's the Iron Man achievement in retail WoW. Some of the limitations are only white gear, no talents, no trading with other players (I think), and the biggest one, no deaths allowed. I know Asmongold did a series on this a while back, but I'm sure plenty of other YouTubers have done it.
---
Ya, you press sheep - it isn't that hard.  Get to know the mobs like anyone else and it's pretty clear who to sheep.  It's a 1.5 cast time without a CD and can be done behind your back with a 50 sec duration...not some 4D chess move.
---
I agree about keeping it fresh!  I leveled in a private server a bit ago and it is a fucking grind man!  Don't get me wrong, it's fun, but it's a lot of time and really I wouldn't want to do that twice in a year, lol.
---
lol
---
Higher populations are bad for raiding because you'll have too many fun guild rivalries, competition, and more options for raiding guilds and wpvp. 
---
Like Bellular, but louder
---
Great input. Good luck holding threat when the hunter is attacking one target and the rogue is attacking another.
---
You have my bow.
---
mage tip - having 2/3 pts in improved blizzard (and no more) makes sure the fairly long-lasting slow from Cone of Cold isn't overwritten by the short-lasting slow from blizzard
---
The risk of CC breakage from both players and randomness made it more thrilling as well. It adds the element of the unknown dispite having done the dungeon countless times.
---
As healer I kept an eye on distance and eventual threat a CC'd mob had because most players were either unknowing, lazy or damage meter hyenas wanting that extra shadowbolt cast instead of moving to a safer spot. Pointing it out helps. For 5 minutes. Let's see this time around.
---
Do you think the spell batch change will affect the need to switch off damage-return-on-hit effects like ret aura on some CC encounters?
---
Ofc
---
Yeah the parry chance vs mobs is better than crit as it changes your attack speed after parrying and that also makes you take less dmg.
---

In aiming for 59, my guild wants all core raiders 60 a week after start.

This is probably one of the very few things that if changed wouldn't bother me
---
And no points in frostbite!!

Did you actually play a druid tank in vanilla? I did. Tanking 5 mans is a struggle. Warriors do not have the same problem.
---
The only thing that I'd be looking for in streams is what server they play on, so I can avoid it.
---
I may try streaming myself. What kind of streamer will I be? A boring one that talks to himself a lot. Something for insomniacs to fall asleep to. 
---
Sounds like that hit close to home.
---
Did you really laugh out loud?  I doubt it.

After all this junk being framed I might go clean out my dryers lint trap and frame that.

That‚Äôs insane lmao

Yup. My friends and I all are. Here is our guild page:

I rotate 3 weeks on and 3 weeks off - with 3 weeks of vacation I'll have just over 2 months to [Live to Win](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUkrE9LTuFc).
---
I didn't enjoy BFA enough to play it past the first month, but I specifically remember having to use cc correctly on mobs to get past dungeons at the beginning. I'm sure with mythic+ they still do that if you are into the keystone idea.
---
I have fond memories of tanking heroics in BC...holding agro on multiple mobs took skill, and yeah there were some mobs that hit like a truck that really required you to think about skill usage to mitigate damage. 
---
It was satisfying to do your job as a tank and earn people‚Äôs respect...not everyone had the skill or put in the effort, so it was nice to earn that reputation as a good tank.
---
I remember my disgust in WoTLK when they really started to homogenise tank classes and trivialise AOE tanking. And heroics were already a joke unless you were doing achievement runs.
---
I miss that unique identity of each tank class. It really pissed me off when Blizzard started homogenising tanks in WoTLK
---
Premade BGs - with the coms active on stream.. raid content with the coms active on stream.. or watching realm leveling progression for the highest level people on the realms with music and no coms.
---
Looks like a friday night on Daggerspine before the server expansions, way pre-BC. 
---
Not stupidly hard, fun hard. I agree encounters become more interesting if people have to be more creative with their abilities. Casting cc indeed ain‚Äôt hard, by the way, but relying on one another to make a run go smoother is definitely part of a good MMO.

This is why I'll always hold early Cata with high regard. Coming off Wrath's mindless aoe spam to actual thinking was marvelous, but of course the uproar for content being to difficult killed any chance of them going back.
---
Sorry for the inconvenience, but please use r/wowservers for private server discussion (Rule #1).
---
Thats close to impossible and pretty absurd. It takes 8-10 days to reach 60 for a normal plauet. Even if you do it in 6 days you have to play 20-21h/day for 7 days.... And for what? To clear MC one week earlier?
---
Not entirely true as it takes more time to set up for an aoe pull compared to single mob grinding. It‚Äôs also fairly unlikely you will be able to open world AoE farm for Classic launch as the population will be ridiculous. When you hit 46 Maraudon with a scepter of Celebras is fucking dope farming snakes/turtles uncontested (free skins, a chance at a Ghost Mushroom node and 100% on a Blind Weed node).
---
check out a youtube video about what path to take in DM:East, the 2nd boss (Sacrifice Satyr) is a bit hard to kill, but apart from thst you can make a lot of gold with disenchanting all blues / selling all weapons and mining Rich Thorium Veins which gives you Arcane Crystals (on some pserver the currently sell Arcanite Bars for 40g a piece)

---
They are not managing their expectations. If you are not prepared with practise and being mentally prepared to spend all that time grinding quests for a consistent xp/h it will break many of them and they will want to do something fun. I have a feeling a lot of ppl are thinking this way. But it's really not doable unless you know what's ahead
---
Druids can be incredibly annoying in AB. Each point is great for line of sighting, which is great for their hots. They have great survivability and track humanoids, so they are really good for defense. 
---
Can also be solid for capping points with engineering.

If blizzard could give us a definite release date and the servers are working and the game is not bugged crashing for weeks I'd say do it if it makes you happy. But you may be very disappointed

Cata heroics were like this, and IMO were peak 5man content. Almost every trash pack was dangerous and required CC or interrupts or focus-fire, or you'd get fucked. Bosses were the same way, required good execution of mechanics or you'd get similarly fucked.
---
But sadly a majority of the playerbase can't handle that and they got nerfed back to "aoe faceroll" difficulty within a couple months of launch.
---
Damn I wish I had that amount of time. GG
---
Oh my god I forgot about this site!  
---
Brings back such memories. I realize now this site is where I figured out where to get my gear on my mage.  
---
It‚Äôs the hunter you have to worry about. That mother fucker will break sheep every god damn time. 
---
In vanilla it was instance lag, and lag is still a major issue for retail currently. 
---
same me and my one viewer will be having a blast as i talk and they dont answer
---
For sure... when I hear the date I'll be going into work even on the weekend to make sure I can take that time off 
---
if a p server can host 8k peak and still be fine... 
---
I was about to say lol like half the jobs around my area offer PTO with a solid month every year. The job I'm working at now even gives you the potential to buy more PTO with these sort of reward points for taking on extra works which is extremely extremely easy. 
---
Most of the guild is aiming for r14 so we want to get 60 and start farming consumes and either pre bis or MC gear asap. 
---
I mean joana did it in 4 days 20 hours /played but only a week in real time. So it's definitely doable. especially since joana is up at it again with the guides to help people get 60 asap

---
This would be amazing. Let‚Äôs make it happen in Classic! Except my main will be my rogue :)
---
This might be a thing that people don't know.
---
Most of the answers you're going to get are from private sever players, and Blizzard has stated that a lot of private servers numbers are inaccurate. Personally, when I was playing back in the day at all I don't remember this "warriors are best tanks" thing that people here are constantly talking about.
---
Combine that with the fact that some of the behind-the-scene functions in Classic won't even be true to vanilla...look at the spell batching issue for example...it's possible that things like you're asking about might be a little different than anyone here can tell you.
---
I played a lot of a wrath private server running on the 3.3.5 client, if your group isn't overgeared heroics are not easy.  CC isn't needed much, but sometimes it is.  I played a paladin tank though, so usually I just had to manage my defensive cooldowns at certain moments when I knew Iwould need it. 
---
But yeah... people in mostly blues/ entry level epics definitely can have trouble in heroics.  healers going low mana, certain trash mobs are strong, and boss mechanics could be tough too easily wiping people who aren't on their game. 
---
&lt;SPLIT DPS&gt; goat guild name
---
Streamers will be Classic WoW's cancer.  
---
Thinking about naming it &lt;Oncology&gt; and rolling the alts on the PVP server where streamers are rolling.  
---
Lol I looked all around and didn't notice the party
---
What are you suggesting? That the current devs at Activision Blizzard go over every mob spawn rate, every drop rate, every resource spawn, and alter all those values to redesign Vanilla WoW to accommodate a larger population?
---
the great thing about rogues is how powerful they can be without much gear. i remember rocking full blues with a gutgore ripper and being able to gank relatively geared people with stun combos and cold blood eviscerates.
---
Raids/BGs with full audio to hear communications.
---
&gt;for me
---
This isn't true mate, I played classic and there was plenty info/guides out there after a while, people just didn't know to look them up or know how to find them. This was a totally new type of game for most people. Most of these websites (or forums) just don't exist anymore because it was so long ago but the content was there. Obviously if you're just talking about youtube that was a different thing 10-15 years ago. For example, this archive was just posted today with full loot guides http://web.archive.org/web/20061121051340/http://www.wow-loot.com 
---
I always wanted to form a guild that would do this on schedule, as well as constantly kill the other factions auctioneers and city vendors and quest givers. We would take mercenary contracts too. Take protection money. I have ideas.

Pots don‚Äôt trigger a GCD. 
---
I don‚Äôt mean to say that at every point, the heroics are faceroll. I only mean that, compared to BC, they are easy. There were hard fights in blues, but overall I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre comparable to BC heroics‚Äô level of brutality. 
---
But one more factor is the gear you could acquire. In BC, it was normals&gt;Easier heroics&gt;Kara&gt;Harder heroics. Kara was very difficult for a mediocre geared group. Naxxramas, on the other hand, had loads of bosses that were drastically easier. So in the end, when both the dungeons are easier to begin with, and the raids are too, the experience quickly becomes lackluster compared to BC, imo.
---
I meant stupidly hard as praise! Compared to every other period in wows history, BC heroics are so much harder it‚Äôs off the charts. Early Cata blew people‚Äôs minds with how hard the dungeons were, yet it didn‚Äôt even touch the level BC was at. 
---
CC on its own isn‚Äôt hard, but there‚Äôs so many factors that make you learn how to play your class better when the demand for skill and attention is so much higher. I can‚Äôt wait to play Blizzard BC already haha.
---
No, youre right there's only one in the photo. Shitty photo shitty post.
---
When you cast a spell on someone of the opposing faction, you will be auto-selected as their target. This gives them some time to react.
---
Wait for them to target something before you cast your spell.
---
yup - planning to do 6-9 days depending the day it falls on. 
---
I might take a week off. And perhaps afterwards switch to a 4-day workweek afterwards. But not sure yet. 
---
Not many that jump out to me. Perhaps UBRS, a Druid is helpful for hibernating one of the dragonkin for the Rend Blackhand fight. It‚Äôs better to have a healer do it, but a bear could easily swap in and out.
---
Other than that it‚Äôs just tiny things. Some dungeons make better use of Innervate and Bres than others, so whatever a bear brings to the table is technically different on a dungeon to dungeon basis. Stratholme has some difficult points, like the abomination gauntlet at the end, where an innervate for your healer is awesome.
---
I feel sorry for everyone playing horde. Alliance zones and cities are way better.
---
I feel like this would be optimal in most cases:
---
1. MT
---
2. Warlock
---
3. BM Hunter
---
4. Paladin Alliance / X for horde
---
5. X
---
This is because I believe the OT would benefit better with a separate team comprised similarly the same thing to maximize buff spread. some recommend shamans and I think that would be better to leave comprised in a team of rogue warriors for the windfury.
---
The bank requires me to take 5 consecutive vacation days a year for anti fraud / theft reasons.. I will be lining this up with release for sure lol
---
Trying to, but theres no official date yet so I cant register my days off. Worst case I‚Äôll take a day or two of PTO 
---
If your saying reckoning bombs will work then I am sorry to inform you but sit critting will no longer trigger talents that was confirmed from blizzard for classic. So fury warriors can't sit crit and paladins can't sit crit.
---
Having played both (and I might add, I enjoy both), I feel yes. Druid tanking is generally easier, especially due to Swipe spam maintaining good threat is easier. For best threat I would generally spam Swipe and Maul minions in turn. Personally I find Warrior tanking more fun, especially in TBC. Since there's more to do, more abilities to use.
---
I will be playing both a Druid (main) and Warrior (alt) in Classic. My Druid will be Resto at 60 and my Warrior Protection.
---
This is exactly my point as to why Druids arent better. Yes, its easier to swipe spam to keep mobs off healers, but a Warrior can just as capably do it with sundering, thunder clap and demo shout and taunting in good order, the warrior just has to put more effort in. The 3 critical things you mention for endgame arent as important in dungeons, but theyre still applicable and can easily make a big difference on hard hitting bosses like King Gordok or Prince Tortheldrin.
---
Only the VW and Succubus have voicelines. The Felhunter and Imp only make noises.
---
After TBC the Imp got voicelines and added in which show up in the chat pane.
---
These voicelines and chat pane lines were in the Classic demo, contrary to how it was/is in Vanilla.
---
Yes I agree, and you're right the earlier on Wotlk heroics are very different than doing the ICC heroics or TOTC heroic.  Even though totc had a couple well known cheese strategies or abilities that made it a ton easier and so most groups knew to use it properly!
---
I was never in on the heroic/raid scene in TBC much at the time I just did all the normal dungeons and then jumped straight into PVP, maybe doing heroic ramparts or underbog for easy badges from time to time.  
---
Oooh, I was actually thinking of doing this for a warrior alt. He'd be essentially twinked and only running dungeons, what level do you think I could reasonably start doing this at?
---
I hope they shard the entrance for UBRS too. It's always full of ganking in PvP servers. Please shard it so I can actually play the game and not get camped.
---
Also, please shard Un'Goro crater. The Devilsaurs are always camped and congested. Please shard Un'goro so I can actually play the game and not stand around trying to tag a Devilsaur for 6 hours.
---
BTW, it's "neurons" for nervous cells, not "neutrons" (a component of a typical atom)
---
Summon Felsteed/Dreadsteed and Summon Warhorse/Charge can be CSd. Felsteed/Dreadsteed is shadow and Warhorse/Charger is Holy. CSing either of these makes them nearly useless, Warlock with only fire spells to start a fight and a Paladin with literally no spells.
---
Our childhood looks identical, Halo and WoW. Only thing missing is CoD4 and GH3 haha
---
I love the crybabies downvoting my comment because they can‚Äôt handle the fact that people like classic and retail üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
What am I'm saying is if you watch the clips from his old speed run. He, post level 10, as a hunter, is melee attacking Mobs. The record he set will be crushed is all I'm saying 
---
Hibernate breaks for no reason constantly though. Having the Druid only cast it once at the start of the fights wouldn‚Äôt be worth it 
---
Im gonna take a week. Maybe two depending in a few things.
---
If I had to choose, I'd rather see something like Ulduar-style hard modes than Mythic+. Make the content *different* instead of just ramping up numbers.
---
I wasn't aware of 'hardmodes' in classic. 
---
Although -- I did have a friend that got to level 30 on his hunter without a pet (he's a bit blessed).
---
Strength and honor!
---
Im quite married. Happily for 3 years lol. 
---
I did it myself due to my background but you can easily get this done at a michales or something similar. Just make sure you get a metal frame, wood frames suck. 
---
I started maybe 5 months in, so I think they added the 5th disc to add the patches or w/e back then.

Thank you.....

cod4 is in there look to the right :P
---
do it bro, you wont
---
edgelord go somewhere else
---
I wish i had the wotlk discs still but i think maybe i did a digital then? if not i lost them to time
---
were on a reddit forum for classic world of warcraft lol, i think we are all kindred spirits here 
---
PM me your Discord. We could start getting ideas together.  
---
Just know that this guild would be alt-only for me. Purely to harass opposite faction and there's a 99% chance I'll be a gnome if I do it.  
---
Since it'll be alt only, I don't care which server it's on, but I highly prefer the PVP server Tips/Es/Staysafe are rolling on so we can rightly name the guild Oncology.  
---
Looking for hardcore raiding guild. 
---
NA, PVP server
---
Horde 
---
Will be going either protection or fury warrior, whatever the guild needs more so most likely protection. 
---
Intended play - Any given moment after work/other things taken care of (usually 6 p.m. est). Planning on grinding as much as I can. 6+ hours a day at the very least. Raid times - can raid whenever so long as its between 6 p.m. and 2 a.m. est. Looking to raid 15-20 hours a week (maybe more depending on what the guild wants). 
---
Raiding priority but will learn my class in pvp and do that more casually. Wanting to do speed runs in raid content. I have the ability to consistently do mechanics while outputting as much damage as possible regardless of role but playing healers sux (respecc to all my heals out there). 
---
These are the only real logs I have available, I don't have any in retail wow for obvious reasons. Didn't bother to finish Alphascape because I was done with ffxiv by that point. Planning on having a higher dps percentile in classic raids than sigmascape as I will be taking that much more seriously than than in ff as that was a casual game and finding a hardcore team was a bitch.

---
Above all else it's a game and is meant to be fun so I will do my best to contribute to making your guild a fun place to be. If my comment interests you, I can be reached on discord Genodcidalmoose#6821 or reddit pms. 
---
Dude Shattered Halls was brutal with all the big pulls in the first hallway.  You had to be coordinated.  I miss those kinds of dungeons.
---
As the original OP of the framed discs. I would do up to wrath and then stop lol.... 
---
I know but after all these years I still can't find my way in there to save my life. I only recently learned to find the deadmines entrance.
---
What are you gonna play? Class and race 
---
How long do you plan to take off? 
---
What‚Äôs your goal for your time off? 
---
Are you gonna stream it?

I just framed my old favorites from when i was a kid with their energy types.... Just picked my favs lol

I am a photographer so framing doesnt cost that much for me :p I get them wholesale 
---
Just picked my favorites holos from when I was a kid and matched them with their energy types! 
---
Just roll whatever class fantasy you prefer, according to the community both classes are trash when it comes to raiding, shamans are better in 5 mans, shamans can blow people up in WPVP if you like that but druids can be flag carriers and can have a high skill cap shifting in and out of forms
---
slightly off topic, since you mentioned war stomp: be careful with tauren shamans. depending on how close classic stays to the original, taurens might have 7-8 yards melee hitbox instead of the usual 5 yards. 
---
what that means is you will be able to hit enemies much further away, but it goes both ways. great is you're enhancement, will fuck you up if you're anything else.
---
Lol
---
This saddens me. 
---
What about Mana stones?
---
I played mage and sleeping is not hard. Honestly for a somewhat experienced players it's common sense. Get your dick out of your butt. It's sad.
---
You know how to watch a cooldown addon. And keep an eye on a mob. Oh God Mr Leet master pro star show me your wayyyys 
---
Is this "that classic wpvp guild" in my discord?
---
Yes! Was nothing quite as satisfying as getting ambushed by three to four mobs and fighting your way out. Or a similar situation but right as your at a sliver of health and some random player rolls up and helps you out.
---
TIL, people think that Vanilla easy content is a race. 
---
I can't wait to watch the guy! :D
---
Then sapping the rezzer
---
Haha! Great pic!
---
I personally wouldn't care (because I probably wouldn't notice) but I can't imagine them changing core assets. They spoke a lot in the blizcon talks about respecting 1.12 data. I'd rather they stick to their 1.12 golden rule. 
---
Great game 
---
You're not the only one, friend
---
It's like Harry Potter wizards run through Platform 9 3/4 for the first time
---
Retail Is Great Again!
---
This sub is hilarious. I'll have my popcorn ready when people are done with their nostalgia feeling. 
---
I doubt this will be a successful endeavour. Probably get shit dicked everytime you step through gates and it will die fast. Will be fun trying thought. Good luck.
---
You mean don't play like an ass?
---
Luckily I don't need to give much advance on PTO and I work remotely. I'll just say I'm tentatively taking a week off and if the servers suck I'll just pop on and work. 
---
My plan is to take 2 weeks off with a week of work between. 2 weeks in a row of 16+ hr wow sessions is too much for me @ 35.
---
Huh, guess we had different experiences there. I really like Grim Batol especially the bombing part.
---
A lot more mana efficient and less time drinking though, no? I do agree about camps probably being too overpopulated at first
---
I only see 1 druid and no pvp tags and no dead players. Is this a trolly shit post made by a 14 yr old?
---
I‚Äôm taking about 3 months off work during the summer to get started on Classic. 
---
(I‚Äôm a teacher)
---
What do you mean gone forever? Like going on a trip or off to college? 
---
I'm having a hard time understanding where these are going forever.... you are probably in complete control of what happens to them right?
---
Not likely, if there is any sort of demand for it Blizz-Activision will want to milk that.
---
They are not talking about vanilla, they are talking about 2019 classic with no tbc for the foreseeable future, it's not crazy to imagine that many more people than back then will eventually have naxx on farm
---
I'm using all my 5 weeks of payed vacation for Classic.
---
Redoubt didn't proc from sit crits in the demo, and they proc the same way. Reckoning didn't work with sit crits in Vanilla, or at least there is no video of it, and I have never heard of it until private servers.
---
Yes, a hit will auto crit if you are sitting, it just won't proc a crit-based ability like Redoubt or Reckoning that way.
---
It was glorious. I enjoyed seeing the Bears shining in their own way as well.
---
the packs after twin emps are twice as bad. :&lt;
---
Works for me!
---
Everything in grey vendor (except rocks for those weird rock collector dudes).
---
Anything white you can make more money selling in on the AH or banking it for later. Making gold in Classic will require you to first of all invest in good bags and bank space so you have somewhere to put everything.
---
Then wait until people are levelled up a bit after launch before selling, when the economy is more healthy and there is less supply of those rarer white items that people may need for professions, quests etc.
---
I won‚Äôt.
---
I've been saving up vacation days, so about 1,5 months of paid leave.
---
Don't know if it was classic, but there was a pacifist no kill gnome run.
---
I had to sub to retail and create a new opposite faction toon... 
---
Or maybe I'm not addicted and don't want to play just 1 game forever? There's no game that you're "supposed to play all the time". 
---
Memories and friends. 
---
Tell him to kill quillboars until you get there, cause you'll get a few levels from discovering zones
---
I'll be taking off 2 weeks, and I plan on hitting 60 in a week and a half, and using the other half to farm my epic mount.
---
You are right, its incredible cheap if i know im going to play for hours. It is not if suddenly find myself not playing for a month or two. then it becomes more like that HBO account that you keep paying after a free month but never use. Vanilla is supposed to stay the same for years to come.
---
The fact that they wont develop anything while im gone adds to this. If i knew i payed for expansions, big or large patches, cosmetics, events like retail i would be "happy" (i dont play retail and quit before tbc) But im paying the same amount and only for the servers.
---
You better believe, just waiting on an exact date!
---
High key mythic+ is mostly interrupting and AOE-stunning like a madman and using heroism on trashpacks.
---
I miss having to cc and think the trash. I miss the trash giving rep and mattering. I miss the trash dropping crafting items and usable blues. 
---
If crossrealm is anything like vanilla, I'd like to not be on their server but in their battlegroup and opposite faction so we can smash them in PvP
---
&gt; Everything in grey vendor (except rocks for those weird rock collector dudes).
---
I used to have a macro that let me vendor everything grey at once in my inventory.  Big time saver.
---
Early Cata dungeons were great! Heroic Stonecore had some nasty trash pulls, and that's if you were able to avoid the pats. 
---
I always thought this was a bug that they couldn't fix at the time.  I don't see any reason not to fix it.
---
Let the humans begin their hearth in ZF before attacking them, that way you only fight the one who actually matters and save time. 
---
Don‚Äôt leave the starting zone until lvl 6 so you can complete the entire first wave of new quests without having to stop or eat (read: it will make the first set of quests a little easier)
---
&gt; Probably get shit dicked everytime you step through gates  
---
Why doe?
---
Yeah HC Shattered Halls was insane
---
Oddly, I enjoyed BCs 5 mans more than the raids.
---
I just can't get into BFA after the opener of the expansion.
---
Just trying to enforce negative reinforcement so you may actuLly do it.
---
Like fat shaming 
---
It works decently for that example. It only has to last until the other dragonkin dies, which shouldn‚Äôt really be more than 10 seconds. It‚Äôs not ideal, but it‚Äôs a use. But my point is that there are less areas where Druid tanking shines exceptionally at level 60, to the point where that is one of the few instances I can think of.
---
Funny, I had a mage fire blast every mob I put into a freezing trap the other day.  That's not fun after I pull the mob using distracting shot.
---
Very few people are going to be 60 in under a week of real time.
---
I‚Äôve spent the last 3 years on and off working on my route and my best times are around 4 to 4.5 days, if you factor in around 4 hours a day of sleep that would be getting close to another day of time. Let‚Äôs say 6 days or so of real time. You also have to factor in massive population (you won‚Äôt be getting out of the starting zones in a rush), server stability and other things.
---
Who? Are these NPCs that will pay you more for rocks?
---
That's a good point... I didn't think about that from eles perspective. Really fucks eles vs rogues.
---
and then need on your drop :)
---
I used to play an MMO called Aion. Each "zone" was instanced with what they called "channels." Players could move between the channels at will via a selectable menu. Various chat functions worked across all channels so you could still talk to people even if in different channels and you could still group with people that were in a different channel. It was meant to combat the swarm of population and was a wonderful feature I feel. I remembered when the WoW server Smolderthorn first opened and me and my friends went there and started leveling...and couldn't. Because there were too many people farming the same 4 mobs. Channels fixed that: too much comp for quest mobs? Switch channels.
---
One thing that suffered, however, was open world PvP as you could switch channels (usually there were 5) and avoid PvP. Other than that, channels were great.
---
Is that what you mean by phasing? A similar system?
---
Gotcha. Yeah laser turkey never really appealed to me, but I would probably get curious at some point. I understand the intricacies of druids well, alone with their inherent quirks. I played one vanilla through wotlk in retail. Vanilla was definitely druids at their most wonky. I say that instead of bad because they did feel rewarding to play. I tanked nearly all of t1 and zg, there wear a few key fights I couldn't talk, but there were also bosses like jind'o that people were stoked to have me on. I also tanked aq20 and some bwl, it was a blast. I only got higher than that in my massage, but I know patchwerk and a few aq20 bosses had a druid tank prio as well. I healed through t2, and even did some Kitty DPS once aq came out. 
---
I fell much less knowledgeable in the shaman aspect and how it compares to what a dudu really felt like.
---
Whoa, you alright dude?
---
Mages are just better than most classes at 60 pvp and they definitely outscale hunters. That being said I imagine a fresh 60 hunter would come out on top quite easily versus a fresh 60 mage. 
---
It‚Äôs only after a mage starts getting some decent gear that they are going to shit on everyone else. 
---
&gt; I wanna see blizzard out of this slope
---
One guy said in video that Classic is one opportunity to show Blizzard that if they just listen fans and keep doing good games we will stay. I really do hope that Classic will have positive effect on company and maybe next expansion they actually deliver something good for us.
---
How are mages in pvp 1-60? Or fresh 60? 
---
A well-played hunter beats all but the best mages.  A poorly played hunter is mage fodder with the dead zone, which can be very frustrating.  Both are pretty skill intensive PvP classes to play.
---
In 1 v 1 matchups, the hunter wins more fights than the mage.  
---
In BGs I'd rather have a mage than a hunter, just a lot more utility with CCs and extremely high damage.   Mages also benefit a lot more from a healer as they can go nuts with AE when being healed while healing a hunter isn't quite as useful. 
---
As far as having fun, I had a lot more fun PvPing with my hunter than with my mage.  I died a little to easy as a mage and a hunter's mobility is just fun.
---
Look I'm playing a hunter cus they're the best class, but you should play a druid cus they're almost the best class. And shamen are boring
---
As someone who doesn't pvp I didn't think of that... Then the problem isn't naxx gear it's lack of higher tier pvp gear. 
---
They are always good in Pvp if you are going frost. Keep in mind that it does take more ‚Äúmechanical‚Äù skill to be a good mage versus and average mage. They have so much outplay potential compared to other classes.
---
If you aren‚Äôt good at playing it and your gear is that good in the end they are still a clothy and can be brought down quickly. 
---
So you have played both mage &amp; hunter at 60? I thought mages were bettet at 1v1s across the board? I was also afraid of being super squishy as a mage, and my main attraction is world pvp, not BGs so theres that. I kinda want to go hunter over mage but what was stopping me was i thought mages were alot better across the board. What do u think?
---
Damn I'm fat too. This is going to fail.  
---
Yes but there are many more white items then there are bank slots, and when you factor in the time of listing it all I guess what im asking is which white items really stand out as things to never sell. Whereas most uncooked food items are white and i usually sell them, same with a lot of the animal parts and so on. I know that spider silk however is used for making excellent boots and is worth keeping. A lot of other spider items i just vendor though.
---
I've got a sore throat coming on, which I think will cause me to be ill for a couple of days in the summer.
---
Absofreakinglutely. Human Paladin. It‚Äôll be fun! Lvling with the guild.
---
I miss how deadly trash were in vanilla and feeling reallg great if I could beat both if i'd pull two by accident
---
..and then get shot in the neck by a hunter from opposite faction, or stabbed in the spleen by a rogue :)
---
Is it summer yet?
---
I think streamers are being a bit full of themselves if they think they can alter a server that much. Its one person in one location trolling, no different then any other booty bay troll.
---
RP rock boys maybe? I never encountered rock collectors in my vanilla time. Might be a private server thing.
---
Why don't you cook the food and then you can sell food to warriors and priests out in the world?
---
Some of the larger streamers will likely have a noticeable affect on the servers that they play on.
---
But it's not just the streamer that I'd want to avoid, it's also their fan base.
---
&gt; So you have played both mage &amp; hunter at 60?
---
Yes, my first 60 was a mage.  My 4th 60 was a hunter.  I spent about equal time on both, but I knew the game much better by the time I rolled a hunter.  I really wished I'd rolled a hunter from day one.  It was just more my play style than was the mage.
---
&gt; I thought mages were bettet at 1v1s across the board?
---
Not in my experience.  However, I was one of the better PvP hunters on my server and there were not a lot of naxx geared mages on my server.  
---
Hunters during leveling especially OPed with beastmaster spec.  Once I got bestial wrath(40) I used to hide behind a tree, sick my pet on a mage or warlock and watch him fail uselessly as my pet ate him alive while I didn't take a lick of damage.  Having radar to find people in World PvP is a big advantage as well.
---
&gt;I was also afraid of being super squishy as a mage, and my main attraction is world pvp, not BGs so theres that.
---
On the plus side for world PvP, sheep then pryoblast is a lot of fun.  Nothing like burning people to death.  On the downside, you'll frequently die to rogues and hunters and you will be squishy without really good gear.  A well-geared frost mage is a very dangerous weapon 1 v1.
---
Again though, mages, in general, are at there best working with a group in PvP while hunters excel as lone wolves in PvP.
---
Everyone plays Rogues. Rogues kill Mages.
---
Both have high skill ceilings and both are really good, if I were you i'd just decide which one I like better thematically. 
---
I like retail dungeons and raids a lot more if they were scaled to one difficulty like it was in vanilla, the mechanincs are a lot more fun.
---
you are right, I forgot that simple solution, being so used to  our '  disenchanter needs, the rest passes' routine  (Need because that is safer if anybody does anything else by accident)
---
bad thinking on my part
---
Yes
---
what's your tip for taking out rogues as a hunter? Also, I generally agree with your assessment that Hunter will Usually get the better of Mages. I mained a mage and hated rogues and hunters.....and locks.
---
You probably wont regret rolling hunter from what I‚Äôve read of the above. 
---
yeah, taurens ain't exactly in the best place unless we're talking warrior (they're fucking amazing at that, though). 
---
for shamans, except enhancement, you're kinda screwed, for druids, restoration suffers without any obvious benefit (forms don't give a shit about their hitbox), and hunters are all kinds of fucked.
---
but even for warriors and enhancement shamans, war stomp can fuck you over, since it has a cast time... so it resets swing timer. the extra 2-3 yards, however, more than make up for it.
---
3.0 yards ‚âà 2.7 metres ^(1 yard ‚âà 0.92m)

Mostly watching people getting ganked in full world buffs, while I laugh in PVE server.
---
Bosses in heroics could just about be solod by the end of the expansion. I remember sprinting ahead to anub trying to lock out as many people as possible 
---
It's a bit surprising, but from my experience, mages are not that amazing in 1v1. In general, hunter and lock beats you. Good priests beat you. Rogue can be a 50/50 against a good one. Druid either beats you or runs away. Shamans wreck you as well. It's in group PvP where mages shine and use their CC to its full potential. Even though you can put up a fight against all the classes, you still lose guaranteedly against almost half the classes. This is during leveling obviously, it can differ at 60 and with raid gear, but it generally stays the same.
---
You *severely* underestimate how stupid a 12,000 person viewer base mostly compromised of annoying children can be. 
---
smallish thing, but in vanilla, everything could be disenchanted even with the skill of 1... so if you're planning on switching profession at level 60 (say, from skinning to engineering), keep the soulbound blues. 
---
why? you're gonna be dropping a profession anyway, it's not a big step to pick up enchanting and disenchant your useless gear, instead of vendoring, then pick up your desired profession.
---
no idea on how much extra gold you could gather this way, but judging from the cost of some enchants... it's might very well be worth it and doesn't cost a thing.
---
Boe greens that may be valuable for alts. My main will be keeping an eye out for mail for my inevitable warrior. That gear will go a long way. 
---
Same idea, save consumables that will be relevant for alts
---
It's ok. You can let the fear tears/regret of betraying your allies and friends out when you get home bby girl &lt;3.
---
Not that you'll live long enough to cast the bubble!
---
If you google leveling full streams you should be able to level alongside a video.
---
I'd be ok with them fixing this as long as it involved 0 adjustment in armor size or shape.
---
In the same vein, is it useful to have a set of 'combat' and  a set of reg gear to switch via macro between fights?
---
All 687 pages of Green Hills of Stranglethorn.  You know, just in case.
---
I guess it depends how you define "better". Both are fine, both can clear the content, but druids can do it with a lower skill ceiling and a bigger health/armour buffer against silly wipes.
---
Right. And cooked food also sells for quite a bit to vendors too. 
---
Back then, games were made for players, not for streamers. 
---
Looking to know what server streamers roll on so we can never meet.
---
Been playing on Kronus3, the level 40 Skullsplitter Trolls drop pages at a stupid-high rate. I'd say sell/vendor the pages until you're clearing out those trolls.
---
Tell me that when you're standing on top of your bank and playing the roof is lava game jumping from spike to spike.
---
It really depends on the groups, lesser geared or less experienced groups often still use hard CC like traps, banish, sheep etc. While better geared or more experienced groups take the soft CC route where possible and make a lot more use of stuns, interrupts and slows. 
---
Which i feel is a more dynamic gameplay and more rewarding than just "You sheep the X, You banish the Moon, kill the skull"
---
Recipes. Usually found recipes require mats that are annoying to get (gems, elixirs, elements, other crafted items, etc), but every once in a while you'll find a recipe for an item that either sells well or you will really want on an alt.
---
Linen and Wool you don't need (excess) should be banked for your alt's quality of life.
---
Some quest items can be accumulated past the max you need, and can therefore be given to alts.
---
Extra bags. Even 6-slot bags are a godsend to a fresh toon, and once you're level 50+, having a few 10-slot bags lying around will be common and you can send those to alts.
---
Vanity items. I like to keep flavor-text-heavy items that have no purpose but are neat to look back on. Quest items that don't get consumed, scrolls describing quests, letters, orders, reports, etc.
---
As Rogue, leveling throwing to deal more damage to trash from far away not to get in danger of aggroing two or more enemies. Macros like Gouge + Target self + Use Bandage. Also, how good pickpocketing is. I made and will make many pickpocketing runs early on to get enough money for skills and epic mount. 
---
Yo, I am planning to take 3 weeks off work which will give me approximately about 21 days of Classic play time.
---
^ THIS
---
Mage has so much defensive utility that relies on actually reacting to situations - knowing how to use that mana shield even if it'll leave you at one mana just because you can eek away and regen.
---
 
---
Or making sure that you know how and when to use your wards or stall fights enough with sheeps, rank 1 frostbolts, and anything you can get your grimy little gnome paws on to reset cooldowns on that counterspell you'll need to blanket burst the priest or completely shut down a shaman.
---
It's amazing you'll love mage if you put in even a small amount of time, trust me :)
---
Not really true- mage rogue is one of the most fun skill match-ups in terms of 1v1 that favors the mage 60-40 if they're prepared IMO
---
I have seen a lot of people argue that Druid is the best tank at lower levels. I am no expert on Druid, but iirc you should go for agility+stamina gear and you‚Äôll be fine
---
Lots of people who follow Joanas guide don't follow it completely. He literally kills what he can on his way places. Lots of people who follow the guide will just run places with auto run. That's a lot of time wasted already. Even with his guide, he did it that fast as a hunter... for people who don't level a hunter, it will take them longer. 
---
I keep rare gem drops, hides, leathers, cloths, alchemy and engineering ingredients as well as fun stuff such as Chicken/Parrot pets. I will probably make many runs in Deadmines just to get full Defias black leather set and wear it sometimes to feel like a badass Rogue on RP server.
---
Stealth negates being prepared.
---
Liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiight of ELUNE
---
Time where you had to use your polymorphs, saps, blinds so you can clear trash and don't wipe. Yeah, I do.
---
GEMS?
---
SIR THIS IS A CLASSIC WOW SUBREDDIT.
---
Druid got some really good oh shit tools for different situation (innervate, and battle rez) but they can be tough to place while tanking (it's definitively possible, i have done it a lot of time to save a wipe because a healer got oom, just have to find an opening where you can pop out of bear form without being killed (letting a dps aggro a mob and letting the mob go away to then feral charge and get a 2 sec without being hit for example).
---
I disagree with the better damage reduction part. At this stage of the game, druid got far better health pool and armor, mobs won't crush and they are both not def capped.
---
Druid also have the advantage to being immune to polymorph and disarm (really useful in some dungeon). 
---
I must be honest. 
---
It's rather not level, but item level, to really start wrecking you need about MC/ZG/AQ20 gear. Otherwise by going offensive stats like 9% hit, you shave off too much defensive attributes like str and stamina. 
---
Also you need a phat 2hander like Zinrokh, BRE, Ashkandi, TuF etc. to really make it work. There is just not enough difference between Aracanite Reaper and 1hander like Krolblade or Dalrend MH.
---
When you get to lvl 58-60, you really should do dungeons in prot + 1h + shield build. Makes everything much smoother.
---
Especially if you like to play dynamically like watching your healers mana and immediately engaging groups of mobs when your healer is at 80% mana even though your mage's is at 20%. Having your melee group teammate and healer is enough to engage the next mob group.
---
If you 2hand tank with shitty gear, your healer will constantly be at 20% mana and you will wait endlessly for them to drink.
---
Normal Grim Batol was heroic MgT level lol
---
Nothing.
---
That's if I was playing nornally sure but for this run I want to test purly Agil/Int gear (Gear that share those 2 stats, I'll be buying them from main).. so I'm wondering how viable it would be with only a small amount of stamina
---
I refuse to play Classic unless this issue gets resolved.
---
&gt; within a couple months of launch.
---
Actually, literally a week or two.
---
Love the idea you should definitely try it and let us know how it goes
---
Sir, I am sorry you are not entertained
---
Quests give the same amount of experience at every level, as long as they are not grey. Use this to your advantage, especially warriors, since you're leveling is typically slower than others.
---
Mapping out a general leveling path helps in the long run. "I'm level 43 and I'm not sure what to do, so I'll just grind for an hour" works but isn't fun. Get an idea for what levels should be done where.

Wouldnt have been the same, if there wasnt stupid hard trash mobs in vanilla.  
---
Every end game 5-man and raid not yet on farm felt like an adventure. You couldnt just go on auto pilot, not even on trash mobs.  
---
It made vanilla exciting, and every group/raid different.
---
Aww I feel bad for you poor disappointed hordie&lt;3
---
Play the way you want. But difficult things are difficult and stay difficult. I loved and hated the game for that.
---
I know and that's what I'm saying, there is no one solution, all of these companies want to make money, whether they want to implement a subscription or give players "choices" to chose what they want to have access to it's all the same, you still have to dish out money for content if not for cosmetics or quality of life features or items.
---
I hope they announce it soon since in mid April the vacation need to be turned in, and i have no idea if its releaseing in june or august. But im planning 3 of my weeks of vacation to go to classic.
---
Any good shaman can wreck a mage with purge, grounding totem and earth shock but good hunters can take shamans all day. Speaking from experience lol.
---
Thanks dude, maybe he/she/it will understand after 2 explanations.
---
Im thinking espenyolo launch, margereitas and nachos. Every time I ding im going to take a shot of tequila!
---
But.. you had to do most of the hard Heroics just to enter Kara :D
---
Real life goals
---
Quite honestly, I hold onto ANYTHING that can be sold on the AH. Specially starting, it's a nice way to get just a little income flow going while you level. 
---
When I aoe farm in westfall at lvl 16-18 I often think to myself, ‚Äùdamn I should be streaming this‚Äù rofl :-D Pretty much the best stream to watch IMO
---
There is always a mage in kargath selling portals. 
---
2 years? There has to be a story here.
---
On a fresh server - elemental earth from Badlands.  On pvt servers the mobs are camped day and night by 60s and each one sells for 5g.
---
If you're levelling there uncontested then it would easily be worth grinding there for as long as possible and banking every item until the economy/demand is there
---
We always MC pulled it, helped greatly...ahh those were the shadowpriest days
---
Tangy clam meat, just because it's the most convenient for leveling cooking at a certain level range, and should be put on ah. Small flame sac, from welps, used for fire resist potions or melee dps food.
---
/camp sets up a nice tent and campfire for you so you can relax a bit.
---
I can't remember the dungeon's name, but one BC naga dungeon stands out in my memory as one of the first times I *really* had trouble healing once i'd gotten out of vanilla dungeons.
---
Chiefly because some of the mobs mind controlled. The horrorshow didn't really begin until *I* got mind controlled and psychic screamed my allies into all of the mobs all over the room. That were  *also* mind controlling. So much hilarity ensued that by the time I was freed I had no mana and the tank who had by now killed everyone *else* was now beating on my face.
---
I faceplanted while levelling so often in that particular dungeon it was frightening, and it was not unusual for toons I created later to have the same trouble.
---
Giant trash pulls may have been the norm by then in wrath, but that particular dungeon did *not* make it a good idea.
---
On private servers you can use the add on outfitter. So you can just click 1 buton to change in to your spirit gear. I'm guessing somebody will make this same add on for Classic.
---
Gems are in vanilla.
---
Baron and Scholo mostly. Want to run them all again though (gnomeregan only once).
---
I have to admit that I felt personally offended when they threw Anub'Arak under the buss for some lowbie WOTLK 5men dungeon. Felt so cheap to kill the patron of the lich king himself in a 5men.
---
He could've been the personal bodyguard of Arthas leading into ICC. 
---
One easy fight? So sad
---
‚ÄùThe majority of the playerbase‚Äù. Hmm I fear the main problem is that blizz started listening to players, listening in the wrong way. Players go for the path of least resistance due to perceived competitive advantages.
---
When whining pays off, the kids will whine more to get even more. This is exactly when ‚Äùlistening‚Äù starts to become equal to shooting themselves in the foot.
---
The solution (To Doom) is tough love and hard, rewarding gameplay that doesn‚Äôt cater to spamming idiots, please!
---
This.  This is why Classic WoW. 
---
Just mail everything to bank alt, start auctin addon and auction everything every few days
---
Only save [Big Bear Meat] to periodically link in casual conversation. Vendor everything else. 
---
The first time I charged into the guy with the octopus on his head and I just got massacred. I didnt know what was going on.
---
Blizzard teased a release date in November. They had 2 toons for their demo. One was a lvl 16 gnome named July (July 16). The other was Osconty, which if searched on YouTube is a video from July 16, 2006 of a naxxramas run. 
---
I think they did it this way to prevent making an official announcement in case they move the date back.
---
This seems like a useless project. Too much time on your hands? Not saying this in a derogatory way, but this is my feedback. Level a druid and test different gear layouts. That should do it. 
---
Ah I see. I am sure that for lower levels you won‚Äôt have any issues at all. I guess that once you reach like 30-40+ you‚Äôll start noticing it getting tougher and tougher from the lack of stamina. 
---
See, your knowledge is already lacking. In 90% of the dungeons you wanted to let the caster freecast, because often it was a 2-3second cast with lame little damage, whereas 2 melees with lots of health and armor would strain mana significantly. Think about ogre in Dire Maul.   
---
Either let them freecast or LoS them and the caster runs in and gets cleaved easily by random damage, because of low armor and health. 
---
The Mauler would stand with 80% health and fresh as a daisy in the middle of the cleave.
---
Lmao. Same. Hibernation mode activated. üò¥
---
Small egg
---
Do pally ever bubble hearth while questing?
---
Well, from a pvp perspective, I think totems are one of the most fun aspects of shaman. Grounding totem is an interesting alternative to stopping a spell, from the normal interrupt. 
---
I‚Äôm waiting on making a shaman till a possible BC classic, because most of my experience with shaman was in BC and wotlk, and I would feel lacking without earth shield, insta ghost wolf, and hex (wotlk). Mostly insta ghost wolf really. But if you haven‚Äôt played shaman before, you wouldn‚Äôt share this particular issue. For the record, I‚Äôm also waiting on Druid.
---
But I‚Äôd argue that totems should be a reason to roll shaman, not a con. If they seem unappealing to you, I‚Äôd question how shaman could be your top choice when you have time for one character.
---
Also, I agree on choosing war stomp! War stomp is great for a shaman and lots of fun, and I have fond memories of winning 100% of my duels in wotlk (when I did serious arena) against all the other top ele shamans on the server, where stomp probably helped me. In vanilla, orc 25% stun resist is arguably the best before it‚Äôs nerfed I‚Äôm BC, but war stomp is more fun, skill dependent, etc. and still very good, and as someone rolling orc for the warlock/warrior/hunter I am considering, I would still choose a Tauren shaman! (Full disclosure, my first toon was my Tauren shaman midway through vanilla, so I may have some nostalgic bias.)
---
AoE has always crited, are you thinking about the downscaling when hitting large packs?
---
Not really. In the time you can farm 1 or 2 arcane crystals you can probably farm 5 stacks of dreamfoil, plaguebloom, blindweed, mountain silver sage (to a lesser degree) and make more gold than you would from mining, and you still have a chance at black lotus spawns too. This is all dependant on server econ but there are a lot of good herbs that are far more abundant than the rich thorium veins that have a 3% chance to drop a crystal. When you herb you‚Äôre guaranteed the drop, rich thorium rarely drops the arcane crystal and thorium itself doesn‚Äôt sell for that much on any server I‚Äôve been on.
---
There was a guy, a Nelf Warrior, who leveled to 60 without a weapon. I can't remember his name though... 
---
Aye I really enjoyed this difficulty. 
---
Even from the first dungeon, RFC, you need to sheep some mobs or you will wipe
---
You mean blessed as in special? And by special you mean?
---
Beware of talking sea otters !

I've just went back to university after a 20 year gap -long boring story- but it means i have a lot of free time this summer. I'm seriously considering plowing a pile of that into wow, i will have both of my children to care for too though.  
---
Because the high armor pet does everything the off tank can do in most cases. Sometimes the pet "fails the group" but most times that's the healer abandoning it.
---
There's gonna be multiple answers to this plus differences between instances. But I'll give an idea.
---
MT (Improved BS)
---
MM/BM Hunter with trueshot
---
Leader of the pack druid
---
Paladin/Shaman (Proly enhancment shaman healer'd be best)
---
Rogue  with improved sap
---
In vanilla, wasn't the feral druid buff 5% crit + life steal?
---
I arrived at a list through research, pre-bis lists and so on. Look at bosses in dungeons, search dbs for what they drop, etc. I haven‚Äôt seen a by-dungeon list as such. 
---
Just use the drake equation 
---
This
---
Naxx is for babies, real end game is not touching the lava
---
Why does it matter? They are both super good. As a mage I prefer a druid tank. And I find that druids have a better attitude in general, which I appreciate. Some warriors seem to think that they are spitzenklasse for simply rolling and wearing a shield. It is not so.
---
Best stat for you if you only want to carry one set is Stam&gt;strength=intel&gt;agi&gt;spirit
---
Agi is very weak in bear form and the armor it provides is insignificant.
---
Stam is your priority stat because bear are just a punching bag with a lot of hp, strength will increase your dps and thus your threat. Intel is always good for healing and shit while leveling outside of instance.
---
Otherwise drood is a great tank a low level and higher lvl too, you just need to keep your gear up to date since you'll have less mitigation than warrior and healer will go oom faster
---
Sorry. Was thinking of blizzard and it was in fact WotLK that they made it crit. Still a bad change though. 
---
In that case, a few deaths to discipline them is the correct answer.
---
Druids are great aoe tanks, learn to play comes to mind.
---
Wait what?
---
You got any prof/evidiance for that? Sounds completly blizzlike though!
---
&gt;However, that is one of the only things blizzard is doing right now on retail with Mythic plus'.
---
I couldn't agree more! Not having played since Cataclysm, it was so refreshing to do Mythics. It was the first time I felt I had to take dungeons seriously in BfA, actually using CC, focusing on good execution, rather than mindlessly AoEing everything down as the tank runs straight through pulling everything at once. I also like that you have to form a group yourself and actually go to the instance portal.
---
Your experiences on private servers are not how vanilla was.
---
&gt; How much better are mages then hunters at 60 pvp?
---
they are not.
---
&gt; If mages are better overall ill roll one
---
see above
---
if you are a good player then hunters are the supreme leaders or vanilla PvP.  
---
5-6k life killing machines with tools for every job and only 1 downside, the deadzone.
---
While levelig a shaman I just kept Int gear from quests or excess dungeon loot and when running as a healer I would swap the gear, while when not - enhancement gear. Also don't expect to have lots of mail while leveling (and you can wear mail from level 40 onwards).
---
mainly I will use the Southfury for fishing. other then that...
---
Trash mobs were still pretty crazy in BC.
---
Shattered Halls felt so bad ass. I remember the first time I did it even though its basically just one long hall way it took us like 2 hours.
---
Why not just carry 2 set ? If you are tanking in bear its not like you will be able to go out of form and heal.
---
I miss the times WoW was a challenge.
---
anywhere from global to minutes.
---
most burst combos can be avoided or need setup so I'd say that generally the fights last arround 5-20 seconds.
---
Every hour i creep the forums for news i set the filters on youtube for newest videos of classic wow and sort through all the trash pvp videos looking for the next new thing. I think its slowly killing me i might just go out side and do this lol. then i can live my dreams of playing a rogue in stv with the beach boys wouldn't it be nice playing in the back ground. 
---
Proof? You can just look it up :) 
---
I like the "noob" macro.
---
A week if I can. Big if, sadly.
---
For me it was always about the person who was streaming then the gameplay itself.
---
This is why WoW will always be a classic 
---
The best tank is the one you can find at the time who isn't shit tbqh. Save optimisation for raids unless you're planning on helping someome farm ironfoe or some shit.
---
I can't really comment on which one is the better 5 man tank by hard numbers, but I do know that Druid is easier to tank with, which makes it simply better for pugs.
---
Better overall than hunters, though a good hunter can still shut you down pretty hard if you don't focus them.
---
I have never done it, but for classic I think I just might :) Thinking about 2 - 3 days plus weekend.
---
same here. i will take 1 week. if i can afford i will take 2. i have to take 2 weeks at a fixed time cause the kindergarden of my daughter is closed in summer. would be so nice if the release is in that time. then i can even make it 3 weeks :D
---
&gt;what's your tip for taking out rogues as a hunter?
---
I don't have any really decent tips, but here goes:
---
Double crippling poison and be ready for the FD focus transfer to the pet.   If he's speced BM, get him to burn his BW, blind the hunter, run away &amp; vanish.  Then come back when the pet is not big and red.  Kill the hunter before BW comes up again and use blind or evasion on the pet to avoid damage.  If he's marks go for the full stunlock, which is hard if he's smart enough to keep flair up. 
---
wise words. Somehow I have never managed to be online on the launch of any retail expansion, so I have never really understood all the complaints and cries
---
Opposite for me. Their high armor and hp pool makes the damage more consistent incoming damage that is easy to anticipate the healing. Warrior on the other hand avoids damage for the fiest few rounds and then suddenly comes a surprise spike of damage once Shield block wears off.
---
Compare with 1.12 talents and not your shaky memory of early vanilla, clueless dude.
---
Blackrock Depths
---
Maraudon
---
If you assume pserver rates to be accurate you're going to be in for a surprise.
---
but this isn't your OC!
---
i thought it doesn't cause you want the other payment method that they're not gonna implement?
---
:)
---
Okay, I may be kinda crazy, but if you have a good group...then Gnomer is a blast to explore!
---
Solid strat.
---
Selling these during Winterveil bought my epic mount.
---
I was gonna take a week off. But I think I‚Äôm gonna just do 3 days (that‚Äôs a vacay for me!) since I‚Äôm rolling a hunter and I have a wife and kid. Plus I work 60+ hours a week. I‚Äôll probably never get to do any raiding
---
I 100% know that feel. the waiting is killing me
---
Hopefully it will be at least 5-6k during primetime. 
---
High populations are one of the few non-blizzlike changes on pservers I and the majority on those servers liked a lot. Everyone that didnt play on such a server and demands a blizzlike 2,5k cap should be careful doing so. Recruiting on low pop servers is hard, finding dungeon grps outside of primetime will be hard (especially for lower dungeons after the majority hit 60), getting bg pops outside of primetime will be hard (especially in lower brackets). There are actually a lot of disadvantages from having low pop servers while all disadvantages can be fixed with dynamic respawns on mobs / gathering nodes.
---
No it's limited to about what he said on all 1.12 servers 
---
Years played Vanilla playing on pserver starting with E, and can 100% confirm this. For 5 man dungeons Druid is often superior. It is especially apparent with AoE threat, meaning you can AoE and burn down pulls even faster.
---
Not talking about Druids tanking raids here. But when it comes to dungeons, they're very good.
---
Not rare gems.
---
People watch streams mostly for the streamer, not for the content. Also I don't think wow classic gameplay is more boring to watch than generic steam survival game where you run around and punch trees for hours.
---
I like this answer a lot.
---
I met a ton who did. 
---
Some ran into unwinnable odds vs npc's just to loot/activate something and then get out. Others just as they were about to loose/die in pvp.
---
The strange thing is, everyone I always knew laughed not cried. If a paladin bubble hearthed from PvP it was a statement they had lost/couldn't win. Most of the people I knew used to smile and mock the paladin as it hearthed, knowing full well it usually had a long trip back to the questing area.
---
Deadmines is absolutely my favourite dungeon. Really unique, especially for a low-level one with how it suddenly turns from a mine into an underground pirate ship. Looking forward to fighting Mr Smite again!
---
This is the way for me too.
---
Could you imagine? People taking time off work and the servers are shit because overpopulation the first few days....
---
I expect them not devoting any artists to this project. It's a done game. Bugs and exploits will be fixed but that's it.
---
Even if something like this would have everyone's approval, it won't happen.
---
Nah. 
---
I think Classic WoW will be the perfect game to come home to and play for a few hours at night, extended session or 2 on the weekend for me. I did the grinding back in the day, now I'm just going to take my time and enjoy the world.

---
If you play like a rogue might be in the bushes - keeping up ice barrier as you drink in the wild, not letting yourself get too low on resources, saving important cooldowns rather than going for gun-ho pulls, and having that trigger finger on blink- you might be surprised how prepared you can be.
---
No, just normals
---
Not for me.
---
To solve clipping you have to change either armor size/shape along with animations. Those things are iconic in classic.
---
I wouldn't want them changed anyway, but for clipping? I don't really care about it tbh.
---
Alliance bring glory, horde bring shame 
---
U should be ashamed
---
PS : that cool tho :p 
---
Yeah, because of timers. Timers kill off all immersion and RPG feeling there is, not to mention that you make up routes and plans before dungeon and then silently execute it for the most part. First time someone fails it is basically over "gg won't make it" and group disbands.
---
It is FUN but god it is not rewarding at all except for rio dick measuring and even that gets old fast when you realize you basically have to run M+ 24/7 to keep up.
---
Even simple things can be a challenge if your only objective is do be fast.
---
ANATHEMA BRUVS
---
Haha fair enough. 
---
But if sometime in the future, classic dies out, would you not like something to happen? 
---
Personally i would prefer classic to remain classic. But if it were to die out, i wouldn't mind small changes. Like devilsaur farming will eventually be meaningless, will it not? Adding something like a new fish pool that drops something interesting, which would be fought over. Or anything that dosnt really change classic like TBC would. 
---
If your second laptop ever does talk let us know! 
---
I always take a few weeks off of work during summer, so might aswell try to fit it in with the classic release.
---
Literally about to comment this. Fond memories, even in low gear.
---
Already told the wife that no matter what, im gonna be locked away for a good week when it launches \^\^ need a release date soon so we neckbeards can plan for real LOL
---
Trap them then kite. 
---
To be fair, they always intended Grim Batol to be a low-level dungeon. Correct me if I'm wrong but I think Kevin Jordan said it was always intended to be a dungeon in the 30's with a Jail-theme ala. Stockades, but they never got around to implement it because they already had a list of 50 dungeons (all of which were being worked on in terms of what it was going to contain) that had to be culled. It's a shame really, I've always liked the dwarves and their lore. 
---
Everyone knows you kill Skull, sheep moon, sap circle.
---
have my like
---
A lot of the white named items are used in various professions, and the demand for the items they make will ebb and flow with the current of the server and progression. For example, [http://classicdb.ch/?item=7191](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7191) fused wiring doesn't seem like a big deal, can drop from the goblin shredders in STV, but those can sell for 1-5g each, as they're used in the field repair bots that raiding guilds use. Also, [http://classicdb.ch/?item=7070#reagent-for](http://classicdb.ch/?item=7070#reagent-for) elemental water is used for greater frost protection pots, so save 'em up, and once guilds are running naxx, toss 'em, on the AH for some sweet $$$.
---
I see so many people vendor their white items, and miss out on a chance for some great gold making.
---
"Sure, send in the little guy"
---
All that 'reserved' shit that I see on Private servers wasn't a normal thing in vanilla,
---
I remember people LFM xxx reserved, and someone else would just start a group LFM no reserves.  
---
I won't join reserve groups in classic, Its wishful thinking, but I hope that reserve shit pisses off.
---
After this picture i feel like a bear in hibernation. :)
---
better yet stand on the campfire so the damage prevents you from being sapped while guarding flags
---
I'm not even trying to be mean but if that's your experience you're just kind of bad at it. Maybe some of that is true while leveling but it is definitely not the case at 60. 
---
Blergh, gnomes.
---
Yeah, I remember 3.3 and on was the first time I remember watching the LFG 15 min Cooldown to see how fast we could clear. Azjol'Nerub would be over and done in like 4 minutes... The only one that gave people any trouble was The Oculus, which ironically is one of my favorite 5-mans from WotLK. The bosses in that dungeon were challenging compared to the rest of the xpacs 5mans. 
---
You have my dagger
---
I was online for launch night the first time around, and while it's fun to tell the stories of 80 level 1 taurens all trying to kill the same 12 plainstriders, I think this time I'll wait a day or two for the numbers to thin out first, THEN I'll take off a week to dive deep into the experience.
---
Things are a bit different now, though...healthy gaming snacks instead of hotpockets, taking a break every 3 or 4 hours to get up and take a walk instead of growing roots at my pc for 14 hours, sPeNdInG tImE wItH tHe WiFe instead of telling the gf "errr...yeah, I'm kinda busy today, sorry, can't hang", lol.
---
hmm intesting, back in classic it used to be sold for  300-500 g. My guess is because so many people farm the orbs this book drops more which makes less valuable then. Back then that might not have been a farming strat anyone used
---
Druids can easily tank 5mans. Shaman falls apart as a tank at higher levels from what I understand.
---
Right you are! I'm a moron heh
---
So playing inefficiently just because there may be a rogue around.
---
As a rule of thumb, if you start from the start of that starting zone, you'll be able to do pretty much every quest.
---
Nice repost you got there!
---
This is 2019 Germany right now.
---
Deadmines is certainly going to be the #1 spot just because i will require cookies cooking rod to finally be able to level as my priest :D
---
Aside from that Shadowfang Keep because of it's tight corridors and guaranteed adds that WILL be happening at numerous places during the instance when running with underleveled healers.
---
When it comes to endgame, Scholomance is fine and fun but I'm really just looking forward to that mega dungeon that is Blackrock. There's no better dungeon.
---
Tell me about your efficiency as your running back to your corpse; unless your planning on playing on a pve server?
---
I only plan on taking release day (to get the character names that I want) and maybe the next day as well.  No plans to rush to level, so I prefer to save my WOW vacation days for a little further in once all of the bugs have been ironed out.
---
Science damn you Time Child!
---
Are you running back to your corpse 100% of the time? Because you're not using your abilities 100% of the time in preparation for something that may not happen.
---
Well the reason they are not perfect is it's an opinion piece from someone who has not played classic well, since classic.
---
This is why a warlock + 2 rogues was a super meta for dungeon farming

**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**

**Dedicated PvE** ***with a social atmosphere***
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‚Äòsemi-hardcore‚Äô guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‚Äòoff-spec‚Äô. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, **we may also try to vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.

I read that most leather is not worth banking, and should rather be vendored. For those who are not leatherworkers, of course.
---
Asmongold is all I need.
---
That is equally if not worse of a problem for a warrior. But it's also irrelevant because you got bigger problems if your dps can't follow the simplest of instructions.
---
Hunters need a lot of food early on for feeding unruly pets who are always hungry.
---
No they are real people who collect rocks for real.
---
Long story short: please dont try to turn old expansions to shit, like Blizz did with Panda-BfA
---
Yeah, i'm going to level a rogue first. But my next char will be a mage.
---
So every single good cloth item (sta/int/spirit/frost damage) i will safe for my mage. Will also safe mana potions for my mage too
---
started MC with Arcanite Reaper and arms spec, rerolled 2h fury, dmg was much better.
---
2 hand fury with the untamed blade in BWL was a blast.
---
Only switched to dw fury once i got crul shorukh and dooms edge. Later crul and thunderfury .
---
Sure. But dont you at all worry that once vanilla content is done, and played for years it will die out? 
---
You have lvl 1 bank alts for that. "STVpageOne" with a bank full of page 1's ;-)
---
nah. but classic is a grind. i got to 12 on a pserver and am back to retail. maybe when I have IRL friends to play classic with but it is indeed a grind. looking fwd tho lol
---
Nah, they don't drop pages at a stupidly high rate. It's just that you need to kill a stupidly high number for the necklaces :P
---
Definately bank the blue twink items. They go for just a couple of gold in early days because nobody has money. But when people start to alt up and have their mounts, the Feet of the Lynx cost will rise exponentially.
---
Probably not because of how many releases Ive seen go to total shitshow first days and I would be so mad if it happen with this. 
---
That‚Äôs never gonna happen 
---
You would be missing out of a decent amount of gold for your level 40 mount by doing this though. How does that go?
---
True, but there's also this thing called 'opportunity cost'. It takes time to organize your bank slots (spread over your bank alts too probably), it costs money to increase your bank slots, it takes time to find a banker and bank the white stuff etc etc.
---
Sometimes the opportunity cost is higher than just vendoring and moving on.
---
Agi is better than u think. While it certainly brings a little amount of armor there's also some dodge and crit (==threat from damage +rage for even more threat through skills) from it. There is a reason many feral-thought gear is str/agi/sta. 
---
That's probably true. Though I would say that if your jumping into classic within the first few weeks, you could probably make a bit of cash. Also you can sell some bits and pieces of leather for quest items or specific craftable guns and heavier armor, if I remember correctly.
---
BUT yes you are correct, sir. 
---
I'll be unemployed by June, so I'm excited!
---
Gonna play lots of hours per day, just like the old times :)
---
You hero
---
It would suck if you were to take a day off and were unable to play for most of it. But there is only ever going to be one more classic launch probably so I have to take the risk.
---
Ah, the mandatory pserver hater comment that adds nothing to the discussion, nice
---
My [Large Red Sack] itches.
---
Im running a nice company right now. and im slowly delegating a lot of the work towards people who are interested in growing or at least working themselves a little up in the company. plus doing a bit of changes so that i dont have to be involved so much all the time in every little thing we do here. People at work think im doing this to help a few of them further their career. 
---
But actually all im doing is making it easier for myself to play wow when the game eventually gets out :(
---
Coilfang Reservoir had 3 instances; Underbog, The Steamvault and Slave Pens. Good memories running those heroics in T3/blues. 
---
Grim Batol, with the red elite dragons guarding it
---
AQ trash to twin emps + some Naxx trash where harder then bosses in the [raids.](https://raids.So) So epic!
---
Friends and a good guild make the grind much better if you are not into. Leveling with other is a good way to do it too.
---
And it was :)
---
You'll be wasting your gold on a gear that's not optimal for neither spec.
---
Stick to agi/sta/str for bear and int/spirit for healing
---
As much as I love classic wow and will be playing it, taking time off work is such a waste, play wow before/after work and in days off and save your holidays for actual holidays, don‚Äôt waste them like that!
---
Wow that‚Äôs so sad and unhealthy, as good as wow is there‚Äôs more to life than thatüòû
---
Drama
---
Hopefully you can! The more the merrier
---
New bakground, quelserrar in r13 gear? im not buying it
---
I want an Alliance one ! :)
---
I think I caught that too ;) *cough cough* i think I'll need the whole week off it's pretty bad. 
---
Yah that's basically what I assumed about them hearth. Sorta like I'm glad they are hearthing
---
Pic is from tbc so literally irrelevant /s
---
Even if doable,  is that even having fun?
---
I stand corrected. You are totally right... that means I maybe wasn't that bad of a player back in the day like I thought. :D
---
yea, same  
---
I enjoyed Legion m+ way more. BFA m+ is just way too intense. Not only are trash super tough but they also have lots of ridiculous mechanics that can be very tough to deal properly with in a pug.  
---
This is why I quit
---
The funny thing is that your argument could be used to justify giving people with Naxx gear their own battleground bracket.
---
There will be progression, so you can't do Naxx on launch for example. Everything else you mention is probably (no one knows for sure) implemented at launch, yes.
---
And thats wrong because...? I've played the crap out of Gothic, but guess what? I've finished the game several times and moved on.
---
&gt;The problem with Naxx geared players is that they break the high-level PvP game and ruin it for normal players, that is the issue any apologia has to address. And it never satisfactorily does.
---
&gt;Nonsense. Naxx geared players are an annoying minority and everyone else would much rather wait a few minutes longer than have to be in a battleground with them. Getting rid of Naxx geared players would absolutely not make queues "exponentially" longer and that is absurd hyperbole.
---
&gt;You aren't helping your case. Yes, people get Naxx gear because they want an unfair fight. This does not make an unfair fight good game design.
---
&gt;We could have an interesting discussion over whether Naxx geared players are mean (the ones with /spit macros are, I am pretty sure) or merely psychopathically self-absorbed and genuinely unable to think about how their actions affect others. But they are bad for the game in either case so it seems like a distraction.
---
&gt;The bottom line is that the high-level pvp game would be significantly improved if Naxx geared players just went away forever, and any small step to curtail getting Naxx gear without hurting normal players is a win for the game.
---
#removenaxx
---
What about the D2 set, DM/ZG gear? Won't that trivialize MC?
---
it will. there's not enough outcry about this actually, even spell batching got more attention. 
---
Kill the wise one!!
---
Roll a char on a private server to pass the time. That's what I've done.
---
Dude, spoiler alert!?? :))
---
Or you can grow up and go do stuff with your daughter
---
I get that this was you trying to be funny, but I have seen anecdotes  from pirate server players that PvPers stop queuing up for battlegrounds and reroll on a fresh server instead when raiding guilds start getting Naxx gear, because the game stops being fun for them.
---
I have never been part of such a community and maybe they are exaggerating the effect. Or maybe Naxx-geared toons in regular battlegrounds are as toxic as twinks in 10-19 WSG, and if too many of them show up people will just stop playing. Time will tell.
---
The bottom line is that too much of a power differential breaks the game, and people won't play a broken game. Whether Naxx gear breaks the game or not is an open question, but if it does that doesn't make twinking any less toxic.
---
There will be a debuff limit of 16. It was explicitly mentioned at Blizzcon.
---
dont know where this comes from and if its just trolling or if u are serious.
---
I'd think for some people as a challenge it may be fun. Like a sadistic self sabotaging kind of fun haha. But of out a entire raiding guild hardly any of them will have this outlook and will not hit the "deadline"
---
Modern WoW feel to me even more tedious as there is less danger and micromanagement and less immersion.
---
Way too much time indeed :P
---
All those mind controlling mana burning fearing assholes...
---
That's possible, it was the first time I saw such a thing. Loot system was then slighly modified going to AQ/Naxx from MC/BWL, but it revolves around people making a wish list, and that items ranking+attendance tells you who should get the next XYZ that drops.
---
No drama, you know exactly if you'll get the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 10th XYZ dropping.
---
I'm planning on taking 3 weeks of my summer vacation to make the most of classic launch. 
---
Feel like the biggest challenge wasn't getting there myself, but having coordinate getting my teammates to the right instance.
---
Bank:
---
Bag of marbles.
---
Fishliver oil (alliance)
---
Call of the raptor (horde)
---
yeah it's all one traumatic blur for me now
---
The fact that people tend to switch servers is because of many different reasons, though I'd say that PvP imbalance is not the most common one. While fighting T3 people can be annoying, group PvP always gives you the advantage of being able to play support (pretty much regardless of class or spec) and overcome a few superior opponents with group tactics. I'd argue that the same thing applies to twinking.
---
By the way, would you extend the moral aspect of the whole thing to people who raid in order to get better gear for PvP? Are those people mean or psychologically self-absorbed?
---
your're*
---
I won't be looking for Classic WoW streams. I will be playing Classic WoW.
---
I find it's the other way around. I've made you waste your hearthstone and run away like a little bitch, who's really laughing? 
---
This is the progression they announced at Blizzcon
---
[https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/803853.jpg](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/803853.jpg)
---
ZG is being released with BWL and BGs, D2 set is being released with AQ.
---
I don't see DM being available at launch as an issue, as it was close enough to release that most people raided MC with DM gear in vanilla anyway.
---
I don't dispute the sentiment of the image, but really lich king deserves the trash bag as well, it's the primary reason WoW turned out as it did, nothing changed game design philosophy like that cursed expansion.
---
Dont they see that the newer WoW replaced nearly 100% of old WoW ? Every expension made the last one less important by this point vanilla content is non existend :O
---
The skill ceiling thing is an important point
---
10 man sucked absolute dick in T11 though, a part from Al'akir which sucked absolute dick on 25 man instead.
---
I never said that so stop putting words in my mouth. I think Classic will have the same amount of players as Vanilla did. And if you don't think there were limitations and they could have had 10k players per server or whatever you are delusional, no matter what the interview says.
---
I would only watch someone going in blind with no idea what's going to happen. 
---
I would relive my first experience through this streamer. 
---
Really looking forward to Deadmines again. Seems so simple, but I had a lot of good times in there. Groups of friends, groups of strangers, it didn‚Äôt matter. I liked to keep a warrior leveled to Deadmines level, and on an off night where I just wanted some simple fun I‚Äôd hop into a group and tank it. Great times. I will really feel like we‚Äôre back home the first time I‚Äôm able to get back in here (and hopefully will remember how to tank by then!).
---
I really wish I could play as Alliance, but you guys don't have shamans :(
---
It's one of my favorites. So many little nooks and crannies.
---
I don‚Äôt care if he wants to pve, but I‚Äôm not going to miss having him whining on a PvP server not sure why that‚Äôs unreasonable.
---
[Reminds me of this french classic pvp video :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWroROTr8Ow)
---
Maraudon is hugely underrated. It's just beautiful. Fighting your way through the slimes, muck, and all that and coming to the falls is such a cool experience.
---
running to corpse for 1 minute  
---
vs  
---
running/flying back to questing zone for 10+ minutes  
---
yea, good trade there  
---
I'm stealing this idea!
---
Based on me reading guides but not playing: druids have more armor, much more threat generation and more hp. They are better overall tanks for 5mans. Not to mention the utility they bring, like innervate or brez.
---
So the original Vanilla WoW devs are delusional, or are they just lying?
---
people at /r/peelingfeeling will love this
---
In my opinion Druids are underestimated in all roles. I used to prefeer druid tank in dungeons when i played dps back in the days. And i also leveled a druid with a healer build from lvl 1 and it was fun, challenging and powerful.
---
I played warrior from level 1 to Naxxramas in Vanilla as a tank and have played Druid extensively on private servers. Druids are definately miles ahead in tanking multiple mobs.
---
What does TSA stand for in relation to Hunters?
---
&gt;I have a lot of experience as a druid in classic and TBC (druid golden age)  
---
lol  
---
As a rogue, getting precision should be top priority, it makes things so much faster.
---
I gather all excess cloth and funnel it to my alts so they can painlessly level first aid.
---
How much difference do you really think there are between the two?
---
We know exactly how much threat each ability does. That was worked out in Vanilla. We know how much damage each ability does, and we know the threat multipliers. We also know how each ability scale based on the character stats.
---
There's no huge mystery in how these mechanics work. At best we are talking minor differences within a few percentage points due to not knowing exactly how much armor enemy monsters have in Vanilla. But again, the difference is likely to be minor since we can estimate the enemy armor based on old videos from vanilla where a character hit a monster and we can see his buffs and gear.
---
Based on what we know, MC will be easy enough.
---
They're changing way too much at this point. 
---
I didn't get my hopes up when they announced it though because blizzard are garbage these days. 
---
I didn't expect them to give us what we wanted... still can't help but feel a little disappointed though. This was going to be blizzard's redemption but they fucked it. 
---
I get that there are hardware/software compatability issues when it comes to reviving a game this old... But I feel like a bit of love and effort from a company that can clearly afford the extra work would go a long way. 
---
I havn't been logged in since wrath so I can't say why he has qs out(should have DOW equipped). And I'm not selling, guy! 
---
Private servers are irrelevant.
---
Yes I miss it. Niss to use CC more, miss that my CC could be resisted or dispelled. 
---
And to fix it for ya , AOE dungeon spam started in WotLK. Not in TBC where dungs were hard  even trash eas harf and CC was daily bread.
---
Yeah...
---
Flying mounts killed wow.
---
Because you have a lot of competition for resources, which you need for competitive raiding. 
---
There are not endless spots for black lotus as an example. 
---
Or the best farm spots for elemantel earth, once aq40 is open. 
---
Lag could be an issue, but I haven't played retail in 9 years so I can't tell you anything about the stability of the new servers. 
---
Just because p servers can do it, is no guarantee that blizzard can do it. 
---
That is the sad fact of the gaming industry right now. 
---
&gt;The only one that will keep people on classic is offering TBC.
---
Absolutely nothing other than Vanilla WoW is needed to "keep people on classic."
---
If you think TBC expansion will "keep people," you just kick the can down the road. Then WotLK? Then the game is dead? Or Cata, MoP, WoD? Where does it stop?
---
It starts and stops at the Classic, which deserves to be kept alive as long as possible. If it's not, pservers will continue to rise and meet the demand.
---
Don't forget the [Large Slimey Bone].
---
Really??? Dungs and HC dungs and some lower M+ keys are just WotLK 2.0 AOE  spam...
---
I'm far from the camp of "they fucked it". It seems to me they're doing what every other private server has done, minus using a new engine to do it. And i don't know about you, but private vanilla servers are fun. So classic will be fun.
---
As a warlock at the time in BC, I still vividly recall the trash packs leading up to Void Reaver in The Eye.
---
On a fresh server - Why is this important ? Is drop % better when server goes live for the first time or what ? :P
---
&gt;  On pvt servers the mobs are camped day and night by 60s and each one sells
---
It'll probably still be fun. But I'm just a bit of a purist and I don't see why they can't deliver a clone of what it was. 
---
People still play EQ despite it's potato graphics. 
---
I don't understand why they feel the need to enhance them.  I think they've added an option in the graphics settings to set everything at a level that will look similar to what it was like back then though which is cool I guess....  
---
I miss the need for strategy in general. Not just for trash mobs with crowd controls etc. But also so many bosses these days feel like copy paste mechanics of each other.
---
Preach dude. I used to love tanking all the way through Cataclysm. Ever since they turned tanking into a damage sponge dps I cant enjoy it.
---
Still in my bank on live!
---
Not much of a story, I run my own show and I'm well-off.
---
Have fun having not fun.
---
you will never oneshot someone with sinister
---
I know what you mean.... But trash was always and is still always harder than the bosses. Even in retail.
---
What makes you think so?
---
Vanilla was pretty well understood by the time TBC came out. Almost every mechanic had been worked out at that point. We know the damage every ability deal, and how it scales with gear. The stats on every piece of equipment in the game is also available from thottbot and allakazham.
---
Cross referencing private servers with the real thing also isnt that horde. There's a lot of video footage available to choose from.
---
Are there differences between the two? Of course there is. But I think people in general greatly underestimate how close private servers in 2019 are to actual Vanilla and having played them recently certainly paints a much better picture of how Vanilla functions than some murky memory of how the game was 13 years ago from Vanillaplayers who mix and match every patch in the game in their heads because it was so long ago.
---
They are NOT starting at patch 1.12.1. They are basing the client on patch 1.12.1 with talents and stuff but the CONTENT and gear can be from any patch.
---
2 years of your life to play a game though. I'm not saying you will regret it on your deathbed or anything but there is a whole world out there.
---
That's part of playing on a pvp server, if you don't save important cooldowns you will be at a disadvantage come an encounter and dying is the biggest waste of time on WoW.
---
In my opinion mages are stronger. Deep frost spec and you will beat all melee classes fairly easy. Rogues only have 1 trinket and max 2 vanish to get out of freeze, while you have 2x nova, cone of cold, ice block and ice barrier with frost, so once the rogue is out of freeze counters, you can kite them easy. Against a hunter you can just blink inn, freeze the hunter and the pet, cone of cold + fireblast and spam arcane explosion in the deadzone, you dont need more than blue gear. Scatter shot on you = block, now the hunter has no interupts / cc and you can keep him slowed from the deadzone. 1v1 at equal gear and skill the mage will win 9/10 times.
---
Not to mention a bunch of people will be following the exact same guides.
---
Nothing wrong at all. But i would like to see it evolved at its end point. Not with expansions. But with small things that expand on vanilla. Obviously m+ strikes a nerve here, but my point wasnt that we should add stuff from retail. Just that a lot of stuff could be added. There's so many zones, raids and dungeons that have the potential to be something great, instead of just being nothing once most players have their 3rd or even 4th 60 geared out. I love vanilla, i cant wait to start! 
---
I guess i thought this forum also had some expectations as to where it might head very much later. 
---
Like i have said, adding TBC, imo would just be super dissapointing. As it will just take players from classic. What happens when TBC is stale, wotlk? No thanks. 
---
LoL!
---
Depends if my leveling friend will be. If so, then probably 3 days (and I only work 3 days a week, so that's like 2 weeks off). Otherwise, I will take leveling a lot slower, in between playing retail ;/
---
This. On private servers you can see the blue twink sword from shadowfang keep go for 200+ gold after some time for example.
---
I'm gonna make my two characters on launch, park em in Orgrimmar/UC and drink up that sweet, sweet rested exp for a week or two and enjoy some time outta the house while the big rush is going on.
---
Come at me bro
---
I'll probably take a week off.  Also curious to see how many other people in my department request the same time off, so I can see who's a nerd like me.
---
Raids are always fun to watch. Wipes are juicy because everyone loses their wbuffs.
---
There are also speedruns and server first kills which have been gaining huge number of viewers on pservers.
---
I don't see travelling and seeing the world as something interesting though. If you knew how I spent my 17-25 years you would probably be shocked.
---
Still waiting for that 1% near-wipe where I am the only surviving member! Time to be a hero
---
Ok but if the options are adding new content and a cash shop or adding tbc which keeps people on classic?
---
We may share one or two things. But putting this shit on your walls is def. something only a /b/tard or weak-ass nerd would do. 
---
If your ambition is to tank 5mans and you are willing to get gear for it , paladins are great. The biggest issue is working around mana constraints and the lack of taunt. Both doable.
---
Oily blackmouth
---
classic economy will be very different for overfarmed or very niche items
---
without enough people there wont be a lot of twink pvp, thus no huge demand for certain items
---
neither will elemental earth/fire be farmed 24/7 etc 
---
&gt;play super easy level of content  
---
&gt;"WHY IS EVERYTHING SO EASY??"  
---
look at this dude...  
---
I quit tanking in Wrath because of that. I played a palatank all through TBC and I did not mind being worse at single target because I had superior aoe tanking abilities.
---
However when warriors could do an equally good job by just spamming Shockwave and Thunderclap, why bother.
---
Sucking dick for crack? I'm not going to tell you what to do, just know that taking 2 years off to play wow is an unusual life choice.
---
Yes. Very. I hope blizz is doing a little forward thinking when it comes to the massive playerbase drop after launch.
---
You could get Redoubt which functions the same way. Sitting for Reckoning and Enrage is not Blizzlike and thats just how it is.
---
The raptor flesh recipe come to mind as one that is very worthwhile to cook to vendor.
---
it'll be hard as release is during summer and most of my co-workers with kids get priority, but if i can i'll take a week off, I don't need to power level I'm thinking about enjoying it this time around. In vanilla I lvled a mage/druid/warrior/paladin so I already know more or less where to quest what class is beneficial etc... I just don't want to be that guildie who takes ages to get to 60. So a week off might be a good idea to keep motivated in questing.
---
Everything until thick leather can be vendored.  There is going to be sooooo many people skinning while leveling (hey it's free gold, why not!?).. thick leather can be crafted by leatherworkers into an item that vendors for more than the mats so you can start selling your thick leather very easily to people for a lot more than the vendor price.
---
Where did you hear that they aren't starting at 1.12? Can you link?
---
I myself prefer agi over stren because most of the time you'll be leveling as a cat and big number is always nice on the screen but from a tanking point of view strength is way better than agi especially at low level where you don't get item giving you more than 2 stats.
---
Streng gives you raw power and increases damage and threat from every hit while agi only give you a chance to do a crit. On a purely tanking gear, agi would have it's place, I don't disagree with that but in the case he only want to carry one set of gear he has to make choice. He'll need some intel because healing, Wpvp, ... Stam because that's just the best stat for leveling and strength because he'll need it for tank so that let him with agi as the "less wanted" stat beside spirit
---
I will be 7-8 months into my vacation when classic comes out, the vacation is about me relaxing but since classic comes out this summer it's simply just sprinkles on top.
---
&gt; So it's definitely doable.
---
Is it though? We are talking about a fresh launch and a full guild who need to hit 60 within a week... As I said, thats close to impossible and absurd and pointless.
---
What? It's true though. You shouldn't assume those rates to be the same that will be in Classic.
---
Well, TBC was pretty damn good for druids. I still have nightmares of druids in 2v2 when arena first came out.
---
not really, still only rdruid good  
---
Likely to be cheaper in Classic due to there being less players tryharding than on private servers.
---
Assuming equal gear, what he says is not that far off.
---
If a hunter is BM - which is not uncommon even at 60 - you lose. Your only hope is double blocking BW and insane luck on frost bite. 
---
I disagree with Druid, they typically won't beat you, but they will run away from you. 
---
Lock is a gear matchup, in even gear it favors the lock.
---
Shadow Priest is beatable in fresh 60 gear but once you're both geared you will never beat a shadow priest.
---
Rogue is NOT fifty fifty. Equal skill and gear should have mage win 80% of the time, most rogues are not good though so you can often beat 2 at a time without breaking a sweat.
---
Warriors are 100% win for mage. 
---
Shaman are hard.
---
Pallies are boring. 
---
All this assuming around equal skill and gear, mages honestly aren't as strong as this site likes to say they are 1 on 1. 
---
I don't know if they get their opinion from Vurtne movies or what, but they tend to talk about mages like omnipotent creatures. Anyway, they're great for group pvp, scale well, good in pve, good for making money, decent levelers, so they're obviously one of the better classes in the game overall. 1on1 not so much.
---
I'm not playing retail and very much look forwards to classic wow but in high m+ keys it's absolutely crucial that you keep track of your group's cc and interrupts.
---
It seems like a lot of people fear the trivializing of content with the DM BiS-gear avalible at launch and I can kinda see where they're coming from. People who are worried about that is probably way more invested in Classic than most and either don't want the competition or feel like others may pull ahead of them. 
---
But i truly agree with you, back in vanilla I, as many others, rerolled horde (or Alliance for those that went the other way). I remember dinging my second 60 a few weeks after ZG dropping, and there were still many guilds in the early phases of raiding on that server. I had no problem finding a nice guild to progress with all the way from MC and upwards with, even though it was almost 1 year into release. Yes, there were already "old" contet per definition, but that didn't stop us from doing guild runs here and there to help eachother out with whatever people needed. 
---
I'll take a druid over a random warrior who's tanking in bererker stance and doesn't know what he's doing any day. In general, seeing a cat or bear makes me happy.
---
If Classic is popular and bringing in new subscriptions, then they would just add a TBC server in few years.
---
Fury is still superior until you get Sweeping Strikes for straight up PvE. However if you want to have a chance at all for PvP you need to be arms for tactical mastery. It also helps tanking.
---
I'd say Arms is the way to go from level 10 and up.
---
watch the blizzcon wow classic panel.  You can find it on youtube and it will answer all your questions.  Regarding your specific question start around the 30 minute mark.
---
Probably less though. Lower population and less gold farming by Chinese/DM exploits ;-)
---
Thats tbc
---
Not even Mortal Strike. Once you get Sweeping Strikes at level 30 you gain the ability to pool your rage on every other pull and proceed to pull two mobs at the same time. After which you bandage and repeat.
---
The vast majority of people didn't even enter MC until long after DM had been out.  
---
I remember back in 2005 a lot of talk the Warlocks hard countered mages all day, I dont know if that is actually true or of i'll it was 2005 and we were all too shit to know better.
---
I think it heavily depends on how many people will acutally play the endgame content of classic. As /u/vejret mentioned, noone knows what comes after the initial classic cycle and the easiest way to add content would be to add TBC. 
---
However i would personally prefer the way you described. There is actually lots of potential in the classic world to add "oldschool" content considering all the content that was scrapped during vanilla for one reason or another.
---
I do believe it was confirmed debuffs are 16 though.
---
Did city guards with stealth-detection exist in classic WoW? Or were those added in an expansion?
---
Whats the item? Just curious
---
Hes very good background noise while playing WoW myself.  I don't agree with half of the shit him and Mcconnell say, but its still very entertaining.
---
Man, Ozruk was brutal with his long target-all stun. Took us a while to figure out the healer and casters had to dot themselves with the reflect buff Ozruk had up right before the stun.
---
Yes thats a good point. On the other hand, players might be more inclined to invest into twinks knowing the server wont shut down at some point down the line.
---
Thanks, I‚Äôm almost sure autocorrect fucked me yhere 
---
I think this is the response.
---
Oh, I got ganked while afk in org, lol. /2 Some rogue ganked me while afk in cleft of shadows fyi.
---
A): lol
---
B) lol rekt
---
C) What level?
---
D): omw
---
E) Anyone want to gank red ridge with me?
---
Yea, something I had considered as well. The issue of course is that it will lead to significant bank space issues (you can‚Äôt put soulbound items on an alt), and a significant decrease in gold earned before level 40. 
---
I can‚Äôt recall ‚Äî at what level do you start getting end game mats from DE? It might be worth just saving those to help with your end game enchants.
---
Totems are fun and it feels cool when you pick out the right combination/placement to handle a situation. Ok, this pack of mobs has a basilisk so I'll throw down Grounding totem to eat those stuns, the snakes poison so a Poison Cleansing totem will come in handy, the troll warrior will run on low hp so an Earthbind totem will come in handy, and I can throw Flametongue totem down to give melee extra damage.
---
The real heartbreak comes from when you buff, set up your totems, drink...and watch as the tank charges into the pack and fights them 50 yards away.  C'est la vie.
---
So I haven't done leatherworking myself, I've always been on the skinning end of things, but I think it's the nightscape tunic ([https://classicdb.ch/?item=8175](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8175)) which vendors for 59.71 silver and takes 7 thick leather (vendor price 21 silver) and 2 silken thread (10 silver total).  So the profit per 7 thick leather is 28.71 silver, or more than 4 silver per thick leather.  Considering the normal vendor price of thick leather is 3 silver you are more than doubling the vendor value by crafting it.
---
Launch will probably be chaos, so maybe I‚Äôll take a few days off work a couple weeks after launch when things calm down.
---
You'll have plenty of time to farm gear before the honor system is released.  The honor system isn't coming out until the 2nd content wave.
---
When strafing from a Warrior in a tight corridor, hop and face him in mid-air. When he intercepts, you will be able to blink the entire distance instead of bumping against the wall.
---
Where in his post does he say he believes they will be the same?
---
Yeah the CC strategy in BC was awesome, we always had to do 2 or 3 CCs, party leader marked mobs to sap, sheep, seduction... and take careful with aoe spells.
---
Some could say it was boring and slow, I think it was more engaging that current state.
---
If it's early in the life of the server, you might be pretty hard up to get 90g for mount at level 40, selling those blues could give you the extra 5-10g to get you over the top. 
---
Well he did come back as the final raid boss the tier before ICC. You are right though, he shouldn‚Äôt have been a five-man boss and should have just been Arthas‚Äô greatest champion in ICC.
---
You can mix auto attacks and wand hits for serious dmg without spending mana. Leveling a priest has never been this easy.
---
" Been playing on Kronus3, the level 40 Skullsplitter Trolls drop pages at a stupid-high rate. I'd say sell/vendor the pages until you're clearing out those trolls. " 
---
A comment in a Classic WoW post regarding which items to sell/bank. It sorta implies that come Classic you should just farm those mobs for the pages, does it not??
---
I can't really understand why people complain about the DM gear being available on launch, considering that in vanilla 99% of NA players were not MC attuned before DM came out and in EU the game released with DM available.
---
Best hunter spec for pvp?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt even call BC heroics ‚Äúhard‚Äù at launch. They were basically straight up broken. Or so I was told. I wasn‚Äôt allowed to run any, because I was a rogue, and the sheer amount of 360 degree cleaves meant I was literally dead weight until they nerfed them a bit.
---
You cant stomp in bear form iirc, so you have to be careful, as you are very squishy in caster form.
---
SL Warlocks Counter pretty much any class in a 1v1 duel situation mage included.
---
That doesn't mean that suddenly most encounters you'll have in PvP will be naxx geared players. Vanilla in 2004-2006 and pservers in 2019 are very different. Classic will not be either one or the other. It will be something in between, but no one, ever, should say that Classic isn't done for them if they actually have played Vanilla and liked it in the past.
---
Do you mean geologists?
---
In all seriousness tho do you mean that the rocks you can throw to people?
---
[Like this one](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18640)
---
Zul Farrak in Tanaris, easy to replay and one of the 1st epics you can farm for
---
it depends if your healer can handle it.
---
On strat live farm runs with decent geared guildmates, we always went with a fury warrior as tank.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=288408/classic-wow-will-have-staged-content-unlocks-including-gates-of-ahnqiraj
---
The game will launch with MC and Onyxia as the highest tier of content, with BWL etc being released later.
---
Same with the big skull at the mage trainer and the screens at the bank, you can just run right through them!
---
If world pvp is your thing hunter is probably 1# there. If you care for 1v1 duels in a limited area (hard to kite) mage is at an advantage in bgs both are Top Tier imo
---
But clearly he gives context that hes playing on a private server so even your tiny brain should be able to understand that this isnt Blizzards classic, but someone elses.
---
&gt;I'd say sell/vendor the pages until you're clearing out those trolls.
---
But he's making a suggestion here what to do come Classic based on his experience on a private server.
---
God forbid
---
Are hunters able to top BGs as well?
---
I can guarantee you that you will see it in Classic, and there's no problem with that. These days its common  knowledge that the best weapon combo before raiding for every melee is the two low drop rate weapons from 10man UBRS.
---
You are insane if you do 60-70 runs for them and roll against the other melee every time. It's much easier to just farm the Key for UBRS, make groups and reserve one weapon at a time.
---
Expect to see the same with a lot of other hard to get preraid gear. There's always the option of making your own groups.
---
I'm just answering your question man. That implies he believes that the rates would be the same in Classic.
---
Kiting has been part of defeating raids and dungeons since vanilla
---
there are some amazing powelevelers on private servers that hit 60 in like 2-3 days /played
---
Druid abilities have a massive threat multiplier in Bear Form though. Especially Maul. If you crit once you can pretty much just forget about that mob and focus on something else. It also helps your rage generation.
---
No, you‚Äôre adding that. He‚Äôs saying, ‚ÄùI‚Äôve played on a emulation of vanilla that isnt perfect and I‚Äôve found X is true there. If X stays true then do X.‚Äù
---
Full Reckbomb with shadow oil, chili, maelstrom trinket, cenarion circle ring and lifesteal enchant on a weapon like Corrupted Ashbringer or Neretzek should oneshot anyone except a tank with shield wall active \^\^
---
No one have said it's impossible. I said that it's close to impossible and absurd to expect a full raid guild to reach 60 in a week on a fresh launch.
---
I would call them broken honestly. They required better gear than Kara while dropping worse loot, so there was very little incentive to run them. I raided all through TBC and I don't even think we *attempted* more than half of them. I mean, Heroic Shadow Labs, Arcatraz, or *Mana Tombs*? You couldn't pay people to run those.
---
15 days from launch
---
I'd like a guild where everyone wears a Bloodsail hat or First Mates hat. Then ganks everyone
---
One of the reasons why Mages were so strong in PvP was that Rank 1 spells were still viable at level 60. You could, for example, use Rank 1 Frostbolt (which had a 1.5s cast time and cost negligible mana) to get off a quick slow on physical damage classes like Hunters and Warriors. Similarly, you could use Rank 1 AE or Blizzard to knock Rogues out of stealth while expending minimal mana.
---
It's important to note, however, that Hunters, Warriors, and Rogues all scaled significantly better than Mages when taking into account Epic gear. You needed to have perfect play to beat a geared Warrior because they could easily two-shot you. 
---
In theory sitting worked in Vanilla due how the server handled the combat events. By spamming a /sit /stand macro you could trick the game into thinking you were standing while it did the calculations for reckoning.
---
Confirmed not to work on the Classic demo however.
---
I have bad memories with that dagger too. Once I've obtained it only to find out that server I was playing on was running pre-itembuff patch where dagger had some shitty stats instead of +spellpower.
---
As if it somehow "made MC irrelevant" otherwise.
---
People on this subreddit scream and run for the hills as soon as a pserver is mentioned, its silly.
---
Maybe possible with windfury or if the priest was naked. Otherwise, no.
---
Using outdoor raids to farm thorium, so good 
---
Most people ran MC with DM gear anyway so it's not really important. The talents though will make MC much easier
---
It's been said a hundred times but man I jist miss the fact that u HAD to communicate with ur randoms in vanilla and tbc.  Owadays u can run every single dungeon from lvl 15 to 100+ and not once have to say a word, use cc, or even try to use rotation in ur abilities.  
---
In vanilla u talked, planned, became friends, and conquered an hour and a half long dungeon 
---
More options to remove gold from the economy, which can only be a good thing.
---
the vast majority never even hit level 60 in vanilla. it's entirely irrelevant to the quality of balancing, not to mention it's 2019 and people will enter MC two weeks after launch. 
---
Gnome Mage
---
You can just use the legion api and it will be fine, the addons will be supported too
---
As long as you're not the one being engaged on (aka charged/rooted in your dreadzone immediately) and you have room to kite, a good hunter pretty much wins any duel, especially at fresh 60 because their base damage are absurd (but they don't scale much).
---
Hunter is even more dominant in leveling 1-60 because very few people level with engineering to help close the gap and basically a hunter's auto shot on a clothy deals as much damage as your 2.5 sec cast, and that's without counting their pet ripping your guts open and the pushback on your spells. It gets a bit better as you get Ice Barrier at 40 as a frost mage, but you'd still probably only win versus bad hunters that can't kite.
---
I'd say every class is food for beast mastery hunters in leveling, their base damage are a lot better than most classes and the pet is basically a second player on its own. At 40, beast mastery hunter can kill a clothy with his pet only. Mages will eventually outscale hunters with more gear, but said gear is a lot harder to come by in vanilla than retail, so keep that in mind.
---
&gt;People on this subreddit scream and run for the hills as soon as a pserver is mentioned, its silly.
---
I think there was very little screaming and running for the hills in this comment chain. The guy literally just said that you shouldn't assume private server rates to be the same as Classic rates, which is completely fair. To me it seems that private server people just get overly defensive when something is said about private servers.
---
By the way, I am not a private server hater or anything like that. Mainly the only WoW I've been playing for the past 6 years has been on private servers.
---
The current retail structure and 7.3.5 client means it will likely be as on current live servers
---
How do hunters do at 60 once people have gear though, thats what i want to know. 
---
The point is that most people who DID enter MC did so with DM being an option to obtain gear.  The class and talent changes by 1.12 will have a far greater impact on how people experience MC as compared to DM.
---
I don't remember it being too bad it you didn't fuck up the initial bombing run (which is also a really stupid mechanic)
---
Only normal answer in this thread :D
---
I hope they ll introduce new content eventually. But to adapt raids and dungeons to level 60 numbers could be a lot of work. They ll probably release TBC again at that point.
---
how to do something like this?
---
I still have it, too! In always looking for a reason to use it, but never found anything worth it. Every time we wipe at 0.01% on a said progression boss, it's in my bank...
---
I don't think it is doable, considering that Joana played on a low pop PvE server towards the end of vanilla. On a fresh PvP server it's going to be a completely different story.
---
Thats the one.
---
That rat bastard wandering gargoyle in Stratholme, flew around so freakin' quick. 
---
I remember having a blast with them, because I wasn't in a raiding guild at the time, and they were a really nice end game challenge for me. At the time, a 3-piece set from tribal leatherworking was the only other epic I had access to other than the single drops at the end of the heroic 5-mans.
---
Hard 5-mans make the game better even if their place on the raid progression latter is a bit puzzling.
---
Later on in TBC, I did get into a raiding guild, and all that practice and gear from heroics prepared me well for Karazhan, and there were still plenty of upgrades for me in there.
---
Why is that so many people who hate retail play retail? 
---

I'll be there on day one just for the tears. Don't want to miss that.
---
I can get behind that.
---
This is very difficult to answer because this is not retail. Vanilla doesn't hand players free epics every week and people will have different gear level depending on their commitment to the game. Some people will stay in blue gear throughout all vanilla while others will completely outscale with raid and/or rank 13 gear giving them a massive advantage.
---
Eventually you'll get destroyed by mages with Naxx gear for sure, but there will be only a handful of those mages on your server because not everybody will raid Naxx.
---
What's more important in my opinion is how much gear do YOU expect to have. Are you going to commit a lot of time to the game? Are you gonna join a raiding guild? Are you gonna PvP 16 hours a day to rank up? Or are you gonna play casually and probably only wear blues? Depending on what you answer to these questions, you may prefer a class with strong base damage that relies less on gear/scaling (hunter) or a class that scales very well into late game and will burst down ungeared people in BGs with a round of instant spells (mage).
---
I think the big difference between runescape and wow in this respect is that runescape is alot more solo content driven game, where as in wow working together is encouraged from group quests starting at level 10 or something like that and following with dungeons and rewards. One thing that I would see going wrong with this kind of iron man thing, is that it directs play similar to achievements. That wasn't part of vanilla so I doubt it makes it in classic (going by the design philosophy they told us about). Of course you can still do something like this if you enjoy it but there is no formal recognition for it. Perhaps the best you can do is threat it like a speedrun and record it and put it up on youtube or something along those lines. Basically the things that we should expect from classic is the things we got told about, and one of those being that if you fell asleep for 15 years and woke up, you wouldn't notice difference in the game other than the technological changes ofc.
---
Cheers! Here's to drunk leveling!
---
depends on the situation
---
i use to love doing it in wrath after i just randomly jumped into the middle of a city like org for some fun
---
1v1 it is definitely say I LOST now i might if i got jumped by a group and where my hearth is located and what i am doing
---
I plan on playing a ton, wow classic will be the only game i play since i dont like anything else. Maybe i should go mage then. Idk. 
---
LoL
---
Have an upvote for this
---
To solve this you make bank alts and mail them everything
---
I do understand that DM gear is extremely potent and in many cases provide better options than MC. But the reality is that T2 also dropped in MC during that timeframe (outside of Rag legs), and EU barely had anyone at 60 when the patch hit due to releasing in february 2005. So DM being in at release with T2 not dropping in MC slightly evens it out imo.  
---
    
---
It's not \_actually\_ confirmed though, as the slide suggests, it's "current thinking", and not set in stone. Personally I would prefer having DM without early T2, as even if we get progressive itemization, we all know what stats the pieces will eventually get, and which ones will become super powerful. So getting access to them early on, in much easier content, would be iffy imo.
---
That was infinitely cooler than what I expected.
---
I love Maraudon. An enormous instance and you feel so accomplished when you finally get the staff that lets your group start the quest at the falls.
---
I agree, I'd love for them to make use of the existing world with future content; Karazhan, Mt. Hyjal, the Azshara battleground, Uldam, Caverns of Time, and the world instance that was supposed to be accessible by the portals guarded be the green world dragons. 
---
Teasers that ended up being disappointing: literally all of them
---
Definitely Hyjal because of all the lore surrounding it and that you could actually get in to an entirely finished zone. They somehow ruined it for Cataclysm.
---
I do not think they would fix that kind of bug because they never did between Vanilla and Mists of Pandaria.
---
It was definitely possible to do at the time, but I guess it was not worth the effort.
---
Bottom line: mage scales harder than hunter. Fresh server hunter is wpvp king until guilds have BWL on farm, then ZG gear and AQ eventually causes mages to become utterly broken, where hunters don't really scale with gear nearly as well. 
---
I played both at 60 for hundreds of hours on retail and private servers. Both are very mechanical classes that rely on kiting and positioning, and feel very similar in their approach to taking down common pvp opponents. Both have opportunities when played perfectly, to be unstoppable by certain classes. Both can have serious burst damage potential. Both have some really nice CC options (mage wins out though). Both have bad matchups (hunter has more than mage). Both are junk if played incorrectly.
---
IMO Hunter is more fun and has a lot more wpvp trolling potential, especially if you are a night elf. Basically, the a racial shadowmeld ability allows you to engage in a manner that no other combination of hunter in the game can dream of, and allows you to do some extremely silly things out in the world. Dwarf stone form IS good too, but once you make shadowmeld ambushing second nature, you just can't give it up. Going invisible and being able to track everything around you and decide when you want to engage is priceless, especially on a pop imbalanced server. 
---
Also....viper sting. 
---
But of course Mage is the ultimate farmer and has a huge array of utility and tricks. If you intend to wpvp then you have to be an engineer, and consider what gaps in your abilities you can fill with toys and potions. 
---
tl;dr both are good, but mages have less weaknesses, while hunters have more fun 
---
5 of those days will be dedicated to leaving the starter zone
---
Is there any classes that do as good as mages or hunters but are more noob friendly?
---
Wish I could but I'll be taking a trip to Europe and that'll deplete most of my days.
---
FOR THE HORDEEEE!!!!
---
MMOs are supposed to be like that.  They take up a lot of time.  If you don't feel like that then don't play the game.
---
Think you are right. Fears and dots make them kind of useless. 
---
This actually happened to me in a raid in BC and I forgot I still had Light of Elune in my bag. Failed with 1000hp left on the boss -.-
---
How are hunters when other classes start getting geared at 60? Do they fall of pretty hard?
---
You can freely use it on PTR realms for fun and shenanigans. That's why I've never used it on live.
---
so we should make it even easier, even though we know of another way? blizzard starting with 16 debuff slots and dm is either absolute laziness or ignorance. there is zero drawback to keeping it out of the game for a few months. 
---
reverting class/talent changes would be a whole other story. from what they've said, they don't have the accurate data to reconstruct it. i'm indifferent to it. but debuff slots and dm are such simple things to improve, it's just baffling why they wouldn't do it. 
---
See, retail isn't supposed to feel like that HBO account you don't use.  It's supposed to be your "main" game.  You can go and play other games for a couple hours, or a week, but at the end you're supposed to want to come back home to WoW.  Retail isn't like that anymore so you wind up feeling like you're wasting money waiting for content.  When new content comes around, a lot of people don't want to pay $15 just to play for a few hours and quit again.  It's the same thing that prevents people from buying new expansions.  They don't want to pay the $60 and another $15 on top of that.
---
They also shouldn't have cosmetics in a sub model game.  If you take all the cool items out of the game and put them on the store then there is nothing to work for in the actual game.
---
Not the purple big tiddy goth gf Horde though. That one sucks.
---
Thanks =). Brought back some good memories of those gross plastic keyboard covers that everyone used to have... Do you remember using them? They started off as transparent plastic and then slowly became yellowish over time... Ugggh... Fucking gross. Haha
---
Not really, they get stunned and then you switch back to bear.
---
In classic wow, all of the classes are very unique in their approach to pvp. In the end, it's up to what you enjoy most. 
---
IMO the most noob friendly ranged DPS pvp class is hunter due to huge flat damage, good cc, and of course the pet. Even a mediocre hunter in bad gear can be dangerous to somebody unprepared to fight them, and can get all sorts of cheesy kills from the longest range in the game. 
---
It's just that you can become enormously more dangerous by learning how to properly play, using macros, and learning all the tricks you can do as a hunter.
---
[Foil Laminating](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17873980381220472/?hl=en)
---
They are. While hunters can have problems in area restricted duel situations vs clothies they absolutely shred through them in bgs. Hunters can be Monsters there. 
---
No, everything has changed... Azeroth isnt the same anymore... I cant wait for Classic when I can TRULY return home, the way it was.
---
When a mob runs in fear, it runs directly away from you, so you can actually control where it goes by where you stand. Draw a line from yourself to the mob, and that's (more or less) the direction they'll go.
---
A good example are murlocs. Usually they're in some sort of camp, so you pull one out of the camp to avoid adds. If you don't reposition yourself after a pull, it'll just run back to the camp when it gets low HP, potentially aggroing everything. Instead, stand between the murloc and the camp, so when it runs in fear it runs AWAY from the other murlocs. 
---
Based on what we know, MC is easier than LFR, even with 8 debuff slots ^^
---
How do hunters do at 60 when people start getting geared though? Do they fall off hard? (Scaling)
---
"We will do what makes sense" - Ion when asked what will happen after post-Naxx
---
I personally wouldn't put too much thought into it right now, the chances of getting fresh classic content is extremely low and TBC seems more likely while they keep classic WoW a vanilla museum piece on their Battlenet launcher.
---
"We will do what makes sense" - Ion when asked what will happen post-Naxx
---
Only you dont need the parry because youre swing timer kiting and will end every fight with 85+% hp, you will then switch to your full set of spirit gear while running to the next mob and be at 90-95% hp before engaging. You will have no downtime. The extra DPS is priority for kill speed and efficiency. You dont need any more survivability.
---
I got a few laughs and pats on the back from the hardcores, theyre the only ones I need to appease =)
---
Kill time is worse than single target with 2 hand fury though. Sweeping strikes is only effective on a handful of mobs 1-60 with incredibly low armor for their level. It isnt an efficient build overall. 2hand fury has 0 downtime, no food or bandages required.
---
I was mostly referring to this clip: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZWybBLMXBs&amp;t=1011s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZWybBLMXBs&amp;t=1011s)
---
You cant tell me, this looks anything like vanilla. They kite 90% of the trash in there.
---
It's not the vanilla once in a bluemoon you have to kite a dragonkin on Razorgore, but kiting as a tool used in the majority of the fights as a mechanic mostly seen in actionRPGs and other dungeons crawlers.
---
Wrong.
---
It would have happened if there was any need to though. Vanilla didn't have timed runs other than one strat quest
---
No clue about 1 v 1 situations but in BG I'd be more scared/ on edge having to deal with a mage over hunter any day of the week. Mages have the caster advantage of ignoring armor on top of burst damage. You won't ever see a hunter pop up out of no where and instant your ass.
---
If played right I view hunters more of a nuisance where they will be dropping ice traps..viper stinging and just being real annoying by trying to get people to chase them. 
---
Target the mages first man.. target the mages.
---
What do you mean caves?
---
They weren't really broken, but they were very tightly tuned and difficult. The only borderline broken one was Arcatraz. Shattered Halls and Shadow Labyrinth were very hard. Even Steam Vaults was pretty rough.
---
??
---
once people start to run bwl hunter is shit, you literally die to 3 frost bolts, 1 warlock fear or a stunlock with thistle tea while doing shit dmg because you have no scaling 
---
Not only that, but frankly I dont trust blizzard to properly add new content to classic. 
---
a cave or a mine, like Echo Ridge in Northshire
---
Not sure if srs
---
BC heroics and early Cata 5men dungeons were plenty difficult without degrading the RPG elements of WoW into a dungeon crawler which simply does not fit the WoW game world.
---
Diablo never went for a "realistic" route but to just grind out gear in difficult ways. That's why nobody cares about the tagged on story in Diablo and spents 99% of their time in rifts in which story has no meaning.
---
rested xp caps at 2 levels.  so you'll be rested to ... level 3.  
---
Don't forget that Shamen can move any mountain.
---
How many of these posts do we need per day?
---
Really? I remember it being longer than that before all of the big nerfs started rolling in.
---
I love this. Brilliant, easy, solves 100% of the problems.
---
Where are you farming that has zero downtime? Even the best spots I would have to eat or bandage sometimes. 
---
Rofl this is hillarious :D Also lets make a second deadmines entrance next to the original one!
---
Some of the best warriors in the game level arms. You are wrong.
---
Monkeynews , god tier nulti rank 14 warripr witg 5 day leveling time levels as arms not fury. Get out of here.
---
Yea, I didn‚Äôt mean broken as in they were bugged or anything. But they were awfully hard, and for the most part weren‚Äôt worth the level of difficulty compared to Karazhan or even Gruul/Magtheridon. Once they got touched up a bit and the ZA round of badge gear was released, they were much more worthwhile.
---
Eh, I get the argument but it keeps dungeons relevant, in BC I used to kite mobs as a lock, granted not that many at once. In classic you just stop doing the dungeons as they became faceroll in higher gear and never change. I like the variety in types of pull and methods of handling trash
---
There used to be an add-on for this also.
---
Oh, I thought it was a code word to some kind of sharding.
---
But nah
---
You're won't here my dude. TBC was amazing for druids. Almost every issue I had with them was resolved. While certainly not op, they were incredibly fun and rewarding to play
---
Mom?
---
It's classic. Earlier is better.
---
I feel the exact opposite. The sun is the enemy. Stay inside through the summer, enjoy the rain/snow
---
Actually, no. You're adding that. 
---
That's because they worked on the alliance zones first 
---
Hunters don't scale very well at all. Nothing like warrior or rogue, or mage (when they start getting trinkets). This is because a significant portion of their damage comes from the pet (which does not scale with gear), and because the rest of it comes from flat damage from their abilities. 
---
The difference in effective pvp damage between the AV crossbow with a 3.8 speed (or whatever it was), and something you can get from a raid was minimal. 
---
It's not truly noticable till everyone has AQ on farm, and every. single. caster. has trinkets. 
---
Minimum 2 weeks
---
I'm thinking: the sooner the better.
---
I'm also thinking: why does it even matter WHEN it's going to be released? If you want to go out in summer, go out. Don't let the existence of a game dictate what you're doing. And if you wanna play instead, play.
---
If you're thinking that you gonna "fall behind" by not playing super hardcore the first couple of months due to sunshine still existing, then you're very likely playing this game "wrong" to begin with...
---
So....dont play until the fall?  
---
Wrong
---
Vanilla wow will be the only game i play, i plan to put a lot of time in it. Would you say due to this, i would get more out of a mage in the long run?
---
I've heard a couple people complain about "not wanting to carry around 2 sets of gear" while playing a hybrid. Ok, your solution is to gear for your leveling spec, and if people ask if you can heal say "No". If you don't want 2 sets of gear, don't try to hybrid, simple as that. First, if you're geared, you don't need to be specced, but you DO need to be geared to not suck. Second, I think you're massively overestimating gear availability... Are you going to be trolling the AH all day and buying gear? Are you going to be looking up drop lists and farming? No? Then you won't get all these perfect agi/int items. Not to mention, it's going to make leveling a huge pain, since you're missing out on stam/str which are huge for leveling feral.
---
It's just a bad idea; gear for your spec, if you want to hybrid as a healer or tank then carry a second set. And don't complain about bag space, I don't want to hear it. Warlocks and hunters literally lose an entire bag slot; and banks exist for a reason. Get a bank alt if you are running out of room.
---
If you 'remember' that it's a false memory.
---
Up until mop trash was harder then boss fights. Seriously look at some of the trash in the first tier of cata. I still have nightmares about the gauntlet after halfus wyrmbreaker
---
Remember blizzard said they would be sharding the starting area the first few weeks. So we can probably party up with people to get the quest spawns asap.
---
Personally I'd prefer fall too. 
---
Who really knows why they decided summer time? Maybe they wanna pace out future expansions for retail WoW. 
---
I can't tell you, dude. You may not like mage, or you may not like hunter. If you plan on putting a lot of time into the game, you should play different classes to get a feel for what you like more. 
---
I started WoW as a shaman, played it till 60 and got sick of it, then rolled a priest, then a mage (didnt get it to 60) then after being sick of getting killed by hunters in bg's, I rolled a hunter and found out how fun it was, after months of thinking it was a very stupid and boring class.  
---
People will annoy the streamers by jumping them on the way to a raid after getting all the buffs. I doubt serious raiding streams will steam outside of a BG or Instance knowing this will happen.
---
I've been trying to optimize my route between the two classes I want to play  (shaman and warlock) and I have been able to hit 60 in about 6 or 7 days /played before but it took me 11 days real time. I'm definitely not one to talk about getting 60 in under a week.
---
I'll one-up you by saying the other Dark Portal, the one in Azshara. I wish that in TBC it was made into an unlockable way to get between Azshara and Zangermarsh.
---
It's subscription based. Blizzard doesn't really care about the optimal release date like they would have for a new expansion, where you have to pay \~$50 for the "new" game.
---
Its true but not a 100% droprate
---
This is something I wonder about. I plan on playing a pvp server and I know a lot of struggles are gonna happen once we hit contested zones. I can only assume those hardcore levelers are just gonna grief the rest of us when we are mid 40s and they ding 60.
---
Classic is targeted for people with nostalgia...we're already old and we don't have friends, nor a reason to go outside in the summer. Sun is a killer, and we have AC at home, so we can cool off, and enjoy playing WoW as it was back in the day(almost), once again\~
---
I mean,  60 in a week even if doable sounds like leveling in private prior to that a couple 60s, watching videos,  of course skipping all instances,  I would doubt you expend time of professions, etc...  It seems a lot of work,  wich is fine I guess whatever floats you  boat,  but by rushing it you are throwing out of the  window every other feeling of joy you would have revisiting the old game, again,  whatever works for you. 
---
Ebay
---
I prefer the [Simple Wood]
---
You There! Check out that noise! 
---
I don't leave the house unless it's for work so the sooner the better for me. 
---
The only dark portal I know of in azshara is the underwater one used as a placeholder for a possible raid entrance. But it never made it to live
---
please delete this post before someone see it and actually believes what you wrote.
---
&gt; you literally die to 3 frost bolts
---
lmao
---
&gt; 1 warlock fear or a stunlock with thistle tea while doing shit dmg because you have no scaling
---
the burest of keks
---
&gt; hunter is garbage tier once people gets bwl gear
---
oh my sweet summer child
---
All the talk about Bis gear is just ridiculous...
---
Back in the early days of Private Server emulation I leveled a hunter from 1-60 with no Pet because they just didn‚Äôt work on the server. It was actually a little fun, like a new challenge for a character I knew really well. It was an MM/Survival Hybrid that got off an Aimed Shot into Arcane, they walked into a Immolation Trap, then Raptor Strike/Mongoose Bite/Counter Attack spam until the thing died. 
---
6/10, wouldn‚Äôt recommend to others but I did enjoy it at the time. 
---
Mage is probably the least dependent class with racials, but Gnome is the best PVE and PVP racial for mage on Alliance. It's a no brainer. Level 1 blizzard also makes perception pretty pointless on a mage. Bind it to something like the S key and learn to strafe. Backpedaling is slower that sideways. You never want to slow yourself on a mage. 
---
&gt; mage scales harder than hunter
---
clue is in the titel. PvP.  
---
fire mage scales better. frost mage does not. less so if you skip piercing ice, which good mages generally do.  
---
you can compare the scaling of hunters to that of MS warriors, with a little bit lower top end damage, but faster attack speed and 41y range. they scale perfectly fine in PvP.
---
&gt; I haven't seen that topic anywhere so far?    
---
You serious ?  
---
There are tons of post on a weekly base.... so sad
---
This sub is filled with repeated questions.  
---
like nobody know where the search function is, and used for :(
---
I can‚Äôt wait to watch Kevin Jordan‚Äôs stream. If you haven‚Äôt seen his streams of retail, I would recommend checking them out. His stream name is FailureAnalysis. He‚Äôs got some pretty thoughtful takes on current WoW design.
---
5 work days. Wed/Thur/Fri Mon/Tues
---
I can't believe that after so many hours of playtime, I never noticed that I could steer the feared mob... I feel so stupid now. Thanks for the tip, will definitely use it!
---
5 days here. Going to the beach so we have fun stuff to do while we take our 20 minute breaks. Making a trip out of it.
---
Trash is really bad right now. I‚Äôve wiped to Zul trash more than anything in the raid.
---
And it isn‚Äôt bosses that kills me in M+ it‚Äôs when trash in high keys one shot me. 
---
oh but yes it can. cant remember if crusader + untamed blade proc was up but it did happen 
---
*Screams in Zul trash, Kings Rest and SotS*
---
We won't know until blizzard gives is a release date but I have been speculating an August launch instead of mid or early summer.
---
I graduate university right before summer, so it lines up perfectly for me!
---
True but again you need to crit and if you don't crit and don't have enough sustained damage you'll lose aggro.
---
As said previously, agi is great in a gear only focused on tanking but I'm discussing here of a multitask gear which don't let much room for extra agi
---
Hunters have so much more than Scatter shot to deal with a mage doing that though. Grenade, trinkets (insignia, reflectors, tidal), potion, spider belt, pet positioning/training pet frost resist to avoid the nova and pushback/intimidation, 1k raptor strike on cloth. If he tries to cast frostball, feign death. If he doesn't tag you asap after feign death, cancel next cast with shadowmeld. One or two viper stings and a mage spamming arcane explosion will oom before he kills you. 
---
Yeah, but rested XP only effects kills, not quests. So realistically you could easily jump to level 7 or 8 by the time you finally deplete your rested bar since most of the levels early on are due to quests. Regardless, I only level one character at a time. I'll keep one in Orgrimmar and use him as a bank, and long onto him every 6 or 7 days for as long as it takes to burn that bonus.
---
Is call of the raptor a 1x use, or multiple use?
---
awesome :)
---
My girlfriend started playing WoW and picked horde. She regrets it because she says the alliance zones are far more beautiful 
---
You definitely need to kill... A lot. I think I farmed for necklaces for 2 hours straight with 2 Druids and I had more than 30 pages by the end. Easily could have completed the book by that point.
---
I intend to take 2 weeks off work one week after the release. Gotta give time to see if servers are stable and to make sure I can nolife for the weeks I'm off work, which is my intention. I'll rush to 60 with everything I've got and hope to go back to work at level 50+ 
---
To display a model you have two solutions:
---
\* model:SetUnit/Creature(unitId) where unitId is not a number but a string "target", "player" for yourself... etc (that works for local units, that is what is behind portraits). It is temporary, and only refers already loaded models.
---
\* modelSetDisplayInfo(displayId) where displayId is unique for each creature and player. And that can be used to actually load the model from disk.
---
Problem is, you cannot get the displayId from the unitId. If you could, you would simply store the value of fictionalGetDisplayId("target") when the soul shard spell is complete. Then anytime you would want to display it, you would just load the model using the stored displayId. 
---
But as far as I know, such function does not exist. You can't get displayId from unitId. You cannot either from a player's name or a creature id.
---
Perhaps it might be possible to create yourself such a database, by fetching data from WoWHead which has this information, and then generating lua code to access it.
---
Something funny to me... Nothing too serious, just a random thought.
---
Vanilla Deadmines is very much an Alliance thing, and here is how I know.
---
I got WoW day one, rolled a Taurean Shaman, did all the dumb vanilla shaman things, like tank wailing caverns and SFK...
---
6 month later I find out some RL friends all play in another server... as Alliance.  At this point I am torn, I have a pretty good group here in horde land... But RL friends!
---
 So I split my time. Weeknights as horde shaman trying to figure out how not to end up as another healer in MC... Weekends playing catch-up as a dwarf Paladin. 
---
And thus the Deadmines thought.  I had Rab my ass over to Deadmines once on my shaman, cause Smite's axe seemed like a good weapon and a rouge in gulid wanted defias gear.  We ran it, it was fine, but "easy" because we couldn't get lost. Unlike WC where you always get lost, then fall down the waterfall and get lost again...  Story and lore wise, Deadmines ment nothing to me at the time...
---
6 months later, Paladin is doing it, it is the most important thing ever! These defias guys are terrorists and must be dealt with!
---
Side note, I made my Alliance friends run WC, they were so lost and impressed that I knew the same way... But I did leave them fail the waterfall jump..  cause you know, they didn't think you needed to jump...
---
So after graduation you should probably be working and earning money and going out and living life, then, I would presume
---
&gt; you're going to be in for a surprise.
---
This is very different from "you shouldn't assume".
---
And what if these specific rates are actually accurate? Why would someone dismiss a mechanic/drop rate just because it's from a private server?
---
People also seem to forget that private servers/community are the main reason we're getting classic in the first place.
---
It's because the world doesn't work itself to suit your needs. You are not as important as you think you are, sorry.
---
Also, Summer Break

is that why various people on pvt servers are always accepting Thick Leather stacks at 1.20g per stack?  Same with Rugged Leather
---
Can you fuck off with "NPC" and "Cuck" you fucking NEET.
---
Atlas loot enhanced is a great addon.
---
I really hope we don‚Äôt end up on the same classic server. 
---
^why ^^are ^^^people ^taking ^^this ^seriously 
---
This was removed by automod due to a landslide of reports from users... good job y'all, I'm proud.
---
Probably a week, won't be hitting it majorly hard though. Just play at my own pace and do other stuff between playing or i'll get burnt out. 
---
I work at a school so as long as its summertime I technically have off.
---
With my luck it'll get delayed.
---
Basically anything with white lettering or better has some AH use.
---
If you're worried about inventory space, you can always mail such items to a bank alt. Perhaps you will find a use for it later yourself.
---
still, you take more damage for those .5 seconds due to being in caster form
---
not saying that you shouldn't do it, just that you should be careful
---
still no rez, feral shit, boomkin shit  
---
just no  
---
wotlk and cata is when they got together and made druid good in general  
---
Not to mention, the stairs were a lot of fun back in the day.
---
First thing that came to mind was raw 'meat/fish'.
---
It's easy enough to farm later, but leveling cooking while also leveling... After about 100 skillpoints, it slows down a lot.
---
In the case of meat...
---
Plus every now and then, a level 20-40 beast might drop meat that can be used in 150+ recipes.    It's just a matter of getting to the quest/vendor in a zone you can't get into easily or accept yet.
---
Plus farming that said meat from grey mobs, so no exp, isn't much fun.
---
In the case of fish...
---
Lots of naga and murlocs drop raw fish... And  gold... And greens... They fact that you can't skin them is the only reason they are not the most farmed mobs I think (worgen drop gold, greens and can be skinned, free Skinner tip... No meat however...).
---
So it can save you some fishing time...
---
It's not about not wanting others to pull ahead them, it's about wanting a good game. There should be a feeling of progression through MC. Rounding up 40 of your friends to storm the depths of Blackrock Mountain to slay giant salamanders who then drop stuff that you turn into nexus shards because it's not as good as the blue that dropped off some asshole elf in DM is not a good game.
---
Man up, get an air condition, and glorify your man cave like a true neckbeard.
---
Oh yeah. And maybe it's because I never rolled a gnome or dwarf in vanilla, but I always felt like I was missing some story or lore, so I'd explore that place to try and find the missing link!
---
It won't take any more artists than what they're currently using. They're reverting models and textures, which means going back and changing all the models anyway. If these are already fixed, they would literally have to add it back in intentionally.
---
I mean yeah, but we're talking about casteer mobs here. They will be casting and you warstomp to interrupt them, so you do not take damage. Also you can always put up barkskin before if you have melee mobs.
---
Not even close. A mediocre druid is much better than a mediocre warrior thanks to Swipe spamming making it easy to keep 3 mobs on you, but comparing both classes played by a competent player and there's just so much more a warrior can do.
---
Wars take less damage, just spend some time healing both of them in dungeon runs and you'll see. Yes bears have some sizable armor, but remember warriors have a built-in 10% mitigation thanks to def stance.
---
Battle shout is crazy strong, arguable an equal dps increase as LotP
---
Shield Bash to interrupt every 10sec as opposed to the long Bash timer, casting interrupts are some of the highest damage mitigation you can pull off and also huge threat generators.
---
Sunder removes much more armor than Fairy Fire
---
Still better damage mitigation thanks to parry and block, Shield Block makes getting uncritable trivial.
---
Thunder Clap is some sizable damage mitigation.
---
Intimidating Shout is a very powerful control tool when used correctly
---
Bezerker Rage to break out of fears
---
Can pop potions without having to change into squishy form.
---
Sure druids bring some nice stuff along as well, Thorns for aoe threat, MotW for the group, combat Rez incase the healer goes down, a stun that doesn't require spacing protection, but they really can't compete with the warrior tanking package.
---
Not to mention, see the old school DM. Before they reworked it!
---
Blackrock was always hard for me to find a group that wanted to do more than a boss or two.
---
I miss Mr. Smite.
---
Keep it EXACTLY how it was in vanilla.
---
There are some legit uses:
---
saving powerful buffs
---
saving durability if your hearth is set nearby anyway 
---
unexpected aggro and you just want to get out
---
+some horde trolling scenarios but it should be done in a sophisticated way or as revenge, not griefing.
---
Bubble hearthing just for the sake of it gets old quickly, and to escape defeat is not in my book. I do think a big chunk of Paladins do it though. They will have to speak for themselves.
---
Thanks for the rec!
---
Wow was my first real mmo. It‚Äôs up to you to teach her. I‚Äôd love to have a gf interested in classic. It would be fun to teach a new player. You have an opportunity many would kill for. 
---
Are you implying that going out to Azeroth doing work for the Horde actually isn't living a life, working or earning money? Goddamnit......
---
Alliance has better early game zones, horse has better end game. Hinterlands has sooooo many more quests for horde for instance.
---
I‚Äôll be taking my two weeks for it
---
They are using exactly zero artists, I'm pretty sure.
---
They are not "reverting" anything (ok, maybe they used that word, it still doesn't mean what you imply). They are using the existing ones. It's all programming, nothing to do with art. (Well, they have to compare their build with the original 1.12 build for discrepancies, but that can be done by the programmers. Maybe after they are done, one artist might take a look and check off on it as 'ok', but I doubt it.)
---
Although I don't work for Blizzard, I'm a game developer. I thought I'd illuminate things a bit, but of course you can think what you want. :)
---
I live in phoenix so summer inside with AC is perfect for me!  But if i get what u are saying. 
---
Good shit post
---
I'm unlikely to find a job straight after graduation, but either way, enjoying myself in Classic is what I would define as living and enjoying life :)
---
Depends on the server economy. At the start of a server it's almost always better to vendor any low level items. If you're on a low pop server where not many items will be traded daily you probably want to vendor most things. My first 60 on a high pop pserver I kept every white and mailed it to bank alt and ended up not making much more than if I just sold everything.
---
Damn.  I was never much for battlegrounds, outside of av but, I remember things like this out in the rest of Azeroth.
---
The Timbermaw Hold gate for a possible raid in Azshara

My favorite 5 man is druid tank, warrior dps, shaman dps or heals, mage, priest. Sub shaman for paladin if alliance 
---
I must be sick in the brain because I know all the BiS items/drop locations for my classes. 
---
I see one assassin and a druid, who's the second assassin?
---
What a great story. I never really enjoyed pvp in wow but I definitely saw the appeal. People like you were called something... Twinks? Was that right? 
---
Totally agree. Paladin tanking in TBC was my best period of enjoyment ever. WotLK had some good aspects specially at the beginning, but then at some point it began to go downward and eventually boring.
---
&gt;That's when I found a different kind of happiness. I broke up with that slut bitch from the movies and leveled from 51 to 60 ENTIRELY inside of AV killing wolves and NPCS. 5hour WSG? BRUH AV was like 20 hours sometimes.
---
Calm down, M. Night Shyamalan.
---
As soon as the gameplay is locked, they should release. 
---
Getting the shade of light perfect from lamps isn‚Äôt a reason to delay the game!

Also agility is better than strength while lvling as arms because crits üòç
---
I miss Barrens chat
---
10/10. 
---
My best friend IRL and I leveled alt gnome rogues to the upper 30‚Äôs. Whenever we wanted to take a break from our mains, we would gank horde players leveling all throughout STV.
---
We had friends IRL on the horde side. They said when they were in STV, people would be in general chat just wanting to know if someone had seen Ronzo or Sincere. 
---
Looking forward to doing it again! 
---
Large venom sac for aq.
---
Dont vendor level 53+ green, disenchant them with a lvl 5 alt! Greater eternal essence sell real good.
---
Sadly, many people think this will trivialize raiding content.
---
This change, and the BoP tradeable loot change, I'm not in agreement with. 
---
Autoselfcast lol
---
Well, changing 8 slot debuff to 16 slot, and changing Bind on Pickup loot to make it tradeable are just bad decisions that will affect the game.
---
This is why running dungeons is underrated. Yes, in a vacuum leveling solo is more efficient. But if quests are being camped or zones are hot, you can benefit greatly from running dungeons.
---
Or, of course, ActiBlizzard can simply shard the zones as they will for the starting zones so quests will never be camped.
---

That's pserver retardation not vanilla Barrens chat.
---
I stopped at 49 with my warrior for a while, used Kang's decapitator and felt immortal. I would oneshot so many people with Mortal Strike. That feeling was amazing.
---
I find it pretty interesting, I expected to get a ton of downvotes for even bringing up this topic but it has stayed at 0. 
---
That was the best part of original servers and BGs. I did a lot of low lvl BGs, too, and purposefully took forever to level up. Ill never forget hanging outside the BG entrance (back when you had to queue at the BG itself) dueling other players and learning tips from the experienced 60s on their GM/HWL grind.
---
I loved seeing and recognizing names in those BGs, on either side, and then seeing them progress and change as the game moved on. You really got a feel of like "oh man this guy has the potential to be something special" and were excited to see them down the line and how they progressed. 
---
Absolutely, but small mistakes could cause you have to abandon your pull and you‚Äôre a lot more vulnerable to opposing faction players. Just clarifying the risks with AoE farming (I just finished a Mage 1-60 recently where I didn‚Äôt do a single quest post 26, so a LOT of AoE farming was used). 
---
AoE farming is very good, but only if the conditions are met to allow it. I just don‚Äôt see that often being the case for Classic launch, unfortunately.
---
So as a shaman Raider... And the fact that you have 'done' the druid Raider... I just don't see a reason to do druid again.
---
Shaman has ghost wolf, so you get some of the PvP effect, not as good, but some crossover anyway.
---
You have both melee and range DPS and healing, just no real tank... So nearly all the same hybrid roles.
---
Gear, you have to roll against hunters for mail but that seems better than against Rouge for leather... Especially if it is int/spirit heavy gear... Plus shamans 'could' also go after caster leather/cloth and agility leather... So really you are just adding mail and sheilds to your potential loot pool.  Never overlook the fact that only warriors in horde sude can use sheilds so caster sheilds would almost always go to a shaman...
---
Totems are great support for 5mans and raids.  Resistance totems are great, never have enough of them.  I really feel like there should have been a 4th of role, Support.  Shaman would have been the king of that role.  Your not to bad at what you do and you make everything way better!
---
Great story. Thank you!
---
If you haven't seen the video about the unreleased version of Kara(totally different from TBC), it looks like it was designed for a 40man raid. Lots of areas for rapid respawning trash mobs(gauntlet style) and big rooms for boss fights. It would be very cool to see it even as a filler dungeon like zg to mc or aq20 to aq40. I would like to see some filler gear for off specs. Maybe a 5piece set? Definitely an arcane resist fight. Maybe a rare mount drop. 
---

---
I'm gonna book my 4 week summer holiday to start at the release date, as soon as it is announced.
---
This was enjoyable to read, I miss the sense of community and seeing the same faces every day. It truly was a wonderful time
---
You have to overgear the dungeon by a lot to 2hander tank it. I used to 2hand tank BRD frequently and it would go so smooth and fast. Dunno if I would do that for Strat or Scholo, but it could probably be done with good enough gear.
---
love them, he makes one every other day
---
I called their support line some years ago, I can't remember if my password had been changed or if I was just hacked, and I just had to read out a CD key from any of the games.
---
I'm pretty sour about the fact that my first experience at end-game was going through the same dungeons 30 times for something that was marginally better than another item that would've sufficed.
---
I feel the same way, but I still manage not to be a cunt *shrugs*
---
As long as it's after June 2nd when my vacation time gets reset. 
---
ok lmao

Lol, this guy.
---
Pre-nerf muru was no joke

---
I can't imagine someone on this subreddit not taking time off lol
---
I'm thinking about it but I'm not sure. At most it would be a day or two since that time off would be better spent with the family.
---
Re:  MC being easy.  MC was always easy.  
---
What made it a grind were the garbage talents and itemization at the time.  Stuff took forever to die.
---
With 1.12, you get the best itemization, the best talents, and the best threat changes.  Not including the ninja changes, they might have done.  16 debuff slots.  etc
---
So you take an easy raid, ramp up the damage, and then you get LFR.
---
If that's what we're getting in Classic, that's really too bad.  MC wasn't always an "entry level" raid.  It was "the" raid at one point.
---
Laughs in Paladin.
---
We did Scholomance with 4 warriors and 1 resto shaman. The tank was the warrior with most plate items and the one who pulled, crazy damage and fun!
---
What I usually look for in a streamer: a decently well-spoken and entertaining individual who's knowledgeable about the game. The actual specific content itself, for me, doesn't matter a ton since the actual streamer, and their attitude, drive the entertainment and the whole experience.

A ransom warrior tanking in serker stance is like a druid tanking in boomkin. 
---
Blackrock is more than just a dungeon. Just like Maraudon or Diremaul you've got different runs. And the journey (and PvP) when try to get to the dungeon are all part of the experience :)
---
Private servers have nothing to do with this. You are just straight up wrong about this and probably sucked ass at your class when you played vanilla.
---
They are definitely using artists. Who do you think made the classic logo? Who do you think will make all the new art on the website / bnet client to advertise and differentiate classic?
---
Now, chances are those are a very different kind of artist than an artist who would modify 3d models, like hair, but they are artists nonetheless. They may also be using artists for other things that I just can't think of off the top of my head. The new old lighting itself may be implemented by programmers, but might have certain values fine tuned by an artist.
---
Idiots like you who think provate servers are no relevant are in for a shock when all the private server players shit on you in Classic because they actually know the game, not some broken memories of being a scrub 10 years ago.
---
Light feather is a big seller as Priests need it to levitate... and as a priest i always have some on me.  The number of times I lost a hordie trying to gank me using it.  I just run across a near by body of water or jump off a cliff to safety.
---
See I'm torn between warlock and druid. Warlock I've played so much of, and druid I haven't played. I've played an enhancement shaman, so I couldn't tell you about the ele/resto life. The only reason I don't choose a druid over the warlock immediately is the "Don't get to see gear often" point you made. I feel like I'd get really bored really quickly just by no life grinding for r10 and rep stuff, then getting a ton of gear handed to me since I'd most likely be one of two druids in the raid lol. (Don't get me wrong getting fully geared in no time is great, but it's the longevity of the situation that I'm concerned with.) We're gods the first month or two of pvp, but once other classes are getting geared etc, druids seem to fall off. I'd say go shaman, since ele and resto seems dope and you get some great item choices + good scaling later on.
---
The mind controlling enemy is [Coilfang Soothsayer](https://db.excalibur.ws/?npc=19890) from Slave Pens. One of the most deadly enemies in that dungeon and should always be CCed immediately. If tank or healer gets mind controlled it's practically a guaranteed wipe on heroic, and even letting a DPS be mind controlled is going to wipe all but the most overgeared groups. 
---
I love BC heroics because there are enemies in every heroic with abilities that if not properly handled will wipe the group. Knowledge of each enemy's abilities and what can be done to counter them is critical for a smooth run. 
---
The main downside is that groups always need at least 1, sometimes 2, CC just to be able to clear the heroic which limits group composition. DPS without CC often have a hard time getting in heroic groups, except for shamans because bloodlust/heroism is very OP for short dungeon boss fights and they have other great utility and DPS too.
---
That's just nitpicking at this point. I'll leave you to it. :)
---
No, not at all. 
---
I will start 2 or 3 weeks after launch to be behind that massive first wave. I am in no rush to reach lvl 60. I was there almost 14 years ago and it took me months to reach max lvl. Raiding started much later for me and even though I became a hardcore raider I want to point out that vanilla wow IS NOT about raiding. There is so much to do which is a lot more fun than raiding...
---
agi is not a good stat for bears. sta&gt;str&gt;int=agi
---
I would say it was flying in Azeroth that killed it in conjunction with LFD. Before that, the game was at the peak of its popularity. 
---
Wow this checks out. World first was 4/25/05 and DM was released 3/7/05. Considering this released 11/23/04 it went uncompleted for 122 days. Imagine that. I imagine a bulk majority was getting to 60 in the first place, but Onyxia was cleared 3 months prior. 
---
sidebar thought on this, but still: do you think epics will disenchant into nexus crystals on release?  
---
it makes an interesting timeline (and economy) if we have more-or-less 12 months of nexus crystals with nothing to spend them on.
---
Even in BC there was still a significant amount of CC that needed to be done unless the tank and healer were SCC/TK geared.  I remember making it a point of pride being able to keep up seduce with my lock when the group was asking for a mage/rogue for poly or sap.
---
Lookup madseasonshow on youtube

I need old scholomance in my life. Amazing story with the whole krastinov stuff. One of my first wow memories back when I joined in burning crusade was spending what felt like hours here, my character I ran it on still has all the original quests for there. Miss that one.
---
I also want old scarlet monastery wings because that was my first ever and I just loved everything about that dungeon.

Hi, /u/SaurfangSweetfang
---
I normally have too many alts for that.
---
I had the fastest SM cath run I‚Äôve ever had with a bear tank the other day. For 5 man content, especially pre 60, if you have the appropriate level and gear, there‚Äôs no real problem.
---
Streamers fans* -I am not looking forward to god damn twitch chat in trade.
---
pvp is half the fun! There is not much of a Horde vs Alliance dynamic without pvp :/
---
"It's better not to plan around the assumption that odd and unusual drop rates are going to the same" is the point, not "I hate pservers".
---
Yup.  That's exactly why you see people buying thick leather.  It typically starts at 1g per stack and works it way up to 1.2g was more leatherworkers catch on.  
---
To me, it's not worth the craft time to craft the item for such little profit (at 1.2g per stack), but some people just sit in org/if all day and just craft these things literally all day long.  It's a 60 second craft time per item by the way.  So in your example of 120g= 7.71g profit it's almost 4.8 hours of crafting.
---
Yeah
---
Wait, a red or a yellow quest doesn't give you way more exp than a green one?
---
Without a doubt.
---
I banked everything. When leveling my main character I also have several bank alts that I mail my stuff to; one for cooking ingrediants, one for herbs, one for ores and stones, one for cloth and leather and one for white items that I don't what they're used for. After I reach 60 and max out my professions I usually just sell whatevers left. 
---
Got my epic mount two weeks after I hit max level this way (also it really clears up some bagspace during leveling)
---
Having run around those areas myself, there really is a lot of potential with where they could take some horizontal content to classic.  I think it really is going to depend on the state of classic, the kind of numbers that it is able to maintain a couple years after release as to what direction they go.
---
Obvious and logical choice is just to roll out a version of TBC for people to transfer to if they want, but we'll see.
---
Well it's already confirmed that sit Critting will not trigger talents (sorry paladins and fury warriors) so some bug/exploits will be patched for sure. I just hope wall jumping is still around. That was my jam

haha yeah i had this epic mace, called the something of the north. I can't remember it entirely, i wish i would have saved a screenshot of my load out.
---
Trash is way harder than bosses in M+ in retail, especially north of a +17. It's just brutal. 
---
Just like the movies, if that shit's been out forever, you get no spoiler alert.
---
No.
---
I played a ton of 49 bracket. Troll BM Hunter named Logick. Nothing like Beastial Wrathing with Tak the Leaper and watching him chase down a mounted clothie and kill him before the stun wore off. Those hours of my life will be cherished.
---
If the legion and BFA launches are any indication, Blizzard has gotten very good at seamless launches.
---
yeah, I considered cast time also.
---
In general as a tribal LW on a heavy pop private server, I've found that most of my gold comes from crafting tips or selling cured rugged hides for 20g each.
---
The overly high server pop means farming spots for things like essence of water and especially devilsaur are too contested, therefore buying/farming mats to craft and sell isn't really worth it.  
---
I tell you what, it was not until BC and WoLk that I had IRL friends to play with. I always wonder how vanilla could have been different with them. Aside from my brother, but he didn't really play with me that much because he was much older than me and had a more serious group.
---
It will change how pvp goes down so I highly doubt it. That‚Äôs the argument against that I‚Äôve heard and it makes sense.
---
I'm proud to say that I've been in a group that cleared the entirety of LBRS and UBRS in one run.  
---
I'd like to do that again in Classic too.  
---
Yes I agree with that being the best part. It was the in game reputations. Not the bar meter you filled for a faction. The real life reputations that developed from guilds that world pvp'ed a lot, and players that you frequently encountered
---
hahaha
---
TBC dungeons were boring loot hallways IMO.
---
no and we don't want it 
---
don't get me wrong i liked it in later expacs but part of what's special is the time investment and seeing people in good gear and thinking wow that person worked hard 
---
I enjoy transmog when i played wow but its not something for classic 
---
yup. I kind of got lucky with a 49 twink especially that early in the game. He was technically my main, but with the help of my brother I could afford the nice stuff and get the gear I needed from runs. 
---
If you want to wear Pally T2, you go out and get Pally Tier 2 and wear it.
---
Do me a favor and learn the necessary version of Lua for the current client API and do addons-on-request.  
---
I'm pretty sure it's against Blizzard's ToS but I'm thinking about setting aside a budget for commissioned addons to get exactly what I need. I'm too stupid to figure it out myself so I have to use my pocket book instead.  
---
Yeah, his videos are more about what Classic was rather than what Private servers are. 
---
=) Wonderful story!
---
I too had an arch enemy at one point in the game in vanilla, and since we played on a PVE-server we could hang out and talk with each other between games, come up with strategies to take each other down and give information on our team mates. Ah, good times. Miniassassin, I miss you. 
---
Yup, the three items which killed WoW for me personally were 1) flying and 2) lfd, which almost completely ended player interaction, and 3) boa scaling gear which (mostly) destroyed crafting and meaningful dungeon drops.   Those were my "Oh this is kinda cool, NO WAIT WHAT HAPPENED IT'S RUINED!!!!"  items.

holy shit thats it! I love you haha. yeah combat rogues got a talent that gave us a chance to stun if hit with a mace. it worked so well with this man i miss vanilla
---
Don't forget Kara, dragon Isles, and I'm sure a bunch more stuff I'm forgetting that they can still finish. 
---
Her nails show her true allegiance.. For the Alliance! :D
---
Pbbbttt
---
I tell you the truth as I see it. The level 49 bracket inside of vanilla WoW was my absolute favorite point for battle grounds. Warriors just got plate, shamans got mail, your talents are well rounded (looking at you shadowpriest), and everyone got a mount. No one had raid gear so the gap in the top players wasn't huge. It was actually a lot of fun.
---
Agree. TBC is awful outside everything but raiding and the raids have already been done. Vanilla, raiding was just a thing you could do. Not EVERYTHING and all that mattered.
---
Even though there is a 0% chance of it ever happening, it would be cool if they expanded the classic game at some point down the road, rather than go TBC.
---
They've already confirmed no transmog system for Classic
---
I totally agree with you 100%. Sad news though. The devs have said that although they don't have any plans for tbc and wrath at this moment, they might release them it all depends on the community. 
---
I agree. It's just it sucks you have to push an arbitrary number modifier so high just to have challenging mechanics. Back in the day even normal mode raids had challenging trash. Mythic Chogall trash was exactly the same as normal mode.
---
I think TBC is basically 10/10 in terms of PvE progression, but I don't like outland and a variety of other changes they made to the game. Things so basic such as summoning stones made a huge difference to the game.
---
In vanilla every class was much more unique, literally none of them really filled the same role (closest probably DPS warrior and rogue) while all others did different things, and each had very unique reasons to be added into any group. Have lock? Now not everyone has to run and replacing people is easier. Mage = free food/water etc etc. While TBC threw that out of whack with lots of QoL changes.
---
Goblin Rocket Helm + Deathwish + Recklessness + Gnomish Death Ray = 1 shot a healer
---
And what suprise would that be ? Ive been playing pservers for 2 years now and cleared naxx back in vanilla. Rates pretty much 99% accurate on both the bigggest pservers communities right now. Sorry to burst your bubble. 
---
Is that bait?
---
warriors weren't aoe tanking with thunderclap (or at all) and paladins weren't mindlessly aoe tanking heroics in level appropriate gear.  sure, by ZA/sunwell where everyone had badge gear it was easy to aoe tank but a preraid/kara geared paladin would just die trying to do such a thing.  no different from aq40 geared ppl facerolling strath for orbs, or shit, even 1.10 OP blue geared people smashing dungeons
---
tbc heroics were the peak of dungeon cc usage.  we had a brief renaissance with launch cata but wotlk babs cried it out of existence
---
They had no plans to re-release WoW vanilla either
---
until they did
---
I‚Äôve always enjoyed vanilla more than TBC. I put so much time into vanilla from launch to TBC launch, and I don‚Äôt ever remember quitting for a long period of time.
---
However, I only got about halfway through TBC before I quit, only to come back at the end of wrath. TBC was good, but it wasn‚Äôt the same game.
---
I saw my guild, and many others, dissolve due to raid size reduction. I saw so many PvP guilds disband due to arena being the main form of PvP. I also never really cared for arena. I went from BGs I enjoyed to watching people hump pillars all day.
---
Also, the theme just felt odd. I went from a fantasy world to space. On top of that we had to share a city with the other faction, and were mostly stuck in the much small Outland for all of our content.
---
Then we have flying mounts and flight form. World PvP died down a lot due to them. Though, I have to admit that flying for the first time was fun but I quickly began to dislike them.
---
Kara development in vanilla would be amazing. Like a pre naxx installment? New attunement chain!
---
For some bonus nostalgia I bet the purple robe you mentioned Demerzel wearing was [Robes of the Lich](https://www.wowhead.com/item=10762/robes-of-the-lich#screenshots:id=20287) or [Robe of the Magi](https://www.wowhead.com/item=1716/robe-of-the-magi#screenshots:id=94587).

I‚Äôve just been on a vanilla server for a few weeks now because of the state of retail, but I could be happy doing nothing but vanilla for years. 
---
I disagree.
---
TBC actually made most specs viable.
---
Vanilla didn't even have any gear for a lot of specs, like balance druids.
---
I think it strikes a good balance between the hardcore RPG that was vanilla, while improving on some of it's rough patches.

How will you know someones skin color through a game?

Thats stuff they could solve with other off-tier content, similar to what ZG did for casters (magic hit rating), maybe they could come up with some items that made other speccs playable without adding huge power-creep to the game.
---
Yeah, Zul trash can be pretty rough tbf. 
---
Classes felt more fleshed out in TBC.  Things were heading the right way at the end of Vanilla but class balance was terrible.  I could actually raid as Enhance in TBC and not be laughed out of the raid.
---
Yeah TBC = you know 25 people. Vanilla = you know a couple thousand. I actually knew more people in WOTLK than TBC because the raiding was so dumbed down we pugged it until Uld hard modes lol. Cheesed Sarth with a blood dk and arcane mages. Easiest thing ever. 
---
I want to for sure. The only issue is that I have to schedule my vacation time soon, and I don‚Äôt know when I should schedule it.
---
This is not how fear works. Fear makes mob run in completely random directions. Some private servers have had incorrect implementations of fear.
---
I always thought Deadwind Pass was cool. It had a sense of foreboding to me when I rode through it. And Karazhan turned out to be one of my favorite raids for its atmosphere and all the details of different areas as you make your way up the tower. To me it did live up to what I imagined could be in there.
---
BRD, the greatest dungeon of all time!
---
Crazy to hear about how young some people were. I was 18 when I played. I probably could have been better but I was a really good resto druid. At the time I was doing really well but that doesn‚Äôt mean myself and my guild mates couldn‚Äôt have done better. With our knowledge at the time we did what we thought best. This made my resto druid the second best healer in my guild. I think some of the other healers just didn‚Äôt know some things like downranking, 
---
but vanilla was the most raid focused time in wow.  you could raid or poopsock honor grind for progression and raiders had a massive advantage in the latter.  wow has always boiled down to raiding or pvping at max level (until the introduction of mythic+) so i dont understand how people keep saying that raiding was only a small part of vanilla.  sure, leveling was a large time investment but event he most casual players could hit 60; this isn't everquest or lineage.  tbc had a longer leveling time investment until 2.3 and a roughly equivalent one after the nerfs.  
---
I don‚Äôt think anything in WoW will ever invoke a sense of wonder like Hyjal did in vanilla. Just because it had been part of WC3 and was a massive locked zone in the middle of everything, with an entrance and a fully detailed world to explore. And things people had seen from explorer‚Äôs videos - Archimonde‚Äôs skeleton, the massive crater, etc. I think Hyjal evoked a ‚Äúso when do WE get to go there?‚Äù response from the community more than any other place like CoT or the various other locked instance portals.
---
Plans can change, what they're planning now is irrelevant when the decision on whether to carry on with the expansions will only be made in over 2 years from now. If Classic is a smashing success then TBC and Wrath will follow eventually, there's no reason for Blizzard to not do it and all the reasons to, there are a lot of people who are incredibly nostalgic for those too. 
---
They won't necessarily replace Vanilla though, I imagine they'd be separate servers which you can copy your Vanilla characters to, straight up upgrading the servers is not a solution I think many would like. In that respect I don't think they'd do much harm, it might spread out the Classic community a bit, but I'm sure it'd still be healthy on the Vanilla side.
---
Personally I'm interested in trying TBC again, but not before I've done everything I want to in Vanilla. Never want to touch Wrath again though, thought it was extremely poor at the time, and I still hold it accountable for what the game has become.
---
The amount of legolas names on hunters was unreal.
---
I think its either they are bragging on a wholesome thread or they only played pservers or they were in the VERY VERY few who knew what they were doing. Honestly, to me it‚Äôs just bragging on a thread people are telling their stories about how bad they were. It‚Äôs not the place for it.
---
http://classicdb.ch/?item=810
---
This one I think :) I remember selling one of those for a fair bit of dosh when working for my epic mount.
---
Because it took forever to get raid-ready and progress your gear, where a lot of that was done outside of raids. While on retail, you raid and do basically nothing else thats relevant to your progression.
---
Shit like actually keeping your economy up so you can afford shit you need for raids, doing your class quests which took forever. Farming rep for shit that you wanted to help you progress etc.
---
Its mostly just a lot slower phased, and lvling as well also took much longer obviously.
---
I don't really agree with the above guy. But regardless of whether the game is mainly PvE in PvP, many people enjoy vanilla PvP and there is quite a bit of depth when you use all the engineering items/consumables/craftables available. People definitely play this game for PvP and I don't see why you are flaming about it. Sure alot of people are trash but that doesn't mean there is no skill involved.   
---
One aspect that is particularly enjoyable is the World PvP in classic, which you seem to be conveniently ignoring. World PvP matters in classic and dominating in say Un' Goro or Silithus can be very lucrative. The best PvP I have ever had in WoW was in Un' Goro Crater in Vanilla.   
---
Many, many people play this game and never end up raiding. Some people just like running dungeons, some pvp 24/7, some enjoy playing the economy, some collect items they enjoy and some just RP around pretending to be a farmer in Southshore. The core of WoW isn't one thing . Perhaps for you it's raiding but these statements just don't generalize to all players.
---
SW park will be back!!!! 
---
Hey, Thanks for reply. I was thinking about that, but so far we don't know which API will be accessible in 1.13. I assume it will be similar to retail, but with few changes. So for that we already have tons of add-ons. So I will likely won't be able to make something worthwhile without duplicating/splitting userbase.
---
Site you mentioned is giving me absolutely same vibe, it seems like 'clear' concept, but execution will be hard in world of bigger players.
---
For Guild recruitment/management, It was just an example, but I think it would be really easy project for me, based on what I do for living.
---
I think they should not do loot trading and not do tickets either. Your ML needs to get it together or not be ML.
---
i really REALLY dont need wrath to be back....it just added way too many QOL and introduced shit like dungeon browser and phasing.
---
Agree with everything here. Deadwind is hostile in a way that no other zone is. It's just death and despair. Even places like Felwood or the Blackrock 
---
 mountain zones feel like some places that are lively but dangeous. I never got to raid Kara during its expansion but I made it a point to stroll through every week on my higher level character and check each and every little corner.
---
Was about to make this identical reply.
---
Put another way, they had no plans to release Vanilla until they were convinced they could make money.
---
They will be similarly not interested in TBC or Wrath until they are sure they can make money.
---
Black Desert is basically given away because the unhealthy grind strongly encourages purchases to stay relevant.
---
Shame. There is an addon I want done for Classic that I haven't found anywhere else.  
---
My soich continues :)  
---
How could y‚Äôall let them continue to be ML? After the second time you give someone else the job. I couldn‚Äôt raid with a team knowing I might not get my loot until a GM can fix it. 
---
We get it, Vanilla is your favorite. Why can't you just leave it at that? Shitting on other people's opinions is completely useless. 
---
I feel like the OSRS route would be amazing. Release content after Naxx. Release funny unique events like the gurubashi event or the fishing extravaganza but keep the old core RPG elements. What's the point in going into TBC?  Wouldn't it be cooler to see new content in Vanilla?
---
&gt;.it just added way too many QOL
---
I think that starts a lot already in TBC. Obviously nowhere near as bad, but somethings are clearly lost, specifically people roaming the world to run to their raids/dungeons or farming resources on azeroth to the same extent.
---
I gotchoo bb
---
I have a very fond memory of dying to 2 mobs that were 3 levels higher than me and being taunted by a rogue for it. The rogue soon died to 2 similar mobs and I got my chance to emote as I resurrected her. The constant challenge forced you to be invested in every encounter and I love that about Vanilla.
---
Yeah there's no such thing as being able to correctly remember droprates from 13 years ago with that level of precision.
---
This community collectively misremembered something as basic and clear cut as warlock pet summoning behavior, the consensus was proven wrong when Blizzard tested it on their internal 1.12 client. 
---
Trying to guesstimate current droprates from personal experience alone would be tough already. Comparing them to historical rates? Forget about it
---
No. This is where you start ruining actual community interaction and core end-gameplay.
---
You cannot divide the community and isolate yourself to your own little world and still be playing Vanilla.
---
I‚Äôm a rogue. Salv helps a ton. I could pull threat on everything if I didn‚Äôt have salv. I don‚Äôt have to spam feint as much. BoS can save the raid. 
---
All classes respec between raiding and PVP in Vanilla. Resto gear = Boomkin gear because there are always a few pieces that are armor specific with "nature dmg" that no one else wants.
---
Anyone complaining about being a Boomkin or a Ele shaman in Vanilla is just delusional. Big deal you press heal instead of a dps button. You are a HYBRID. If you never heal while doing pvp or whatever, you are playing the class wrong anyways.
---
I often play ele shaman. It's a WAY easier road then rogue that I also play. I drop totems press chainheal get awesome ele gear, respec and smoke people, while having people kiss my a@$ because I'm a healer. 
---
On Rogue...spend epic mount money on stupid devilsaur, kiss some warriors arse to even get a CHANCE to acquire Dal'rends that they also need in 1.12, fight 20 other people trying to get that dps spot, while realizing  I'm replaced by any warrior who can do BWL level rogue damage in pre raid.
---
Ret/Enhance? Kind of have an argument, but...they also excel in mediocre gear in Vanilla and can do just fine in easily accessible pvp blues and the 2 handed mace from AV. They also were designed to be new player/casual friendly and to not even really need raiding gear until the end of the expansion.
---
If they do the same dmg as warriors they make warriors pointless. See WOTLK and Ret. Anyone who played warrior dps over Ret in that expansion that liked BG's was a masochist. Ret Paladins were like John Wick and that's the kind of stuff that just breaks the game. Then you had to give non heal classes heal and now the game is completely FUBAR. All classes are basically the same with different animations.
---
Could you share ?
---
You didn't need full BiS to start raiding especially back in the day most players wore t0 sub optimal gear and did poor rotations. Most guilds didn't utilize full consumables or flask for every single raid or gather all the world buffs for raids like is common now in private servers.
---
  
---
What vanilla WoW has is the occasional rep grind or even more rarely a BoE that is useful for your spec that you can grind toward. However what vanilla wow does do is if you decide to get full pre raid-BiS (which is not remotely required to complete the raids easily) is it has rare spawn named that aren't in every instance like jed in UBRS and some bosses have drops that are much rarer. That's the time sync I assume you are referring to and like I said a lot of it is completely optional and not required at all.
---
I learned around 30 that I could actually drink AND eat at the same time. It changed everything...
---
Great peel and awesome result.
---
Can we see the "negative" as well? 
---
I had a 29 God/Twink back 2006ish, a rogue named grond.  There were a few pallys at that level that were really hard to kill. Justiczar was  the toughest. We had a bunch of nice scrapes. I miss it. I wish I could get my twink back almost more than my main. 
---
But instead we have actual molten metal right in the middle of our most-used capital city.
---
Do you have that? 
---
Stealth aggro range just takes getting used to. I can tell how far I need to be to avoid aggro. It all depends on your level relative to theirs. For pocketing i have no idea. It could all be different in classic for all we know.
---
100% agree!
---
You mean "opinions" like Brack's who told me that Vanilla was rose tinted glasses because he never worked on it? Sorry, the rose tinted glasses is the WoW he helped ruin. TCB is garbage outside raiding that's already been done. WoW is not even a real MMO past vanilla. You know 25 people in TBC. The people you raid with. In Vanilla you knew THOUSANDS.
---
An addon that replicates the action bar paging functionality, but uses the micro bar and bag bar as one page, and replaces it with an action bar when you press the paging button.  
---
Here is a rough idea of what it would look like, this concept was put together by someone who was working with me on it before, but eventually stopped responding on the project.  
---
https://i.imgur.com/jGWHpQc.gif
---
This poor kid probably has never played a real MMO. So very sad. Classic can't come soon enough!
---
Im 100% fine with tbc being released as long as we still get to keep dedicated Classic servers, preferably with the ability to transfer a character over. 
---
Why does it matter if people dominate leveling and gear because of guides? It won‚Äôt effect you accept maybe in wpvp. As I won‚Äôt be on a pvp server I won‚Äôt have that problem. 
---
I played a feral in the later part of vanilla and did a lot of battlegrounds.  I could usually hold my own in pretty much any 1v1 situation but you aren't fast at killing unless the enemy is undergeared so there's a lot of time that their friends can show up and ruin your day.  Warlocks were a constant pest, as they could dot you on sight and you don't really have the mana to heal up too much.  A properly played hunter (which used to be pretty rare honestly) should be able to cause you a lot of trouble however, as they have a fear that will work on your forms; you can shift at the end of the cast to stop that but you will run out of mana if you do it too much.
---
A resto druid can be nearly unkillable in group settings, unless your team is doing nothing to protect you.  With nature's grasp, throwing hots, and spam shifting when you need to create space, you can be hard to pin down.  Solo you can still win 1v1s but it will take a long time and your best bet is probably just to run lol.
---
Spirit adds a flat amount of health regeneration per point. Warrior's health regen formula in vanilla per tick is Spirit * 0.80 + 6. [Source](http://wowwiki.wikia.com/wiki/Health_regeneration). Very underrated stat for warriors for sure.
---
I want the original version of shazzrah back, the one that doesn't' blink and just sits there and dies.
---
Yeah, you don't need to min-max, but if you are there is going to always be a reason for you to be active and farm stuff to keep a strong economy. The same goes TBC where there are even more enchants and gems as well. You have gold sinks, resistance gear, specific rep if you want stuff, professions are pretty tough to skill up, you want to farm specific recipes etc.
---
And yeah, you can probably do MC/Onyxia maybe with a pretty low-effort group with relatively bad gear (still need people to farm aqual essence for raggy and executus tho), but when you get into BWL and further people really need to start farming this stuff or they are going to have a really bad time in the more difficult and gear dependant raids.
---
Obviously 40 man raids have a lot of room for carrying people if the core is overgeared, but if you want to actually participate in the raids and progression you will have to put in some effort unless your guild is insanely good.
---
Bullshit. I knew tons of pvpers in TBC and Wrath and alot of the server pop as a whole. Arena was tons of fun. People can like a game for any reason they want and who the fuck are you to tell them otherwise?
---
Vanilla isn't hardcore. Appeasing them is what made the game fail. Want hardcore go do mythic raiding with the second worst demographic you will ever meet in modern WoW. Or join the RBG community and join the worst.
---
Vanilla let hardcores get a few months ahead but the gear was close between tiers and content was never designed around them. It was designed around slow gear accumulation gating content. Hardcore players just broke the design as Blizzard knew they would.
---
Autistic people will find a way to compete in ANYTHING. You don't make a MMO for them though. You just give them some room to do it and make the game for everyone else.
---
The thing is that WoW isn't really that hardcore. Many of it's systems were invented to make the MMO genre more accessible. That trend simply continued beyond a reasonable stopping point.
---
Why does this matter unless you are going for server firsts? Make your own guild of people who don‚Äôt know everything. The pserver community will mostly be in the same guilds. We will also be spread out over several servers. It‚Äôs not like a pserver where everyone will be on the same server. Imo, the uninformed will be the majority. Plus, gear makes up your damage. Figuring out the right rotation isn‚Äôt hard. Just takes some practice. 
---
I can't wait for TBC and Wrath
---
Sorry all I saw was rogue/mage, rogue/priest, druid/warrior /priest/hunter #2523343234434 as we ran around a pole in a horrible minigame that the designers said was a mistake that eventually broke the game with homogenization.
---
https://www.engadget.com/2009/11/13/blizzard-arenas-were-a-mistake/
---
No one even played 3's outside the wannabe esport "athletes" that failed in real esports that actually have an audience.
---
I like the idea of horizontal content in 3 years or so. More 5 mans for leveling, new raids and tier sets with really minor like +2 stamina vs last set upgrades. 
---
There‚Äôs so many unexplored areas. It wouldn‚Äôt invalidate old content. 
---
It would also be great to see (way down the road) good gear for off spec. 
---
I think it would be the classic wow expansion. 
---
As long as they don‚Äôt invalidate old content, I think horizontal content is a good idea after several years. 
---
Funny that you are aligning with the designers opinions, when those are the same people who ruined your precious Vanilla. Logic. 
---
People played threes and fives and they liked it. You are wrong.
---
I'm not going to bother with this, you're not comprehending my posts and bringing up shit that wasn't even within the context of this thread.
---
I like TBC and WOTLK was passable so I'd be cool either way tbh. I wasn't really happy with how they handled Uldum or Grim Batol in Cata and they're just empty in vanilla so it'd be interesting to see them give those some content
---
But the debuff slot change from 8 to 16 was in vanilla? It wasn't even late vanilla, it was 1.7.
---
Tons of people love TBC and play it on private servers to this day. By saying that its garbage you are being the exact same as Brack, telling people what their opinion should be. Fuck off
---
Yeah but you're talking about people who barely played classic "remembering" stuff. Im talking about the work private servers like K. and N. have been doing for years now, looking up old sources and videos to get data as accurate as possible. I may not remember everything myself, but I know those servers do everything they can to get it right, and from my experience playing both projects extensively as well as the original, the drop rates, health levels, and other important server side values are pretty damn accurate. 
---
To claim that people will be "in for a surprise" with Blizzards Classic values over pserver ones is uninformed at best, ridiculous at the most. 
---
In retail it fits, you are the center of the story, the hero, the saviour. You are supposed to look cool. In classic, you arent shit, and you ll look like it until you have the armor to prove you arent anymore.
---
Yeah I try to tell them this, but you are dealing with mostly autistic people and the mentally ill. Even the best raiders have said this like Kungen. PVE was harder in EQ. PvP had bigger penalties in Ultima Online. You died you lost armor, reagents, potions, weapon. Death in WoW is a joke. 
---
It's a GOOD casual MMO that allows you to be good at pvp or raiding due to time, consumables. PvP has more room for being "great" but that is due to professions, which you still have to spend a lot of time on. When WoW tried to be esport level it crash and burned. Now you have the most annoying, mentally ill playerbase of any game ever that repels new players. Then Blizzard removed the time component and just let everyone experience things with no work. Now you have autistic people or people who don't even want to play a MMO. The normal people (vast majority) are all gone.
---
You are dead wrong on TBC. Because the continent was so small and the daily quest implementation, you saw the who's who daily. You knew the top PvPs, the top raiders, the top griefers all by name. There wasn't a million places to farm like there was in vanilla so everyone congregated to those spots. If you were good, you could make a name for yourself too. Raid size had very little to do with who you actually knew unless you only raid logged in some shit guild who didn't force you to have consumables for every raid.
---
What kind of mad masochist is this?!
---
I like to min max and I like to have extra things to do outside of raiding. Even retail has those extra mile stones. Like no you don't need every mythic+ drop titanforged but you could grind it. Yeah you personally could unlock feast recipes and flask recipes or grind gold so you can have boe's for the next raid tier but you don't have to do any of that.  
---
I guess my main point is throughout the entirety of WoW there has always been rep grinds profession grinds and gold farm grinds for boe's to help progress your character but they have always been optional for the most part and not needed to clear raid content especially if you aren't in a worldwide top guild competing for early kills and end up killing targets after nerfs / catch up mechanics kick in.  
---
Unpopular opinion apparently:
---
TBC is better than Classic. Arguably the best expansion ever created. 
---
Same age range here bro. I forgot how much people raged when someone used a pot. I do it second nature in pvp now. I think people don‚Äôt realize how many people on classic will be new to it. I think pserver community will be the minority. Plus, there are a lot of people on pservers who make their own guilds and they don‚Äôt min/max because they don‚Äôt know. My gm is playing vanilla for the first time ever. They don‚Äôt know the strats like I do. I watched a hunter break his devilsaur set for some random blue leggings and when told devilsaur was better he said those lists could be wrong for all you know. 
---
Just because someone plays on a pserver does not mean they know how to play optimally.
---
Sounds like the American south version of blessed.  So I believe ‚Äúspecial‚Äù meaning they churn butter in the brain a bit differently.
---
Would be nice if we got it already because I have to submit my long holiday plan until the end of May....
---
&gt; Vanilla isn't hardcore. Appeasing them is what made the game fail.
---
Just to piggyback on your comment, the MMO Wildstar was developed by ex-WoW devs who felt that WoW had become *too casual*.
---
It just shut down a few months ago.
---
Like [this Gamezone article](https://www.gamezone.com/originals/why-i-stopped-playing-wildstar/) put it back in 2014:
---
&gt; WildStar is catering to an audience of ‚Äúolder raiders‚Äù ‚Äî the guys who played EQ or early WoW, many of whom stopped doing 40-man raiding almost a decade ago. The people who were taking part in that content did so at a completely different time in their lives, and a lot has changed in the time since, including our gaming palate.
---
... and [this final article by MassivelyOP](https://massivelyop.com/2018/11/30/the-nexus-telegraph-what-other-games-can-learn-from-wildstars-demise/) in 2018:
---
&gt; Let‚Äôs make one thing clear here: WildStar‚Äôs shutdown is a death knell for raiding, or at least the antique MMO fantasy of the huge hyper-difficult raid as the be-all and end-all of the level cap. We have seen what the audience is for that, and it brought us here. Arguing otherwise is a game of trying to snipe at semantics or insist that the evidence doesn‚Äôt count. If there was ever a game that would have made this work, either by attracting that audience or developing its playerbase into that audience, it was this one.
---
&gt; Instead, it killed the game.
---
LOL no.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ShTe7aEwlOo
---
Nah. They all don't work at Blizzard anymore. You just have delusional people like Ion who played a class where he pressed literally one button for 2 expansions and thought he was an "elitist jerk". 
---
Depends on your degree, I needed a few years to find something decent. I did find a job a few months after graduation but it was shit lol.
---
I will agree on it being the best expansion. But classic isn't an expansion.
---
Some people can. My gm on my pserver has never played vanilla or wow for that matter before. Her husband is new to vanilla but not wow. 
---
Some people can have a first time experience because they will only associate with people that have no idea. I think pserver players will be in the minority on their servers and mostly all in the same guilds. 
---
Just because people play on pservers doesn‚Äôt mean they know what they are doing.
---
I think the try hards will have fun and so will the super casuals. People are over thinking it. 
---
They are designers that worked on TBC and likely later expansions. The same TBC and later expansions that you hate so much. You are literally doing exactly what Brack did. People can like the retail game and they do. It isn't my cup of tea but I do understand that some people do enjoy it. People can like any given expansion they choose. Nothing you can do about it either.

---
Why? To make gold, sell it and pay for the alt account with that money?
---
Yes, you probably can. But I guess feel like the reward factor is on a whole different level, where actually bothering to do that shit in vanilla just feels more worthwhile than in BFA or any other moden wow xpac.
---
Obtaining new gear, and then just enchanting that shit (which costs a fuckton of gold if you want the good enchants) just feels much more worth it if you are progressing in raids.
---
On retail I just can't give a fuck, you are gonna clear the raid in the first day anyway and your gear will be irrelevant soon anyways, because you will just get free new gear in the next raid anyways without "true" progression.
---
First to 60, first to Ragnaros. I‚Äôll be a rogue so I know I won‚Äôt be first to 60. I just changed the line from Ready Player One.  I do want server first kills though.
---
You're right. Players in this thread seem very unaware that Vanilla was left incomplete &amp; class design was interrupted for taking too much time away from [developing the first expansion.](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
&gt; ‚ÄúRight now the class team is heavily focused on the expansion. We will be announcing details of what's in store for each class in the weeks to come. There are a number of improvements we're considering for Shamans in expansion, such as improved totem UI and functionality. I've also been studying the development of new talents and abilities for each class, and so far I'm fairly excited at what I've seen for the Shaman. Despite the belief that no one reads the Shaman boards (ironically, our loudest forum), we're fully aware of the feedback that's been expressed here, and will do what we can to address it. **Much of the improvement players are demanding will have to wait until the Burning Crusade launches, which isn't too far off.**‚Äù
---
&gt; Why? To make gold, sell it and pay for the alt account with that money?
---
That won't be a thing.
---
A bank alt on a secondary account (camped at the AH while playing the main account) is FAR more lucrative than having the bank alt on your main account. It's just a way to make MORE gold.
---
Kill earth elementals in Silithus.
---
I feel like that's a big psychological effect I can relate to. Like in retail you get the EXACT same item with just higher stats. It doesn't look any different it's just copy pasted with a slightly higher ceiling when its titan forged. Same thing with raids they are the same atmosphere with some more mechanics to the fights and the same thing copy pasted again.  
---
In vanilla every item was different and you actually knew the name of things you were after especially the rarer ones. And even old items sometimes were so special they carried over almost the entire duration like hand of justice. Every raid was harder then the last for the most part and they had completely different atmospheres.  
---
The pace which you get the upgrades too are a huge difference. In retail gear just gets thrown at you in droves. You don't remember any of it and none of it is special. In vanilla though with so little raid drops for 40 people getting loot feels a lot more rewarding. Or you go to that 5man a bazillion times to finally see the rare named drop his rare item is a great feeling.
---
Name it Sesame Street.
---
That's a kinda bizarre rant.
---
Resto Gear = Boomkin gear - that's only the case in vanilla because Boomkin gear literally doesn't exist. It doesn't have to be like that - see TBC.
---
I think that a lot of what you have said is why I like TBC. Vanilla had a lot of balance and itemization problems.
---
I feel like I was at the forefront of that, being a feral druid and tanking raids with my level 43 boe epic which was BIS. 
---
TBC wasnt perfect by any means, but it did give off-specs a fighting chance.
---
I actually agree with your point about it spiralling out of control, to the point that all classes have healing abilities and wind up looking too much alike.
---
I just don't think WoW reached that point at TBC.
---
Do you play ally or horde?
---
Yes. No changes.
---
Here is a good use of it. volume warning
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bXOAXHTpv2c
---
Yup. They did a great job at what a LOUD vocal minority said they wanted that they mistook as the majority. You always want room for great players and WoW has that with consumables, progressions, trinkets. You don't DESIGN everything for them though.
---
Even when you design things for hardcores that don't seemingly ruin the game like the Mage Tower, you still have people spending countless hours ALONE in a multiplayer game and doing it for all their characters. These people can go play Dark Souls. I say this as someone who enjoyed the Mage Tower. 
---
No transmog and we don't need such silliness. People KNOW what you are all about from 100 yards away. Hardcores had it a few months early. They were more admired and held in higher prestige then to, which makes it all funnier. No one gives a sh@% if anyone cleared Mythic. They saw that Benediction and they were like ohhhhhhhhhhh, how do I get that bad boy.
---
Yeah, and for that reason people are a lot more active out in the world doing everything and anything, whetever its doing quests or running dungeons or skilling professions or whatever. People enjoy gearing, and its rewarding so they are more active, which makes the world feel more alive as well. There is always something to do that you can do to progress your character when you are invested.
---
That statistic has never been proven at all. Just become received wisdom. 
---
So you link a video to one super specific case of an overheated rogue with a very specific set of professions to grind one area and you make a wide arcing swoop in that my statement is wrong. 
---
You are either incredibly stupid, or just a troll. I'll let you pick. 
---
I read that response a bit differently. To me they're saying it's not something they have plans for right now but something they're open to when the time comes if that's what the community wants. They didn't have plans for Classic for a very long time, and here we are.
---
That said, I agree with you. I would like to see them use un-used assets in vanilla without changing the game play.
---
If they do go release TBC and Wrath classic servers I hope they're separate new servers.
---
Yeah yeah go fuck yourself.
---
Really though that's just another way to say they had no plans to release Vanilla until they were convinced that people wanted to play it. Which makes perfect sense and doesn't sound nearly as cynical.
---
There's already a couple DKP trackers, I haven't used them so I can't speak to how good they are. What I think would be interesting is another suicide kings tracker that includes popular variations. I know there's at least one suicide kings tool already, but I'm sure someone could make a better one.
---
Guild recruitment is tough because it comes down to how many people are using it... and there's already things like this reddit page, official forums, and discord channels that you'd have to compete with.
---
Yes! I remember tanking all of SSC/TK/BT as a Protection Paladin, it was so cool cause it was rare, but it was doable. I miss those days. I know Classic won't allow me to relive those days, but if they ever bring back TBC.. Protection here I come!
---
I suppose in the end we'll see. 
---
I could be proven wrong eventually but I really think someone who doesn't like surprises will be better off not basing strategies around specific droprates being the same as pservers. Definitely not the obscure and unusual ones like the level 40 trolls
---
Vanilla with very good class balance would be amazing.  It'd never happen but a Classic 2.0 would be awesome imo.  Balanced classes, all the missing content added, but the original experience left intact.  Add new content, but keep the level cap at 60.
---
The saddest part of your post is shaman were in the same situation going into BfA...
---
But why pay for more accounts?
---
Shaman are absolutely not trash for raiding, they are actually one of the most sought after classes.
---
If you only did them while leveling in Wotlk, sure
---
prepop fire and arcane protection....
---
everyone pop faps and use your SAPPERS
---
You want me to discuss the rest of the population?
---
1) Herbalism/Mining  that all the PVP players had (along with engineering) and flying around made just as much money, especially when you got the fast mount. You could farm money while never engaging in pvp easily.
---
2) Players in raid spec who farmed with other means usually left people alone, because raid specs suck for pvp and raiding was all that mattered in TBC. They were the people without mining/engineering. Herb/engineering. They had leatherworking/X. It's just like modern WoW where people just fly around ignoring people doing their dailies like Zombies. 
---
3) The good pvp players were now in a stupid mini game, not out in the world (unless they were farming some gold mining or something) and they were forced to be in that instance due to "resilience", which was a horrible idea.
---
4) I would say a vast majority of the high end raiders botted (the WoW Glider banning was HUGE) or bought gold. I didn't know one person in my guild who bought their epic flying mount with gold they farmed. The botters got banned, the people who bought gold got away with it.
---
Did you even play TBC? Not a private server with 2 x the servers number. Actual TBC. 
---
I was a casual leveler in evenings when Warsong Gulch first dropped. I happened into 19s where some people on Horde were dominating. I had to research to find out why, and got hooked. People think the thrill is beating up on lowbies and ungeared noobs, but the real thrill is beating a geared player and geared teams because you out-theorycraft them or out-strategize them.
---
After that, I mostly played 39s, 29s, and 19s and I was a total scrub in 49s, but in 49s there was a warlock named Truu or something like that who absolutely dominated. It was in 39s, 49s, and then 70s where you'd see casters dominate. I still miss 70s and how much fun it was, and of course the community in 39s.
---
Couldn't agree more with everything you've said. A+
---
def. hard to master. 
---
amen brother
---
Its unbalanced mess with no competitive modes to speak of and extremely limited play areas (bgs) that are extremely simple.  
---
World PVP essentially died when BGs were released. For a reason. It was dumb zerging. Or dueling. Or Skirmishing. BGs do all of those better.  
---
You can say what you want, but WoW's core was always PVE aka raiding. If that wasn't true, there would be more than pathetic 2 battlegrounds or arenas per expansions while PVE gets tens of dungeons and multiple raids.  
---
Deadmines because Goonies never say die. Always liked that place and Westfall because of its color scheme, music and its arguably peaceful environment.
---
I mean, don't you have to go out and get it in retail anyway, you just outlevel the content?
---
Transmog in vanilla would be just keeping the cool looking stuff in the bank and then wearing it around town
---
Keep in mind that a lot of what was "confirmed" at Blizzcon was still a work in progress. Their plan right now is 16, but who knows what changes during testing.
---
Ok keep having the victim complex and built in excuse that all hybrids seem to use for their own personal failures. Hybrids were still easy mode though. 
---
BTW everyone had "itemization problems". Might want to actually look at the stats on something like Mage tier 1. They are laughable. Warrior dps gear was trash and they wore a lot of leather until AQ. The pet classes had it good early. That was about it. Rogues did to statwise, but the problem is in 1.12 they are just bad dps warriors. They had it really good in real vanilla though. Classic ain't real vanilla. 
---
Never going to convince a snowflake they aren't a snowflake though. You all think other specs don't respec for raids, spend a ton of money just to be viable and actually complain about the EASIEST PVP spec/class to get a raid spot (druids are the one classes that just aren't played, especially on horde side). OMG I have to press heal buttons instead of dps buttons in a raid, when my class is a HYBRID with the ability to heal.
---
I mean if you want to complain about being a stupid looking, retarded moose bird in boomkin form, I will listen to that and tell you to get some noggenfogers. Tauren? I like how they look and my ele shamans are Tauren and the racial is great. 
---
You dont, and you dont need to, its shitalking
---
My ponit is that you can insult anyone for whatever reason, be it their race, gender, interests,etc etc.
---
Now if someone hurls insults exclusively at woman and minorities but gets offended if someone else calls him an inbreed hillbily sisterfucker, well that person can fuck off too, everyone is fair game if you are into shitalking
---
Not true at all. World PvP was always alive in Vanilla, fighting over contested resources such as Silithus Lords, Devilsaur Leather, Black Lotus and Rich Thorium.  PvE is not raiding, raiding is a small part of PvE.    You don't need 20 different battlegrounds and arenas for PvP to be a big part of the game. It would actually be detrimental to have the server queueing into 20 different BGs. Having more dungeons and raids than BGs does not mean that dungeons and raids are the core part of the game and PvP is just some sort of appendage.
---
Some of the dungeons were unfortunately hallway-ish, but not all of them. They‚Äôre not boring when your constantly shifting your pants at the tank getting 3 shot or you constantly being OOM, or the painful mechanics.
---
It‚Äôs almost like they wanted to make 5-man raids. I played WoD for a minute and they announced mythic dungeons. I was so excited but they turned out to be easy after the 2nd day. And M+ is its own can of worms.
---
For easier AH muling and more characters.
---
&gt;I was curious if it's true that basicaly just 1 spec per class works and is useful in pve/pvp contexts. Because if it is then it sucks.
---
It does suck.
---
&gt;I would like someone to argue about why it's positive that just 1 working spec per class is okay. 
---
It's not positive, they just couldn't balance the classes fast enough and decided to hold off until TBC.
---
But if there is even 1 thing that doesn't work good in vanilla, then there is no reason to call out someone for wanting changes in the classic release. 
---
2), 3), and 4) go to mage without a doubt, for the rest it‚Äôs much more of a tossup. Warlock destroys a lot of classes 1v1. Warrior, for example, has no chance.
---
So something, like leveling through only 1 mob like in Retail? Sort of a challenge that is not necessarily hard but rather time consuming.
---
Most likely [Lich](http://classicdb.ch/?item=10762). 20 Stamina in vanilla.
---
It varies heavily from class to class, what role you are in, etc. It's pretty different from wrath/tbc where just about every class was at least viable somewhere/somewhat, but it's not necessarily as big of a deal as you think.
---
E.g. Druid: Leveling, you are feral. Tanking is considered "not good" but it was heavily buffed by 1.12, but is viable for off tanks. You can even have pretty decent OT/damage specs, where you can swap between either. Resto is the most common raid spec, and the only one you will get no shit for. They have HotW, which while not very good in raids, is great for dungeons and lets you tank/heal/dps with gear swaps.
---
Warlock: SL locks are very powerful in World PvP. Destro is generally the go-to for raiding, in either SM/ruin or DS/ruin. Affliction is the recommendation for leveling.
---
Hunter: Beast mastery for leveling, survival/marksman for PvP, marksman for Raiding. Not really a lot of variability in this class.
---
SOME classes are able to do multiple things with 1 spec, like raid heal/PvP heal; or some warlock builds that were good at pvp/pve, and druid which was able to tank/heal/dps in one spec. But they are generally uncommon, more likely you will need to switch specs to do *high end* pvp or pve. Any hybrid spec is going to be sub-optimal, for the most part.
---
Naxx is cleared inside 24 hours on private servers, which ban world buffs to add more difficulty. You are kidding yourself if you think bosses will take months or even weeks after release (other than probably Raggy). 
---
But that's the thing, a change like re-balancing talent trees will ultimately impact *many* parts of WoW: PvP, PvE, what gear people want, what professions they choose, the economy etc. A massive talent rebalance doesn't just improve that single talent tree in a vacuum, it can potentially impact numerous other aspects of the game. At that point, the game we remember may not be the game that is Classic, which is why people are so turned off at the idea of changes beyond the barest of bare minimum (and, even then, some people will protest).
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2d1FSAcBM8#t=1m30s  
---
True  
---
&gt;Having more dungeons and raids than BGs does not mean that dungeons and raids are the core part of the game and PvP is just some sort of appendage 
---
Yes it does. Tenfold amount of work is put into PVE than PVP in every expansion. For a reason.  
---
Making BGs more interesting with more objectives and bigger maps (AV but better) would've been a good, instead most of the maps are braindead capture X.  
---
&gt;High up in vanilla PVP  
---
&gt;vanilla PVP  
---
Good joke mate. Anyone who plays and takes vanilla PVP serious is trash, like you. Its literal casual fest of who can grind more. No MMR of any kind. Perfect for trash like you :)  
---
I would say that mages are easy to play, as you can get kills quite easily due to your naturally high damage. However, as you stated they are hard to master. A master mage can dominate in most circumstances due to damage and abilities that control the flow of the fight. You wouldn't become a pro mage over night, but if you put enough hours in, you will pull off some impressive plays.
---
It‚Äôs not a question of ‚Äúis X bad‚Äù but more of a question of circumstances, gear progression, and effectiveness. 
---
Examples: 
---
(Circumstances) Fire Mages aren‚Äôt going to be as good as ice mages in Molten Core, but may be better in Naxx.
---
(Effectiveness) Hunter Survival and Druid Balance trees are generally seen as pretty bad, but mostly because the other trees they have are much, much, better.
---
(Gear Progression) Warlocks tend to be underachievers in comparison to Mages until they get high level AQ/Naxx gear at which point in time they can really put people on a first class trip on the pain train.
---
There certainly are classes that have more effective specs than others, and some scale better with gear or in certain raid situations than others. The most important thing is whether you‚Äôre having fun and are a reliable team mate and a good friend.
---
A lot of things don‚Äôt well in Vanilla, that‚Äôs part of the charm. It‚Äôs precisely because of its flaws and foibles that it became as popular as it did, not because it was the perfect game.
---
TBH im a noob &amp; i do plan on getting better, i was just worried mage would be way hard even to play at an average level. Ill just roll one and play it till i master it though. 
---
Nope! That only works for mob xp gains. Killing a mob that's 4 levels above you gives more xp than a mob your level (although the challenge increases exponentially with level, and is generally not recommended.)
---
If you want to level a warrior or paladin and not have to sit and eat every mob, try and do only green quests for the decrease in down-time.
---
I find machinima to be quite lame / weird 
---
Of course there‚Äôs a good reason to call for **no changes.** The game is imperfect, but why would we ever trust modern blizz to make the right decisions to improve the game? Why is perfect balance a good thing? 
---
The slippery slope argument applies very heavily here, I believe. Once you start changing classes, not only is it no longer vanilla, but it also makes the argument for not changing other things much weaker. Then we just trend over time towards alternate-universe retail where every class is homogenised, has equal amounts of damage/cc/utility/selfheals/dots, where ‚Äúquality of life‚Äù is so high that you‚Äôre barely engaged and the community doesn‚Äôt matter.
---
Obviously there are ways Vanilla could be objectively better. There are ways Halo 1 could objectively be better too. But I want to be able to just go PLAY Vanilla the same way I can just go play Halo 1. Once modern blizzard starts making changes, there will be no end to community demands and no end to the fuckery they can get up to. Half the posts here, and on the wow forums since 2004, are just every tom, dick and harry putting forth their own half-baked ideas about changes, and listening to them, along with changing design philosophies, literally killed WoW.
---
I counter by asking you why it's a positive to allow more than one spec per class.
---
It's design philosophy, the #nochange crowd isn't saying no changes because vanilla was perfect, they want a re-release of what existed back then/what they have been playing on private servers. It's still a good game with the flaws, and is fairly well balanced despite some problems.
---
I'm not a #nochange advocate necessarily, but they generally don't think activizzard will do a good job with any changes and will fuck it up like they did retail, or they want it as a "museum piece", or they just want to complain; but I don't think any of them are arguing that the game was perfect and there's nothing that could be done to make it better.
---
They *don't have plans for BC/Wotlk* cause they haven't released vanilla. It'll happen, they'll already have the infrastructure done and the data for both expansions. They'd be nuts to throw away easy millions choosing not to recycle Wrath specifically. BC will probably just be a stepping stone for Blizzard, less appeal than vanilla and without the cash shop/services of Wotlk, but I guarantee they'll both happen
---
It's free nostalgia-laden content -- one even with microtransactions. It's got Blizz written all over it
---
Vanilla isn't really a single iteration, so it's a bit of a moving target.  But I'd say that by the time 1.12 rolled around, pretty much all talent trees were viable.
---
However, "viable" is relative and begs the question:  *Viable at what?*  Vanilla was predicated on specialization.  Your classes' best PvP spec would probably be suboptimal in PvE, and your classes' best PvE spec would probably be suboptimal in PvP.  
---
So which specs are "viable" depends on your perspective.  If you're a PvP'er, then your list of "viable" specs is going to be almost totally different than that of a PvE'er/raider.
---
Posting a video with a person talking makes something true?  Just because he never pvped in Un Goro or Silithus doesn't mean it didn't happen. Southshore / Tarren Mill will always be a shit show - so what?
---
I guarantee you that in Classic there will be world pvp around the devilsaur spawns and groups employing a great deal of strategy in order to maintain control of the spawns. Same thing for the Silithus Lords. 
---
There are players who have made gladiator in various retail expansions that still choose to play vanilla PvP because they find it the most fun. Dueling is quite balanced, maybe SL lock is a bit over powered. Sure there are ideal comps for BGs doesn't mean the other specs are trash. (Although yes, a few of them are). There were trash specs throughout WoW's life, not just in Vanilla.
---
Yes there is.
---
To many people, myself included, it doesn't matter what we want, like or even what we think is better/worse. What matters is getting a true representation of Vanilla, as close to (if not exact) as it can possibly be.
---
It needs to be a historical snapshot in all its triumphs and fails, to be playable 'as was' for years to come.
---
Otherwise, whats the point? We'd just be bastardising its legacy in the name of rose tinted goggles.
---
If you mean end game raid viability, only warriors(tank and DPS) and maybe shamans(heal and DPS) have multiple roles that they can fill as good or better than next best replacement.  You can make other specs viable, but they aren't considered ideal(yeah, you can bring a shadow priest, but you will spend the whole boss oom).
---
And DPS classes will always have a best spec for raiding.  There is not way they could make each spec equal in it's damage and utility.
---
PvP is completely different in what is viable, but most classes still have an 'ideal' talent spec.
---
In that case I would recommend making a frost mage. They are arguably one of the best ranged PVP classes and are great in PvE too. As your main focus is ice, your enemies are slowed, which means you have additional time to react and plan your attacks.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F3b8DIMwZis
---
Isnt frost the best pvp spec anyway
---
I argue against #nochanges, but to play devil's advocate - there are several motives to resist changes to classic.  
---
1) Slippery slope, if we open the door to some changes, it's hard to close that door on stuff that seriously compromises the integrity of classic, and blizzard's reputation is dubious right now.  
---
2) Consistency with the original. Even if you say "rose tinted glasses", playing for nostalgia is still a valid reason to play, and a lot of people say they want it to be truly faithful to the original.  
---
3) There are a lot of factors in play that make specs unviable, and changing any of them has ripple effects throughout the rest of the game. Even I don't think blizzard is up to the task of doing such a rework well (see: BfA)
---
Horde all the way.
---
Everyone has to spec different for raiding than PvP. Gold is a big part of the game in vanilla. Farming gold and buffs puts you out in the world and leads to organic PvP content. 
---
Warrior has two PvP specs. Arms and Fury.
---
Warlock has 3 viable PvP specs. a glass cannon spec, a thinking man's spec and a boring SL spec specifically made for handicapped people and small children, 
---
Shaman has two viable PVP specs a hybrid healer as Elemental and Enhance which is tied is tied as the easiest spec to play in the game that was specifically made for handicapped people and children.
---
Paladin is the best faceroll PVP healer and is tied as the easiest spec to play in the game that was specifically made for handicapped people and children.
---
Priests have like 4 specs. Shadow, tri, buff a caster, heals. 
---
Rogue has 2 viable pvp specs. Anti-rogue as hemo since that is what they are often doing or anti-mage as imp sprint daggers.
---
Druid has a lot of specs with a lot of variation. They got a great duel spec, a flag cap spec, pure feral.
---
Hunter has 3 pvp specs but 2 are close. The third is a beastmaster spec specifically made for handicapped people and children.
---
How much more variety do you want?  The only classes that aren't super raid viable (ret and enhance) are not really that gear dependent, can be played by a drunk blind man and are competitive dfor 2/3rds of the game in easily gotten PvP blues/DM gear and a 2 hander from AV. Before that they can make a Arcanite Reaper.
---
Healer hybrid specs share most of the same gear as dps specs.
---
GTFO! 
---
&gt; get all these perfect agi/int items. Not to mention, it's going to make leveling a huge pain, since you're missi
---
It's not really a complaint as I don't mind at all on my paladin having a full set of healing gear there at all times it's more so something I wanted to just do for fun, random sort of thing just to see how it turns out
---
Every class is viable in vanilla, almost every spec is viable in some form of content 
---
As a general rule yes.
---
Pve is very one dimensional but in pvp every class has multiple specs they can play. Specs in vanilla arent designed to be balanced the same way they are in retail. In vanilla you choose ur spec based on what you are doing. There is always an optimal spec for a specific situation but that doesnt mean every class only has 1 good spec. You just choose ur spec based on what u are gonna do.
---
Why would you ever play a pure dps class like a mage or rogue if you can be a healer/mage/rogue by being a druid? 
---
I can't imagine a situation where it will work well, even if you can get it to where it "technically" works, it's going to be markedly worse than just having 2 sets and will be very inconvenient/annoying to anyone you group with. I do not recommend trying it.
---
Problem with suicide list is that you are limited around what you can interconnect in web API and whether that will even be an option, and addon is not really web based.
---
You are right about Guild Recruitment, but I gave it only as an example. Not really committed to anything. In the end I would do something that would benefit community instead, even if it would be just for few people.
---
To get "average" good it's mainly just a matter of being aware of what is going on around you and keeping distance from threats. Between polymorph, frost nova, cone of cold, and blink you have a lot of control over how fights go down. The tricky part is maintaining awareness and moving towards safety.
---
I hope 49 bracket is active on classic. I've always done a 49 tauren warrior twink. Some of the best times I've ever had in this game. 
---
This is kind of a shame. But they also mentioned that they would see what the community wants and there is a lot of us who would like to see BC servers where we can transfer our characters to, and then Wrath servers. For those who don't play or don't like those expansions don't try and put us down or take away from us or you're exactly like the retail players/ yeschanges crowd.
---
Correct. Thus its better to always do your green quests first.
---
Let's enjoy vanilla, then we can enjoy TBC and Wrath.
---
&gt;I haven't seen that topic anywhere so far
---
This is the third post in just the past two days asking this same question.
---
 * [When do you think Blizzard will announce the release date?](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ai17nn/when_do_you_think_blizzard_will_announce_the/)
---
 * [When do you think they will give us an actual release date?](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ahvcn2/when_do_you_think_they_will_give_us_an_actual/)
---
Also, I'm building my warlock to be ready to play in Burning Crusade when those character transfer servers open up. I can feel it. It's going to happen.
---
except your responding too is a single persons opinion and not a fact
---
Soupa? 
---
I used to watch your videos somewhere in 2016, when you tried Legion! 
---
ahah, the word is very little :3 
---
&gt;Posting a video with a person talking makes something true? Just because he never pvped in Un Goro or Silithus doesn't mean it didn't happen  
---
That's not where most people WPVP'd. Even if they did, that's irrelevant. Battlegrounds provide the same thing, fighting over resource.  
---
&gt;There are players who have made gladiator in multiple retail expansions that still choose to play vanilla PvP because they find it the most fun 
---
Yea like Sodapoppin? Dude has such case of nostalgia goggles that he finds leveling in legion/bfa more fun than doing anything else. That's how fucked he is.  
---
&gt;Dueling is quite balanced, maybe SL lock is a bit over powered. Sure there are ideal comps for BGs doesn't mean the other specs are trash. (Although yes, a few of them are). There were trash specs throughout WoW's life, not just in Vanilla.  
---
Yea but never in the category of "cast 5 spells and you're out of mana" type of unplayable trash.  
---
&gt;You don't need MMR to make competitive premades happen, but yes it helps. The good players notice each other. I don't need a fancy number to feel good when I beat a skilled player in a duel, or win 1v3 in World.  
---
Sure but individual's skill will always be undecided unless you put a strict mmr number that shows the skill.  
---
Remember Swifty? So skilled right? Or other backpedaling GM and HW?   
---
&gt;Whatever though, you clearly never were involved in the good World PvP or any good at vanilla PvP so why would I even entertain your opinion?
---
Thinking your opinion matters when you enjoy PVP in PVE game with no rating LUL  
---
You'll have to wear gear for your character to wear the gear.
---
The answer should always be no.  Lets hope it stays that way.
---
Found these on ebay for a good price. My guess is that prices will skyrocket as classic release comes closer! You better get a copy soon :)
---
You explained why it got popular. But that doesn't coincide with why it's better than the actual wow. 
---
You can say Vanilla is  better because it's more like an mmo by not having the rdf, for example. And it would be right.
---
But this? This is not a thing that is " stright better " than retail. This, specifically, is worse then retail! XD 
---
It stressed me out my first time cause I got kicked for being a noob, and going to Kalimdor always was tense. Finally went back to it on Nostalrius and was floored.
---
Anecdote: we cleared MC as a pug on a pserver with most of the group in blues and even some quest greens and we had 3 ferals in the raid and one of them was #4 on the meters.
---
All of these idiots talking about end-game progression no meme-specs blah blah are seriously, *seriously* overestimating how easy classic WoW is with 1.12 talents and itemization.  If they don't do progressive itemnization - and they really, *really* shouldn't do that for a variety of reasons - then all raids are facerolls and it does not matter what spec you play.
---
In fact, we're going to see the good players do 100% memespecs for the lulz because it's not going to be hard enough without handicapping themselves - at least all content except maybe a couple of AQ40 encounters and the harder Naxx bosses.
---
I remember in some goods you could lose experience and even levels on death. Could you imagine getting bumped from 40 to 39, losing the ability to ride a mount, and the guy who killed you steals all your shit? People would rage.
---
Brought me back to the golden years, thank you for the story.
---
Because there are three ingame.
---
If you just want one, remove the other two. Fuse them, I don't know.
---
If you put me in front of 3 cards, same model but different colors, I will want to choose between them. And I would be right on doing so, since it was you who put me 3 of them. 
---
If you dont want me to choose, put in front of me just 1 car. :D
---
I actually think there is something more to this than just random tinfoil hat theory.  
---
If not exactly July 16th, I think it will be within a couple weeks of it.
---
A warrior that knows what they are doing will perform better then a druid in every aspect (Yes, even AOE pulls).
---
Yeah I remember them. We used them for the lab systems. Later we had those whashable silicone keyboards. You could roll them like a burrito.
---
What you are suggesting more mobs that are found inside caves. I don't dislike this idea, as it would fit in the world and it would help a bit with overcrowding but it would betray the whole "1.12 warts and all" concept that the Classic WoW project was founded on.
---
&gt;sweaty nerds with autism.
---
Welcome to the World of Warcraft.
---
Then I can rightfully call out all people who claim vanilla must come back because - it's better than the current wow - . Because they don't want it because it's better ( else they would be okay in making a version even BETTER ), they just want IT. 
---
And they are not admitting that. Unless specifically asked. 
---
&gt; But that doesn't coincide with why it's better than the actual wow.
---
This is a huge misconception that needs to be clarified by everyone in this thread.
---
By all *objective* metrics, Retail is better at delivering the promise of an MMORPG than Classic is.
---
Some people agree (myself included) that suboptimal design can sometimes be *subjectively* more interesting and fun than optimal design.
---
That's why people want to play Classic again, warts and all.
---
Yeah Vanilla will be cool but tbh I've been playing it for so many years now that I'm alittle burned out on it. But I know I'm the minority. I'm patient 
---
The stat comes from blizzard blue post claim that 23 guilds cleared naxx before tbc. I'd argue against it but I have no proof to refute blizzard data. There is a reddit post claiming 130 guilds have proof of clearing it but I will stick to blizz stats until otherwise. But even if that were true that's still 0.6% (rounding up) clear rate
---
Came here to say this
---
One one hand you have server side values that have been researched for years with evidence from the period, on the other hand you have people claiming those values are wrong, without any evidence to support that, aside from the fact that "it might be".
---
Sure, it might be wrong, but I tend to believe positive evidence over simply claiming something is wrong because you dont like it. Private server data might not be perfect, but its much closer to the real thing than people in this sub like to admit for whatever reason.
---
That's an amazing tip! Thanks dude.
---
Swell!
---
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
I liked your explanation a lot man. 
---
But people have been telling them they waited to play it for a decade. 
---
I cannot stop laughing. 
---
It's for handicapped people and children 
---
AHAHAHAHAHAAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH
---
Whether or not a mage is easy to take down in pvp depends on the class engaging. Let me tell you it's not fun fighting a frost mage as a melee unless you get the drop on them.
---
To be fair, some specs were definitely put on the back-burner while the class design team worked on TBC instead.
---
Two prime examples are [non-Resto shamans...](http://blue.cardplace.com/cache/wow-shaman/668634.htm)
---
... and [Protection Paladins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rd-Zt8bueFk)
---
&gt; ‚Äú[A Protection Paladin] was fine generating threat as long as the mob was on him, but once it was off him it was really difficult to get it back on him so that he could go back to generating threat, whereas the Warrior was more direct and, you know, consistent.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs one of those things where we didn‚Äôt have the idea worked out yet and we didn‚Äôt want to just band-aid it by giving him a taunt, because once you give him a taunt you can‚Äôt take it away, right? Like anything less than that or even different than that and people are going to be like, why? why would you do this to us, just give us the thing back. It‚Äôs very difficult to take mechanics away. **We didn‚Äôt have the total specific idea worked out on how he was actually going to taunt** so we were still experimenting and learning as we went.‚Äù
---
Can you link that post? It gets cited without reference constantly. 
---
have you played classic before? if not. just enjoy the game and try doing a bit of everything. there are plenty of things to do. One thing that might help you is trying to get as many keys to instances and attunments. they are fun quests :) and will make it easier for you to get groups in the future.
---
I'd only call survival less effective in pve. Most pvp specced hunters will have more points in survival than any other tree. 
---
Don't play the game at all because i don't want to no life it and play just that game?  Seriously dude re read what you're saying,  it's pretty unrealistic. 
---
A lot of folks haven't played on pservers at end game and are underestimating how the meta has evolved.  They're remembering how vanilla was.  1.12 talents and 1.12 itemization trivialize almost everything except 1.12 content (Naxx) to the extent that nobody is going to care if you're playing a memespec.
---
No changes 
---
Hey I have that Art book too. 
---
I like Vanilla more than any other version of the game, but TBC is still amazing and a close 2nd place.
---
I feel like you're just making a post to dump on expansions because YOU didn't like them and you're jumping the gun here. Just because Blizzard has no plans for TBC doesn't mean that it won't happen. They're just trying not to count their chickens before they hatch.
---
Fact of the matter is, people will clamor for TBC/Wrath. This was the time period of WoW where subscription numbers peaked, so many people started their WoW experience at this time.
---
If Classic is profitable, I have no doubt that they will at some point back port TBC and Wrath as well.
---
I would like to see new Vanilla content too, but creating new content is riskier and probably more expensive than repackaging previous stuff that they know many players already love.
---
I think I've read your past comment, wasn't able to answer because the comment got deleted, anyways:
---
You cleared the topic. You convinced me. Perfect. 
---
There is still something sad blocking me from picking classic instead of retail and it's the fact that playing it with my new pc as main game would be a complete waste of my 1200euros budget, because of the poor graphic. But that's not something you can fix, sadly. 
---
You really cleared the topic, tho. 
---
Just 1 last question:
---
What do you mean for 1.12 itemization and talents? Can you make an example of an x items who got changed and why those changes made the older raids easier? 
---
While I'm nostalgic for vanilla, I really liked TBC. Every spec had a place, and Kara is far and away my favorite raid ever. Also, people still operated out in the open world - just more of it was concentrated in Outland. You still need to go back to the old world to use the AH, though.
---
Listen to yourself...  The game takes like 10 days /played to get to max level and then the actual game starts.  It's meant to be the ONLY game you play.  That's just how it is.  If you don't want to only play WoW or can't afford $15 for how much you will play then don't play.  I don't understand what the conundrum is here.
---
Tough, because is varies from class to class. BiS lists will drive *which* dungeons you want to spam, your class will determine the best places to farm and get your gold for your epic mount, and professions are pretty up in the air.
---
I haven't seen anyone condense these down to a "60 warlock pre-raid guide" or anything, but it's not too hard to figure out yourself. Just look up:
---
- Attunement guides, generic for each class
---
- Best grinding spots for "X" class
---
- BiS list with item origin
---
- relevant profession guides for whichever ones you are leveling
---
- raid consumables/enchants lists, which honestly aren't a huge deal till later in your raiding career
---
- Class quest guides (if your class has any important ones)
---
No, fighting two guilds competing over devilsaur or silithus lords is actually very structured. You know where the spawns are and depending on control, you may know when. You need to keep an eye on the enemy group and split up accordingly to be successful. It is quite similar to a BG  and competing for the best gold-making resources on the server.  You really aren't able to argue this because apparently you don't even know it exists.
---
Using Sodapoppin is a massive strawman argument. Acting as if every gladiator who like to pvp in Vanilla is Sodapoppin -  come on do better. Irrelevant.
---
Meh, druids have multiple viable pvp specs. Sorry that boomkin isn't one of them. Not worried about it.
---
So whoever has the highest MMR at a given time is indisputably the most skilled player? Nope. 
---
If a player literally beats everyone else in a duel, then they are the best pvp player on the server. Don't need a number to see that.  Swifty is irrelevant. Players are a lot better now and he would get stomped by current vanilla players. Another stupid fcking strawman argument.
---
There are lots of PvP games that don't have MMR, especially from Vanilla's era. You going to tell me Dark Age of Camelot wasn't a PvP game because it didn't have MMR? Even your own example, Counter Strike, didn't have an MMR back in the day. Does that mean Counter Strike was a PvE game lol? MMR in competitive games is a standard in newer games but in old games it rarely existed. That doesn't mean the game can't be competitive or that you can't be good at it. 
---
You can also listen to these segments on the Deftalk podcast. 
---
They have a bunch of other episodes that are a great listen.
---
Lol churn butter in the brain
---
The one thing TBC had going for it over classic is that it was planned a lot better.  They had an idea of what they wanted to do for it and designed everything ahead of time.  Classic at times felt like they were literally making it up as they went, especially with class balancing which suffered the flavor of the patch syndrome.  People dislike a lot of the things introduced in TBC (flying/arenas/resilience mostly) but at least it was coherent.
---
Yeah, that's me. And it was 2017 when I tried Legion for the first time :)
---
They said some things are under consideration, like sharding and loot trading. Others are not. I highly doubt that number will change. There is no point in changing it. I don't think they'll change/tune raids and if they did, why would they tune it to anything else?
---
Yeah, of course *anything* can change. I just don't think it's on their mind. It's a done thing. They are not creating a new game, not much testing needed, apart from making sure it works as it worked in 1.12 (which they have as reference).
---
There is not a single spec that doesn't work/is not useful in either PvE or PvP. That being said, some of those specs may not play the way you want them to.
---
Examples:
---
Arcane is an excellent PvE build for mages. However, despite the fact that you will have 31 points in Arcane, your rotation is Frostbolt spam.
---
Protection is an excellent PvP build for paladins. However, despite the fact that you will have 31 points in Protection, you will mostly just heal, Cleanse, and buff.
---
Balance is an excellent PvP build for druids. However, despite the fact that you will have 29 points in Balance, you will mostly just kite, cast DoTs, and melee in Feral forms.
---
Thanks for posting this! I already had an art book which covered up to WoD, but barely has focus on vanilla as this art book does (which I wasn't aware existed). Already ordered my copy :)
---
And then it's just a matter of gear. Once you get enough agi, survival beats marksman (talented +15% agi). 
---
You pass that treshold with AQ40 gear. 
---
Yeah, they're 'actual' trolls.
---
The main problem for me that made me not know a lot of people on my server during TBC was the fact that by late vanilla they introduced crossrealm BGs and that continued in TBC plus arenas.  At max level you usually didn't run into a lot of people since most people spent the majority of their time raiding or doing PvP (which was arenas or BGs).  So you knew who you raided with but PvP was mostly just mystery folks unless you queued together.  The little bit of time spent farming or doing dailies was not enough to cement someone in your memory and its not like you would probably ever see them in an arena or BG anyway.

---
**What we are looking for:** Players of all different schedules and backgrounds willing to be part of an amazing community regardless of how much time they have on their hands to play this game.
---
**What we are aiming for:** Clearing all raid content, acquiring all epic items and scepter and be one of the most respected guilds on the server. We aim is to be decent in PvE without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing this game in order to spearhead the advancement of structured WPvP in the Classic WoW community.

Let's say you balance ret-paladins and feral druids to do the same dps as warriors and rogues. In pvp that would be seriously broken as they can also heal and do much other things that the warrior and rogues cant. Also, why would you bring a warrior or rogue for raids when you can bring a paladin/druid that can do the same damage while also bringing crazy utility to the raid? like battle-res, hand of protection +++++ (this coming from someone who is planning to play druid)
---
I think around 30ish 
---
How is mcconnel/asmongold here when sodapoppin isn't? xD
---
Yeah ! Faster leveling, because it's so boring in Classic ! Everybody hates elite mobs, it's better without them ! And with the flying mount I will never get ganked on the roads by those mean rogues. I love blood elves, I mean they are so much prettier than the ugly orcs and undeads. For the Horde!
---
Plus I don't like how I never get epics on vanilla servers, that's not fair and it takes so much time! At least with BC you just have to play some BGs and even if I lose no problem I get honor points then full set.
---
After at LK I will continue my ret paladin or roll a blood elf deathknight (heirlooms are so cool!). Those are really the best balanced classes ever! I feel so skilled with these. And at least I won't have to do boring trips to dungeons thanks to LFD. Wrath is so a good expansion.
---
And my favorite mount, the Celestial Steed will be available. Come on, it's not a big deal for Blizzard to sell it for just 20$. It's just cosmetic, and it's a company they have to make money.
---
Cannot wait !
---
Jeez. What's with the name calling? Please stay away from my classic server
---
Oh man we were at peak form at that time- 4 college roommates all living together and playing in the same room. Friday afternoons were the best, we'd get a couple cases of beer, big old fat sack, maybe a couple adderall and just jam out on wow until we couldn't see straight anymore.  Didn't feel  like we were wasting our lives away in the basement since we were all there together.  WSG was just unfair with our coordination.  Some of the best times of my real life combined with my gaming life all at once.  Ahh the nostalgic glory days  lol
---
No because I don‚Äôt care about e-celebs

Wow, this cracks me up because my brother in law was at the time obsessed with the 40-49 bracket too.  Like you he was a rogue and like you he pseudo-twinked his main.  Fortunately or unfortunately for him, we were higher ups in a guild that was trying to progress through MC (when MC was challenging for most guilds) and we needed competent people.  Despite our entreaties to hit 60 and help us out, he just continued the 49 grind.  Also unfortunately for him, he was a serial respeccer and that was his undoing, as in order to respec, he had to grind money which meant eventually he was in danger of leveling, leaving him in a position where I could hop on his computer one day and turn in a few quests putting him over the edge.  I know it sounds like a dick move, but it was understood and we still laugh about it today.  He forgave me when he got perditions guild first.
---
twinks at that level are pretty sweet but the 19 and 29 brackets are more popular.  At 39 and 49 you CAN lose, but almost every battle is yours to lose because your gear is top notch.  At 19 twinking just steals the fun of BGs from other lowbies that should be learning.  When you get up in the brackets, it's an advantage but not unovercomeable.  My favorite BGs will probably always be 39 because once you get mounts it totally changes the dynamic (for the worse in my opinion).
---
I loved dungeon trash, especially leading through as a tank. It was always enjoyable for me to handle the marking/coordinating of CC on each pull. I'm looking forward to that again.
---
Defensively warriors have a lot more room than bears in 5 mans, block is sizable there.
---
This right here.  If the game launches on a Tuesday then im going to take the next Monday and Tuesday off work and play early in the mornings when player numbers dip.
---
How could you forget the man the myth the legend that is Alexensual
---
And I want the original version of onyxia back just to see if we could kill it (instead of shooting fireballs in the air they are conflags).  Probably wouldn't be too hard now since people are better at spreading out but it would make it a bit more challenging.
---
Last alinea 10/10! Great write up, loved it.
---
Deadmines was a mess for sure. The Stockades aswell and BFD. Things got better in Gnomer and then settled for Scarlet. Soooo around lvl 25-30ish
---
Yeah and next to him is probably Collina in his 20s...
---
BRD is definitely one of my favs. Spent so much time there solo farming dark coffer for my epic mount in retail then multi box farmed savage gladiator chest on PSs. I‚Äôve multiboxed the whole instance up to wiping on emp.
---
You seriously have no idea what you are talking about and its overwhelmingly apparent. 
---
1. All serious PvPers/PvEers had two crafting professions for the added bonuses crafting professions gave in TBC.
---
2. Maybe on your shit server? I was T6 holy pally and T5 rogue both raid speced and I would absolutely dunk on most people in world pvp. 
---
3. Again, maybe on your shit server? I knew a good chunk of the top pvpers mainly because they would raid in their pvp gear and absolutely dominate.  They loved to world pvp.
---
4. Great over-generalizing statement again.  "All the guys I knew in my group of friends were homophobic, so I would say vast majority of men are homophobic."
---
I'm pretty sure it wasn't your server that was shit, but more that you were actually shit and didn't actually partake in the TBC community like you did in vanilla, and blame TBC mechanics for it. TBC was a fucking blast and the community aspect was very much so there. You either were so shit that no one knew you and in turn you didn't know anyone, or you just didn't care to talk to anyone besides your one guild raid group and that's on you.
---
Trade chat is absolutely NOT a Classic WoW enthusiast. Last video I watched of hers she said she hoped Blizz would never make Classic just to spite us. Lost my sub after that video! Not classy at all.
---
Didn't know a picture could smell.
---
Deadmines ... I played everquest before though so it was obvious.
---
Yeah I'm not talking about chump change differences.
---
I've played on private servers.  I vowed never to raid or pvp again, but I did MC for kicks.  I did not do MC, BWL, AQ40 as of 1.12 because it was Naxx and only Naxx.  I'm not sure if many people did with TBC around the corner.  So, the accuracy?  I don't think anyone can say for sure.
---
Naxx is the kicker.  That is one raid that pservers could have gotten right.       because by that time, youtube was bigger and videos were more accessible (we used to download ours).   Most of the videos I've seen are not of entry/mid level geared raiders.  They are geared to the teeth.  So again, Vanilla Naxx wasn't around long enough for most people to see what they could do with gear like that.  And for those claiming that they did finish Naxx or close to, I'll question that.  When Naxx hit, guilds were running on fumes close to burning out.  I personally quit early TBC.  It wore on you.  It really did.  Guilds didn't hit Naxx "fresh" . (pun intended).  It's like someone saying they hit rank 14 in Vanilla and did it 2 more times on a private server.  It's going to raise eyebrows - true or not.
---
Now, no one has any proof that private servers have 1.12 all wrong. Heck, they could be even harder for all we know.   Blizzard has all the numbers.  But the evidence is damning.  Yes I realized people watched tons of videos and scoured the web archives.  But it's still a huge, but educated guess.  It's like coming up with the formula of 5 variables and i'll give you 100 results as a baseline.  Every private server has gone from iteration to iteration each claiming it was 90% Blizz like.  I believe warrior rage is still being talked about to this very day - which has huge implications.  Private server devs got laughed at by Blizzard when discussing raid accuracy.  Even that Nost Q&amp;A guy said they were guessing a lot.
---
There's nothing wrong to stick up for pservers.  They're a great experience.  But, i find it hard to believe that with all the things that have gone on - on going inaccuracies, input from blizzard, even hearsay from others, won't make anyone think twice.
---
Note:  AoE leveling for mages is not correct on pservers, unless Blizzard reverted some ninja nerfs in 1,12 that occurred in previous patches.   Let's not forget there are more indirect implications for some things being wrong.  If gold is more accessible and if respawn rates are higher, then things like consumables become more accessible.  Farming consumables was a job on top of raiding.  It sucked hard.
---
It is worse. Id like it changed but i think ill just wait til tbc is released or play pservers.
---
Pretty much what I am doing. Leveling mage, watching aoe leveling videos, practicing the pulls on private servers.
---
Relax bro, just enjoy the picture
---
Vanilla wow is incomplete. That is a fact. People saying this is a good thing are blinded by nostalgia or like incomplete games.
---
The only good reason i see not completing it for a recreation is time and money.
---
TB, Cox, Hobbs and Oxhorn. So many good memories of playing old-school WoW and watching/listening to these guys.

Since no one else has posted this, here's some of my favorite WoW copypasta from the guild Overrated shortly after WotLK was released:
---
&gt; ‚ÄúWith Naxx looming high above our heads, this is a tribute to the heroes of Overrated- the 40+ players who lost everything (including accounts worth $2000+) so that we may play a better game.
---
&gt; Overrated were true heroes of the Horde. Their achievements were heard of across the realm as the ones who stopped the Lich King's invasion. Overrated were the only Horde guild capable of killing Kel'thuzad in the United States (remember, being a gimped faction is a game feature) and they found the Twin Emperors trash in AQ40 unfun. There was much complaining about the trash, but the gods from above said that trash is an important pacing mechanic in raid design. Think of it as an extension of the stick that holds a carrot at the end. In the spirit of having fun, Overrated would have none of it. The guild decided to introduce the phasing world years before players would install Wrath of the Lich King on computers worldwide.
---
&gt; They say it was because they didn't want to slog through an hour of trash, but the insiders know that there was a bigger, selfless reason to bypass said trash. Cut off the head of the enemy and the player dies. Perhaps the remaining bosses could be studied by science and we could understand the bugs better- perhaps even negotiate peace now that the Old God was dead. These pious raiders truly had a heart of gold.
---
&gt; The players phased out the floor and dropped down to the chamber of C'Thun. The players risked everything in the name of fun. They said "No! We do not accept this answer. We shall risk exile, torture, death, and the worst punishment- being turned into Trolls and given terribad Troll racials."
---
&gt; The gods discovered their transgression and all were summoned to the Temple of Ahn'Qiraj- the site of the betrayal. A portal was summoned and all the members clicked it because you can't keybind clicking on a portal; therefore, being a clicker is ok in this case. A million voices cried out in unison and were suddenly silenced. Overrated was banished to the realm of permaban forever- at least until they took up the quest to drive to their local Target and pick up another retail copy of the game.
---
&gt; Life is not without parity. The gods questioned why someone would risk so much for so little, especially when punishment was inevitable. In recognition for what the members of Overrated went through, the trash was too banished to the realm of permaban. Some say that Overrated's true punishment is that their ghosts must battle the bug specters for eternity- a fate worse than death.
---
&gt; This is a tribute to those heroes who gave up everything so that players would never again have to slog through an hour of trash just to reach a boss. If we could speak to them today, we would tell them that things are better now. Their death was not in vain. Even the slowest keyboard turner can't walk three feet within Naxx without stumbling upon an epic, and his or her progress is never impeded by an hour worth of mobs who drop nothing. We live in a better world because of Overrated's ultimate sacrifice. These are the true heroes of Warcraft, and may their name ring forth forever in exaltation.
---
&gt; 11/03/2006! NEVER FORGET!‚Äù
---
pre 1.12 a lot of items were just... weird. They had stats and nothing else. You'd get "caster rings" with just Intellect and Stamina and Spirit on. You'd get DPS plate with spirit. Hit chance was super rare. Spellpower and + Healing were really uncommon, and when present were super low.
---
You also got a lot more green "of wrath" gear, like green pants of Frozen Wrath with +30 frost damage on, which were amazing for MC frost mages. These didnt exist before the big item shakeup.
---
End result - anyone in a full set of Pre-Raid Best in Slot Blue items in 1.12 would have a really nice balanced set of stats including good crit/hit if dps, high +healing or high spellpower if a caster.
---
Before the big item patch, people going into MC may as well have been in all items of the Eagle/Whale/Bear because that was pretty much what blue items were, just with slightly bigger numbers.
---
It'd be pretty impossible to find the post itself. It is referenced a lot in many archived sites/posts and I managed to locate a blue post stating "&lt;1%" cleared it (1% of 8million is 800k players so at the absolute maximum would be 20k guilds, however unlikely since it's referenced that 23NA and 56 worldwide in many many posts). If you'd like you can stumble through archived Internet to try to find something different.
---
Better doesnt mean balanced though. It's just different.
---
Take something like Retribution Paladins. In vanilla, you couldn't really raid as Ret. You'd be a crappy low dps paladin that didn't bring anything to the raid that you couldn't bring as Holy whilst also being more useful. Some players could make Ret work if they made the effort to massively gear up and used loads of consumables but that same player would do double the damage on a "real" dps class.
---
Some players will say that means that Classic sucks because Rets werent good like that.
---
However, the game was different. Raiding wasnt the be-all and end-all. Retribution was a popular spec because it was a.) good for levelling, b.) very strong in PvP due to its burst and survivability and c.) actually pretty good in 5mans where you could provide all the added Paladin utility like backup heals, good buffs, auras etc and still do acceptable dps.
---
Blizzard's view on Paladins was that if you wanted to raid, you probably had to heal. But Ret was still a beloved spec. Also, the fact Ret was viewed as "terrible" in raids was a POSITIVE to some Ret players, as this meant they could try their hardest to push the boundaries of the class and see what they could do.
---
That's the thing with Vanilla. Players nowadays are used to the Current "all things must be balanced" view of WoW. That isnt BETTER, its just DIFFERENT. To me, the fact that there were a lot of imbalances made the game really a lot more interesting.
---
I definitely had a different experience. I knew the ninja looters, I knew the top pvp groups, I knew the top raid groups. I knew the asshats who would kill on sight at any of the daily quest hubs.  I knew when to not do the BEM dark rune event because I would nearly immediately get ganked and lose my dark rune. I knew when the opposing factions top raid group would run their progression in Tempest Keep, and I would camp the graveyard with my friends before our raid started.  I was extremely active in TBC and it wasn't BS casual friendly.
---
I do miss real trash but, I don't miss TBC trash. That crap took it too far lol. It's gotta be a balance between having the trash be challenging and, frustrating.
---
Asmongold is not a content creator, he is a content recycler. I can't go five minutes on Youtube without being reccomended a video of a recording of him streaming someone else's video and adding useless commentary. He basically finds an elaborate way of saying "i agree with this" or "this is wrong". He manages to turn a 6 minute video into a 15 minute video, and he doesn't really add anything to it. He just drags out other people's content and then monetizes it.
---
If he actually edited and planned out a video, I might watch it. For now, his videos are trash.
---
I totally vouch for this show as well, very relaxed and easy to listen to.
---
They sound different from episode to episode, in that they don't repeat themselves, and they know what they're talking about.
---
Give it a listen.
---
Everything is viable depending on what you want to do. To be the best of the best at certain raids? Certain specs are clearly more viable than others, yes. 
---
I've leveled as a moonkin because I had to play on dial-up and the latency was rough. That increased armor as a caster helped. I was able to off tank/5 man as a bear Druid sometimes but my main spec for raiding was Resto. 
---
That depends on what you mean by "viable". In a raid setting yes. I would have to say there are less useful specs. All of that being said. Wow is a lot more then just raiding. You can do some really crazy stuff in the game especially in the pvp department. With specs and, strats no one sees coming.
---
Is this from the collectors edition?
---
I watched a lot of Jesse Cox and Totalbiscuit back in the day. Two of the first content creators for WoW coverage! 
---
Nah is Magi way better for that 22 spell damage.
---
Think of it this way.  
---
Classic retail gives you a choice of 3 cars. Paladins get a choice of a red, blue or green Lamborghini. Warriors get a choice of a red, yellow or blue Ferrari. Shamans get a choice of blue, black or white porsche. Fundamentally different styles or flavors of the same thing  - a nice fast sports car with slightly different feels, all mostly balanced depending on the exact model.
---
Classic gives you the choice between a Ferrari, a Tractor and a hovercraft. You can pick the tractor and nooone will let it on their race track as it's going to lose to all the sports cars. But you dont care that you can't race the other sports cars, because you picked it to plough fields and it does that really well.
---
Why would they add a private server bug to classic?
---
Lol, there are literally dozens of things that don't work well in Vanilla, it's why the no changes folks are so frustrating to deal with.
---
Looking through your comments here I do get the point you are making, but in terms of viabilty, most classes have more than one spec that is useful/viable, not ideal, but then that would never be the case anyway.  In fact I can't think of a single class that does have at least two viable specs, maybe pallies, they are really under designed tanks, and weak dps, but that would be it.
---
Who's mans is this
---
Ehhh... this is tricky and I'm not sure which side I fall on. *Not* listening to your playerbase is bad too; it's also bad to not following global population trends. The fact is, gaming is becoming more and more casual overall.
---
Look at the MMO, *Wildstar*, developed by ex-WoW devs who felt that WoW had become *too casual.* 
---
Their insistence on catering to hardcore players is the reason Wildstar finally shutdown.
---
... and [this MassivelyOP](https://massivelyop.com/2018/11/30/the-nexus-telegraph-what-other-games-can-learn-from-wildstars-demise/) article in 2018:
---
&gt; Let‚Äôs make one thing clear here: WildStar‚Äôs shutdown is a death knell for raiding, or at least the antique MMO fantasy of the huge hyper-difficult raid as the be-all and end-all of the level cap. We have seen what the audience is for that, and it brought us here... If there was ever a game that would have made this work, either by attracting that audience or developing its playerbase into that audience, it was this one.
---
Until they see the success or lack there of, of Vanilla Blizz has no plans for anything post classic.  If you really took that statement as meaning they were going to go a different development route you are going to be very disappointed.  It's all but guaranteed that if they develop classic beyond Vanilla we will get at least TBC and likely WotLK, it's just way too cheap for them to develop those next instead of new content, what comes after that if anything is anyone's guess.
---
I would say that was a silly argument because absolutely nothing stops geared toons using group tactics too. The idea that you can just ‚Äúplay support‚Äù and by so doing miraculously defeat a massive gear advantage is naive verging on deliberately disingenuous. If it was that easy everyone would win every battleground that way... which is so obviously impossible there must be a problem with your narrative.
---
As for people who raid to PvP, if they are doing it in the sixty bracket I think it‚Äôs part of the sixty PvP game, and besides they don‚Äôt have any other options. It‚Äôs not like they are deliberately dropping out of every other part of the game to grief levellers. A twinker is more like someone who raids to get better gear to grief level 20 toons doing escort quests on a PvE server.
---
Happy cake day 
---
I never really paid much attention to Wildstar because I was too busy at the time to play another MMORPG anyway but all I remember seeing is that mobs would show on the ground where their attacks were going to hit.  What exactly made it hard core or at least "harder"?
---
By late vanilla, the devs knew how the game they designed played out and were able to polish much of the "wild west" elements (itemization, down ranking, etc.) out of the game.  Rather than fleshed out, I found the resulting trends in late vanilla/TBC to be a disappointing streamlining process that removed complexity and player discovery.  Yes TBC made all specs viable for end game over but it was at a cost.  You can't have balance without control and starting with TBC the devs exerted increasing control over the play for each class.
---
August
---
Read those two articles I linked, they actually do a good job of explaining it.
---
What a crude finish. Thx for the memories
---
Cool link those arena ratings. NM. You are delusional. BTW I was on Tich.
---
When you see 5000 buff ret paladins when they legit can one shot classes like rogue? You get sick of it. At this point they should make a server with all hybrids so all the whiners and excuse makers are in one place.
---
It's not as bad as it sounds. It's just that many classes in Vanilla have a very strong baseline even without talents, allowing you to spec into a tree in order to tweak a playstyle that would otherwise be associated with a different tree.
---
For instance, a paladin healer can sacrifice 5% healing crit chance, Divine Favor and Holy Shock (it has a 30 second CD in Vanilla) to gain Holy Shield and Reckoning (1 extra melee attack on next swing every time you get crit, stacks up to 4 times) from the Protection tree. The final build can look something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxZVGtMcuxo). It gives you a lot of flexibility and reinforces the idea that hybrid classes can actually switch between roles mid-combat.
---
For a new player to vanilla, but familiar to WoW and RPG's in general.... maybe 9-14 days played time? It really depends on what you are doing while leveling; leveling up profs, doing dungeons, dueling, PvPing etc.
---
The horde have it better. Wailing Caverns is an absolute masterpiece of a level 18-22 dungeon and, it's followed up by Shadow Fang Keep. Which as least in my opinion is the best lain out low level dungeon in the game. Ya'll got stunted on for early dungeons.
---
I remember making a pally lv 70 twink  in cata. I would beat lv 85 players with my bis lv 70 gear.
---
Exorcism hit for like 10k with my gear and I could spam it. On top of never going OOM. 
---
People that would chill in gold shire would call me the Noob checker. There was this one warrior with 1800 raited Pvp gear that was talking all trash to people he would beat. The moment he lost to me was the moment he became a meme and lost all respect from the goldshire fence club.
---
It's hard to say without much more information. Will you follow a guide? Will you level professions as you level, and if so, which ones? Which class are you playing? How many dungeons will you do? How much PvP will you do? Will you level by quests exclusively, or will you grind mobs at every opportunity?
---
Record breakers are estimating less than 4 days played when classic releases, so that's the absolute lower limit. Most people can get to 60 in 8 days played pretty comfortably if you follow a guide. If you don't follow a guide, do a lot of pvp, do a lot of dungeons, and don't grind at every opportunity: there's people that hit 50 days played before they hit 60. Hell I've seen screencaps of level 40's with 50+ days played. 
---
Questing is *generally* faster than grinding, *if* you optimize it and know where to go so that you can chain them. If not, or if there's really high competition (e.g. around launch behind the curve), grinding will be faster.
---
Hi, /u/radicalrockin
---
This. There are cross over pvp/pve specs that work for many classes. But to optimize one or the other, you're definitely sacrificing utility. Great gear mitigates this a bit, so high level pve geared characters can get away with a pve build in pvp. But a pve geared person that re-specs for pvp will dominate even more. I don't believe there is 1 optimal spec for any class.
---
I‚Äôm a professional UX designer if you need a hand :) 
---
It'll be easy for experienced WoW players, but let's not get carried away. LFR is so easy to be almost completely impossible to wipe, it's designed to be 1-shot by random people who have never done it before.
---
Throw 40 players who aren't already familiar with MC into the raid, and they will wipe quite a bit. There are actual raid mechanics!
---
I'm clearing the week
---
Yes the only way I can pull playing this game off. Is to take a week off work. Tell everyone to consider me dead for a week. Then just plow through leveling. Otherwise I will play way too much everyday and, it will get disruptive to my life. People in my life can deal with me Awal for a week but, not months at a time lol.
---
I levelled on Pvp servers in vanilla. You don't level inefficiency just because some guy might get a free kill on you.
---
Spending your entire time saving your abilities is the biggest waste of time in WoW.
---
It's not really bragging if someone wasn't terrible from the start. Binding abilities and turning with the mouse is something most decent PC players would have been doing, regardless of MMO experience.
---
I played original wow non-stop and would never even fathom trusting my memory on item drop rates.
---
Could historical thottbot data have been used to calculate a rough percentage ?
---
So did I and I'd much rather be able to kill that guy than blow my cooldowns on mobs that don't require it. I PvP to win not to be caught with my trousers down.
---
The trolls in the upper right of the map? Everyone farmed pages there because they were rumored to have a higher page drop rate.. but in reality they just respawned pretty fast compared to everything else.. so it was easy to actually farm them for pages.
---
I was pointing out that TBC caters for more specs and playstyles by providing more gear. I'm not sure that's even up for debate, it's plainly true.
---
Then you went into a crazy rant about how underpowered rogues were compared to warriors in vanilla, then you moaned about how overpowered rets were in wotlk, then you started going on about how bad itemization was for other classes in vanilla, which was my original point!
---
What's your deal? Are you being purposely dense and argumentative for the sake of it?
---
Yes I agree with this fully. For me TBC introduced so much shit to the game that made it worse. It was just so new at the time. I didn't see it. Flying Mounts, Daily Quests, Dungeon Finder, Multiple levels of Dungeon difficulty, and Arena. God I can't even speak on how much I hate Arena's now. Even though I was pretty HC into them during TBC. Honestly in hindsight TBC was an unmitigated disaster. 
---
 "meet on bank" tells were very very common Horde side.
---
That's your choice. Mine is to outlevel everyone else which reduces the chances of being ganked.
---
14 days played is the average I normally saw on Private servers, but this is with servers that had 4 times the population of original WoW. You would also see mages power leveling characters, ruining large chunks of Mob spawns for normal leveling players. Keep in mind class is a huge part of your leveling speed, mages and hunters can clock 9 - 10 days played easy for 1 - 60, while warriors are considered the slowest most painful class to level due to overall gear reliance. If it's your first char a warrior will be super rough to level, if you can bankroll it's gear from another char, it will be a cake walk. As another person said, use a guide, and a quest helper add-on is also a good idea, vanilla wow just had some quests that would waste a long amount of time from being vague.
---
Shhh
---
Don't ruin it
---
&gt; cute girl from class finally convinced me to go to the movies with her.
---
You had me in full belief until this part. Completely fake story. Good try BFA scrub. You nearly had me fooled.
---
People who speed run 1-60 can do it in under 150 hours.  An experienced player who is doing quests, dungeons, and generally just having fun would probably do it in under 300 hours.  A new player not following any guides and just having fun with the game can take 700+ hours.  It's hard to say how long it takes new players to get to 60, but if you follow a guide you can do it in under 300 hours even as a new player.
---
The math checks out. Date confirmed. 
---
I was playing FFxi so I knew immediately, but I have been invited to some crazy group como DM runs.
---
Id argue that its EVEN more face-rollish, as hardcore players are trying to "beat" the game with weird specs just for the sake of a challenge.
---
BiS lists are a pretty good driver.
---
Eg as a mage you‚Äôll be working on lbrs to get your robe pattern (tailor bop). You‚Äôll be getting AV rep for your offhand, belt, etc. You‚Äôll be doing UBRS for ya trinkets. 
---
After world firsts are obtained, every spec becomes viable.
---
Big deal. It isn't all tier gear. You go to ZG. AQ has some good stuff. Again you act as if other classes are in all tier gear in Vanilla. They aren't. On a mage you don't even take tier 1. You laughed at anyone who would and use all the bidding on the eph power trinket, belt, t2 helm.
---
Also I didn't say Rets were OP. I said they made warriors pointless. They did. WOTLK ret is what happens when you cater to the whiners. You ruin the game. You make other classes pointless outside a small mini game that like 5 percent of the population actually played a lot. 
---
Just go back to modern WoW. YOU are the people who ruined WoW. They made a game for you. It's sh@%. We hate it. Don't try to ruin WoW again. 
---
Solid noise for tuning out at work. Thanks for this
---
I am moving the week of the 16th. Knowing how this always goes when in really want to play a game means that it will probably release on the 16th.
---
New raid in Bfa launches today and blizzard will use classic to bridge the time to the next raid
---
1-60 took me about 3 months in retail Vanilla. I have no idea how much I played but it was pretty much Daily after school. 
---
Gotta disagree. I loved TBC at the time but, in hindsight it was the birth of pretty much every aspect of wow I have come to hate. It's just they were peppered in over the expansion. So living through it I didn't see the change but, after playing on a private server. Where the patches are at the end and, the whole thing is lain out it's an abomination in my eyes. 
---
List of things TBC introduced that I hate.
---
1. Arena
---
2. Overly stream lined specs.
---
3. Dungeon finder
---
4. Flying mounts
---
5. Daily Quests
---
6. Multiple Dungeon difficulty levels.
---
7. Free epics from PVP
---
8. A seperation of PVP and PVE gear
---
9. Classes becoming more homogenized in pursuit of their precious balance.
---
10. Last but, not least. They added those Knife eared goons to my beloved horde. We betrayed the Amani and, for what... Paladins? Shoulda left them to die.
---
Thats just my take on it any way. Classic or bust for me. To each his own though.
---
dump dat ho, problem solved
---
It depends. Survival hunter blows. Mages have multiple good specs, but not all are equally good at all things. Warriors can tank or DPS entirely fine.   
---
There's a number of options, and while not are all great, the "one way or it sucks" crowd has always been there, and has often been wrong. It's generally hyperbole, or refusing to value other people's priorities where they differ from yours. 
---
I don't know if you've ever played on a PvP server but playing with you mana gems up- not letting yourself get too low on resources- keeping barriers up where possible (and vulnerable to ganks) isn't playing inefficiently- it's playing smart.
---
That's true. Survival is awful at a certain point, but it's not universal. Gear/spec have heavy interplay. 
---
That's not the whole story with Wildstar. It was incredibly buggy, had a goofy aesthetic theme, and had a shit UI. If it was a great game that was focused on hardcore players I think it would still be going strong. It was instead a flawed game. Hardcore/mediumcore/blackgaze/casual doesn't matter if the game isn't great. 
---
Question: Where does it put the micro bar and bag bar?
---
Do you pvp?
---
Happy cake day bro :))
---
My first time leveling to 60 was on a mage in 2005. I had leveled 3 other chars past level 25 prior. I did not focus on being fast, but I spent most of my time out in the world doing things that gave exp.
---
I spent 21 days (x24h) to 60. About 5 irl months. 
---
My last 3 chars have been rogue, warrior and mage. With 9, 8, and 6 days played to 60. First two on fresh launch servers, mage 6 days on established server. 
---
You first have to distinguish what you are told by 1) pservers players 2) players who arguably have never played Vanilla / began to play very late right before TBC and 3) players who played Vanilla for most of its life and onward.
---
Pservers (private server) players have been farming the game for years, sometimes 10+ years, and therefore see Vanilla raid content from another point of view, which is the one of the min maxer.
---
My experience, as someone who played in Vanilla, and never in a pserver, what I can tell you is that I went up to somewhere mid AQ40 in term of raid content, I mained ret in 40 man raids (sometimes replaced as heal when too many of them were missing or some other problem), and tanked most of the non-40-man raid content, ZG included. With all that said, my personal view is that **in most servers back in the day, people didn't care what you played and how hardcore you were. You could play moonkin, ret, any spec, having a few green gear going into MC (the term BiS didn't existed in my server, even for all TBC and WotLK duration), not getting buffs and consumables, and you were still accepted in raid.** Why? Because 1) nobody cared, the fun came from playing the game and discovering 2) The game was not figured out (and aside from pserver players, it will not be figured out A LOT more in Classic unless you are hardcore) and **3) The most important was to be able to have 40 people being present on a raid night, which was a nightmare all by itself. Because deciding of a common schedule with 40 people, when a lot of them are not nolife hardcore people is really, really hard. Your raid leader was happy if no one was missing. It will be exactly the same in Classic.**
---
My conclusion is, don't let pservers players / min maxers what you should play / not play. As I told you with my story, you can clear raid content even with a suboptimal spec and playstyle. Just be yourself, and find friends and eventually a guild that enjoy the game the way you do. There is no "Classic is not done for you".
---
Cheers.
---
Not viable in raiding?  Very true.
---
Not viable at all?  Very false.
---
You see, the game wasn't built around raiding.  There was leveling.  There was end-game farming.  There were 5-mans (which had vastly different requirements), and then there were raids.  There was also PvP, which depending on your server might just mean WSG/AB/AV, or might mean everywhere.
---
What you have to realize is that you had a character, and that character could do different things.  A spec which has a lot of extra utility that's useful in PvP, or a spec which has a lot of survivability (that isn't a tank) is going to have its uses - just not in a raid.  That survivability might make it an extremely efficient leveler by reducing downtime and increasing the margin for error when you pull.  That survivability might make you useful in a 5-man where you can hit an add before it runs after the healer, and take a few hits along the way.  That utility might make you useful to a group, depending on what it is you're adding.
---
But, if you take a character with all that utility and survivability and then also give them competitive damage, what you've done is create a character that's "balanced" in raids, but overpowered in solo play and in PvP.  The only way to compensate is to give the other specs comparable utility and survivability.  They tried this in Wrath and it didn't exactly work out.
---
The problem you have now, is that if everything is balanced along every axis, they all feel the same.  What's the point in picking between arcane, fire, and frost, if they can all kite, can all take a hit, and can all DPS just the same?  You end up picking over flavor (I want to see sparkles instead of flames) or you end up picking over the miniscule benefits one might have (i.e. if one is slightly better on fights with 3-4 enemies, if one has cooldowns that line up with a certain fight) instead of picking on what advantages the specialization gives you.
---
The min/maxing that people do is exactly that - throw away everything that is not maximizing your potential in one area.  The reason is that raids have so many players that you can specialize yourself.  In a raid, you're not concerned with the rest of the factors you might be balanced by.  Which means that some specs fall by the wayside in raids, but also means raids should not be the barometer by which the classes are balanced.
---
Sit Critting was a thing in vanilla (also known as reckoning bombs). 
---
&gt; I would say that was a silly argument because absolutely nothing stops  geared toons using group tactics too. The idea that you can just ‚Äúplay  support‚Äù and by so doing miraculously defeat a massive gear advantage is  naive verging on deliberately disingenuous. 
---
Both sides should have some well geared people. My point is that even in such a situation, undergeared people on both sides still have options that can turn the tide of the battle.
---
I don't think that every twink player is an angsty griefer. As a personal anecdote, I have enjoyed a fair bit of level 19 twinking, but I also spent a lot of time queing WSG with a level 10 twink. I made both of those twinks for the same reason, but while one of them could one-shot other players, the other one could easily lose to competent non-twinks. It wasn't about making people angry - if a GM gave me an item that could instakill, I wouldn't use it. It was about seeing your character grow and perform in ways that were not laid down for me by the game designers.
---
Is it incomplete?  Maybe.  But it's not as bad as you think.  It might be inbalanced for raids, but it's a lot better when you include PvP, leveling, solo, 5-mans, and all the other content aside from just raids.
---
My first 60 was a warrior and I want to say it took around 12 days played. WoW wasnt my first mmo though so I was playing with some purpose.
---
People who want Vanilla, but don't want Blizzard to release TBC and Wrath, are worse than the people who like Live and don't want Vanilla released.
---
Because at least the retail players aren't hypocrites.
---
I don't think it's zero percent chance. I think it is the most likely outcome. Classic wow will dwarf modern wows player base inside of a year. Classic wow offers something no one else currently does. It doesn't matter if the game is "better". Modern wow lost it's uniqueness so it will die. No one thought in 2010 wow killer would be wow lol but, I do think that to be the most likely outcome. They didn't stop pubing their subs for no reason.
---
I kind of feel like that's why Transmog is okay in the modern game.  Even if they didn't make it ridiculously easy to solo the content, a level 120 going into a level 60 raid should have an easy time, and the players will easily be able to get good looking gear anyway.
---
If transmog does happen I'm sure half the die-hard Vanilla players will unsub and either never play WoW again or only play on private servers.
---
Wouldn't the players be way too divided at that point tho? Itll make the servers emptier and ultimately fall apart faster.
---
And if the instances get too full, we can add a 3rd portal.
---
Hah I remember getting clobbered in RFC before we figured out we needed to have healers. Me and my roommate thought the potions we had would be good enough and the rest of the group was new enough to play follow the leader. Pretty soon we got our asses handed to us and figured out that golden dragon portrait = just one guy can wreck you hard. A bit later I learned what a tank was. I can't imagine clearing WC without one or being vastly overleveled.
---
Did people really not like normal/heroic dungeons? I thought it was a pretty good way of keeping them relevant at Max level. I don't like the 80 difficulties as have now but I was pretty keen on heroic dungeons &amp; raids (added later).
---
Wait, was I not supposed to have a separate account full of STV banks?
---
probably somewhere in the 210-270 hours (9-12 days of play time) is what most people with the goal of hitting 60 will have for play time
---
Extensively in TBC I made it all the way to 2345 rank in 5's on my Pally (I know hypocritical but, I inherited it from my brother.) I know it's not the highest rank but, it's certainly respectable. Fell just short of Gladiator on my battle group.
---
All of that being said. I think TBC sacrificed way to much on the altar of competitive pvp. Classic wow pvp was way more fun. Not as balanced but, way more fun. I just don't see MMORPG's as a good place to flex your I got skills epeen. I think "Pro" style MLG pvp has no place in an RPG. Arena and, TBC ignored that and, massively hurt the game because of it.
---
Here are the rules I've been using:
---
* If you do not yet have the profession that would use it on one of your alts, sell it
---
* If you do have the profession, but the character is basically on ice for the foreseeable future, sell it
---
* If you do have the profession, send it to that character and let that character bank it.  If that character's bank gets full, sell stuff from it.
---
Bank space is better than inventory, unless you plan to use that inventory.  With very few exceptions, it will be easy to farm up the material again (or simply buy it later off the AH).  Sell it, get bank space + gold to use on things NOW, and then buy stuff later when you have more of each.
---
There's also tanks that couldn't take more than X adds at a time and had to have enough CC for the healer to not get threat.
---
It's what made the game feel like a strategy game instead of a hack-and-slash.
---
BOE items for your alts.
---
jul 16th is a likely release date for the new ffxiv raid and those always line up with wow releases so i wouldn't be too surprised if this was right on
---
I may.  I have other commitments around summer that may be burning my leave.  Hopefully the two match up.
---
This is a very unpopular opinion that I agree with. 
---
As far as I know. That is not a popular opinion. It's just one that I have. I like the idea of easier dungeons and, harder ones. I really don't like the idea of killing a boss but, it not being a "true" kill because I could have activated heroic mode and, her would played for real for real. It's just a personal pet peev of mine.
---
I just don't want what are supposed to be "elite" dungeon villains to have an easy mode. It kills the vibe of it for me. Makes the enemy seem less foreboding.
---
All of the arguments about server fracturing have been made on live.
---
If they make Classic and either:
---
* TBC is not released in 3-4 years (longer than it took originally)
---
* TBC is not announced in 2-3 years
---
* It is officially stated they do not want to do TBC
---
Then the same thing will happen to Classic as happened to live - attrition to private servers or simply players quitting.  That will also "fracture" the community.
---
Questing isn't the fastest. Even less for new players. If your new you want to farm a lot other then oboius quests. A big mistake people do is going to "new zones all the time" becasue there  is no quests left. But it's actually way better to farm, even in speedruning guides (Like joana) it's perma "farm 1/4 lvl here. farm to 30 here etc" like in thousand needles  u have to farm from 29&gt;30 pretty much. 
---
So if you want to level faster as a new player, just be find with farming a lot.
---
Also don't do dungeons, doing dungeons is fine if u dont care to much about leveling fast (Look up all quests and how to get them before hand - example - https://classicdb.ch/?zone=718#quests)
---
Open a tap on each quest and see where u get them. It's way more fun leveling with gear, but it's slower.
---
So my suggestion if you wanna level fast as a new player would be.
---
Have a quest helper.
---
Do oboius quests.
---
Farm a lot of EXP rather then traveling to new zones all the time, yes sometimes u need to farm the same mobs 2 hours in a row, find a spot with not that many players.
---
If you are a warrior (not the fastest) grouping up is actually more exp/hour. On the most recent big private server, the fastest lvl 60 warrior was in 3 man group (priest,mage,warrior) - Dynamic respawn was enabled which made it faster then what it will be in classic tho.
---
So that's my advice :)
---
I‚Äôve had some of the odd ball group combos be amazing, and some of the cookie cutter groups be horrible.
---
Druids have talents deep in each tree, which are useful.  If you go into Feral, there's Heart of the Wild, which is the 26-30 point talent, and comes with a whopping 20% intellect.  Then there's the Balance build which requires 24 points to pick up Nature's Grace and Moonglow, and then plenty of deep resto builds as well.  
---
It's largely true. TBC had *FAR* better class balance and spec viability, which is why I consider it better than Vanilla. WotLK was still pretty good, but hints of class homogeneity were already starting to peak out.
---
I'd love a good site for server blacklists, not sure if any private servers already have something for this tho
---
Love this. I may just get a premium account to gold you if it is indeed released on that date. 
---
"You obviously didn't play TBC" is what I would answer you if I was a dick.
---
I think you shouldn't be mixing TBC with parts of WotLK and modern retail WoW.
---
Yes leveling and world PvP was not a good side of TBC. But it was still hard and long to get gear in TBC. Dungeons and raids were still hard and interesting. You still couldn't PuG on command. Nothing was free. Balance no matter you look at it was 100x better than Classic, and tbh better than every expansion balance. It's widely recognized even by #nochangers. PvP was awesome with the new balance.
---
&gt; One one hand you have server side values that have been researched for years with evidence from the period
---
Sure they must have watched hours worth of footage of STV troll grinding to make extra sure they got the rates right.
---
I dunno how I feel about transmog in classic. On one hand part of me screams no. On the other hand I plan on playing a Warrior...
---
Get a life, you're an embarrassing wannabe elitist. 
---
You are a caricature of the worst type of wow player. You think you know more and are better than everyone else, and you want everyone to know it. 
---
You'll be over-compensating for your real-life failures, no doubt.
---
Just enjoy the game and stop being such a dick.
---
The argument is that the changes introduced to fix an issue like class balance will have unintended consequences and end up doing more harm than good. 
---
I am unabashedly a "changes" person. Let Blizzard continue to do patch balancing like they did 12+ times during Vanilla. They were progressing and getting better each time, they simply ran out of time before shifting labor toward working on TBC. Had that expansion been delayed a year, we perhaps could have seen up to 1.15 or so, which may have un-memed the various "meme specs", e.g. Moonkin or Prot Paladin or Enhancement Shaman.
---
I disagree. There weren't significative QoL added in Classic. Outland and flying is not QoL, the sad part was that the leveling and many raids were located in outland, and therefore Azeroth was not the center of interest anymore, but it's still content in itself, not QoL related.
---
There wasn't an auto teleporting mechanic for the whole group, there weren't microtransactions. Classes weren't homogenized, in fact, balance in TBC was the best it has ever been in WoW arguably. PvP was incredibly good. And of course PvE and even quests/rep were super good imo.
---
Don't mix TBC with wrath and onward.
---
It is somewhat true. I mean, PvP ret kinda works, but you are mainly wanted as a healer, the protection talents feel like they could only be used prior to maximum level in dungeons and are mostly just there to compliment ret/holy builds. I wouldn't say it is "1 spec per class works", closer to "2 specs work, the third is meant to buff the other two". But it would depend quite on the build classic wow uses, we still don't know which it would be, all very speculative. 
---
I have exams throughout July :(
---
My first 60 back in Vanilla was a hunter. I wasted a lot of time, grinded nearly all of it, did dungeons, and PvP. I took 16 days played.
---
I suspect I can do 10 Days played following a guide. I figure I can devote 30 hours on average a week into the game, bringing me to about 8 weeks or 2 months to hit 60.
---
I think a new player following a guide can do about 12 days plus or minus a day based on class
---
Another day, another picture of a book.
---
That comment is underrated.

I'd expect 9 to 15 days played as a warrior depending on how much PvP, dungeons, professions, and quest optimization you do.  One tip I can give you for warrior leveling is go herbing/alchemy .  You're going to need a lot of health pots to avoid dying on mobs.
---
blessed (adj) - "That boy ain't right"
---
Honestly, what I miss is group content at your level being challenging, not that part so much. I mean, I tanked and healed Mythic+ last xpac and on 10+ it was a bigger challenge than I ever had in TBC and classic. Was fun, too. You can't really call modern content "easy" if all you do is raid finder and heroic. I do not like how you need to have a bunch of increasing difficulties, though. 
---
This^
---
Good man. 
---
People back in the day were slower paced in about everything but right now as it stands there is so much information out there that if people really want to get to 60 they will be getting to 60 asap. We should be seeing faster-paced vanilla then what was regular when it first released. 
---
I would also like to stress that warrior leveling has been proven to be slightly slower than other classes. I wouldn't worry about hitting 60 asap and just go at your own pace. (Some guides for quests and I'm sure devs will have addons up shortly before or after release)
---
Personally, I am hoping to find a guild and within the first month of release be raid ready, I just haven't settled completely on my class yet.
---
I just realized I didn't give you a definitive answer and what I can say is that the top levelers will hit 60 in 4-6 Days /played and the average levelers will be in 10-15 /played. (7-10 days irl top and 16-30 days for average). These numbers are based on irl experiences and not the end all be all information.
---
I agree, but unfortunately a lot of the memespecs require a LOT of fixing as evident in TBC where in the most part the issues were resolved.
---
Take Protadins - TBC protadins were much better but in order to become viable they needed to be given a taunt, a passive that gave them mana back when healed, a ranged shield throw, and they needed gear that had defense and spellpower on it which didn't exist in Vanilla. You kinda need all of these fixes to make protadins a viable raid tank in Vanilla, and changing so much will have a lot of far reaching consequences in other aspects of the game.
---
Moonkins could possibly be fixed by making the spec more mana efficient somehow when in moonkin form, but anything they do to increase this would potentially affect the entire balance (no pun intended) of both PvP and that of Resto druids if the changes werent entirely all toploaded at 25+ points in the Balance tree.
---
I think a lot of us would really like to see the memespecs made viable in Vanilla, but in practise they all require so much more than a couple of minor talent changes to make decent and the changes would likely throw the whole feel of the game off.
---
For now you just have to accept Vanilla is a place where some specs were "good for things other than Raiding". Paladins and Druids were Raid Healers that had specs you could change to for OTHER parts of the game such as 5mans and pvp. That was the way Vanilla worked and I wouldnt say it meant it was unfinished or incomplete.
---
Prot Paladins work just fine for instances and pvp. They arent incomplete. They arent designed to be able to tank raid bosses, they're a spec designed to tank AOE stuff and 5mans to give some alternative "minor jobs" to an otherwise primary heal class. Is this design -good-? No. But it's a design choice and changing it hugely would make vanilla not vanilla.
---
I'm excited for the results!
---
They were. 
---
I was there. 
---
You are someone that will be sitting outside a raid because you cry about having to heal, even though you get a DPS gear for Boomkin healing . BTW the "elitist" is below. He went off about "sh%$ servers" and thinks there was a lot of world pvp in TBC. I have always said WoW is a casual MMO.  People like you? Wrecked what was a casual MMO and wanted it more casual. 
---
**Funny that you should talk about "enjoying the game" when you want to change it or act like it should be changed. You are the reason we can't enjoy the game.** Simply don't play Classic if you want it changed. I'm not playing the current garbage game anymore. All that it had left was arena and that got destroyed in WoD by Celestalon. You ask for all this crap, Blizzard ruins the game and gives it to you, then you won't play the game they gave to you.
---
Wan to DPS as a boomkin? Go on BFA. It's that simple. Stay far away from Classic. 
---
As I understood lua file, it changes Alpha(Visibility) to 0, and shuffles bottom right multi cast action bar.
---
&gt; Both sides should have some well geared people.
---
"Should" is a wonderfully ambiguous word. If you had said "both sides **will** have some well geared people" then you would have been factually wrong, of course, but then your argument would work. But by saying they "should" have well geared people you in fact say nothing at all.
---
&gt; My point is that even in such a situation, undergeared people on both sides still have options that can turn the tide of the battle.
---
Since you admit to 19 twinking you know you are full of shit. The only option a 500 health hunter whose autoshots do thirty damage has when a 1200 health hunter whose autoshots do closer to one hundred damage and who dodges a third of their attacks rocks up is to be an honour kill or run away.
---
You can make up stories about how a lowbie mage or warlock or something can CC a twink, but realistically they're going to feed them far more HKs trying than it is worth if the twinker is remotely competent.
---
&gt; It was about seeing your character grow and perform in ways that were not laid down for me by the game designers.
---
It is amazing the ingenuity twinkers have in coming up with narratives in which they are totally not the bad guy. And indeed, if every twinker played level 10 toons no more powerful than a normally geared levelling toon nobody would have a problem with them. But we both know that is not what they do, don't we? It's not about this disingenuous pretence to be interested in "seeing your character grow and perform in ways that were not laid down for me by the game designers", it's about seeing your character grow and perform in ways that were not laid down for me by the game designers *and* which let you fuck over levellers and noobs for your own gratification.
---
Otherwise you'd be equally happy "seeing your character grow and perform in ways that were not laid down for me by the game designers" by beating up PvE mobs with a melee priest or a bow warrior or something.
---
Healers, we kind of understood by Deadmines, but a level 37 hunter ran us through for fun, so we didn't have to bother with one, but we had no idea about tanks well into our 50s.  Typically pulls would have everyone tanking something, usually with their face or with pets, with palys sort of playing the guy who tanks the most dangerous mob.
---
The final boss of ST kind of made it clear that we actually needed something that could tank.  However, when I hit 60 everyone was running 15-20 man raids on level 60 dungons (10mans for BRD) so you really didn't need a tank and the few tanks that existed were so fucking awful. 
---
Once my server started raiding we had a small core of dedicated tanks who knew what they were doing, but they were fucking rare still.  In my guild, we had 2 guys who could tank and that was a guild of 300 or so people.  
---
While leveling mages were in higher demand than tanks because their CC was bigger factor in not wiping all the time than the few warriors who were poorly tanking.
---
I'm afraid that would promote harassment against such players, which blizzard might not like. In the past this usually was discussed on realm forums. I really hope they will bring them back.
---
&gt; Is this design -good-? No. But it's a design choice
---
This is just factually wrong, unless you think the designers who have spoken about this were lying. They wanted all specs to be viable and they considered it a failure that not all of them were. But with limited development time they ended up focusing on fixing the specs people were playing over the specs that people weren't playing (because those specs were not viable).
---
Failed specs were not a design choice and never were. They were a design error that did not get fixed until TBC.
---
Now you are perfectly entitled to want those failed specs to be the same in Classic as they were in 1.12 or whenever, I am not interested in arguing that point right now. But don't try to pretend that they were intentionally designed to fail.
---
You are more than welcome. I'm really bad at UX design. I might shoot you a pm eventually. Thanks!
---
I'd hate to say immediately but... atleast lvl10? My first character was a warrior and I knew I needed a healer so the conditions basically filled themselves. 
---
Wotlk had the best PvP hands down and each class was unique and balanced, what are you talking about? there are specs and classes that are much better at everything in vanilla (PvP, raiding, leveling, 5-mans, farming) - frost mages for example and there are classes that have one very unique niche and even that ain't that special - druids for example. 
---
Mage is strong in every aspect of the game. Frost is great the whole time, Fire is great mostly late game.
---
Druid can be a suboptimal healer in PvE and/or good world PvP 1v1 class and/or flag runner.
---
Shaman can be a chain healer in PvE and burst spellcaster for BGs when playing against low skilled/geared players.
---
Rogue is one of the best PvP and PvE specs.
---
Warrior is the only raid tank and one of the best DPS classes. Wrecking ball in PvP.
---
Hunter is shit in late-game content and only good at some PvP aspects.
---
Priest is great in PvP and PvE as a healer. Great damage spec for PvP as well.
---
Paladin is only good as a healer. 
---
What are you talking about balance and viability? If a games offers 3 specs for each class then all 3 specs should be viable and balanced to some extent. If they are not it's a bad game-design. You can't have a Fury Warrior (that can also tank as a Prot) pulling the highest DPS and PURE DPS classes as Hunter pulling 50% of that damage. And yes the game should be balanced about late game content. WOW CLASSIC will be around for many years so it's expectable that many players will have full Naxx gear and will be doing PvP and PvE on the highest level possible. 
---
As far as tanks go, why is Prot warr the only spec available for raid tanking? "others are good at trash and/or 5-mans" yeah they are but by this logic, warrior should suck a huge donkey's Dck as a 5-man tank. Does he? No he is great there as well. By the logic that every class feels special - you can pull great DPS as a mage, you can farm as a devil, you can go literally 1v5 in PvP if you are geared/skilled and have consumables, you have great utility and everything. What can you do as a Hunter? yeah your leveling experience is 20% faster and easier than other classes. Good luck. You just hit your level 60 and saved 20 hours out of 200. now your next 2000 hours will be fun. Druids are fun aren't they? They are hybrids which means you can play every class, they are the true jack of all trades. Now that is a crap and everyone knows that. You can't pull 70% of the rogue's DPS if you have the same gear and what other utility you have? You have roots and suboptimal HoT spells that can be dispelled. Rogue have better utility and CC than druid for both PvP and PvE. Warrior can charge you and kill you. Retri paladin or Enha shaman has to get some lucky procs to be able to do something in PvP and are utterly shit at PvE. 
---
All these min-maxers already know what is good in vanilla and what is going to remain there in classic. That's why there will be warriors, mages, rogues, priests and warlock everywhere while Druids, Hunters, Shamans and Paladins are going to be hugely underrepresented in the most parts. Yeah that is a great balance right there.
---
solution: dump your girlfriend for WoW
---
One of the slides at blizzcon showed a rogue named July and someone else saw something that added up to the 16th or around that date. So it's pretty much confirmed now üòÅ
---
&gt; But that's the thing, a change like re-balancing talent trees will ultimately impact many parts of WoW: PvP, PvE, what gear people want, what professions they choose, the economy etc. A massive talent rebalance doesn't just improve that single talent tree in a vacuum, it can potentially impact numerous other aspects of the game. At that point, the game we remember may not be the game that is Classic
---
But it might be truer to the experience of playing vanilla in 2004 or 2006, since those were never solved games in a permanent mechanical stasis.
---
What the "no changes" brigade want is far, far closer to the 2018 pirate server experience than the 2004-2006 retail experience. They want a known, solved game with no uncertainty and no unexpected changes ever. Not a dynamic game where regular updates chang PvP, PvE, the economy, what gear people want, what professions they chose and so on, and where no class or strategy was guaranteed to be the top dog forever.
---
