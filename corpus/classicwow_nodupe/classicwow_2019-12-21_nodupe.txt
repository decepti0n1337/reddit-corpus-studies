 Nothing wrong with giving out free water and food to people who ASK. Fuck the people who just open trade. 
---

---
Yes it‚Äôs free to make, but still a PAIN in the ass to make enough to trade out some stacks and then buff people and then buff yourself!

---
Where do you get snowballs?

Has epic rank 13 and 14 gear. Nothing special? Or nothing attainable?

I miss being able to go in at any level and buy whatever I wanted with my hard earned honor.

The good old SCHUTZENBANDER
---
Highly underrated reply.
---
Everything is doable in 5 mans- compositions only help so much, this isn‚Äôt a raid. Not sure who takes 5 hours doing scholo. Anyhow, it greatly helps to make your own group to pick and choose who your bring with you.
---
Yeah was meaning for horde, but yeah alliance have insta queues which allows premades to get in the same av
---
No, you can't have two different ranks of a DoT on a player. That is a specific mechanic for moonfire because it has an instant damage half to the spell.
---
So to explain it further, the first moonfire tick hits 3 seconds into its duration. If you spam rank 10 Moonfire rapidly, you get the instant damage, but the DoT damage never goes off because the duration is repeatedly reset.
---
If you hit them with a rank 10 Moonfire then spam with Rank 9, you get the instant damage from the Rank 9 Moonfire spam while the Rank 10 Moonfire DoT is ticking in the background. You squeeze a little extra damage and mana efficiency with this strategy.
---
&gt; horde has better PvP racials so it might be that most competent PvP players went horde side.
---
Not quite cut and dry.
---
the two commonly are cited ones are WotF and Hardiness
---
Hardiness is powerful but it's unreliable. While a good player with hardiness is better than a good player with no racials, its nature as a passive RNG means that it's not as appealing to good players (who'll want more reliable effects) as it is to bad or casual players who can benefit from it without thinking about it.
---
WotF is also technically powerful... but with some huge caveats. Only 3 classes have access to fear and one of them doesn't rely on it.  Out of all compatible classes, Rogues are also the only class that flatly benefits from it against all fear-using classes. 
---
- Warriors already have berserker rage and they still get hardbodied by locks/priests anyways. In giant brawls it's a bit more defense against fear spam which is nice, but not really gamechanging since you're not going to be fearlocked in the chaos anyways.
---
- Mages already hardbody warriors and do poorly against locks/spriests. Very little effect here.
---
- Locks already hardbody warriors, and have a solid matchup against non-dwarf priests. Mirror matches will have a significant edge to the UD.
---
- Priests already hardbody warriors. UD priest will be a bit better against locks than other races. In Mirror Matches, Fear Ward &gt; WotF every single time. 
---
Really the only incredibly strong horde racial is War Stomp and it's *really* strong but even combined with WotF/Hardiness it's still not better than what Alliance has access to.
---
Alliance however have Stoneform and Escape Artist which are both *very* strong for all classes capable of having them and on top of that, Paladins are hands down *the* best PvP healer in all aspects from buffs, to healing output, to utility (both defensive and offensive), to survivability, to mana efficiency, and so on.
---
Also another thing to consider is that tauren and gnomes both have altered melee ranges that make minor but still notable changes to balance in melee vs ranged matchups as gnome casters technically have extra range against non-tauren melees and tauren melees are technically closer to to non-gnome casters.
---
All-in-all Horde is phenomenally good at making shit players less shit, but Alliance is far and away the better PvP faction for those serious about PvP.
---
100% Agreed, the most hardcore person I saw in dreadmist was an almost full raid bis mage and a druid, and it's always fun to chat a bit in LFG at 3 am
---
Pretty sure I can tank better just running SL as a warlock, this seems painful, even for 5mans. While I can dig the meme, and I do almost fit into the tryhard group you mention, I find it a bit of a bummer someone making such a big push to make an arguably just... Shite spec work, even enhancement dps is... Laughable, clearly it just plainly doesn't matter in the current tier, nor will it for a while, but man, for someone who's exalted with AV and running enhancement just for the meme, it feels strange, if nothing else.
---
Though, I do wonder if 2-handers might be superior threat generation, at least for bosses where the damage is usually a bit more managable and the healing a bit more certain.
---
I recognize those guildnames. This is Venoxis, i isn't it?
---
In legacy software, most hotfixes require a compile to be installed which requires downtime even if it's brief.
---
You have to have at least 15 HK's a week otherwise you don't get put into a bracket for RP.
---
Gotcha! Sounds cool, will put in bag of tricks when super seriously playing my lvl 7 Druid to its fullest lol
---
You would be happier on retail.  If you choose to take that as an insult that's your prerogative.
---
And why is it hilarious?  Should pve realms not min max or strive for firsts ??
---
Gutgore ripper takes a debuff slot, you won't be raiding with it that's for damn sure.
---
Alliance smacked our Ice lord though :/. I was also in this AV ^^
---
Weapon skill
---
Yeah, everyone thought the map was imbalanced back in vanilla, but I'm starting to think it's actually just queue length. In vanilla horde had instant queue, so no one really tried to win. Same thing last week when AV launched.
---
But now... Now I spend as much time in queue as I do playing. As that queue time has gone up, fewer and fewer people are whinging about letting the alliance win. People coordinate, people defend, people summon a 6 story elemental and feed them human blood. It's great.
---
Yeah but that's not the true classic experience. Not even close.
---
Hey I'm a 60 druid with  max elemental LW with recipes, and recently dropped skinning for enchanting (as I got the heart of the mountain recipe which I made).  I had 300 skinning + finkel's skinner and I eventually want a breastplate of bloodthirst.  I plan to keep LW for my guild.  I'm wondering if it's worth going skinning again, or just going for a better gold income gathering profession so that I can eventually buy a pristine hide of the beast.  Would herblore or mining be better for a druid in general (keeping in mind jump runs, etc)?
---
Same!
---
Still after 305 still helps your glancing blows do more damage, so 313 swords beats 305 maces by a little.
---
OEB is 64.7 dps and has 42 strength which means not only that as far as white hits it has 70.7 effective dps but the 84 ap from strength makes your bloodthirst hit harder.
---
TUF has 61.5 dps and 19 strength and 2 crit. Crit is worth roughly 30 AP each, so TUF effectively gives 19*2 + 2 * 30 = 98 attack power in addition to it's normal damage. That makes it's effective dps 68.5 which is slightly less than OEB but having less weapon skill makes it even worse in comparison on level 63 mobs. This difference is even bigger if you're not a human obviously.
---
Oh, yeah.. just got my 5th piece of the set.
---
This might be the reason! Thanks. :D
---
We are playing on game client 7.0 that has been modified and hacked to behave like 1.12 in whatever test cases the current development team is putting it through.
---
Specifically with reckoning, whatever coding they tried to do to replicate the effect is just flat wrong, and has never existed at any point in retail WoW or private servers.
---
And how would it look?
---
Did you recently get your 5 peice hunter set bonus because that is a known reason that will cause this. If you drop down to only 4pc of set gear they stop.
---
I personally still use the set gear and found 99% of the time when I body pull (control pet into boss's agro field), 90% of the time it illuminated them both re-aggroing. 
---
Another thing I worked out is if you rather do the 4pc set + send your pet to attack, don't use his energy dmg abilities or growl, and always attack the king. If you chose the caster as first agro sometimes it will make it harder then normal to gain agro on him with a single shot.
---

---
First of all, no h. Exalted
---
Currently, it provides a +5 resist all enchant. Futurely, it provides free attunement to Naxx and tailor/ LW / BS's can make frost resistance gear which will become 100% necessary in Naxx
---
&gt; Since horde keep turteling and killing the 60% andy's they usually stop and turtle instead of pushing to gavl and drek.
---
&gt; 
---
The Horde aren't turtling. We just leave 10ish people behind to defend while 30 rush the base.
---
+dagger is ridiculously strong. I'd use Distracting until you can get your hands on Aged Core Leather Gloves or Mugger's Belt.
---
Thanks for the reply, oof that sucks I really don't want to do that lol
---
Four months in and people still don‚Äôt know how to screenshot. Smh my head ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Exactly.
---
Mage 100% if you want an alt to farm gold and to efficiently level more professions.
---
Nightmare to gear, though.
---
Seems like you both are using the term "live service" differently.
---
As a horde player, the trihard premades are a fairly small portion of the Alliance.
---
I have only encountered them once in dozens of games.
---
Depends on what you do in AV - I'm PvPing a lot
---
Pretty sure you are right with the item - it's actually a dagger and priests can wear them. Was not aware that the dmg procc can happen through mind vision though.  
---
Many priests I know have it from farming Maraudon solo, so even with the dagger being generally rare it's likely to find players with this specific class + item combination.
---
im trying to find the addon hes using where it shows how many people targeting each mark
---
Think it's ElvUI
---
The only people who wanted "No Changes" were Casualscrubs who never played Vanilla and though they would miss something if Blizz changed too much.
---
Works great, thanks!
---
yea definitely, premades vs premades, the fact that av can be premaded by ally is pissing me to no end, given how fking easy is for them to rush to van, pugs cant do it easily, but when u have ppl on discord and have all the tanks and palas knowing who does what then its just 7min gg crap
---
Brotherhood lmao
---
Turtles can be great for rep as long as people turn in quest items.
---
Yeah but the vanilla experience is completely impossible to get back. Even if you start no-lifing in WSG you'll not get the same experience as back then because these days everyone and their mother has grenades, 300 trinkets to swap for every single situation, optimized gear instead of just random cool shit in the appropriate armor class for their class. Moreover, people will premade way more than what they did back then. Yes it happened back then but it was not super common. 
---
And the talents and abilities we currently have are also a slap in the face for the true vanilla experience. Vanish should not remove hunter's mark or Mind Vision. Bleeds shouldn't scale with AP. Warrior Execute should consume all rage even if it misses. Most classes should have very different talents. We can go on all day. But even if every single detail about the game was an exact replica of what it was at this point in the game, we still wouldn't get the same vanilla experience because people tryhard way too much these days. Not as a bad thing, but it's a mind-set. People seek to optimize pretty much everything, that simply didn't happen back then. I'm sure today's players would find a way to optimize AV even if it was an older version.
---
lmao get good 60%er
---
I just view that as a perk of playing the less popular classes.  10 warriors are going to be harder to gear than 3 Druids no matter the system.
---
stop spreading this bullshit dude. jfc. do you even play the game? i bet you are like a grunt or something.
---
every server is horde heavy and alli have insta queue. you won't find alli in between queues to kill. with luck you can maybe get 1 per queue. that's 200 honor. at the end of the week that would not even be a additional 30k honor. top standings are 1mil
---
now compare to alliance who gets 20k+ honor/h. if you afk you can't recoup.
---
&gt;This is the false claim you made. Zg came out 14 years ago and we do know how they work. You may not, doesn't change the fact that it is known. 
---
You know as well as I do that was a reference to the game as it is now not the original release, you trying to swing that is just so poorly though out it is astonishing. You cannot know by any measurable way what the devs are going to or not going to do with the release of ZG period. You are making yourself out to be a complete and utter fool, I do not need to prove that the future is thusly the future....
---
lol maybe on heartseeker
---
The proc from Dwarven Hand Cannon can also break your Scatter Shot which really sucks.
---
Yep. The cross server premade group has legit 1000+ people on it at all times, its insanity during peak hours. If youre queueing solo as alliance youre basically left with the people who didnt adapt and its a shitshow
---
Literally best helm in the game being a crafted item available in t1 is pretty awesome though. Some people go months and months never seeing a certain piece of loot they want from a boss.
---
I don't play retail and never will... So I don't get it.  Are you saying there's no conversations that go on like in classic?  That sucks
---
German item names make me cringe.
---
then how come st1 skeram 1.1mil chilled during queue? pls stop talking about stuff you don't know about
---
Horde has 15 minute ques, 10 during peak hours sometimes.
---
I don‚Äôt like to say ‚ÄúI told you so‚Äù, but many people were very vocal/critical about this version of AV for all the reasons you listed above and then some. You can thank the #Nochanges crowd for this one. While it can still be a lot of fun every once in a while, this version of AV is overall incredibly lame. It will be interesting to see if they keep it or update it during the coming phases
---
It‚Äôs all anumbers game
---
Dude this is soo true! Holy/Disco Priest here and I thought its just my experience but mages suuuck. I used to run away when I saw one but after 1v1ing like 10 last week I chase them now. They can only aoe even on single target lol 
---
I‚Äôm not even gonna mention the sweet mana burns that never get countered and suddenly they just stand wait for me to kill them..
---
Just for you then:
---
Donnerzorn, Gesegnete Klinge des Windsuchers
---
lol. pls record you doing this and post it. otherwise you are clearly talking out of your ass.
---
or maybe you play on heartseeker then I can believe you
---
Yeah, I'm using the actual definition of what a live service is and he is using it to mean a server that is up
---
They're making cosmetic items only that have no bearing in the game other than how a ton looks?  How DARE they squeeze us with these completely ignorable options!!!
---
I‚Äôve been doing the premade AV stuff for about a week and the games usually last 10-15 minutes when we win. We lose about 20% of the time of horde send back 15 people because we will play zero defense. If we can get 35 in one premade then the game will be over in 8-9 minutes
---
A secret officer chat is part of every guild out there, you sound like a bunch of babies.
---
False
---
Exactly
---
It's a commonly used term for developers to refer to something that is generally always-online. If a game server has been offline for a week, it is STILL a live service. It's just offline for now. Live service is a type of software, not a server status.
---
But what about the fishers and the harpy cave people
---
"GO LEFT."
---
"GO RIGHT."
---
*group splits*
---
*20 minutes later allies lose*
---
Honestly atleast back in the day if you reported someone honor botting av a GM would investigate.
---
What are you saying in your single sentence replies then?  Because there's so much information that I'm obviously missing things.  Your grammar and lack of punctuation makes following your train of thought like tracking a fish.  You can see where it shit but you don't know where it's going.
---
Or a fantastic idea, I was a cleric duskblade who would use a whip to heal people, healing spells were "touch" range, while a whip had a 15 foot reach, and did no damage to anyone who had at least 1 armor, Duskblade allowed me to deliver touch spells though melee attacks. So the joke was "The beatings shall continue until morale improves" was quite literal in that party.
---
And you somehow think it's the A team horde guys that you're beating on a rigged map? 
---
They got exalted and stopped queuing this past weekend too.
---
I think I was there for that comment...
---
I figured you talked levelling and maybe yeah play smart, or AOE mobs to 60 in line 3-4 days /played ezgameezlife type thing
---
Briarwood =/= briarthorn
---
Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!! ...big yikes then. üòÇ
---
Me and my 4 guildies were trying to get to scholo and we we had to corpsewalk from the bridge to the door because it was being camped by ~15 allies.
---
Did we go cry on reddit? Nope, we said "man pvp servers can be rough sometimes" and went on with our day.
---
Sucks that pvp happened to you on a pvp server.
---
I always wanted one of those.
---
It really is baffling, taking FWGY and doing galv then trying to go to drek is the best way to guarantee you or towers burn before clearing the war room and you end up with too many warmasters to kill.  I‚Äôm so confused as to how THIS ended up being the meta no one deviates from.
---
The backdoor can be defended with 1 player because of all the npc in the SP courtyard. The entire horde village is on a different level down a hill from the keep.
---
What defensive advantage does Drek have than Vann doesn't, I'm headed scratching here so please elaborate on their massive differences.
---
Now you get some copy pasta in broken English about how you should use the community to publicly shame the offending players.
---
record your session and post it. i wanna see you finding 5 alli on any non heartseeker server while in queue.
---
They do count extra mana.  You generally avoid getting hit full stop or use gfpps to absorb.
---
I'm really confused by your confusion, I don't know how I can make this any clearer. 
---
This entire thread started because you said 2h sword spec is better than mace in classic because you get more rage, and rage is more scarce in classic than in tbc due to a different formula. 
---
The formula you pasted says absolutely nothing about 2h spec because the "Factor" variable was not listed in the blue post. It is trivial to plot the 2 functions against each for different Factor values and show how rage can be smaller, equal to, or greater than the previous rage formula based on this value. I asked if you knew what this value was since I couldn't find it anywhere, but you responded with nothing of value. 
---
Again I really don't know how to make this more clear, I don't understand what is confusing
---
Lmao
---
Nah, fire lacks the aoe talents that make aoe farming worthwhile.  Good aoe, bad cc.
---
and technically the TBC pre-patch of vanilla still existed in vanilla, yet no one in their right mind could concider that version true vanilla. 
---
They have already picked and chosen what they concider "true vanilla" which is the version they gave to freaking retail, yet they gave us the bastaradized one that was nerfed to hell
---
Yes he gets that he was asking if the individual took the time to fill them out.
---
im at 9 bank alts and i could buy 20+ epic mounts with current prices bitch
---
I love when someone's at 10% and I nature swift healing touch 10 and they're at full hp. 3 min CD is nothing in a BG.
---
I love FF rogue even if they kill me. Just like, enjoy being useless for 45 seconds.
---
ppl doing turn-ins for rep are real mvps got most of my rep that way(also contributed to other ppl rep grinds with my own turn-in spam)
---
Alliance needs a Warchief.  That's why The Horde is better
---
The difference is you did pre xfer research lol
---
You know what's funny? After I relearned alchemy I got the recipe for elixir of frost power and used it. Now I made a ticket and if they are to bring back my old alchemy setup, frost power will be removed. WHY THE FUCK IS THIS GAME SO DAMN CANCEROUS?
---
PvP warfronts would have been like classic AV. Either a rush/stomp or an eternal stalemate shitfest. People would mostly be there for the rewards and the mode would be plagued with afkers/really salty people arguing.
---
Are people really not understanding the joke..?
---
But where? If he is "anti afk" at the entrance, ppl would report you. If you move a bit into the map, I'd argue you would get 15 hk's over 80 hours by accident.
---
Its actually impressive that he got 900k honor w/o 15 hk's.
---
Pretty much how everything in life goes.  Just wing it and wonder why the results sucked vs research and act accordingly with a plan and know why the results were good.
---
Thats bananabar but it was made for the 1.12 client. Not sure if a classic port has been done
---
#nochanges
---
BOED proccing from Mind Vision seems like a bug. The tooltip says it only procs from "landing a damaging spell".
---
But they can‚Äôt stop you.
---
Sweeping strikes doesn't help if you fight one person, or  am I missing something?
---
you asked for a source that rage was changed before cata, i provided this source  
---
2h factor is the same as mainhand, always has been
---
No.
---
That would open the door to character selling and account splitting for power leveling bots.
---
There is an addon called Prat that does it.
---
Isn‚Äôt this common knowledge? It‚Äôs how i farmed my head.
---
My question is. If there is going to be a classic plus, they should already be working on it right? Doesn‚Äôt it take them year(s) to create a new expansion?   Maybe I‚Äôm wrong just curious
---
When you say last 3 are you referring to 302-305? Or 3 points after 305? 
---
Sorry it‚Äôs not entirely clear.
---
It is, this is a troll post not at peak time
---
even if its on the same battle net? Im not talking about transfering subscriptions between two battle net accounts yeah, so i dont really know why that would apply to character selling?
---
That's because "Players policing players" only works in theory, but in practise it always leads to people finding ways to abuse it.
---
Used to work until my new video card. Now alt z brings up the geforce menu
---
also LF invite
---
Yeah ok
---
Since paid transfers happened. You think faction change will?
---
probably should have done the research before you dropped it mate
---
That video sucks. Took you over 20 minutes to finish 2 out of 3 groups of graves. Let alone all the consumables u used jeez

---
What you think?
---
not really, disease is pretty easy to cleanse and it takes a third of priest mana if they done use inner focus before
---
My wife plays on my old secondary account, which is linked to my main so she can use my pets and heirlooms.
---
There is now way to move characters from account B to account A or vice versa.
---
3rd phase you get feared into fire a lot. Saves mana
---
haha get fucked horde
---
Not with paladin and shamans
---
They can, but often don‚Äôt. Or it gets messed up.
---
Something that has a 25% chance of happening is by definition unreliable.
---
But the Ram still costs 700-800g, so if you can afford the Ram you can basically afford an epic mount?
---
You will probably plateau  at rank 7 or 8 or so
---
Because he used account sharing. Pretty simple stuff.
---
Why is it the healers responsibility to deal with all the flame damage in phase 3 when you can just pot and absorb plenty of it. Plus this is a pug we already have yo deal with people taking a mountain of damage in phase 2 or getting deep breathed, etc.
---
There is a reason I topped the healing metres all the time. I stayed alive.
---
Lol you alright my guy?
---
My experience in AV thus far as Alliance is there‚Äôs always 3 people afk in the start zone, 10 people immediately give up before we‚Äôve even reached the mid and go and sit at the DB bunkers the other 27 split and like 5 go to back cap, get shit on, give up on the game and sit at DB as well, the rest of the offense is like 20 people, everyone but like 5 skips TP and IWB for some stupid fucking reason and then they get wiped along the way to the FW GY and also give up and sit in base. 
---
Also there‚Äôs always at least 5 dipshits on offense that hit the god damn commanders every time you cc them and just cap flag.
---
I should‚Äôve clarified. They keep trying to polymorph while in form.
---
It's the exact same thing...
---
Making water is literally the most important thing you can do in a BG to contribute to success.
---
yea except a bunch of other stuff that was out by 1.12 is still not out "because it wasn't out yet" even though we have 1.12 av, 1.12 talents, 1.12 gear itemzations, etc
---
Imagine being so slow you can't kill one single mage lol.
---
I passed on my 2nd win - thought it was common practice to let people who don't have one already get one.
---
Why they let you keep rolling on it is the real question
---
Why would he need to say anything.   You can't trade anything else...  Do your job.
---
Reported
---
Pvp gear is for hardcore players mostly. I would get exalted in AV and then stop.
---
I you play 2-3 hours you should be able to raid, which gets you good gear
---
Once I'm exalted with AV I'm done with bgs, it's so time consuming to even do that.
---
Which I find funny, because Horde kills about 90% of the mobs just for the honor bonuses (and even nothing for a lot of them) yet still wins.
---
Why get exalted?
---
Less "dead" and more "there's no reason to talk with other players until a certain difficulty level of content" I'd assume.
---
15 minute queue.. man, remember when wsg was a 2h queue? I freakin do. but you'd stay in there for hours and hours, racking up hundreds of kills.. those days are over. sad.
---
Rule #7 dude. These are google-able questions.  
---
    
---
Real talk though; Playing 2-3 hours a day you might barely make it to r6 over a long period of time, not a month, but much longer due to the 20% weekly decay. It's not gonna happen and I suggest you don't even get started.
---
wheres that link dog?!
---
The thing is, I already have all the stuff for the breastplate.  Also I just really want it.
---
But thanks for the advice!
---
Been bypassing SP and using the backdoor since last week, and a decent amount of horde do it too.  Directly there after balinda and theres almost always 1 tank, 1 heal and a dps or 2.  Makes it a breeze to cap and keep the aid station, provided some impatient hunter or mage doesnt start pulling marshalls before we have the gy...
---
Exactly that. We had a 6min win as ally.
---
1 hour of premade is worth 3-4 hours of pugs.
---
I know what significant means. I would be surprised if there was even 1% of the playerbase under the age of 18.
---
Wow, you killed four mobs, congratulations.. and now you have to eat.
---
Now imagine being able to kill four mobs, but NOT having to eat, and you understand what it's like to level a feral druid, hunter, or warlock.
---
Also, you're level 30 talking about a discussion of 1-60 levelling. You're not even level 60, lmfao. Rogue gets harder 40-60, all those other classes don't. Which you'd know, if you weren't level 30.....
---
i donated some of each type in each of the cities when i was 59 to help boost myself to 60. Those non-repeatable ones give XP. Beyond that, the repeatable runecloth turn in gives rep (i don‚Äôt think it gives xp tho), which is necessary if you want to ride another factions mount. 
---
the av mount is either a white wolf if you‚Äôre horde or a ram for alliance. it‚Äôs likely being preferable due to being cheaper (640g vs 800g + riding skill) but beyond that is no different
---
that rep grind is about to suck for everyone that hasn't started yet. the longer AV is out, the longer the queue will be and the longer the games will get. once AB comes out, you may as well kiss exalted goodbye.
---
Because they don‚Äôt want you. It‚Äôs an in crowd.
---
Hush! Don't give out the secrets of our trade.
---
It is not their obligation to carry you to exalted when they all got their 100% speed mount. I recommend putting in the minimal effort required to buy the mount if you want to play with these people.
---
It‚Äôs funny cause they posted the exact thing last week
---
I got rank 13 as a priest. I‚Äôd run premades on double honor weekends and when I got burnt out. But mostly just spammed AV.
---
Why do rogue players all feel so personally attacked when they get told other classes 1-60 faster than them?
---
Lmaoooo
---

Should I worry about gold generation end-game as a deciding factor for picking a class? I'm trying to decide between my druid and my hunter (both in their 30's), and am slightly leaning towards druid due to the role diversity and lack of gear competition. However, hunters can generate gold so much better than druids endgame without relying on professions, and they seem fun in their own regard.
---
If gold wasn't an issue, I would likely choose druid, especially since I want to get my epic mount as soon as possible. Is this a valid concern, or is farming gold and getting your epic mount at 60 a relatively easy task anyway?
---
and weapons TUF, lobo, all the caster offhands
---
How much FR should a ranged dps have for Molten Core? (I'm a mage)
---
Very true
---
ew
---
Your fault for choosing horde though.
---
Congrats!! :) look how polite and positive I am :)))
---
you clearly missed the part where I was literally in the middle of fighting someone
---
Oh, the queue times speeding up from cross-server bgs makes sense. They should really change it back to an earlier version then to compensate for it. I don't see what the huge problem is, I can't think of anyone who would be upset if they reverted the 1.11 changes at least.
---
Yes it took horde a day to counter go right. So alliance counter with go left, then it took another day for horde adapt. So we alliance adapted again from drek rush to galv rush. You rush galv then head to frostwolf and hold it till it caps instead of rushing relief hut. Both sides adapt just because your battlegroup hasn't adapted well doesn't mean the alliance as a whole haven't.
---
it's a pretty "2005" tradition. Everyone has to do the same 60 levels, and 58 of them are not significant.
---
Not my art - scene is from Hazbin Hotel on Youtube
---
Open world has been pretty mellow since BGs
---
biggest difference is that horde adapted.They didnt defend at all first few days just zerg rush and let ally win! AV games are completely different now Alliance player didnt change.
---
on gehennas atleast feels like its full no matter when i go there, got arcane crystal and blue gem or w/e its called on one tap few days ago tho, free 90g
---
Name something better
---
The two felguards at the front of dark whisper gorge can be soloed by a priest
---
Drinking vodka from a coffee mug is key in this situation
---
/me prays there's an answer
---
Yeah for me its honestly just taking back Frostwold GY makes a big difference in slowing the ally down. Most ally just zerg it and leave no one to defend it 90% in my games.
---
It would probably be faster to farm 160g than grind exalted though.
---
hell naw, the new meta of defending at galv is awesome. im only in it for the rep so honor per hour is irrelevant. id rather enjoy some pvp while rep trickles in. 
---
i respecced soul link and its insane. i can tank 2 rogues/warr with a healer. they cant chew through 4.8k hp, void shield, HS, AV health pot
---
Don't worry, horde are still pretty trash.
---
But on the other hand, Alliance were not "so much better" at the beginning either, they just benefited from the asymmetrical AV balance to rush ahead in their grind.
---
Yes, please!
---
Some guy called me the 'a brainless n-word' because I wouldn't give him more than two stacks of food. So now no one gets anything :/
---
Was going for my 3rd bag last sunday and lost with a 99 :(
---
I actually didnt hear about mt until this year (2019), I've always used wc for wrong chat
---
Wholesome. Thanks for sharing!
---
Cheers
---
No idea why dps thinks it can outrun mobs. Only running they should be doing is to the tank, anything else is just making everyone‚Äôs lives harder.
---
I don't think they were implying that's the only spells you would cast....
---
If gearing a mage is a nightmare. What about warrior compared¬ø
---
You have become the very thing you swore to destroy
---
Atiesh is like 70% ally!
---
You should have seen Tarren Mill, it was a massacre
---
Can't figure out why guilds run logs for classic? Every boss is deleted
---
Big thing here is the RX bottle in the corner.
---
The difference is the alliance advantages are in place to more or less benefit a mindless horde, but the horde advantages need some real deliberate know-how to take advantage of.
---
Drek isn't really easier to defend, though.
---
anyone left to do AV now is a bunch of shitters
---
How else?
---
i approve of the vodka
---
Really? The highest ranking players achieving the highest ranks by running premades isn‚Äôt the vanilla experience? And on what server did you play?
---
&gt; so there were real in-game consequences to not working together with your fellow PvP rankers.
---
And then the PvErs of your server who didn't give a shit about PvP ranking, who happened to have that one guy who seemed to always be on 24/7 in BGs mucking up the pvp rankers, and ending up R14 before people because their character ..just existed, and only during X time to Y time he actually talked, and the rest was just a mute.. and also was a little worse at the game.
---
Need those legal meds once in a while
---
Snitch
---
Not with +1000 people lol.
---
yep, all it took was about 12 hours to get exalted with the day 1 rushes.
---
Yes with that many people. It can be as simple as must have X rating on retail or be a friend of a friend.
---
Well, many is probably not too true, they are rare to see, as you had to be what, b13+ per week? Something like that, so less than 1% of all pvpers.
---
If you've ever played those COOP X hero siege maps in War3.. basically think that, sort of?
---
I just buy them.
---
[Here you go](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c_MHIkMhSfc&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=216)
---
&gt;AV lasted several hours
---
That's a bit of a lie. Most AVs took 30-60 minutes. Sometimes, you'd have one take closer to 2 hours, but it was relatively rare (maybe 20% of the time). Once every few days, you might get one that took 3-4 hours, but that only happened during off-peak hours because both factions had 10-15 AFKs so neither faction was able to finish it.
---
What's comical is that people think 1.5 AV would be different. Private servers say otherwise. Instead of 7 min AV premades, you'd get 10 min AV premades. That's about it.
---
No class in classic is mechanically difficult.
---
I believe there‚Äôs a way to make a weak aura for queues pop and if so‚Äîyou could add sounds and big text warnings for it. I‚Äôd say start there
---
No problem. Discord is pretty amazing. There‚Äôs a lot of stuff you can do.
---
I would imagine a higher proportion of PVE players are interested in the leveling experience rather than endgame and that‚Äôs where hunter shines
---
Lmao wat.
---
Doesn't warden scan your computer and check all the processes running. Pretty sure they can detect it but IDK if it would say anything other than steam or google chrome etc.
---
Spell batching.  If you cast slam when your swing timer has equal or less time till your next auto attack.  They both go off at once.
---
I'm playing Classic because I can't be bothered with the carrot on a stick that is retail.
---
I want to play as I did in TBC-MoP.
---
* Log 3-4 times a week.
---
* Once to raid.
---
* Once or twice to play some arenas
---
* Once or twice to do whatever I want : farming, professions, dungeons or random BGs
---
The one thing I hate the most about retail WoW is that it forces you to log in. Every. Fuckin. Day.
---
Imagine thinking that all knowledge is common knowledge when you aren't even an astrophysicist lul
---
I love it too, I‚Äôve had some crazy defends against an entire team as a rogue. Sometimes they just don‚Äôt noticed you deleting their healers while they fight galv
---
In the first few days when we didn't have this 20min average game length shit, Alliance were hitting exalted from scratch in 13-14 hours. And they never did Galv.
---
Horde won't play like they did then though, because their queue times have gone from 2mins to 16+ thanks to more alliance hitting exalted and stopping. But the point remains that your best honor/hour in a pug is definitely to rush the end boss and have an 8 minute game. (A more organized semi-premade can both split off 5 for Galv and rush Drekk, but that's usually too much to ask in a pug.)
---
I made a bar with Doninoes add on too small because I thought there‚Äôs a reset button but I cannot find one. Any one know what to do?
---
[Big oof](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/ecldkw/current_state_of_flamelash/fbci9t9)
---
Only reason to pool rage is for burst like youre saying but thats only helpful against a healer and the healer needs to be decently geared for you to even care to do that. 99.9% of the time, you just use abilities as you get rage to do so.  
---
  
---
The reason you *dont* want to pool rage is so you can switch stances when its necessary. If they dodge and you want to switch to op but are sitting at 80 rage with ms already on cd, youre going to waste a ton of rage switching even if you are to ww first.
---
&gt;Yeah this needs to be sorted out. Though I care less about the premades than I do about these fucked up queues.
---
Then you are playing the wrong faction. Everyone knew alliance would have instant queues, and horde would have cancer queues.
---
‚ÄúAlliance‚Äù
---
i just did a lot of scholo runs and asked my group to let me need on every green  scourgestones. since i am a tank they had no problem with it and i got very fast to exalted
---
Yeah its the games fault
---
Which guild?
---
Well, zg gives a 18 slot and so does nax quests. So kinda? Standard is that you pass until everyone had one, then you begin again.
---
You get a rank based on your honor compared to the honor of everyone else on your server and faction. Based on which percentile you land in, you get Ranking Points. These points decay by 20% every week.
---
So if you get 5000 Ranking Points every week, you have 5000 after the first week, then 20% decay -&gt; then you have 4000, get 5000, have 9000, 20% decay -&gt; 7200, get 5000, 20% decay -&gt; 9760 etc. 
---
At some point you'll end up having 25000 Ranking Points (Rank 7), 20% decay -&gt; 20000, you make 5000 and you're back to 20000.  
---
At that point you give up or go harder.
---
not pictured: the absolute clusterfuck of horde at the warmasters
---
My guild is giving out....BOXING DAY PRESENTS! 
---
Good drama to have.
---
Horde queue atm is minimum 15 minutes, sometimes 18-19min. Getting worse by the day.
---
Did the same. It does amazing things for your sanity.
---
It really is a net loss on time spend. Unless you enjoy speed running.
---
&gt;The backdoor can be defended with 1 player because of all the npc in the SP courtyard.
---
You don't even need npcs, 2 mages spamming blizzard rank 1 can hold off a backdoor
---
Sure.  But the point of two differen't AVs wouldn't be about ranking.
---
If you plan on just killing mobs to level, with a few quests or dungeons, you'll get decent gear from drops. You won't have to rely on buying gear.
---
Be aware though, depending on the mobs you kill, your bag space will run low and you'll have to run back to town/camp quite often, but if you're only playing 1 or 2 hours, you'll be good.
---
oh yeah you def have no idea about shit
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/e8zykz/retail_has_actually_a_better_av_than_classic_did/fafpr0n/
---
&gt;AV games will change a lot in a week. It happened on every single private server. Once people are exalted they will defend because that's where the pvp is and without a massive zerg rushing many groups will wipe.
---
The real question not so much how you didn't predict this weeks ago like others but how you still can't accept it even now. It's not some big secret or anything and you somehow stick your head and in sand and pretended like it has something to do with faction... Unless you're talking about difference in queues both factions have the same amount of try hards, casuals, and afks...you just can't see the other side as easily.
---
Life pro tip: No one is out to get you, people are for themselves. No one owes you anything, just play the game and have fun.
---
Think of it from their point of view. They've probably lost 16 of the past 17 games they played, and often getting dismounted and killed means your separated from the group and now are a "straggler" who spends the rest of the game getting picked off trying to get to their team. I'd be like, hah no thanks and just keep running too.
---
I don‚Äôt recall this happening at all in vanilla, but it‚Äôs a huge issue right now with people trying to rank.
---
In vanilla the best honor/hr was WSG, and being in a productive premade would make games twice as fast and 90%+ win rate.  This meant you got 3-4x honor per unit of time investment as compared to the average random queue player.  For the ‚Äúthat one‚Äù PvE player to screw over rankers, they would have to be playing 3x more at a minimum.  If the rankers are playing 8 hours/day, there is not enough time in a day for a solo queue player to catch up.
---
In the current meta, however, the one and only measure of honor (outside of RNG of getting into fast games), is time investment.  Ranker, PvE hero, zero-talent keyboard turning clicker, or keyboard macro that clicks the space bar every 30 seconds - all are rewarded more or less the same as far as ranking is concerned.
---
I assume so, since no one can prep before AV queuing
---
I like how windSEEKER is spelled  In German
---
Warmfix
---
&gt;we'd be seeing the same 90% loss rate on alliance as we are now.
---
I don't know what kind of games are you playing but my win rate today was 93.5%
---
You don't even need any of the PvP gear if you raid.  Obviously there are some exceptions but it's mostly useless.  You get some okay stuff at r12 but like, it's hardly worth the effort over MC epics, if even.
---
There were A LOT of people holding on tight to ‚ÄúBGs wIL bE CrOss REaLm‚Äù a month ago lol
---
&gt;Does the advantage that hunters have here (gearing out much quicker) outweigh them theoretically not scaling well?
---
If you're asking if you can outpace their scaling with good gear, no. Even receiving less drops overall they still out-dps hunters.
---
That being said, hunters are fine throughout the entirety of classic. There were hunters in the world first naxx clear.
---
&gt;Another one I know of has said that if you don't have 109% speed (mount, carrot, spurs, gloves), your entire   
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;guild will be blacklisted.
---
This honestly seems a little harsh :D
---
Habs fan hell yea!!
---
I wouldn't worry about it too much tbh, alchemy is a good money maker, you can just buy them with gold made from other pots or herbs.
---
Sour skittles.
---
Interesting. Is it everything after BWL where they fall off?
---
As a hunter you are mostly there to pull for the tank and use tranq shot, a tranq bot if you will.
---
wow, there are 18 months in a year?
---
Hunter's don't even compete with war/rogues now. You don't play hunter for the mad DPS.
---
Ram costs 800g, 720g with honored discount (which you have ofc), 640g with honored and rank3.
---
Normal mount is 1000g - 900g, 800g. 
---
So it's 160-180g cheaper depending if you're rank 3 or not (I assume people are honored with their home faction).
---
Alliance quest for the trinket. Nothing to complain about.
---
:(
---
your racials are rigged, so it evens out. back to the hut.
---
&gt;horde has better PvP racials so it might be that most competent PvP players went horde side.
---
Judging from how many full raids tried to stop us at IB GY and got rolled up alongside their elite npcs I wouldn't say that's true.
---
Queues for BGs? Thats something I haven't experienced since 2006 :O
---
&gt; but did all you guys think we were all lying when we tried to say the vanilla wow honor system was total shit
---
You're lying now when you pretend this is the vanilla honor system.  Vanilla required winning WSG and AB to rank.
---
That's what I'm saying, nexus Crystal's are valued at around 25g when stabilized. 
---
My guild does gold bids on items nobody needs and they are stored on a disenchanting alt for when they can be D/Ed and distributed accordingly.
---
For Horde.  For Alliance you will play 3 games in that time and easily come out ahead.
---
An hour in a pug? There's optimistic and there's what you are on.
---
The chance of alliance victory is directly proportional to the number of 100% mounts on your side.
---
Those were the times when we had funny content without meme vomit. It got worse once the concept of memes became more clearly defined between 2011-2012.
---
&gt;when to pull WM etc.
---
Never. You never pull WM, you can literally pull Drek alone and keep him near entrance for the raid to kill.
---
Swifty is not in the discord with the hardcore raiders, why would he? The one being referred to is the one with members of Apes, Progress and that sort of players topping the raid rankings
---
I dunno what you mean by "fall off," even in MC they aren't as good as the "good" dps. The trend just continues.
---
Check our server discord
---
k
---
seent
---
There is no way to rack up even twice the honor we get in a 8 mins game, even if you go up to 16.
---
k, fixed it.
---
I mean... Okay, i fixed it.
---
It's not???
---
You need a leader calling out the shots.
---
Usually capping IB GY is bad, because then Horde respawns at FW ahead of you.
---
But today a couple times they actually challenged us at IB so we had to cap it, cause the whole horde raid respawning there would've wiped us. Instead, they respawned at FW so we had time to rec, ress deads, and wipe them again.
---
you are popping consumes and using engi if you're serious at all about getting maximum honor per hour
---
Lol nooo. PST means Please Send Tell. aka whisper me. It doesnt mean *psssstttt* like youre calling a cat over :P
---
Yet my rank is probably higher than you, the irony :)
---
Yes tbh Activision is a greedy company wouldn't surprise me if they try to milk classic and force the devs to make that a reality.
---
Serves you right.
---
&gt;OR sufficiently geared tanks and healers to tank all the warmasters AND drek at the same time while the raid burns Drek down.
---
You don't pull 3 out of the 4 warmasters. If you have all warmasters running around is because of dumb shits fucking up the pull.
---
You dog you. Only took Reddit 30 minutes to defile a pleasant Christmas card! Lol
---
Don't forget shadoweave set my man
---
Reported for reporting
---
The fact that it reduces the aggregate number of stuns doesn't make it reliable.
---
You can't plan around it and you can't predict it. At 25% (30% total) a literal coin-flip is more reliable than it.
---
You might resist 3 stuns in a fight, you might go multiple fights without resisting a single one.
---
Personally I've never resisted a cheapshot because I'm just that unlucky---But on the flipside there's certainly somebody out there who claims that they resist 9 out of 10 cheap-shots and I believe them, because RNG is RNG and RNG is very often feast or famine.
---
Again, it's a strong effect over the course of a BG---But it's only reliable if you have a shit definition of the word reliable.
---
&gt; I also think that valuing one power specific to dwarf priests over a racial active that costs no mana, works against more than fear, and is available to any class isn't fair.
---
First off, I only compared the two in terms of Priest versus Priest 1v1 and in that situation Fear Ward beats WotF because priests have no charm/sleep and only 1 fear every 30 seconds so while both the undead and the dwarf can ignore the first fear, if the fight drags on longer than 30 seconds only the Dwarf can ignore the second fear.
---
Second, Undead cannot be shamans, druids, hunters, or paladins so WotF is only available to half the classes in the game but fear ward can be cast on whoever the dwarf chooses so technically speaking, if either of the two have a claim to being available to every class it's fear ward (even shamans can technically get it, by way of mind control despite being impractical and basically just a tidbit of trivia.)

Im soloing jump runs with just mining atm, probably gonna drop engi for herbalism soon to maximize profit

It‚Äôs cute you wrote all this, but completely ignore the substance of my post which you yourself do not even deny:
---
It will get easier
---
People have already started to hit their goals and retire, others will burn out, etc all contributing to... an easier time hitting your desired rank
---
Feel free to write another essay that in no way disagrees with anything I‚Äôve written
---
Oh and yes it will be easier in feb and march and April etc maybe not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù but where did I type that it would ever be ‚Äúeasy‚Äù? That was all you bud.
---
Imagine not doing AV in a premade
---
Wait really?? I‚Äôve been going on the ledge in P3 since the first week of raiding Onyxia and it only happened this time
---
Alliance side?
---
And I won 29 out of 31 today, your point being?
---
Lmao who upvoted this retarded comment?
---
Just wait until more and more go outside and camp the world again, it doesn‚Äôt take long until enough people realize they can farm honor in queue to advance even further.. I‚Äôm sure, if queues get up to like 30 minutes, the open world will be a shit show again.
---
They're both shit. Not doing classic progressively was the dumbest fucking thing.
---
If they do the same to TBC I'll just play a private server.
---
I just hop into AV and run into the money if I need shards tbh
---
Lock all orbs. People fall for that shit. If you'd offer 80g Tank service without rolling on anything, people would laugh at you. However, some really intelligent dudes gladly join your all orbs locked group, which will net up to 120g.
---
It's sad, but I see warriors doing this every day for months now and it seems like they still get groups.
---
On the other hand, if you're not an asshole, professions can net good profits. Both, gathering and producing professions can work, but LW and BS can be really tough. BS at least has (had) a chance for Lionheart recipe luck. Without any use of professions or your character, "simple" trading has the possibility for the highest profits, but it'll require you to spend much of your time on the AH.
---
I was playing vanilla before too and no one has ever explained this to me and I always thought it was pssst/whisper. Lol you just blew my mind!
---
transfer to a lower pop realm and you wont need to play as much, or wait until most already got rank 10 so then you can climb ranks easier
---
lol that's not true, this has obvious technical solutions. There are some good suggestions in this thread.
---
He was unaware PepeLaugh
---
I thought PST was a whisper sound until just now :(((
---
Why don't you just go there and have a look? NPCs there are non-elites so just hit one of the allies who afk near the vendors and see what happens.
---
I like you, you can count.
---
I like you, you can count!
---
Lol!! Wow im waiting 16 mins now
---
Everyone down voting is clearly not a mage, were not charities and you would get annoyed too being asked multiple times every battle ground, Or every few minutes for a portal in capital cities; time is money friends!
---
That's the spec I use I use &amp; I'm the #1 on the server. Idk why more people aren't using it.
---
Why pass up Omen of Clarity?!  I mean it's not god tier or anything but it's a hell of a lot more useful than improved enrage?  Or whatever 34th point you take in Feral?

Just need to tab in long enough to use your recall and run into Dreks room.
---
trying to read what the prescription is for, can't quite make it out.
---
Funny thing is this works to complete your quests in shimmering flats which is full of horde bots on my server (incendius). But when I got to arathi highlands the 3 bots I tried this with would ignore the mob and move on once it‚Äôs tagged before them. Two different zones two different bot programs. Makes you wonder.
---
Farm crystals if you‚Äôre a miner. There are outdoor routes where you barely ever dismount to fight a mob. Tons of cash if you have a good route and can farm when it‚Äôs not crowded.
---
Cooking and fishing
---
The 1st week should be the worst of it, since you had a ton of people going hard to get exalted.
---
Then why are you playing classic? The entire purpose of classic is to relive the game as it was, if you want the rediculous ticket system  filled 3 minute av that skips half of the mechanics, literally go back to retail, where they changed it exactly for you.
---
careful still a lot of horde players claiming instant queues cause they too butthurt
---
That Add-on works for shit. We still end up all spread out across battlegrounds.
---
why would it be sorted out. you chose the wrong faction
---
This happens to me all the time, the rogue I was saving will vanish into thin air, never to be seen again.
---
Alright alright. You got me there.
---
not hard if you raid log
---
Is pyrewood a bad realm? I've leavled up to 23 but all player interactions i've had have all been terrible. Either dont want to group up for killing quests or come and steal chests
---
If I found the most dead server and transferred over for easy R14 then transferred back, would this work or is there anything I'm missing? The server I'm looking at has 40 people on my faction online right now.
---
It does. I use /tell to send whispers :p
---
yea
---
we just roll for it but you only get 1 till the 39 other people also have 1
---
Is the Chief‚Äôs Enforcer a decent upgrade on Ravager for warriors or should I vendor it? I‚Äôm level 49.
---
Dollar Store Grobbulus
---
It's cause Alliance don't care about PvP
---
Everyone just did it for Exalted now all that's left is people that still need it and don't care and a small few that actually care
---
Piss on xp bar like a man showing your dominance
---
No its not. People can just buy water beforehand. Cheapskates.
---
Hit is king until you‚Äôre capped
---
Gloves for sure. The 5pc just helps with thistle tea timing and energy pooling. Think of fights like rag and geddon where you back out, it all adds up.
---
Gloves + 2pc bf + 5pc ns is your end game for this phase.
---
Personally, I queue in Hillsbrad area, ride over to EP, and farm herbs for 5-10 minutes until the queue pops. Or, queue in Orgrimmar, and farm herbs in Azshara.
---
I'm on benediction as a druid and between a pretty active guild and being able to tank or heal groups are pretty easy to find. Good tip instead of saying lfg if you're dps say Lfm, people will message you quick.
---
&gt; Watch Asmon or Swiftly, they're not good players, but they're at least entertaining enough when the content isn't.
---
PvP wise, both of these are true in that they're not great/good.
---
Swifty's claim to fame was all the warrior macros a lot of the old warriors were rocking, and everyone seen it, Dudes still a pretty wholesome guy all in all.
---
Asmon.. I'm pretty sure in the past he's said he wasn't a pvper after he started to get really big in streaming.
---
I'm talking about going form 305 to 308.
---
Glancing penalty at 300WS is 35% reduced damage. Every point of weapon skill after 300 reduces that penalty by 4% until you reach a cap of 5% reduction.
---
301=31%
---
302=27%
---
303=23%
---
304=19%
---
305=15%
---
306=11%
---
307=7%
---
308=5%
---
Weapon skill also affects hit chance. The first 5 points are worth .4% hit chance each and if your weapon skill is more than 10 points lower than your targets defense level your first 1% hit from gear is ignored. After the first 5 WS is worth .1% hit per point. So 305 lowers yellow hit cap from 9 to 6 and you don't go from 6 to 5 until 315.

Quick question, because it happened recently.
---
You‚Äôre already subscribed to the /lfg and /world channels right?
---
PvE and PvP? That was phased out for "Normal" servers.
---
Sword gets two swings instead of a useless stun proc maybe
---
No u
---
No it doesn't
---
I'm not an OG hunter, but
---
The only clue you get is from the quest description, "If you had to take a guess, you would say this leaf came from something ancient and powerful."
---
During your travels, you encounter beings called "Ancients" which are giant trees. So assuming you didn't totally miss these guys while leveling, this is a pretty big hint that you're looking for one of those.
---
The expectation, I suppose, is that you check everywhere you remember seeing Ancients (and probably ask your guild if they remember seeing any ancients that you might have missed) to see if one of them wants the leaf. Probably easier for Horde, because most ancients are Alliance-affiliated, so that narrows their list down. If all else fails, I guess you just start checking obscure corners of forested zones to try to find an Ancient somewhere.

Happened to me once. Never tried again.

Reported for reporting a report
---
Yes you will plateau at around rank 5-6 if the amount of playing you plan to do only made rank 2 your first week.
---
Your rating decays by a percentage of your total rating every week, meaning the decay is larger as your rank gets higher.
---
actually its implied to mean immediately, in software terms.
---
You think you want it, but you don't.
---
Honestly the dps difference will be so minimal you wont notice, use the epic if you want to flex epics use the dagger skills one if you want to theoretically max dps
---
The Immovable Object is a fuckin great shield too.
---
You're 21st on that log.  Locks are a support class.  Doing your supporting duties is more important than DPS.
---
I think most "pro" pvpers went  horde since they supposedly have best pvp racials. Leaving the good ally pvpers tuck with lots of noobs
---
BFD was my first dungeon. It wasn't until my second dungeon that I realized you don't get a buff and a free teleport to your capital city just for finishing the run.
---
Swifty is just a big ole' teddy bear too, his streams are the opposite of the toxic stuff that comes out of most big streamers.

Deathcoil can be dispelled.

BWL is way off, and the chest piece is a 12% drop off ebonroc.

They don't sell this type of new amsterdam around here... im jelly.
---
You can simulate it. Crit is nowhere near 20 spellpower. With my setup, with world buffs, crit is worth 11,63 SP. Without world buffs it jumps to 14,84 SP.
---
That's with 700 spellpower with consumables which should heavily favor crit.
---
There are sheets in the Warlock discord that use Excel, or you can use Guybrush's for a google docs alternative.

Still grates on me when I see 'please pst'
---
Chief Enforcer's better but doesn't have a specialization in the arms tree.
---
I recently joined a good with epgp system. So much better
---
I did not know this i jsut joined to play with friends and i got more hooked then they did
---
It's BIS for warriors. It's Pre-raid BIS for hunters.
---
Warriors don't have a better upgrade until AQ40 and then you have to compete with 5-9+ other DPS warriors for your chest. Hunters can get their "BIS" in MC and you only have to compete with a couple other hunters.
---
A simple fix is to never bring someone who's going to roll on the SGC. You can 2 man it so there's no reason to.
---
&gt; paladins so WotF is only available to half the classes in the game
---
Like 75% of every server is Warriors, Mages, Rogues, and Priests
---
Dwarf Priest have Fear Ward, which needs mentioning.  I'd argue it's stronger in some ways than WoTF, although more limited.  There's at least one Dwarf Priest in every WSG though.
---
You're overstating the usefulness of Cannibalize and Blood Fury in PvP... but I'll allow it.  You forgot two equally useful Alliance racials though:
---
Shadowmeld is a solid ability in WSG and AB.
---
Perception is less useful in Classic than it was in Vanilla, since way fewer people seem to be playing Rogues, but it still trivializes them.
---
I do agree that Horde Racials are slightly better in PvP, but it isn't that big of a difference.
---
Bruh, do you realize there were NO caster + damage gear until MC gear? Now casters showing up with  a BUNCH of damage. Just THAT alone shows you how different itemization is. Plus MC is actually nerfed in this version if I remember correctly.
---
You get free Naxxramas attunement.
---
This guy AFKs
---
No smart, hit stuff gud
---
lol
---
Pink?
---
Yep. Anyone that thinks otherwise has no clue.
---
There is more to it as well. Because less and less alliance began queueing, it just wasn't worth it for horde anymore to give alliance the easy win. I mean during the first day, people literally said "Kill Balinda and Lieutennants and let alliance win". Almost no Horde player even tried to win the matches. 
---
As queues got longer it wasn't worth it anymore to wait 15 minutes for a 7 minute game with 3k honor and 200 rep. So instead it became a "Def and then win".
---
Still doesn't make it available to every class
---
Aside from that using a Howl wolf instead of a kamikaze pet is a DPS loss.
---
Seems like we are of similar mind that gear with +int and a few key feral pieces does well against mages. Personally I like to use my resto gear which is mostly pre-raid BIS and 4 piece of T1. For feral pieces ill throw on devilsaur or slaghide of monkey and blademaster, bonecrusher or impervious giant, don julio ring, possibly unforgiven mask. Usually just that with my healing gear. Ive tried various mixes of gear but ultimately I find the highest lvl/hard stat gear like T1 is good for PVP. Having a big manapool to constantly shapeshift and heal keeps me alive a lot better than full feral unless im against a rogue/warrior. I keep all sets on me at all times which SUCKS for inv space but being able to go full tank, full healer, and a mix of dps/pvp/resist gear feels good to have all the options. With my full mitigation set on I have about 40 pieces of gear in my inv still. Also have some items in the bank like MCPs and alternative gear I may use at some point
---
A mage in my group did this ~2 months ago, we ended up wiping haha
---
I haven't seen a single pve-AV yet. Is reddit being hyperbolic as usual or is the meta different on american servers?
---
Horde's goal is also to increase the time a game takes in the first place. It is better for honor and for rep to play a 20 minute game regardless whether we lose or win.
---
Now tell me, is it harder to be in the top 0,1% of a small server or a big server?
---
Why so?
---
Yeah plus you know...all the people who got it in vanilla.
---
Quest
---
It was my first time doing ZF and the video included a failed attempt.

I bet you're one of these people struggling to do it at 60 anyway lol

He's truly outrageous!

---
We will miss you. Menethil is running around IF talking about being the only remaining ret. it‚Äôs complete madness.
---
Cloth donations give you rep for the faction which you need if you want to ride their mount. Though nowadays AV turn ins are much better in getting rep.
---
I have a mage alt (hunter main as well) and honestly I wouldnt go with it. Yeah sure its easy, but raiding is incresibly boring and thus post 60 you'll most likely stop playing. Gearing is really contested and tedious, and you are just playing another overpopulated class. You dont need it for money either seeing as you main hunter. So whats really left?
---
Alliance/horde, yeah
---
\[GM\] was way worse than \[warrior tank officer\]. I didn't hear what went down, but I've known him for months and he's always been good around me. I think he just had a meltdown. But I don't really know, since I wasn't there for it.
---
Good fucking Thrall, this is a damn good video sir!
---
More of a warning really.
---
Can we get a clip of an alliance streamer exploiting the queue system to force AV games to open and get 30 people from a myriad of servers into one game for fast 7 minute wins?
---
Especially when the site in the OP states, "I made some maps".
---
No you didn't.
---
In case anyone else was wondering like I was, [Sch√ºtzenb√§nder](https://de.classic.wowhead.com/item=18296) is the [Marksman's Bands](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18296) BOE from DM East.
---
i would say both are hard initially but on smaller servers ranking in a year would be easier compared to large servers.
---
way easisr to backet stack orginaze with 3 people vs 30

This helped.

---
On the flip side, why do alliance rush? You already know the answer. Its the same for horde.
---
I grinded to exalted on 2 characters in the first 5 days. I was planning to take it easy on the second one, but I noticed the queues getting longer and longer (horde side) so I rushed the second one as well.
---
From our side, I could clearly see a difference between day 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. In the beginning, we tried to do the same thing you do. Rush and win on speed. It just can't be done. The alliance has a much easier path. On top of that, you don't need to queue as long as we do - so you get twice as many games in the same time to get practise. Day 1 was an emberassment for us.
---
By the second day we had 2 things happening in each game:
---
1. Instead of going for the win, we were trying to maximize the rep/honor per game. That means splitting up, pulling and kiting every lieutenant and commander to Balinda, where we kill them all in a big pile it only takes about 10 people realizing this strategy and the other 30 will help with killing. Even if we lose, that's 3,5k of bonus honor and a bunch of reputation per game.
---
2. People started calling to use the insignia to port back and hold off the alliance. Which failed every time.
---
Day 3: More capable defense teams started forming. Games went from 10 minutes to 20. Many horde discovered the back entrance to the alliance base, skipping the bridge. Whenever a team of 5 makes it in there, it's undefended. They can cap the graveyard and keep killing archers while the main force trickles in. A group of 15 people is enough to kill Vann.
---
Day 4: You would think Horde got even better at this point, but it didn't really. Many good players got exalted and left. I was on my second character, so I wanted to make the most of the time not being in queue. I would ask the RL for assist every game, spam a macro with some tactics, fix groups for windfury, etc. But the forward team would be just those 5 people, and the rest would trickle in very slowly.
---
A lot more Horde went defense because they just wanted to use their non-queue time to farm as much honor as they could. As a result, the Alliance started to fail their zerg rush every game. We started seeing many more 40+ min games and even the occasional Ice Lord being summoned, which would end the game at 50+ minutes.
---
Day 5 was the same. I hit exalted on my second character, left and haven't done an AV since.
---
For the  Horde!
---
wait are you talking about killing people *inside* AV? ofc you hunt for solo kills in AV. im talking about finding people in between queues. which you consistently wont. 1 solo kill per queue is already a rare find
---
People are big mad about it
---
Dude, yes.  I have been a part of numerous hunter duos stopping horde backdoor rushes for long enough for the alliance raid to win.
---
YO CAN I GET A LINK TO YOUR FULL BLOG?!
---
The idea of expecting people to know BIS for other classes and consider LONG term benefit is stupid
---
You can love classic but hate parts of it. It was not perfect in 2005 and 8snt perfect now.
---
Alliance only way to win or get close to one is 40man premade over voice-com. Sad but true.
---
Nice setup. Except that trash  Horde character

I still haven't played an av but it seems ridiculous that all of the hardcore allies finished their rep already by rushing drek , and the remaining players decided it wasn't the correct strategy.   Consider that 60% of players are horde, 60% of redittors are probably going to downvote rush drek and upvoted don't rush drek on top of alliance that don't like drek rushing
---
Nothing. You can *maybe* find some wpvp while you wait on av queues by going out and gathering but it will be sparse. Im on the same boat as you though, i wanted to just do some casual wsg pvp but youre just asking to run into premades, honestly i think blizz needs to make it so only parties of 5 or less can queue for wsg and to get around the trick alli use for av, make it so more people from your server cant join after those 5 slots.  
---
Beyond that fix, which still has the xrealm premade issue, we can only hope that after those that are grinding for r14 get it, it alleviates the premades. Otherwise.. game will be fucked for me personally as I only came to play classic to bg with friends but I dont have enough that stuck around to fill 10 slots. So we'll see how it plays out in a month? 2? Idk how long it takes for those who are r10 now to hit 14, but assuming they fall off it will make things better.
---
Havent been to av lately
---
I hope it was worth it for that asshole!  That same guild he left high n dry is better than ever :)
---
Man, I love the community in classic. Only had a single bad encounter. Everyone is SO accommodating and helpful. Everyone agrees to finish escort quests in dungeons, and even if they say they gotta go soon, they stick with it. It's something special just to have that again.
---
I am not ashamed at how hard I giggled at this as a 30 year old man.
---
im 99% sure that epics that dropped before nexus crystals are released wont DE into them.
---
Warriors compete with rogues on some things, but most of who they compete against are other warriors. Mages compete with warlocks and cheeky shadow priests/ boomkins. Warriors are still difficult to gear though.
---
fucking zappyboi over here
---
Why does it matter? There are still going to be raid slots available for hunter, sure you won't top the dps but so what? None is expecting you to top the meters because your class simply doesn't do that. Try to beat other hunters instead.
---
Druids can farm gold by 2manning DM tribute with a rogue.
---
I would definitely consider the ability to make gold when picking your class, but basically any class has some really good money maker like druid tribute runs. It's not all as crazy as hunter, but as long as you know some good methods you will be fine in that aspect.
---
I don't even disagree with you, but this is Reddit. This is the content people want to see.
---
It's not like there's actual theorycrafting or gameplay discussion here, it's just shitposting and memes.
---
If he wants to PVE as DW fury, it sucks, but he will need edgemasters. If he doesn‚Äôt get it, he will be middle of the road DPS.
---
You say you are preraid bis while not having done the endgame dungeons? Somethinf is wrong there.
---
Seems to work just fine for me. You have to not move and *not have moved in the last server tick and not move for the next server tick*. Then it works every time (that it isn't resisted). So if you are someone who does the "run merrily along, hit FD, then after 7 milliseconds continue on your merry way" method of FD, that ain't gonna work.
---
Something in between.
---
Having a decent rage pool at all times is a good idea. And waiting until you get crit(enrage) to unleash your rage is a good thing too. However if the player you are attacking is likely to get healed, perhaps throwing up and early mortal strike is a good idea.
---
Would fall under griefing. Not saying they have banned someone for it but they could.
---
after the burial god
---
Unless you count the 50% attack speed 3 time use mace from gnomeregan you can farm
---
That last one! I never knew! Thank you.
---
Its proccing
---
Deported
---
Unless your on a 13k server and ever mode is heavily farmed 24/7
---
Is pulling the magistrate right at the start of the dungeon much faster than killing him at the end? Hmm I think I‚Äôm gonna have to research this matter further before we know for sure
---
yeah but dont forget, increasing the game length of AV will also increase your queue times, this affects your honor/rep per hour.     
---
Turning a 10min game into 30mins, locks out 80 horde players. Do that a couple dozen times over at once and add alliance players who finished their rep and won't return, it'll keep going up.
---
Is that so?
---
fishin'
---
That's not the goal at all.  That's the product of the strategy that wins.  As everyone else here is saying, horde pugs beat alliance pugs.  Horde doesn't have the benefit of group q.
---
Thank you so much for such an in depth reply! This is exactly why I posted on this forum. to try and learn as much as possible üòä
---
Every thing you say makes complete sense! I have no clue how successful this guild will be or how far into raiding we will get! I do know that I want to give it a shot though. I'm hoping I can find other people in my situation. I can't raid at peak times and I also can't dedicate crazy amounts of time to the game. Although I do really enjoy it and I'm trying to make a fun atmosphere.
---
I'm not expecting the guild to absolutely smash raids. What I do want to do though is lead a fun, semi successful raid. If we can find a way to make things work, even if it's slowly then I'll be happy üòä
---
I'm a personal trainer who works early mornings and late evenings. Making this guild has been amazing. In one week we have grown heaps already! Talked to so many new people and made some friends already too. I've helped create the social aspect (along with the other guildies) which I felt was lacking in my other exp and guild experiences
---
I believe I have to be completely transparent with every one and get everyone one on the same page. Hoping I can make it work!!
---
Being able to join AV in Hillsbrad and WSG in Barrens makes this queue look bad idea. I understand concept of trying to make Horde premades working, but it never works for faction having majority and long queue times, that gets longer the longer match time Horde is developing in their meta.
---
then why is it taking so long for you guys to win. If alliance wipe south, they either a. /afk or b. sit around at stonehearth and wait for you to win, cause they just want out and back into the next game
---
Jesus you got extremely unlucky. I probably lost a total of 11 games from neutral to exalted as alliance
---
I like dbz, but the audio was shit.
---
Worked fine before the recent patch/hotfix but ok. Every hunter in my guild noticed it.
---
For the life of me I can‚Äôt understand why people join those runs.
---
That, is ingenious üòÅ
---
The hunt for a rune platebody continues.
---
I think I can agree with you. But this, in my mind, was a huge oversight. I mean I'm only one person, but I quit playing at the end of WoD and have no desire to go back to retail. I had completely kicked the WoW habit until classic came out, and if classic ever dies or becomes stale, I'll just unsub before going to retail.
---
same!
---
the introduction of snowballs also removed the drek only pull, if a horde gets in with one, he can knockback drek with it and reset it.
---
I used to say this exact same thing, but every time I see an honor spy ranking list on higher pop servers, the brackets are much higher than on lower pop servers.  Sure you can say the %s should equal out but it doesn't end up working like that.  People just get more competitive as there's more people in the pool.
---
I fail to see how pressing 1 button instead of 2-3 mages a mage more boring.
---
Unless you have adhd having a 1 button class makes raiding less boring because you dont have to focus as much.
---
Really depends on what you call boring
---
The resto pot quest is extremely low level, why not just use an alt
---
I'm ashamed to say I did this in BC. Everyone was doing it! &gt;.&gt; but really, everyone was doing it
---
Yea. No need to interact with other people when questing, no need to look for people to mythic dung or even raids thanks to both group searcher and dungeon finder, one for mythic dungeons, the other one for heroic raids.
---
You don't even need a guild. Sure the game can be boring but I spent my last days of Legion completely alone without talking much with anyone and I never stopped doing heroic raids weekly and mythic dungeons.
---
Poor warriors. Their preraid bis are completely ridiculous compared to my priest. I had full prebis after like 3-4 times played after hitting 60 and I wasnt even being super efficient.
---
It's not really scraping the barrel, it's quite obvious really.
---
Wtf you going on about? It's a video of a person playing video games. It's not that serious, you act like a boss grilling employees about wasting time at work or something
---
Loot council is for brain dead socialist, if your letting another adult tell you what gear you can and can‚Äôt get... your just a bitch and a sucker.
---
Tbh I didn't think this was a thing people wanted. I guess the nochanges crowd was a little more hardcore than I thought. To me this just seems like an unnecessary self imposed limitation though.
---
Yeah that's the debate my guild is having right now as well. I'm also 99% sure in original vanilla they didn't but I suppose that doesn't necessarily mean it will be true for classic.
---
amazing
---
HonorBuddy did like 8 years ago, could never trick them into helping me. This is a bad bot.
---
Never bring another mail wearer into arena runs with you. Try to bring a warlock/mage and a healer for 3 man runs. It helps making friends with people in your guild to help you out since it will take a lot of time to get the chain to finally drop
---
Oh god.  You actually think that.  How sad.
---
Twinks man. Best part of the game right now. Perfect mix of other twinks in games for good competition and levelers in both factions for the twinks to stomp. The range of gear is considerably less for the twinks so if you‚Äôre both geared out it‚Äôs more about skill and crit RNG and not gear. No mounts making WSG less fun. Potential to 1-3 shot with certain classes. Plenty of engineering toys that have high impact. It‚Äôs a lot of fun
---
lmao are you planning on raiding in 2021? how are you gonna get a warrior AND mage to 60 anytime soon while playing 15 hours a week? not to mention the time it takes to gear as a warrior for stuff like SGC, HOJ, and dalrends
---
the answer to your post is certainly yes, you can raid (and even farm consumables) with just 15 hours a week but you do need to be realistic about how long it will take you to get to that point
---
Apologies in advance for filming like a savage (you can put me in reddit jail later with the rest of ‚Äòem)!

---
Wait, did he really quit?  It always amazes me how willing these streamers are to completely run away with all the gear they had their guild farm for them.
---
Isn't it 2k points?
---
Warrior is the worst option for what you want. You need tons of gold and are one of the worst classes at making it. Plus tons of gear competition. I‚Äôd go hunter, warlock, shaman, or Druid.
---
My guild doesn't even let mages or locks bid on Mageblade. Its paladin priority to them... Their reasoning is that pallies get nothing better till Nef. So its dropped the last 3 weeks and gone to a pally each time.
---
I should have rolled horde
---
This will both haunt me and keep me warm on those cold nights
---
How is your experience with the other wings? I used to do Library, it takes up more bag space but I get the rate of 30g/hour more consistently and with a lesser risk of dying.
---
Don't need any more than a full 24 slot bag worth of shards. I log on early to raid and take note of who is on, and remind them that if I'm logged in and able to make it to raid on time, so are they.  Now they're trained, and it's only the folks who barely get home from work by raid time that get summons.
---
EP/GP is better than both. Rewarded for showing up to raids, clear item costs, every1 gets a chance at loot, decay to prevent hoarding.
---
Can also be completely automated. Major items can still be LCed if the guild agrees on it.
---
No drama at all with it and super quick to distribute loot.
---
In Vanilla it certainly did.. there was a lot of controversy about it.
---
This. I really dont understand why people are recommending mage when hes already playing one of the best moneymakers in the game. Mage is just really boring as well, especially as an alt.
---
Sad I had to scroll down so far for this. Tributing as a fresh 60 is by far the most fun, time-efficient and long term beneficial thing you can do. Only the king fight is gear dependent, and the only dps check is the dogs, so OP, start on those runs and ask around on how to beat the returning dogs (or kill em)
---
Batching screws up tons of stuff, that's certainly not limited to FD. FD can't be used the way it used to be used, which is to press the button and immediately move on the next action. It *does* work when you stop, wait, FD, wait, continue on. That's kinda lame, but that's what we've got to work with.
---
What is your IT background?
---
So, I just killed that thing for you and it was a DHK, so you're welcome.
---
How is afking in AV better than playing it and killing people? Serious question.
---
Hmm wall of text from bitter mage, or direct quote from designer of the game? I wonder who Ill pick...
---
Im always shocked how delusional people can be. Wow.
---
NOT A BIG DEAAAAAAAAAALLLLLLLLL
---
True.
---
playing it would only be marginally better.  Get a bot that makes you jump or just watch netflix while interacting with the client every so often or when ever you get reported, the effort vs reward is almost the same for doing nothing than doing something so people do nothing.
---
As someone who hasn't yet partaken in the "lmao retail bad" Kool-Aid, even I think it's a bit... too little, too late? It would've been interesting if it was PvP from the outset, maybe, but the fact that it STILL isn't added? That's just laughable.
---
I don't need a 20 min video to tell me anything when ally lose 90%+ of the games :))
---
And no, "ally suck kek" isn't an argument
---
AV getting worse after the hardcore pve guys are done with rep has happened on every private server as well. Having coordinated and geared people over random guys is just an advantage. For random alliance it is amplified this time around  because their raiders got exalted super quickly and the more coordinated part of their player base is premade-queuing, decreasing the average quality ofor groups a solo-queue guy lands in while increasing their own.
---
Also during my private server days I experienced both sides several times. It seemed that the average level of competence tended to be lower on alliance side. They always had some very hardcore guilds but also a lot of people that were like "don't tell me what to do I'm having fun as a ret pally".  
---
Which is fine but it won't help you win AVs.
---
Honestly I think taking back FWGY is usually not the right move,  if Horde has enough to defend we should let them come in and hold them at the ramp.  The archers do crazy damage in such a concentrated spot.  if theres 10-15 horde on D with some mages, hunters, warlocks and a couple healers   we can usually hold them at the bridge for quite a while until they get wise and send more people or decide to actually group up.   Its a great spot, tons of LOS to use and the archers.
---
Once they dive to relief station fall back to Drek and bait them into peaking the corner and then freeze or fear them and the warlords will go ham on them.
---
I've seen 6 horde (2 mage, 2 lock, spriest, and priest) hold back 25 ish allies trying to start pulling warlords.
---
We have a GDKP MC run every week on Venoxxis. It usually takes 2h and most of the times without wipes. Bid starts at 50g or 100g depending on the item. It's usually 150-180g each after a run. Last time the Eye dropped and a shaman bought it for 4k g. We ended up with 270g each :-)
---
This video in many ways is very ahead of its time.
---
&gt;So at that rate it will take about a month of grinding until I could get some gear?
---
&gt;I‚Äôm not very familiar with the honor system and am looking for insight.
---
https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Honor_System
---
That's a lot to read, so a short hands-on explaination: 2-3 hours a night should be enough to *eventually* hit rank 7-10, depending on your server. But it may take a while, rank grows slowly. 
---
After R2 you'll most likely get R3.5 or something, only R4.2 after that, R4.8 after that - that's some random estimate. It will *never* grow too fast, even if you nolife for a week. 1.5-4 months, depending on the breaks/pushes and competition.
---
Probably bannable if a group of people team up to punt people out of the instance that aren't afk and are actually trying to get out of the tunnel.
---
Mmmm. Bring it back boys. Illegal Danish and all.
---
Drem. You‚Äôre my hero.
---
You actually watch other people play world of warcraft ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£
---
One thing I dont ever see the horde do is actually offtank the marshalls,  ally groups are so well organized with this.
---
All this pally was op in wotlk talk...I don't remember it that way. Maybe cause I mostly played SP in pvp?
---
Yeah, mages with shatter setup nova into 2 crits also pretty damn OP, but they can do it way more often, anytime you're frozen.
---
Fraps lol
---
The min/maxing in this game kinda sucked all the fun out of it for me. I‚Äôm pretty much just raid logging now.
---
...what?
---
&gt; because you're incapable of constructing an actual argument for Vanilla hunter being more difficult in pvp than Wrath hunter
---
Thats not at all what this is about.
---
Or just play Alliance for instant queues.
---
I did my quest in vanilla, but several Hunters had allready completed the quest by then. I knew where to go from the internet. The tactics for the demons was another story. There was no clear cut strategy for some, and some kills took some whipes. I also think the respawntimer on the demons was much longer.
---
I remember being a 15 year old kid and thinking about this quest constantly, and then finally managing to kill the demon. Total satisfaction and pride!
---
Then you can't ever have to pvp for raid loot, following your own reasoning. So your point above is stupid.
---
You look bored AF
---
Lol you are equating using earlier patches to adding transmog?  Let me guess franken patching involves adding dual talent specs and other QoL improvements?  There is a huge difference between adding better versions of vanilla wow and adding changes from tbc and beyond.  The fact that you are conflating the two shows how little you understand the #nochanges crowd.
---
Really? Damn. Mvp though.
---
Will I get into it as 57? And dont I need to do some quest to do it? I did the quest you get from the guy in BRD at 55 but dont know if theres more
---
Nice! Get any good loot?
---
You can transfer subscription time if that's what you mean. Did it just the other day when I subbed on the wrong account accidentally. Asked a GM to put the game time on the right account and they did it.
---
This is nothing new, we used to fill queues with random all the time and then get our people in instead
---
I'm not the one that even brought the dude up have no idea what the guy's name is or even what server it occured on.  I'm just saying it's really shitty to let a guild gear you up just to stop raiding.
---
Most of the good players went horde because they prefer it aesthetically in addition to many of the racials being strong. Because of this, the odds of you getting a noob on your team solo queuing is far higher on alliance.
---
if you have 2 hours aday you can play, do you want to do an instance or do you want to look for a tank for 2 hours?
---
Jesus christ you have it right. As a NE I was spamming eagle eye around Darnassus trying to identify all the ancients and then using some pinning add on to mark their patrol routes, thinking they would pop quest when they reached the end point..
---
One thing you gotta keep in mind is all the decent alliance players play in Premades (where we enjoy 25k honor per hour and 99% win rates), whereas horde don't/can't.
---
Jeez, clean your shit man. Fucking filthy!
---
‚ÄúYou think this is a game!?‚Äù 
---
-OP probably
---
This is pretty cool. Im gonna try it out. Gonna get my warrior friend to test it too.
---
The only griefing that Blizzard themselves has said is actually against the rules are ninja looting, harassment of players and gamemasters and scamming. This wouldn't fall under griefing unless you target a specific player and repeatedly do this to the same player. Messing up something for someone in a videogame once can't really be called harassment, but making them completely unable to play would most definitely qualify for it.
---
Nothing new.
---
Any evidence on that? Sure, a redditor telling me that is great, but that doesn't really confirm anything. I can't imagine that Blizzard intended this
---
I'm an officer in a guild that runs EPGP (pretty similar to dkp) and starting to run with another guild as a member with a LC. 
---
DKP/EPGP:
---
* Less loot drama
---
* Feels fairer for new players as they get to decide what to spend points on
---
* Much, much easier on officers
---
* Overall loot will go to waste when people don't want to spend points on minor upgrades
---
* Feels really bad for new players when forced upgrades happen
---
* Loot can go to players who raid log and aren't that reliable.
---
Loot council:
---
* Generally more efficient forum of gear distribution
---
* Best tier loot goes to the best players who provide the most to the raid. 
---
* Feels the best for dedicated players
---
* Generally great for letting people know the priority of the guild and helpful for New players to get a feel for the officers. You'll find out real quick if a guild is worth sticking around for. 
---
* More work for officers
---
* Loot drama always happens
---
* Can be coruptable.
---
No need for team training but I'm pretty sure you need to have training to ride a 100% mount though right?
---
It's pre raid bis for hunters and a moderate upgrade over easier to get options. 
---
They replace it with their T1, T2, T0 (set bonus), or blue PvP (with or without set bonuses)....
---
Then people wonder why hunters don't get brought to dungeons.
---
Is DME jump doable with (deep) prot though? I'd think damage is far too low, and that you need to be fury or fury/prot.
---
Firemaw alliance premades are sick tho. We have addon developers that make queuing easier and shit.
---
You wont due to decay, RP needed, and others competing in your brackets. Nice try though
---
"lol paladins"
---
How‚Äôs them ques holding up. Run into any premades lately?
---
Well if you're hung up on that "direct quote" from Kevin Jordan, listen again to the podcast.  He does agree that it became more complicated than he envisioned and they made it less complex in future expansions, but the direct quote you cited came from the other guest on the podcast, and the shot rotation in question is strictly relevant to PVE.  I can say from experience that you'll have the time of your life one shotting everyone but warriors once you get your Nef xbow, only to get absolutely no loot priority over warriors and rogues from then and then get demolished by everyone in AQ gear.  If you want to brag that this gameplay is "complex," though, people are going to laugh at you because hunters are as braindead as warrior to execute, but with worse scaling and worse synergy with healers.  
---
If your hatred for mages is really that great, just roll a warrior and chug 50s faps to demolish them as they wonder why they're losing to a class they supposedly counter.
---
is dit een makker?
---
Yep. All the scrubs complaining about the time needed to hit r14 are the same scrubs that turned retail into a total loot pinata
---
As someone who has only been playing wow since September this whole thread might as well be in a different language
---
Does it work for Hunter pet thread?
---
&gt;When a group of alliance runs by and 1-2 of them get CC'd, the rest just keeps running.
---
Because we don't need everyone down south. Just enough to kill Drek.
---
Why would you both get exclusive rights on RTVs AND get part of the DE loot? Done between 50-100 DME duo jumps as healer and I'd never join one where things are not split 50/50. If anything, the tank's job in there is way easier than the healer's.
---
Kromcrush 4tw
---
It‚Äôs been overwhelmingly positive for me for the most part. I can‚Äôt speak for retail as I haven‚Äôt touched it since MOP, but it‚Äôs really nice. Pretty much everyone is helpful and not dickish for no reason. I‚Äôve only had 3ish real bad experiences with others before, and 2 of those were just Alliance dudes spitting on me and such for no reason which hardly counts.
---
U wanna use:
---
Elix Mongoose
---
Roids and Ground Scorpok 
---
Elix Giants or Juju Might
---
Juju Power 
---
Blessed Sunfruit or Grilled Squid
---
Dense and/or Elemental Sharpening Stones
---
Nono of these stack with each other
---
Everything was known and guides existed back then.
---
People were not troglodytes 15 years ago.
---
Don't see how that would work since for example 2 people queue and their queue pops. In the time all other players get invited into the party there's a chance outsiders join the wsg already and fill the spots or am I missing something?
---
&gt;But the point remains that your best honor/hour in a pug is definitely to rush the end boss and have an 8 minute game. (A more organized semi-premade can both split off 5 for Galv and rush Drekk, but that's usually too much to ask in a pug.)
---
Considering killing Galv and lieutenants only loses you a couple of minutes for more than twice the honor, no, rushing Drek isn't the best honor per hour you can make.
---
Wouldn't the etiquette be to share rtv spoils?
---
How about those losers who watch people play soccer/icehockey LOL LOL..... /s
---
That‚Äôs me at 0:32. Dude, you one-shotted me twice in that AV, it was fucking hilarious.
---
I wanna add my sarcastic but kinda true *Zug Zug*
---
No, for casters, it is not.
---
Yes it's slower but also doable being deep prot.
---
Bwahahaha! I'm need to remember this one.
---
Cool beans, did not know. Any idea about average run time? Cheers!
---
Players expecting reckoning to be good and viable are people in a nutshell- the game gives you the best PvP healer that is borderline broken to support classes that are way better in melee combat but you still want to play that underperforming role.
---
In a way this is good because if Alliance actualy played paladins to their strengths Horde would never stand a chance in PvP.
---
Holy shit Dremlock. Master of those ele crits from back in the day.
---
Yes
---
Yes, it doesn't show up but can still hold your keys. I'm using the classic version, and tried the retail version but it's the same.
---
The healing pants
---
I'd say that's not entirely true. Depending on the situation and location you get different results. For example if you're in an area with rare spawns there's people calling out when they spawn(as you can all tag them and get loot) and usually there's gatherings of people on the spawn points and talk or emote/use toy items while waiting.
---
Even yesterday when I was doing the 15th anniversary event we were reminiscing with a stranger about the nostalgic days of WOTLK, and when the raid popped we wished each other a good day and were off.
---
That doesn't work. The point is to gain an advantage by getting instant queues while the rest of the people you are competing against have to sit in queue.
---
I get that, i just found stuff i enjoy and dont bother with everything else i find unenjoyable. I know some of the rank grinders and it seems miserable.
---
Fishing, scout AH for what to fish, and fish it
---
I‚Äôm a wizard, Harry! 
---
Seriously though I‚Äôm a Mage haha.
---
No. That‚Äôs not what I said. I said that a lot of the arguments were the same regardless of topic. People acted as if a discussion regarding 1.7-related changes were the same as adding transmog - the same thing you are doing right now. 
---
Frankenpatching meant implementing things from different 1.X-patches (such as 1.5 AV, 1.1 AH, 1.12 Itemization) to create the ‚Äùperfect‚Äù Classic.
---
Ganksquads in open world disappeared - i love AV for this.
---
That's actually ridiculous. Grinding to exalted is 300k-ish honor, so if you only grinded to exalted and a bit more you'd get very good standing.   
---
I nearly don't believe it.
---
Runescape players are well aware and they love that stuff
---
I‚Äôm having trouble imagining any reasonable argument supporting botting...
---
quests  awarding rep for whole raid group that can be spamed you bring stuff looted from players to dun baldar and go ham on quest turn-ins. It might seem like its no rep at all 1-5 stormpike and 10-50 IF but it adds up very fast if bunch of ppl do those
---
My question is, is it possible to find stonespine similar to Jed by using tar. I want that cloak so badly but rng has fked me
---
Shatter batching has always existed and works even with ice lance
---
Mining is like 3gph. I laugh my ass off when people think its a good moneymaker.
---
Ha ? Wouldn't you need to requeue for this??
---
Wrong, because in actual reality those few minutes cost pugs any victory at all a lot of the time, let alone a fast win. The issue is that if pugs do Galv and lieutenants they do them with 30+, same thing horde do with Balinda.
---
Galv and LTs can efficiently add to your honor if you don't derail your offense for them, which means doing them with a small squad of 5-10. It's feasible for premades to split in that manner, which is exactly why I said they could do both. It's not feasible for a pug to execute both objectives.
---
Sounds like you got the short end of the stick. Pissed off that you've ended up on a server you're not happy with. Get over it. and more importantly your "solution" is not well thought out for so many reasons. The main one being, why force thousands of people's hands by merging servers when players can be given a choice. Poor you! dont be an entitled prick, play the game
---
This sort of stuff is why I don‚Äôt think Classic+ will work, Blizzard teams don‚Äôt understand the reason behind limitations in the original game design anymore IMO.
---
Layering + Resources like Black Lotus made this extremely clear; they failed to understand or counter the ramifications of a new system in an old game.
---
Thanks for help got it going in the end!
---
Thanks :)
---
The bar is only as high as the highest ranked player. Hard to blame Blizzard when everyone is nerding out on rank to be the first R14.
---
IS HE REALLY BACK??????
---
Cool. I spend my mana giving ppl buffs in pregame not making their lazy asses water. Guess that makes me a dumb shit rofl
---
Yeah, I'm glad for you that you are levelling 4 months after server launched in a super competitive fashion. You must be a very unique person
---
dwarf without edgemasters
---
It's not about skilled players, Alliance simply has instant queue and so most players don't want to turtle and would rather lose fast and queue into another AV.
---
The whirlwind is a cast and can be dodged. No reason to stay out as a melee.
---
Send a detailed report and move on. They eventually get banned
---
That button shortcut is a pretty new feature in the snipping tool, so no wonder uve missed it :p
---
You have several groups with 2 people queueing. Then you have a main team of 8 people that joins one and gets a run. Finishes, leaves and joins the next group in line.
---
Basically it's like hiring people to stand in line after each other at a midnight release so you can keep going in and buying the thing before everyone else.
---
You dont need to bother yourself with what other people do.
---
Honestly without reading reddit I would say and think that the game is in great shape but when I come here people make it seem like the world is on fire. It brings so much negative thoughts and ruins the mood.
---
"After the waiting period?" Sounds like you're talking about AV, which is hardly PvP.
---
It's strong in organized PvP.  Any premade WSG or AB group worth a damn will have at least one Dwarf Priest.  Fear immune that can be given to anyone on a 30 second cooldown is absolutely as strong as wotf.    Sure, it can be purged, but it's on 1/4 the cooldown as wotf.  Unless you plan on throwing out 50 purges at the start of a battle, it's still going to block fears.
---
Most enjoyable edit I've ever seen
---
I might be wrong but I don't think there have been any advancements in the bot "AI" since maybe Cataclysm. It's all into detection these days.
---
The bots you see in vanilla are absolute trash compared to what used to go around in Cata/Mop and beyond.
---
Who dat snacc streamin'?
---
It's not marginally better, you can easily double your honor if you farm solo players
---
Did esfand even play vanilla lol.
---
The winning comment
---
If that's what you enjoy you picked the right class!
---
Pretty much exactly like that. I usually set out a grill cooker(yes, that's a campfire that exists) and a few cushions/chairs to get the atmosphere going. Here's a fun one, there's a potion that lets you understand the other faction's language. But they also need it to understand *you*, so you can basically understand them and talk but they will just see gibberish on their side like usual if they don't have it so the caveman anology works perfectly.
---
Thex approves
---
I thought &lt;1% of people cleared Naxx in which case people would care. Hopefully the community decides which made up reality they want when complaining, either Naxx was so hard nobody ever saw it or everyone had Naxx gear and didn‚Äôt care about ranking up, or everyone was more concerned with fun than rewards and played BGs just because. 
---
Some day we‚Äôll get the story straight.
---
Kind of like asking if it‚Äôs worth getting a job or if you should just count on winning the lottery
---
Believe it or not, many gamers see death in a video game as failures. MOBAS and FPS and Battle Royals have set the tone for *dying in a video game*. 
---
Not saying it's right. Its just how it is.
---
The one flaw in your logic is thinking that Blizzard would spend extra time/money/brain cells on trying to create and balance Classic+ rather than just throwing up some TBC realms with no thought, just like they did with Vanilla
---
Dremlock... Thumbs up
---
Rank 1 maybe? I don't play mage, no idea what the mana cost is
---
They go over it in the twitch link, theres a mage talent that replenishes mana on resists, so they just spec that and let the lil imps spam their bolts so they get resists
---
Strat live is lucrative without orbs. Not great but not zilch. There‚Äôs tons of green/blue weapons, actual silver on mobs, runecloth, and recipes. It‚Äôs obviously much more worth when orbs drop but you should be running enough of them that the RNG will even out.
---
Hmm I might give it a go, kill everything or skip some mobs like Cath?
---
Holy shit its Vthevictim? That dude was one of the OSRS players not too long ago. Great to see he‚Äôs doing incredible things on this game as well.
---
AV didnt give so much honor and it wasnt instant queue.
---
sry but the chain can be used my multiple classes. this game doesn't revolve around u. btw, ever consider that mayb u dont NEED a chain? its ok bro, you might do 2.1 less dps but its not the end of the world
---
Nah, you cant follow the rules =&gt; blacklisted
---
Its not like its some intangible performance factor
---
At the end of the day, every class is gear dependent one way or another. You need to farm gold with EVERY class and get GEARED with every class. You need to put TIME into whatever class you choose to play. Not sure what your misconception is about warriors. Most gear dependent? Maybe? But nothing is more satisfying than getting that one upgrade and climb the dps meters on a warrior. 
---
I have the luxury of taking dungeons with my Warrior and hand picking my group to ease upgrades as well. 
---
My guild has the main raid and the alt raid. I‚Äôm sure they have no issue taking me with the alt run until I‚Äôm ready and I don‚Äôt have an issue proving my worth there either and then getting promoted to the main group.
---
There is the concept that botting increases supply and thus lowers costs for all players. So basically someone is doing your farming for you.
---
a dwarf priest or something
---
No. It does not. It means there is no patch involved client side. It means the issue can be fixed server side.
---
Probably if you read the original comment you'd see him doubting 90% winrate.
---
Ah like that yeah.
---
Hahaha awesome
---
&gt; Unless you plan on throwing out 50 purges at the start of a battle, it's still going to block fears.
---
you also make this statement:
---
&gt;Unless you plan on throwing out 50 purges at the start of a battle, it's still going to block fears.
---
as if it's ridiculous, but it's just as ridiculous as 1 dwarf priest buffing all 10 (let alone 40 in AV) with fear ward in WSG on a 30 second CD.
---
IIRC, on retail the 2 players would have to drop and requeue for the new player(s) to get the same queue. Is that the bug? The queue isn't resetting?
---
YEET
---
Blade of eternal darkness.
---
At least they're q'ing WSG instead of AV
---
So fucking what? How is it hurting you?
---
Sean, is that you?
---
It‚Äòs much better until 44 or even 52 is why.
---
If you spec shadow before level 44, then leveling quickly in a pve environment is not your goal or you are being very inefficient.
---
And my axe!
---
That's until your small mana pool runs out and you're a walking swingtimer. 
---
We've all got bursted down by a Ret paladin but it really needs a lot of gear to be effective and even then a lot of your utility is lost chasing after people when your warrior friend could be mowing down 2-3 people easily with your support.
---
What is the addon called with the darker bars and nameplate?
---
Soon.
---
You're pretty toxic, pal

---
Why not? Raiding is pretty casual. On my server there are PuGs every night for MC and Onyxia. You can just LFG for MC and you'll get into one that takes 1-3 hours depending on how good they are. Once you know some people you can end up in a good group (or just a guild run) and do it when you want to.
---
10 into holy and you do as much damage as a 1-43 shadow priest without ever having to drink.
---
5/10/5 into 13/10/5.
---
This is very niche. Consensus is rushing 13/0/5.
---
No. I don‚Äòt to it so I can heal better. I do it because I calculated every ability rank‚Äòs damage per mana.
---
Oh nice!!
---
You're never getting Rank 7 at that rate. You need to play at least 4 hours a day for the next month.
---
baisicly,2 weeks ago major healing potion was 1g 15s in golemagg eu horde side
---
now it is 55s
---
why is it dropping ?
---
i have like 40 stacks from my tribute runs,should i sell them now? in other words should i except price to continue droping ?
---
Yes very, no one ever thought of doing this :)
---
surely there are stupider things to watch?
---
alliance mentality displayed right here.
---
If he isn't gonna get edgies he needs to go daggers, otherwise he is simply gimping his damage
---
Have a bot on my friends list for 2 months now. He dinged lvl 60 and farms mobs in silithus 24/7.
---
Where‚Äôs the waves I keep hearing about? 2 months is pretty long time.
---
I soloed them with my lock back in the days. So with two people it should be easy.
---
Nah, they are not the same at all. Diablo 3 is fundamentally garbage, Wow classic isnt.
---
Honestly, AQ is only hard because of the travel time between bosses. I think guilds that are casual now will have to clear it in two nights and skip other content if they have two raid nights, but will get through it.
---
Naxx is going to be the first real wall imo
---
Called unitframesimproved
---
Oh no, it's like every faction has its share of dumbasses. What a surprise. Just because you don't see the all the horde side shit that's happening doesn't mean that your faction is dumber or that it doesn't happen at all on their side.
---
Part of the reason for the price dropping is written in your last paragraph.
---
Also world pvp ain‚Äôt huge anymore so farming herbs is doable again
---
Alliance is trash. Our warcry is let them win! Plus, AV is massively horde favoured when it comes to turtling/defending. And alliance literally can't function without a skull mark or DBM to lead the way.
---
Tried farming them for my truefaith, not a single drop for 10 hours, just skip that and farm DM for money and buy them
---
/r/murderedbywords
---
The erronous assumption you do is that it's just one game at a time being "filled". In my experience games are started in bulk, with up multiple games being started simultaneously during peak times. So while you get in AV 217 or whatever, your friend gets into 218 and the person after that gets in 219, then the 4th person goes into AV 217 again etc. That is the most logical explanation I have to the "RNG" part of joining AV.
---
Nah, I remember doing this in vanilla.
---
Just figure out what you want to do most. You easily have a year to get to level 60, and people will still run 5-mans. Tanking is arguably the hardest job and requires more knowledge not only about your class, but about dungeons and how to run them. Healing is much easier when we talk 5-mans only. Finally being a dps is mostly about just doing damage and watching not to attack/pull wrong monsters by accident.
---
If you only have 10 hours per week, I'd focus on one character only for now. If we take the average of 10 days /played time to get to 60, you're looking at 6 months to reach 60. Make of that what you will.

Best video eu. Dm east farm convinced me
---
You need to understand this about naxx:
---
Many people entered naxx and could kill some bosses. The first three were quite easy. As you progressed through the instance it got harder and harder to the point where only the most elite guys cleared it. So the story is both actually. Many people will have naxx gear, almost no one will kill kel‚Äòthuzad.
---
Is that true? Pretty sure they hit way too hard.
---
What? how is that relevant, no one is talking about who got quel in vanilla lol
---
Sorry about *servername* :(
---
It‚Äôs not really gear dependent as long as you bring 55 water.
---
Sure the dogs is a little trickier with bad gear unless you waste a mana pot on them. Then they are also super easy.
---
1v1? Kill the hunter. You might go OOM but thats better than dead.
---
In group PvP you‚Äôre gonna have to become close friends with Shamans, Druids or Paladins.
---
Druid, bring it to one or two mc raids and you are 8/8 t1. Ez.
---
That's just sad dude
---
I am bad at my rogue. Like... REALLY BAD. I want to get better at pvp but I always fuck up ok real encounters and I get frustrated.

How can I get better?

Your logic kind of falls apart when you realise Horde's A Team also finished and we're also on our B Team atm.

Verbal Harrassment on *a whole* '*nother level*

Yes.

Absolutely. You also get 11 Stamina.

Are the "Decrease magical resistances" stat, for example on Don Rodrigo band, of any use for PvE content ? How does is compare to +spell hit chance ?

Good call. Thanks!

And the only way the horde won in the start of phase two was to 5v30 the alliance.

classic+ and micro transactions are no the same
---
im playing on biggest EU server. i dont see the r14 bracket players playing more then 18h/day. account sharing isnt necessary to get r14
---
: And no one on the sub was surprised by that
---
And I can‚Äôt understand tanks that run it for one orb. They don‚Äôt need anything form the instance, so every time more than one drops you are covered for the runs when zero drop. People join because you gather the party and you they don‚Äôt have to wait 2 hours for the tank that is leveling atm especially that tanks don‚Äôt need anything from there.
---
Crit really starts to shine when you are above 1150 ranged ap. 
---
And for hunters you want to be as close to 25% crit as possible.
---
I‚Äôd say test it out kill some mobs with it equipped and without and see if it‚Äôs noticeable or not.
---
What are you even complaining about? PuG groups are awful find some friends.
---
How is that possible?
---
Most of the conversation, here: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/524379719
---
In short, we got booted for a few top honor grinders being accused of manipulating brackets and controlling the influx of players from their respective servers to the Discord. The whole server is now unable to queue with the rest of them. Kind of a bummer because there are some great players in there and the honor grind has been a blast.
---
Add a description for those who can't watch the video?
---
Why do you think ally lose 90% of the time?
---
Blacklisting the most popular Alliance realm's entire population from using the main Discord channel for premades because a few at the top wanted to control brackets. From my perspective, it's a little harsh to those not involved.
---
But if you're Horde and sympathizing with their current BG plight, then all I have to say to you, good sir is Zug Zug. Carry on.
---
Oh yeah? There are thousands of people who killed Rag for the first time since classic launched, and tens of thousands of people who dinged 60 for the first time, not even mentioning other similar "milestones". Do you want to celebrate with all of them?
---
Doesn't sound like exploiting, pretty smart actually, especially if people ate willing to queue for you
---
You are a god damn legend. Thank you! Will try it today!!
---
I soloed first boss plus some trash in DM North alot. Not the best gold but pretty chill..
---
OP is a shitty guy anyways. He used people to join his guild then he treated them like trash and gave priority to all his irl friends for instant loot and officer positions which officers for some reason can loot themselves first. No matter how much you donate to the guild bank, help others out, or how long you stay in the guild, you will still be least priority. Theres a ton of other fishy stuff but this dude is black listed for myself.
---
Christ
---
In jump runs its necessary, for world it is very mediocre
---
Massacre everyone.
---
I‚Äôve thought about that, but PvP is my passion. Triple Crit WF hits take me back to my childhood, and the nostalgia of purging a frost mage and one shotting them brings me tears of joy. I‚Äôm looking to fill the in between. 
---
Turns out, I‚Äôm highly specific and incredibly needy. Ha! 
---
Thank you!
---
Just to put this into perspective with a completely stupid and not at all realistic example:
---
Ragnaros has around 1.1m hp according to a few sources online.
---
If 40 people were to crit for 25.5k each on their first cast he would instantly lose ~ 93% of his hp.
---
honestly? probably. i feel like a tight knit group can come up with convincing enough reasons to funnel stuff to their pals. it‚Äôs a pretty exploitable system unless there‚Äôs complete transparency and some additional contingency involved. i‚Äôd say run a couple times with them and see how you feel about the way they do things.
---
They‚Äôre amazing and probably why its not released til phase 5
---
Ah, I just take the dogs out. The timing on my runs makes so that they are just about to leave the platform when I come into king room.
---
Druid is an excellent herb/alch class in Classic. But wading into large groups of lvl60-mobs just is never a good idea in Classic... The feral druid is a good grind-class but it isn‚Äôt as easy as retail
---
‚ÄúThis is like... boom boom boom... CLAP!‚Äù Hahaha. Phenomenal editing as always, keep it up brother!
---
Because horde doesn't need pvp consumes to farm zergers in AV, so people aren't buying hp pots and you have the pvp ones from honor vendor too.
---
Actually working Loot Council is better.
---
Problem DKP has always been how it promotes raiders to compete and screw over each other.
---
maybe, but likely not as it is a huge disadvantage. you‚Äôd get a better answer if you can ask in your server‚Äôs discord/subreddit (if they have one).
---
The same can be done with a tank with Tactical mastery, charge + intercept.
---
They do, I'm not sure why you'd type something so stupid in the first place. The main appeal is the low price. Nobody uses Major pots in PVP because they'd run out of stock/gold quickly.
---
And I have a pretty damn big dick aswell. Life‚Äôs good.
---
Meanwhile also alliance: what's a win?
---
Check out your servers discord.  Lots of active guild recruiters there.  You'll probably get more visibility
---
Buffed or unbuffed?
---
Dremlocks videos have always been top tier
---
Tbf it was a progress, apes and symbol premade
---
My favorite warrior gold making technique is to just level my rogue. Not even kidding
---
Great advice! Thank you!
---
Blacksmithing gloves. Full Imperial Plate armor to roleplay. Level an alt
---
I mean it hurts everyone on horde who doesn't do it...
---
My bad, i read that you retain them if you use mouseover on other targets
---
I'm on Pyrewood (horde) and find it to be a pretty good realm.
---
I'd like to know how they plan to ban an entire server. Like how would they know which server they are on?
---
Paladins had a talent called reckoning. It stores a extra hit for your next attack, each time you where critted. There was no cap on the number stored or duration they lasted. Just until next attack. 
---
So what they did was removing all valuable gear and just having random plate with stamina on it. Then dual a rouge with lvl 1 starter knives. The pala would constant spam a /sit marco so the rouge would auto crit him. 
---
That would go on for hours. I recall that they broke a handful of knives for the rouge and stopped when the paladins gear was breaking for the second time. Then they just went down there. Started recording and the rest is history. 
---
So it was not, a one shot in any sense of the word. Just a ludicrous amount of instantaneous stacked attacks.
---
Holy shit, Dremlock! I remember making an Orc Sham back in WotLK after seeing your Dremlock 4. 
---
WotLK Shaman was the shit !
---
Hi Mr. Racist
---
Sure, the OP is about AV, but we were talking specifically about racial abilities in this comment thread.  Talking about racial abilities and AV balance is pretty pointless.  There are so many far more impactful differences at play.  But sure, I'd rather have wotf in AV because there is little to no organization.
---
I'll still stand by Fear Ward being just as strong in actual organized PvP.  It should be and is used on cooldown in WSG and AB, and it absolutely blocks a lot of fears.  Play a fearing class in premade WSG as Horde and you'll see a LOT of immunes, especially in the beginning of matches when fights can be the most crucual.  It's used differently and has weaknesses compared to worf, sure, but it's a very impactful ability in PvP, and leaving it out of the conversation on the strength of racial abilities between factions is silly.  Saying otherwise is literally just arguing for the sake of trying to be right, and I'm not going down that route with you.
---
Yes with a well geared group you can 2 runs per hour. That would be on avarage one or + boxes + greens/grays and boss vendor loot. Should add up to 50-70gph excluding group making and travel time. Dungeons are also pretty fun so imo an awesome way to make money if you can tank well.
---
Yeah his vampire series was dope
---
Lol.  This isn't server transfer, this is BG un-clusterfucking the open world.  Go take a picture of the AV entrance or the battlemasters, or org at primetime.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt take it that way haha! I‚Äôm just explaining it more how we use it. Every guild is different and should use whichever way makes the most sense for their structure
---
No problem, I reworded the first comment to be less confusing as well. :)
---
That was the times :) Before everything got nerfed :D
---
&gt;People in the past did it, so that makes it okay
---
Well, lets bring back slavery then
---
30g and no loot sounds reasonable for me
---
Anyone above r10 is already hurt
---
So i can‚Äôt get to rank 14, fine, but what about rank 13? Possible with a couple hours of play every night?
---
Are you an idiot?
---
This doesnt solve the problem one iota.
---
what npcs r selling pvp potions ?
---
I read that 1 crit is = 32ap in terms of DPS. Not sure how accurate that was though or remember where I got it from...
---
Kromkrush represent!
---
If we were going to recreate a museum of the times where slaves worked our lands and houses.. it would be pretty dishonest to not have slaves on display.
---
You blink and use CS instead of Arcane Missile.
---
I did it against Shazz on horde! No recklessness either
---
literally has nothing to do with the server type, lol.   The correct answer is to not rank.
---
I dunno, we killed an Alliance premade yesterday by having 8ish mages hide at Galv and wipe all 40 of them via AOE.
---
It does if PvP isn't important to you at all and you want to PvE though. Some people don't give one iota about PvP.
---
My personal opinion is that charging for this at all is bullshit. I get that you can get away with it because people are desperate for tanks, all these fury warriors have a fear of tanking and then that's just capitalism baby^^TM. However, everyone in a given group has had to level up and run as many, if not more instances than you for gear. The fact that one person should get to charge others just because they happened to pick a particular class feels so wrong to me.
---
If you start a group with the intent of getting one piece of loot and reserve that one piece of loot, that's fine. If you reserve all sellables, all ores, all whatever or outright want gold to play your class, that's bullshit. How would it feel if you had to pay your priest to heal and res? Your mage to sheep? Your lock to summon? Your rogue to open doors? 
---
You do you, but I think charging at all is against the spirit of the game.
---
Also, don't confusing cheating streamers with min maxing.
---
whats your current bracket?
---
loading...
---
Scumbag is a strong word.  Taking min maxing a bit too far isn't really scummy.  That's the way the game is.  If you want to be competitive on their server you have to do this.  If they don't do this they can't rank.  How is this scummy if it's required?
---
I'm also LOOKING AT YOU **ANNAONELOVE** on **Mograine** and **Zandalar Tribe!**
---
Blizzard should fix all this fraud by removing the ability to cancel your auction if anyone else already bid on that
---
Everyone if they kill belinda first
---
Isn‚Äôt this just a clever use of game mechanics?
---
What makes you entitled to state you know more than anyone else here? Do you have a Doctorate degree in world of Warcraft? 
---
You clearly don‚Äôt know anything. Your millennial attitude clearly how‚Äôs you started playing this game 4 months ago and everything you ‚Äúknow‚Äù is from YouTube. Get humble kid.
---
Nope. Not even close. At the moment R8 is like 4-6 hours a day. Depends a bit on your server of course.
---
thats why mc is so hard /s
---
Yeah or just not give a fuck about your rank and PvP anyway. If you enjoy it, good, if you don't, stop.
---
I think this really varies how geared you are, if I‚Äôm in a charging mood I‚Äôll do 15g - probs 25 for full BRD or first orb in strat live, and I‚Äôm full BiS except legs, one ring
---
Capitalism baby
---
Alliance has insta ques, all the good players are just premading because why carry people who arent there for honor.
---
All before rank 6 you only decay 10% not 20%
---
Pve bis for mage in t2 requires 2pvp pieces
---
Imagine going for rank 14 in 2020
---
Deadmines for wool
---
Says the lvl 32 warrior who doesnt know the answer to his own stupid question.  Pathetic
---
Unfortunately hordes suffer 20+ minute queues now, while alliance get inside instantly, and then use discord bots &amp; voice to win.
---
The problem is here is bis and min-maxing though.
---
WOTLK is a bit like when Prot Paladins got a version 1.0 build.  Before that they were ok, but to say they are good is ignoring glaring issues they had.
---
The addon(s) you are using are inaccurate at least for spell crit %. It presents each point in Holy Power as 2% and is showing you 5% higher than you really are. Run /script print(GetSpellCritChance(2)) in-game as a macro to get your actual spell crit %.
---
Yup!  That's the best way to play classic wow.  If you enjoy the activity keep doing it.  Who cares if it's not min/max?  The point of the game is to enjoy playing.
---
I had redemption ark.
---
Never had one in vanilla or on pserver, lost with a 98 roll. Went back 5 days later and rolled a 99 straight off the bat and finally got one of the bastards.
---
The meta you speak of only worked with the collusion of a horde that was doing the same thing: spamming insta queue AV for rep. Now we wait 18 minutes in queue and that no longer works to our benefit, so we simply stop you from winning that way, which is really easy if alliance isn't super organized. One wipe and you're all running back from sh.
---
If only there were more like you.  Seriously, don't fuck with hunters doing that terrible quest in the open world.  It takes nothing to walk away, or help out.  I watched a horde warrior pop a demon that an alliance had tagged, while 4 of the alliance watched in vain.  I called him a fuckwit in general and watched them beat him into the ground.  Man was he salty.
---
Had another horde hunter despawn simone as I was fighting her and immediately log off.  And then deny it when confronted and reported for griefing 5 hours later when he had onviously failed again and again and was following her around to attempt her again.
---
This quest gave me heatburn 15 years ago, and did the same this time around.
---
Theoretically it is 85k XP/h but pulling this off flawlessly for hours on end is tough with a lot of risk.
---
I mean, PVP still totally exists there too. Probably easier to rank if that matters to you as well.
---
Brutality blade
---
Did they?
---
So you are saying the solution to people cheating is to abandon all my friends and guildmates and move to a PVE server in hopes that nobody cheats on *that* server?
---
Flawless solution.
---
Dremlock come play AAU with me stahp playin classic wow
---
That sounds like the number from the classic wowhead hunter guide. At least that‚Äôs where I remember it from.
---
Yeah. In retail I never even finished lvling because  I was basically playing a single player game. And I've got plenty of much better single player games.
---
A shame really, I actually prefer many things about retail compared to classic, but the most fundamental thing about an mmo to me is the social aspect, and that's pretty much non-existent during lvling.
---
Can confirm that any decent alliance player found a discord premade. I was struggling with these terrible games and toxic alliance memebers.
---
Found the discord, and proceeded to literally win every single game in less than 15 minutes all the way until exalted. No exaggeration, I won about 30 games straight without losing.
---
I doubt that. He said major HEALING potion, which is far less valuable than major mana potion in raiding.
---
Can confirm
---
Lol yeah he likes them thicc I enjoyed him in bdo
---
How shocking, players dont want to play a pile of dogsh\*t.
---
Sure, technically yea. But "clever use of game mechanics" has gotten people in trouble before, if it is used in a way that was not really intended and the effect is too great.
---
I didn't, but doesn't he just mean that since we are playing before BWL but with 1.12 item, consumable and talent balance that there is way more spellpower to go around than there was at the time in Vanilla?
---
I guess you could skip the problem with a messenger addon like wim? Easiest thing I could come up with lol
---
I presume you go to raid every week and pass on every single item then, right?
---
The enjoyment of the game is progression. If you cant progress because of cheaters, how are you intended to enjoy yourself?
---
So this is what it's like to have friends
---
This sub is weird
---
You asked a total of 2 questions smartass. By the time you reach 60 the content will be so consumeable required you wont ever have the gold for it. GG, have fun not getting geared lol
---
I usually take all not needed loot. 40g/dungeon is the alternative price, but rarely do anyone go for that.
---
So glad I rolled shammy
---
That is correct. I never played vanilla myself, but I had looked into this ages ago when I got interested in vanilla.
---
When Vanilla launched, spell power was extremely scarce. It was only a thing found on specific pieces or high end gear. Even some of the MC gear didn't have spellpower that are now "BiS". Sometime mid-way through Vanilla they completely re-did the gear of nearly every high-end dungeon and raid gear and gave them a lot of +spell and +healing power.
---
This gear change, on top of talents becoming a lot better(seriously, the talents Vanilla launched with were absolute trash vs. 1.12) for DPS and healing. I would guess the DPS has pretty much doubled since 1.0 compared to 1.12 in the gear+talent differences.
---
Gottem
---
Oh ok. So i can see when my CD are up. When my banish runs out and when I should re-up my soul stone? 
---
I tried to use elvui which did a lot and looked nice imo, but it does not display buff and debuffs on others that technically does affact me like mount/unmount on friendly. Other warlocks curses on enemies
---
I don‚Äòt get it.  
---
How does it even work?  
---
I didn‚Äòt even manage to get into an AV with ONE friend.
---
Didn‚Äòt matter at all how simultaneous we queued.
---
I hope Blizz makes this available for everybody or ban the shit out of those who abuse it.
---
So apparently it‚Äôs possible for someone to fuck over an entire realm and just sit at rank 14 for weeks/months.  Great game design üíØ
---
Used to, or did until you read that comment?
---
Elemental Mastery makes your next spell 100% crit chance.
---
So you cast your hardest hitting ability, chain lightning, and earth shock so they go off at the same time.
---
Spell batching makes them both crit
---
Thats not how this works
---
Instant gratification has ruined games SLIGHTLY tbh 
---
Journey &gt; Destination
---
What if the warrior already has all the gear from there they need or like with strat live there really isn't anything they need? Why should they bother tanking in there? The reason mages can't charge for poly and healers can't charge to heal is because those roles are a dime a dozen.
---
How does it work? If they are given the evidence and decide it's not cheating they are incorrect? Because some other people think so?
---
Do you really want all serious pvpers on the ally side banned?
---
Which is 99% of players...
---
You mixed up juju might and power. You can use firewater instead of juju might
---
Yes. Also get hit scope and replace the other tarnished ring with painweaver band
---
The WoW forums have terms against "publicly naming and shaming" players for their behavior. Youre intended to record evidence and email it to them.
---
The issue is they are so hands off with GM oversight that they just ignore reports until a arbitrarily high number of them are received.
---
Reckoning originally stacked infinitely. It was this event right here that caused Blizzard to hotfix it to only stack up to 4 times.
---
Yeah he's got the whole guild feeding him loot for a terrible spec and even when he gets everything he won't be doing this damage.
---
You're probably right. I still think they're going with TBC.
---
They could easily transform classic into a cashcow. Server transfer brings something, but ultimately things like pets and recent cosmetic things (like the backback, i like that thing) bring the money.
---
But since classic has a limited time span (after Naxx there is nothing more) they would need to invest some development into it. I mean they could totally just bring future dungeons into classic. Karazhan, Grim Batol come to mind. They could totally introduce Highelves into the game and their city. The map, the start zones, everything exists already.
---
Kurinnaxx is the best!!
---
For dps mirahs will be better (with edgies or human racial)
---
But for fury prot tank the storms trike hammer will provide better threat as it's slow speed will eat less flurry procs allowing you to heroic strike your main hand more.
---
Well, they present themselves to large audiences and should be held accountable if they fuck up.
---
Mages...is there anythign they cant do?
---
How much cash do you earn by doing this?
---
&gt;&gt;But did you just compare exploiting bg queues to slavery..
---
&gt;
---
&gt;No, I applied your logical fallacy to an extreme example to exemplify how flawed it is.
---
So a strawman.
---
It isn't now, but it will be for the people who are geared in AQ/Naxx loot.
---
Exactly the same way as I can't wade into a giant pack of mobs when I first hit level cap in a new retail expansions but after a few months of gearing I can handle more and more and more.
---
I love when people level in retail, do one normal mode dungeon, then quit and say this is too easy I just faceroll everything. That's the literal equivalent of hitting 60 in Classic, killing some non-elite stuff outside in Eastern Plaguelands, and saying, "man this game isn't hard at all."
---
Having played on a lot of private servers. The bad ones were the ones that only had locked raids. the good ones were the ones that had gradually introduced content. Blizzard has decided to mostly just lock out raids and keep some overpowered items and a broken AV. It means that they decided to take the only option to actually try the old AV again away.
---
Not an answer, but I think other loot systems are fine. I used dkp in about half a dozen midtier guilds in tbc, epgp in the 2-3rd best guild on the server for sometime in tbc and entire wotlk and now I am in a casual guild using fixed % dkp and all systems worked great. 
---
I think loot council only makes sense for like a dozen best guilds in the world trying to compete for speedrunning records.
---
We. Told. You.
---
Is this Alliance or Horde? I see the flair but I‚Äôm curious how horde premades would be working.
---
That's why you dont stop at 1.
---
It's Alliance. I hope Horde are getting premades, too. Sucks about their queues times :\
---
The most popular streamers are effectively paid based on how much controversy and drama they can stir up in order to continuously grow their 'reach'. [Then put lots of effort into making it appear like they dont make as much as they really do, in order to entice people to give them more money.](https://youtu.be/OiYtHUERB4k)
---
Twitch isn't inherently designed to benefit greedy narcissists, but the culture surrounding the platform certainly doesn't discourage it.
---
You can enjoy PVP without ranking. So I guess it's not really the PVP that's important for you it's more the rank and rewards coming with it.
---
I think it is far better to farm gold. The drop rate for pearls is shit imho. 
---
If you are making truefaith farming orbs is worth it. Do 3-4man guild runs of strat live.
---
Can I join your guild?
---
what is the song?
---
Which herbs are most likely to grow in price when BWL is released? Been stacking up on different herbs for quite some time but im not sure which ones I want to sell now
---
Think it's best to wait for the sweat lords to get their r14 before trying for something like r13, he'll even rank 10. You gotta figure there's a good amount of bots and multi loggers skewing the curve right now and should die down when they get their ranks or are banned.
---
Already up to 16min queues on Herod.  AV is dying. It will just be people all AFking at some point.  
---
PVP isn‚Äôt as much fun as I remember in TBC...........
---
AC is like 60-70g on Everlook. Dang
---
can you write again but this time in english?
---
Ya I‚Äôd be upset if I had to pay a mage for food, or a portal, and an enchanter asking for a tip please I already brought the mats how dare these people try and sell a marketable ability they have
---
LF invite, BIS holy paladin, epic mount
---
So by that logic it's probably better to sell now?
---
I think (and hope) they are going to TBC too.
---
I know a large portion of people want to see Classic+ but the effort to reward alongside the risk is not worth it for Blizz when in comparison they could just polish TBC / LK and call it a day.
---
I‚Äôm sure they are mostly done with development on Classic at this point, even the unreleased dungeons so its mostly a job of maintaining servers and bugfixing while they rake up the cash.
---
Classic+ is essentially telling them to get off their asses and take a huge risk for the people to make most likely the same amount as before. I‚Äôm sure a lot of people would feel like Classic+ is just WoW2: Electric Boogaloo and it really is an off-putting topic imo.
---
I don‚Äôt trust any game developers nowadays, the industry has became solely fueled by money and the passion put into games over the years has died down to near nothing.
---
Think about the original Blizzcon panels and how those guys felt about the game - nowadays it looks like they are just going through the motions to advertise another product just like every other game developer I can think of.
---
It sucks but thats just how it is and Classic+ doesn‚Äôt fix that issue so i‚Äôd rather leave room for TBC and LK - two copies of WoW where if you paid your sub you could obtain everything in game.
---
MTX mounts in WoW was one of the biggest ‚Äòyikes‚Äô moments personally, it seems like you didn‚Äôt mind them?
---
This exploit also increases BG queue times for everybody else.
---
Yeah this works surprisingly well. It's not the best farm in the game but it is reliable, which I prefer over stuff like "you might find ONE super rare item that's worth 500g every 10h" farms
---
Incorrect
---
Cool!
---
But how exactly does this work? :p
---
The only thing I understood of this is creating a folder inside the Interface folder called "CURSORS" and that I should get an uncompressed .blp file as the graphics I want :p
---
I got trashed for asking if it was ok to need blues no one needs in dungeons as a tanking fee. I'd probably make 10-15 gold a dungeon this way. This guy is asking if a 40g fee is acceptable and is getting praised.
---
Reddit makes no sense sometimes.
---
I'd either join, get my share of the sellable and mats to be had in there, have fun killing shit or, if that didn't satisfy me, do something more fun with my time, as it's a video game meant to be fun, not a job.
---
&gt; MTX mounts in WoW was one of the biggest ‚Äòyikes‚Äô moments personally, it seems like you didn‚Äôt mind them?
---
I don't mind any microtransactions as long as they're purely cosmetic. That includes pets, mounts and fashion. Retail offers many things to individualize your character. I find that awesome. There is even a sub dedicated to show that off (/r/Transmogrification/). Yeah some mounts are a bit over the top. Most them are flying, we don't have that in classic. Pet battles would be nice thing to add to classic too i believe. #Nochanges is nice for the initial release of classic. But classic+, should it be a thing, would need some major improvements in gameplay. Also it would need a complete reset.
---
I'm out if TBC becomes a thing. Imho classic is better. And a classic+ could easily straighten some rough edges of it out.
---
Hoi means dick
---
I literally looked it up on this subreddit first and couldn't find any videos. Haters gonna hate I guess *shrug*
---
If hunts are taking BB and CHT while melee still need, they are scum bags. Plenty of other comparable options. Leaf staff, dm sword, 2 hit sword etc.
---
I just got back from a 10-day holiday ready to lvl up my 2 alts around level 40.
---
Both were not in an inn and I feel like I did myself dirty.
---
Source?
---
Currently it only works for threat you generate; so if your pet has a separate table then thats not factored in. I‚Äòll look into making it work for pet threat too in a future update.
---
There is a countdown in the discord server from 5 and at 0 everyone presses the 'join first' button at once. Everyone types in /s which AV they got, like 91,177, etc..  If enough people (or all) got the same game the raid group joins, and people who didnt got it can search the game from the list and join too.
---
I wish you were right! I would love to stay level 60 and see classic + new content , new path unseen before instead of playing all over again tbc and so on... unfortunately every streamer and their mothers are the ones blizzard listen to and they are all talking how big would be TBC and how great it was and how sure they are there will be TBC after Naxx! 
---
As much as i want arena, i want it in classic + , with the talent trees and new content within same zones, but that req resources and money and as we know Blizzard will most likely milk money of existing content such as stupid TBC instead bringing new path for us.
---
the true spirit of vanilla WoW
---
no changes, and you think you do but you dont
---
Technically the GOAT.
---
take your meds shizo
---
cmon guys, let's not bullshit ourselves, there's plenty of shitty people and stupid teenagers in classic.
---
&gt;or, if that didn't satisfy me, not join and do something more fun with my time
---
Exactly! Now you get it. Tanks would just rather not join if it isn't worth their time. So you have to make it worth their time or they'll just find something else that's more fun/important for them to do.
---
What Cantina said. Also, you want an owl.

POGGERS

IMO druid. Feel like most of these replies for mage are with gold farming in mind which you have more than covered being a hunter.
---
Druid seems to be uncommon from what I have noticed and would allow you to gear up really fast and skip a lot of effort in getting weapons that everyone and their mother also wants. Really not sure why I see so few druids. I leveled one long ago and enjoyed how flexible they are. (If I end up leveling another it will be a druid. But I have 2 twinks to finish and WC3 is coming out soon which will eat my time.)
---
You can build as tank, melee DPS, heals, ranged caster DPS. I know oomkin has it's issues but the choice is there. Melee dps is suppose to be pretty capable from what I've heard but you have to farm the gnomer wep to get there. 
---
Both healer and tank are pretty good and would allow you easily fill a slot for raids/instances to help out whoever you feel like.
---
It‚Äôs probably best to sell right when p3 release date gets announced
---
Last I heard he quit streaming to travel or something?
---
Cool to see him making WoW content!
---
Totally reasonable
---
How does this even affect you? If you‚Äôre not a no lifer you‚Äôre maxing out at around r7 anyways.
---
Dm East on farm hell ya brother
---
It actually makes it harder
---
Yep. Totally missed it. Thanks
---
Yes unbuffed
---
About the only difference in the guides between Vanilla and Classic is things were written down in Vanilla. Now days everything is a video which you have wade through to get the answer you need.
---
Whoops sorry bout that, hard to follow who posted what sometimes.
---
My point stands though.  It's even shittier to try and make somebody do what they dont want during their free time.  It's even shittiet to go around talking shit like a teenaged girl afterwards.
---
And seriously...if he isn't having fun, and doesnt want to be there then why would anyone wanna subject themselves to that?  You really think raids are gonna go well when the most important member wants to be doing anything but that?  You think guild morale is gonna stay up while you drag him down?  It's a game, not a job, and certainly not a responsibility.
---
The Cleaner. Not cleaver
---
According to the druid youtuber ebbnflow, kitty is the fastest leveler. The increased damage taken is offset by the faster killtimes, ending up with comparable downtime. 
---
Doing AOE pulls (3 at a time) is possible, but you will need to stop to heal after each one, and you will spend more time on your ass, drinking. Not recommended, but doable.
---
Yes, but how many empire state buildings is that?
---
If you decay and lose rank, will you lose your title and ability to wear the gear?
---
Dremlock is back? Dremlock 4 inspired me to roll Ele back in Wrath and its been one of my favorite specs ever since. I even still have my retail Shaman on Dunemaul.
---
It depends on how competitive your server/faction is since you're only competing against your faction on your server. The general consensus for months has been that eventually you should be able to hit rank 10 with a couple hours a day spent in PvP.  The bottleneck for rank starts at rank 11.  
---
Right now ranking competition is absolutely fierce, with people still spamming AV as much as possible for rep - but I think after another week or so it won't be so extreme, and the number of people farming honor will stabilize and become more predictable.  Lots of people will lose their motivation to push rank for a variety of reasons, and as those people fall away there will be less competition.
---
Guys its me im the warrior in the joke.
---
Boom boom boom. Clapped.
---
[Citation needed]
---
Good luck finding a guild that will take a feral and an oomkin and stack them in a group with you just so you can do kinda sorta okay damage
---
Absolutely not.  Many people who push for rank 14 will never be able to get past rank 13 with their playing BG's 12 hours a day.  If you're playing a couple hours every night, I think you'll be lucky to hit rank 11.
---
I've leveled a warrior to around 35, no WW axe yet. It's by far not as hard as people claim. Dying to 2 mobs is a non issue after sweeping strikes, and the warrior is far from the only class that has to sit down and eat after every few pulls. The only thing that sucks is that I can't solo elites.
---
I've also leveled a Druid to 55 now. Sure, leveling was easy mode, but I wasn't a whole lot faster than the warrior, I just died less. I've tanked pretty much all of the leveling dungeons and now BRD as well up to torch room. 
---
It's not a lot of additional work compared to dps. If anything, healing is more stressful. Charge in, demo shout/roar, tab spam the highest threat ability (maul for me, sunder for warrs), taunt if anything runs to the healer. What's so hard about that? I never played wow or tanked in an MMO before classic and by just using external dungeon maps and reading through boss mechanics once before doing them I was able to lead groups no problem. Yeah, warriors have higher repair costs, but unlike everyone but rogues and mages they don't need to buy water, so what gives?
---
This whole "tanking is 2x as much effort as anything else and I deserve to be paid to play the role" is overblown. I believed it as well and leveled two tanks to try it out myself. It's not true.
---
Y doesn‚Äôt everyone stack?
---
have they fucked up tho?
---
As time goes on I see Blizzard running 1 possibly 2 low maintenance dedicated Classic servers that reset after a full content release. 
---
 But that's just me.
---
Just go there and have a look. You definitely will find people there that you can easily solo.
---
Happened to us once.
---
That's why now we have a couple hunter run ahead with track humanoid on, so we know what to expect. I bet that premade now does the same.
---
Premades adapt.
---
U can have 1 in your bag
---
Stockades are compact, allowing for massive pulls. They have higher lvl mobs, meaning wool will drop more often, than linen.
---
Mixed them up my b.
---
If priest charge to heal and res? Replace, almost instantly found a new one.
---
If mage charge to sheep? Get started with conjuring some water for the party before we kick and replace you. I do pay mages for water in cities, they already gey their share.
---
Warlock charge to summon? Is he part of the group? Usually if there are a warlock from another group outside the dungeon im doing and my party is far away, Ill ask him to summon and then pay a bit for it. Warlock in my group wants to be payed to summon? Well, he gets time delayed just as much as everyone else in the party because of it. There is no incentive for anyone to pay him.
---
Rogue charging to open doors? I guess only applicable in DM tribute. Well, better start backtracking and killing the boss for the key. Less chance for his elven tarnished ring.
---
Also why do you think tank DME jump runs are seen as so profitable? Usually because they get to take all the arcane crystals. They're literally reserving the equivalent of all orbs.
---
One thing you have to understand is that if there are 1:3 relation between tanks and dps and 1:1 tanks to healers, then finding a dungeon would be perfectly fine... But people dont play this gamr for dungeons. They play for raids. In a raid you dont need 8 tanks out of 40 people. Your usual raid team will have 3-4 tanks with maybe one feral that can switch to tanking in some fights. That means that the relation between tank and healer will be around 1:2-1:3, and the relation between tank and dps will be around 1:20-1:30 in a raid team. Do some simple math and compare the two optimal numbers and you'll realize why warriors might go tank in the first 2 weeks, put parties together specifically not to share loot with anyone (because they can) get their full pre raid BIS for fury dps and then respec to fury. Its their best play. 
---
Those that actually got a raid spot as a tank, and can stay as protection for ever are the ones that can remain consistent as tanks and they will get so geared out from the raids that item drops in dungeons will be useless from them. They will defenitely do dungeon runs with their guildies to help out their dps and healers to gear up without charging for it. But they do not care for random people. Random people are not entitled to their time. You want to waste 30min-2hours looking for a tank for your stratholme live run? Absolutely fine. You are not entitled to force a tank to come to your run any more than the tank is entitled to demand any orb drops. You want to get a tank the proper motivation to use his time specifically to gear you up with the items you need, which he will literally never benefit of? Give him some of the valuable loot from the dungeon so that he gets something too!
---
LC is best for hardcore, well established guilds.  For casual guilds who don't have the exact same 40 people showing up every raid day, DKP is better.
---
Ya my bad, was very late :P
---
Did not know, ally player :P
---
Oddly enough I got it last night within the first 15 kills which was really lucky, they sell for 400 gold on my server so I was super pumped. I actually got the other eye drop from mc last night too, so now I just gotta complete the quest, which seems a bit challenging and I'll have the staff. 
---
Thanks to all for the advice
---
Yup. It's gamer time.
---
Ahh thank you for Clarification
---
&gt;i have like 40 stacks from my tribute runs,  
---
&gt; why is it dropping ? 
---
Because other people have 40 stacks from tribute runs, and they're trying to sell them.  Supply is flooded.
---
They go up again after the initial stockpiles dry up too, but I agree they peak before the release
---
It is supposed to be transparent?
---
I have so much icecap from queuing in Org and flying up to Winterspring. I usually get about 6-8 before the queue pops. Had 100 in no time.
---
Yea I get it. I played an enhancement shaman back in vanilla and it was tons of fun. I was in a raiding guild and did some raids with them but not a ton, but was of course 1 of 1 enhancement shamans. It is certainly possible for you to get a spot but will certainly be more difficult. 
---
I‚Äôd recommend trying to be more flexible and learn resto and be willing to respec as needed with the understanding that your main spec is enhancement and you are going to roll accordingly. 
---
Of course it‚Äôs all a game and if that‚Äôs not fun for you then just stick with what is.
---
I miss Stalagg, honestly. I wanted to grind rank on that server. Half of our guild came here, though, before we had a chance to talk about it. Sorry if you've dealt with toxicity from individuals from our server.
---
Oh no, someone is queuing into a BG. Better make a call out thread.
---
Alliance is dumber in all things. It is known
---
This isn't strictly true. We got people in dungeon blues and mixed greens but a few enchants will make it look like you care. Epic mount is obviously required though as is a headset and working mic.
---
I think you don't get it then. It's greedy to expect people to drop everything and work for you for no gain. It's not greedy to expect to benefit from your time spent. This is like socialists thinking people who earned their money are greedy for wanting to keep it all while not getting the irony that they are the greedy ones for wanting to take other people's money that they didn't earn.
---
Show us on the doll where the mage sheeped you.
---
Check with your guild. If you plan to pug, just do it.
---
Kk don‚Äôt pay man
---
It wasn't just one patch, they completely redid many raid items multiple times to bring caster scaling more in line with melees and to eliminate usless stats.
---
Here's an example:
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?item=16798](https://classicdb.ch/?item=16798)
---
Yes, yes it is. Especially when you can get many veins an hour.
---
I attempted it 3 times by myself in about an hour, nobody else around, then got a couple of guildies to help me, fun fact if you have a mage stand where the skeletons spawn and he DOES NOT MOVE EVER they can spam arcane explosion without summoning the cleaner (at least when i did it 2 months ago)
---
Well that's individual and that's another story. I think most of the people who can afford doing AFK AVs for 18 hours can play as well and would rather do that (maybe for 18 hours, maybe for less).
---
Tab name is a bad word. Fix and make read-only.
---
To be honest: yes. If the initial galv push doesent work we run around like headless chicken, no grouping no teamwork. And if we somehow manage to get south some impatient player pulls drek with all warmasters. In random groups 1 or 2 win in 10 games
---
Join a guild then and play dungeons with your guild. There is absolutely no reason to complain about the state of the game. My server has not started to implement orb reservations yet, but i would very much like for that to happen, although it probably wont. If you think wow is about cooperation, you might have to time travel back a few years. People's mindset is different. Wow is today about grinding with intention of making your character stronger long term and short term. Most people dont care about the gear of others outside of their friend spectrum and raid roster. Combine this with the mindset of trying to gear out yourself and you'll realize why they charge for tanking. It helps their own character gear out rather than pausing their gearing out process for 1 hour.
---
Maybe you should have complained 15 years ago but imo now that ship has sailed, deal with it or accept it but nothings going to change.
---
It just seems weird to me, like people deciding a TV show from the 80‚Äôs is no longer good enough for everyone 50 years later - no shit, it was a product of it‚Äôs time.
---
Wow if I was horde this would be an easy sell. Good luck out there oi boys if I see you I'll remember to stay away from the pvp gods
---
On the other hand you can't trinket stack anymore, so you can't activate ZHC and ToEP or the natural alignment crystal together anymore.
---
As soon as BWL comes out, ele shamans would happily trade the current +sp out to be able to double trinket again.
---
What are some items I can start collecting now that will have value in a later phase or event? (like the eggs for gingerbread cookies, etc)
---
AAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
Yeah I don't think that's based within any type of logic. By that reasoning, a man working in retail during Black Friday is apparently the biggest asshole on the planet.
---
Why owl?
---
Genuinely not even sure.
---
Ok then what about world bosses? Unless your server is dead there is raid loot you MUST pvp for
---
I am in east battlegroup for the US. We only have an average of about 40 people in the BG.
---
Hero we don‚Äôt deserve
---
I haven't read anything about them doing this. A lot of people complaining about being mass reported for trying to play instead of zerging though. So it is/was being abused.
---
Aye it is frustrating as hell, if I end up going back to WoW, I'm just going to do my own thing.
---
I am considering leveling my warlock to 60 finally as it's my favourite class.
---
You say "drops" but i dont know if thats 100% chance either way im leading a group right now and im going to master loot just before willey dies HEHEHEHEHEHHE
---
They are. The repair bill is very small compared to the time bill.
---
Heartseeker is a refuge of cowards and toxic players from other servers so fuckem
---
It's New Amsterdam, just a marketing ploy
---
That was not his question! Ofc if u put more time and effort you should be better rewarded, but in all honesty it is a GAME  and a paid one, so ppl have to work for money , bills, expenses , electricity , internet and so on IRL... FOOD! Tell me now is it normal even for the best gear that you HAVE  to play 18 hrs  a day? So for sleeping , go to work, taking bath , shopping ( family or GF ) u have the rest 6 hrs ? Unless you are streamer ( a person that lives on their chairs , has bi families or anything meaningful  IRL) how on earth  is this 18 hrs every day a norm ?!
---
Now 6-7 hrs looks a lot but u can still go to work and sacrifice from tour sleep for a period of time and get something done, but 18 hrs ... and you even proudly defending  and brag about that many hours is SAD. On top of it has absolutely nothing to do with how good you are in pvp, only that " hey look i i havent slept months , im bot working or having family and the biggest thing in my life is to sit in my chair 99% of the time im awake" . 
---
Good for you bro, but it is not  normal and it should demand less than that for sure. If everyone of the millions of players were jobless lifeless ranker, game would be dead with just few thousand subs cause u know... u cant be all streamers and someone has to actually work for money  and have families .
---
Go habs go
---
Yolomouse works great
---
Tldr this guy doesn't like pve
---
its so pathetic how much people will do for these streamers. When they dont even get a simple acknowledgement of their efforts even. sad people.
---
It‚Äôs called a circle jerk
---
Why don‚Äôt you put 5-6 on def at chokepoints while maintaining offense of around 20-25 like we do? I‚Äôve never seen ally do that. You‚Äôre just either full offense or all mid.
---
I have no issues finding groups without reservations, and if it's a weird time and there's legit nobody online, I just level my Druid instead, which is more fun than chasing minuscule upgrades so much that I spam LFM for an hour.
---
&gt;People's mindset is different. [...] Most people dont care about the gear of others outside of their friend spectrum and raid roster.
---
I completely agree. That's what I'm trying to talk about in my post, and what I describe as a selfish and greedy mentality that should have no place in our community.
---
&gt;you'll realize why they charge for tanking.
---
I know why they do it, and why they get away with doing it, I just think it's greedy and selfish.
---
Fucking esfand is so ignorant, he really is at the same level of stupidity as tipsout
---
Not groomsblood?
---
Ytmnd... Now that is a name I haven't heard in a long, long time..
---
We do gold bids for them. To stock the guild bank. Ive bought 2 for 150g each. Only bid that much to contribute.
---
I don't understand
---
Rip
---
No its not tied... in every game on steam or battlenet you can have your ingame nickname, even real ID has its own name you can choose.
---
So theres just as much anonymity now as there was before... you are just less incentivized to do hacking since your entire account can get banned, where as back in the  day hacking wasnt as easy so most people  didnt bother doing it even tho your account wasnt as valuable.
---
Now its alot easier to hack,  as the tools have been developed further and are even easier to use, but your accounts are more  valuable  so you are less likely to do it.
---
Ofcourse if you play in an already toxic inducing community then you would always experience toxicity... the change is drastic if you used to be in one but no longer play so you might imagine there was more toxicity.
---
Ive never played in dota or cs or any other known toxic communities and still dont...  so my experience comes from communities that arent supposed to be toxic but yet they have become more due to the society changing overtime and toxicity overflowing into other communities aswell.
---
Its a hypothetical. Jesus fucking christ, its not complicated.
---
Honestly great theory crafting right here.
---
The problem I‚Äôm seeing is that this will likely drive people away from enhancement shaman. I got sweaty just watching it.
---
Updated the post
---
It's not a constant, depending on your gear 1% crit is 30-60AP.
---
It's value goes up as you get more AP.
---
Lots of those mages are alts though. All the warriors in my guild have lvl 60 mage alts for gold farming. Except one who has a hunter instead.
---
Depending on server pop, herbalism. I'm on a pretty dead server, and herbalism is a slow and steady moneymaker, plus you get mats for consumables pretty quick.
---
You can go 1-300 herba in a few hours, especially with herbalist gloves with the enchant to get +10, which lets you grind way more orange herbs, which significantly speeds up levelling it.
---
Never knew this until last night, been buddies with him for about 3-4 weeks now. Pretty cool.
---
I mean this in the nicest way possible. Fuck you and your cursed monkey paw.
---
Looking for solutions to encourage more people to play tanks was neither the point of OP's nor my post.
---
All I'm saying is that it's not to make the community of this video game an environment where you have to pay people to do their role in a group.
---
Not really related to your question but drop skinning. There is little money to be had for the time it takes to kill things you can skin and actually skin them. 
---
I had 300 skin and LW on my shaman and gold I come was poor. Dropped skin for herb and now I no longer have a want for gold but it keeps on coming in. 
---
At lvl 60 you will need to have the skinning knife and/or hand chant for skinning to do anything lvl 61+. Thick and rugged leather do not sell for much. (Especially considering the time it takes vs something like herb or mine.) Devilsaur leather has been dropping steadily in price since people aren't needing the items it makes as much anymore. 
---
IMO pick up something like smithing or engineer to go along with your mining.  Make a level 5 alt with enchanting to disenchant BoE's.
---
Swipe only hits three targets in front of you for a tiny amount of damage. You won‚Äôt be clearing packs of anything with it.
---
thats how much xp he can donate to people in his party. 4 people at level will get a decent amount from a 60 killing it all.
---
thats my guess
---

I always just stand in the middle of the alliance rush and wait until I see a healer that I will pick out.
---
Is the reason you say delete if not undead bc undead can‚Äôt be feared and fear is a huge weakness to rogues? I‚Äôm genuinely asking btw
---
Biznasty‚Äôs selling techniques my man
---
Elemental Mastery also never allowed for double crits until Blizzard added simulated spell batching in Classic
---
same
---
well not every server fixes brackets though.
---
I did that for my eye of shadow it's boring and quite hard.  You have to only kill the succubus mobs really.  Anything else is not worth the effort
---
If you say anything, no matter what it is. Its wrong and you will be flamed for it. Its just casuals and plebs in AV now. All the tryhards have been exalted a week and do premades so we dont have to be in AVs with noobs who want the "classic experience".
---
He‚Äôs still working on those numbers but well over 40G/H. I‚Äôve filled up 72 slots of bag space in one run. Lol
---
Lolret
---
We sure will, just wait for the bwl attunement quest, its gonna be wild
---
It worked by the way!!! If you ever need an Alliance priest to MC/Kill the Ony head guy so your guild can get head drop before you raid... let me know!
---
Little unrelated but I was thinking one of the reasons I've enjoyed classic so much more than  retail is each class I've leveled feels much different than the previous. All my alts all retail and basically spam abilities til you get a big one and then repeat. On classic, since each class is more unique it feels more rewarding playing new alts. I honestly don't have time to play all the alts I'd like but when I do it makes me want to try new things because i know it will feel different than whatever i currently play
---
You should be focused on getting healing gear and respec to the only spec you are good as.
---
Spell batching. It should work anytime you can get two of the right type of effect to batch together.
---
Hey there, " A little salty" from Kromcrush raids 11:30 pm Server Time (22:30 ST) And we are horde. Would u be interested?
---
That is correct, in the updated video which isn‚Äôt the full run but what was captured he explains everything that can go wrong and tips and tricks he‚Äôs found doing this run, if you get hit you‚Äôll be 1 shot easily.
---
Reddit is a lot of different people. Only bad players think a tank charging for runs is unreasonable and you don‚Äôt wanna run with them anyways.
---
Who's shaming anyone? His username is literally imaUPSdriver.
---
What? That's not how it works.  If it were just a problem of "filling a queue that needs players that aren't there" then horde would have instant queue times for every 10 players that queued in a battlegroup.  If these 2 players hadn't been waiting in queue for however long then the group's queue wouldn't instantly pop just from reaching 10 players.
---
/afk
---
95% + of mages cant do this
---
Anyone else with both alliance and horde characters notice how toxic alliance are in BGs towards their own team? On horde people are joking, referencing dumb memes and just having a laugh. I've seen two toxic comments that I remember in total after grinding AV till exalted and WSG almost till honored on horde, one of the guys those guys was made fun of until he left the BG. On my alliance character almost every BG where we don't completely stomp horde turns into a shitshow as soon as we meet any kind of resistance.
---
Are alliance players the people who throw a fit every time they meet resistance IRL? Maybe horde is just happy to finally be through the queue and get to do some PvP, win or lose?
---
man it sounds awful to play alliance
---
Thats about it. The new meta is fury/prot for this reason exactly. Nothing below 20 pts in prot gives any mitigation. Ss gives a high threat low cost move thats nice for a fresh lvl 60 to tank with. Once u get a little gear (blues&amp;an epic or 2) fury prot generates WAY more threat. The general consensus on the warrior discord "fight club" is that for all non-raid(open world, 5 man dps/tanking, and pvp) content arms is the optimal spec, and for raids it is furyprot for tanking and furyarms for dps.
---
not really, an entire raid can loot it at once and he respawns pretty quick
---
If you're after something you can run solo whenever, run RFD. Runs are a few minutes each so you get locked after 30 minutes or so, is log to an alt or do something else while you wait. I find it's perfect for AV queue (I'm Horde). I queue in org, fly to Taurajo, run to RFD and run it till queue pops. 20-40g per hour depending on drops. Not the highest GPH but very easily soloable even in PvP gear with a shield on. Here's a video guide. https://youtu.be/4fSYIswyoKs

I had a friend, right when the honor mafias were forming, who had an identical twin brother who shared his character. The mafia tried to force them into the line with empty threats and whatnot so him and his brother took a few weeks off of work to play Bags 24/7 for several weeks. They held grand marshal the entire time
---
When i summoned the yeti the cleaner demon spawned instantly. Did you guys do it in classic or vanilla?
---
&gt; Once u get a little gear (blues&amp;an epic or 2) fury prot generates WAY more threat.
---
This is 100% wrong lmao
---
I'm not saying it isn't a good weapon for a fresh 60. I just don't think it's worth epic mount money.
---
PvP sucks until TBC.  In fact, it could be said that TBC didn't made vanilla a great game.  
---
WoW is about enjoying the journey on the way to sweet loot.  If you're grinding PvP for gear and it's tedious or boring, the loot isn't worth it. 
---
And there will always be newer and better loot, so don't burn out on one phase of the game.
---
It's just pretty much non existant.

I had someone randomly whisper me yesterday with just "I hate you".

All I want is just someone to tell me to either wear crit gear but take more damage or use healing/damage gear to take more hits but crit less

I mean, it sounds like you think the warriors started this or something. Often you message a warrior, asking to tank, they say no because they have nothing to do there (hello Strat live). Group gets desperate, because all the warriors are saying no for the same reason ... Can you blame them? "Hey would you like to spend 2 hours in here, lose money, and get no character advancement?" Sure on occasion you might say yes if you're feeling generous. Most of the time though, that's a hard pass for everyone. The group still needs the instance though.. so they start offering orbs. How is a warrior greedy for accepting their offer?
---
It's the same reason I pay a healer to run arena/anger with me. If they have golem gear, why would they come? I needed to run those things 200+ times. Gold is easier to come by than healers, so I pay. The healer isn't greedy, I'm the one offering! I need the runs, and I'd rather farm gold + pay than wait an indefinite amount of time.
---
Fury lets u dw while tanking generating lots more threat as well as giving u access to flurry (30%as) and enrage(25%dmg) while not missing out on the improved threat from prot tree... while deep prot gives u.... nothing in the way of threat.
---
The problem is the gear is overturned... 1.11 itemized pvp gear and bwl not even out
---
I love how with all that considered, a mediocre geared warrior will still do better dps.
---
ahh interesting.
---
Which server(s) doesn't fix brackets?
---
So glad I went with this server. Lots of kickass people and not many douches I‚Äôve found. Once BG‚Äôs started I really saw how good we have it with the playerbase on Kurinaxx.
---
ROLFstomping people as a premade on the lower pop faction was a staple of vanilla wow... 
---
9/10 of my wsg games were guild premades where you completely fucking dominated people still wearing blues and maybe the odd person had some mc gear.
---
Will try that, thank you for recomendation.
---
When/why do they become valuable?
---
TiL Shield Slam and 1h Specialization dont exist
---
Look, we know once geared fury prot is bis for threat, but theres no reason to lie and say deep prot does nothing for threat.
---
 Until you are stacking mountains of crit/ap and hit capped deep prot generates more threat because of how powerful Shield Slam is for snap threat
---
Lol thanks for the worthless post. Goodluck getting help with your responses to people.
---
Woulda preferred an Unregistered HyperCam 2 for authenticity.
---
I did gather first, it still wouldnt Mark up on the map after.

Thanks for recommendation!

Is that THE Dremlock? Played on Dunemaul back in the day? I love this game.

After they all leave there are less spots at the top.

This week is much better for anyone going for the top 4-5 ranks, and worse for everyone else.
---
No, because you can't cannibalise them for maximum bm, you will also be looked down upon for corpsecamping, but if youre undead it's an exception, they should have known what's coming. Fear resist is top too tho
---
Depends. My warrior is in full prebis and starting to acquire raid gear. If you arent a friend or guild member youd have to pay me to go into most 5 mans. Why would I go if not for $$$ if I have the gear already

That seems like less of a premade and more about just having voice chat up with your pug. The lengths people go to just to avoid using the in game voice chat is funny.
---
Yeah I don't believe you
---
You can still be an Enhancement shaman without going full-sweaty, just, you're going to be relegated to swinging Nightfall while totem-twisting.
---
I was 16. My guild told me I wouldn‚Äôt be able to do it because I had crap gear. Proceeded to one shot them in a day and my guild was like ‚Äúwut?!‚Äù. Was honestly one of my favorite moments in vanilla.
---
This made sense before BGs but the world is empty again now that they're out
---
Make sure you‚Äôre using the full range of your abilities. If you‚Äôre having trouble keeping aggro, before you pull swap out and cast a regrowth and rejuv on yourself and then switch back to bear. Make sure you are swiping when you can, and tab target to some of the off target mobs and build some aggro on them too.
---
Reported for loot hacks
---
Fury prot required a certain amount of crit to produce more threat than deep prot. I think it's 18% unbuffed. Moreover you lose out on tactical mastery, a great talent when tanking dungeons. So fury/prot is primarily a raid tanking spec, which required you to have pretty much raid bis, to be viable at this point. Also you will no longer be uncritable, due to not having shield block. So for now deep prot is superior. When bwl gear comes out fury/prot will start to produce much more threat than deep prot. For now deep prot is the superior spec.
---
Check out the discord channel noted above.. I should get the link for you..
---
Also Skarm‚Äôs YouTube vids, can really explain the talent trees and options for you. And his discord.
---
First time tank, lvl 51 checking in. Those references have proven very valuable. Up through about 32-33 everyone was telling me to do it differently nearly every day... my respec costs holy shit... lol
---
What is your current spec?
---
It only works for alliance with their instant queues.
---
I'd be surprised if the pool shrunk more than 10% on pvp servers.   That's only 1, maybe 2, less slots in bracket 14.
---
Simple, alliance have fast queues so as soon as they see something go wrong they gg out. Horde have long queues so they try harder each game. I hate this short queue bs no one is trying to win every wants to lose the second any small thing goes wrong
---
That's the big problem with LC. Funneling loot to their friends is actually one of the more legitimate things you can do. It doesn't make sense to funnel gear to some random person that's only been in the guild for 1-2 raids since they may leave. Your good friends (probably the officers and members of the LC) are going to stick around. After all, gear only benefits the guild as a whole if it stays within the guild. 
---
It's a pretty terrible situation really.
---
I don't really see doing something in game as an exploit.  They aren't using 3rd party software or having someone else play their account so I'm gonna go ahead and say this is fine.  If other people want to they can just do the same thing.  That's what min/max is all about.
---
You are shit at confirming. The buffs stack, the bonuses dont
---
When ever you can get an inv to raid!  Just dont be in full greens and you should be ok
---
Nope doesnt work. Buffs stack, effects dont.
---
He's right though
---
Stalagg alliance is actually a pretty tough bunch of bastards relative to server population. Makes sense that once they weeded out all the casuals who xferred to heartseeker that the strongest would be left standing.
---
-Stalagg horde
---
There was a Discord that preceded this one that is/was more open. Someone DM'd me an invite to the second one that we're discussing now. There are two MAIN cross-server Discords running, to my knowledge.
---
You can buy it on the AH for cheaper than the firewater. Its also easily farmed as it drops raidwide
---
Better: add lightning bolt before, takes time to travel and in that time you pop EM+CL and a shock, even more burst damage. Lightning bolt, chain lightning and earth shock all hit the same time
---
yes but the buffs dont stack
---
"People cheat. Anybody that doesnt like it should just give up"
---
Lol good luck with that mentality
---
As a Dunemaul OG, I approve this message.
---
Hey man, grats on the rag kill.  Must be nice to finally see your members get to 10/10 on the hardest content available.  It always feels better when you accomplish something with people you know :)
---
This.
---
ice lance is BC not classic.
---
wow isnt a skill-based game, bad comparison.
---
It's called the pity spot.
---
&gt; Good reputation is worth more
---
Good reputation's value is entirely dependent on the people you have the reputation with. If it's some random shit guild that isn't going to do anything, or a bunch of people you don't really like, it's worthless.
---
He jerked it for his personal benefit atleast
---
Lol, okay buddy
---
Just saying, AV premades are far from roflstomp, it's way too easy to hold drek rush, with recalls or especially with snowballs.
---
Aimed auto multi makes them explode like a tick on a dog.
---
I know warrior is one of the best PvP toons at 60 however very gear dependant.
---
What would be the minimum you would say gear wise to still have fun and do damage without ‚Äúbreaking the bank‚Äù so to say?
---
I'm not sure how much of this is incorrect, concerning the exact numbers of crit, but it is incorrect.  Top guilds are using fury tanks.  You don't need a deep prot tank at all when fights are between 15 and 45 seconds
---
I hate streamers. Pure, straight loathe them. This however is not an exploit.
---
I didnt drop surefoot till sometime in AQ (back in vanilla) due to stacking items with raw AGI for added RAP with GBoK. I used surefoot and +3 scope for a very long time and rings from DM. 
---
I swapped to AV ring after getting exalted and found that keeping the 9% hit was easy to do and could better items with items with more raw AGI on them. 
---
Once we have BWL and ZG you will see that itemization will get more wonkey and the raw BIS list is going to be able to be played with a bit.
---
LF Invite also!
---
Thanks for the actual advice lol  everything you listed was exactly what we had trouble with tbh
---
I‚Äôd say solo farming ZF or mara as levelling mage is still better bc it‚Äôs more consistent and less prone to time lost. still a cool vid though.
---
Horde have tried getting premades, but with their 10-15 min queues, they can't simply leave queue and requeue if people don't get into the same one. My friend had over 60 people queueing, and was hard to get more than 10 in a single BG. Apparently the horde pool of queuers is simply too big.
---
Who... cares?
---
But they aren't strangers, that would be a good scenario if everyone was a PUG. This is more like you joined a new military unit. Question is the free and easy reputation/rapport you'd potentially build with your new team of higher worth to you than 550g? (Since they offered you 300). I'd only say yes if it was a good guild (one of the top on your server) and you planned to raid there for the entirety of classic.
---
That early in the release cycle, since no one was really PvPing hardcore (no honor system yet), and people were still farming pre-Raid BIS, I think they logically came to the conclusion that it would be easier to get into BRM on a server where we weren't being forced to death run multiple times over. 
---
We came from Stalagg first wave.
---
I would do it half price for them. So if that‚Äôs 300g sure go for it.
---
600g I‚Äôd say, 300g guildie price is insanely little compared to 850g. 
---
Me personally I hate being forced to give ‚Äúguildie price‚Äù. I‚Äôd sell it for 800g priority to guildie, if no buyers I‚Äôll sell 850g to randoms. If guild actually needs something like ingots or bars I‚Äôm happy to donate, but not like this.
---
We got a skullflame shield drop in strat UD, and it was passed to our tank.
---
2 days later the shield from garr dropped, havent see the shield since. Bb 500g
---
You just have to look at some of the best ret parses on wow logs, best pallies with Hand of Ragnaros have lower dps than my fresh 60 warrior with 1/3 prebis and a shitty 2.3 speed 2H axe.
---
I started leveling a warrior alt last night finally (after dreading it since everyone says it‚Äôs the worst) and to be honest it‚Äôs not half as bad as people say (I have a priest main and I‚Äôve leveled shaman and rogue too)
---
I can also funnel gold to my warrior to my main. 
---
My question is where/why does it start to get bad? I‚Äôm assuming being able to funnel gold will help too?
---
You are both correct. Even alliance players hate typical alliance players.
---
I did this over the last week. If you recruit a 2nd or 3rd person to help, you can clear the AFKers quick :) I was scared of getting banned at first but tbh this is some of the most fun I‚Äôve had in classic.
---
You DO NOT have to have BiS gear. You have to have 100% mount and follow directions.
---
Volunteering to wield [Nightfall](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19169/nightfall) when it releases with BWL is probably one of the best ways you can make yourself useful as a Ret Paladin.
---
This picture is innaccurate, noone ever posts Caster Daggers on the AH for sale, it's all Agi shit. Lol
---
All I do in AV is fish lol
---
Ugh Esfand is such an insufferable whiny bitch
---
Horde has long queues so they try to win their games at all costs. Alliance has instant queues so they just want the games to end fast, no matter who wins. Is that too hard to understand?
---
It's true. Even premades get fucked sometimes by good Horde coordination and disruption.
---
Yes that‚Äôs something I didn‚Äôt take into consideration. I haven‚Äôt raided with them yet. They claim they clear rag in 2 hours so.. we shall see
---
No offense, but I am pretty sure you are desocialized irl if you cannot solve these "problems" in a 15yo game that was designed for children/teens. Anyway, over and out.
---
Hold the ring until your first raid, IMO.
---
If the raid is smooth and you enjoy the vibe, check out the mages to see if any of them would want the ring- and sell to them directly for a discount, like 500-600g instead of 850 or 300.
---
If the raid is super painful and disorganized, bounce and enjoy your new epic mount.
---
For all you know, the GM is going to turn around and flip the ring for 850- that would be 550g profit for them and 300g to you.
---
Man you just replied to a parody vid with this...
---
Was the ‚ÄòDM: East - On Farm‚Äô not obvious enough?
---
Wasn't that a popular theory way back that the Blizz devs before Vanilla launched nerfed specifically melee paladins and shamans because they were hybrids and thus shouldn't be able to do anything well?
---
Yeah I pop mages like they were pimples.
---
For alliance you mean?
---
2-3 hours isn't bad, you can get rank 7-8 with that once the AV rep rush is over, since currently you're competing with hundreds of players trying to get their exalted rewards.
---
&gt; So at that rate it will take about a month of grinding until I could get some gear?
---
Oh. Yes it will, and more.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing with you, you have yet to make a valid point that I would consider arguing. Please go take your meds.
---
You are right. It is used to refer to the status of a process or application and not the server itself.
---
&lt;insert fast queue response to justify my bad faction&gt;
---
After unpacking blizzard interface art data its **Interface\CURSOR** folder and files **Point.blp** and **UnablePoint.blp** .. I am using PS with .blp plugin to edit .blp files
---
Horde.
---
None of those things are are easy/readily available as playing a video game, which effectively can be done by just pushing a button.
---
I leveled an alt to 35 and it was pretty easy as a warrior. But being an alt and always having good weapons makes things easier. You also know more about the game.
---
I just wanted to comment on the lack of non-staff caster weapons on the AH in general while levelling
---
Druid and yes everything is on farm with 2 raids
---
On TF I can't think of any afternoon raids. Your best bet might be to make your own guild and offer PUG/alt raids with MS&gt;OS rolling. That's still a long shot but at least you'll be guaranteed a  spot and the time you need.
---
You'll need a core group though or you'll have too much RNG week to week and well have trouble clearing consistently.
---
There is no need to argue anymore because I already won the argumentation several times. Again, read your headline and your replies. One day, maybe, you will understand and say sorry to me. Till then, I am not forgiving you.
---
We will definitely take Dreadmist into consideration then! Looks like there are way more Allies according to the realmpopulation site though? 
---
But please I beg your forgiveness.
---
Yea gotta love those raids that are nothing but warriors for dps.
---
:eyeroll:
---
Add it the op. Would be very interesting.
---
Good boy. Here, take this karma point.
---
how do you join these premade discords?
---
Value of gold does change, gold gets easier to come by because of inflation
---
For the enchant if you're pvping you want to put a chain on it.
---
"so I started blasting aoe"
---
Wym?
---
You are being dense. We are just talking about a situation here.
---
You‚Äôre right. It definitely takes no skill to press 1 button in raids and get max rank just by the amount of time you invest
---
1/29/21 (still just 48 and my last build is the resto)
---
Our healers/dps we‚Äôre above me. I wasn‚Äôt sure if I just sucked. Lol.
---
Thank you.
---
Ok but not everyone is in a top guild.....
---
It's ideal to fix brackets so everyone can get some sleep every week, but plenty of servers have bracket breakers pushing super hard that makes everyone else push even harder to control the brackets.
---
Stalagg is one of the servers that do not currently have an agreement on honor caps - Grizzly is absolutely dominating our brackets because of 2 people as far as I know and it's making life miserable for those of us who are just trying to maintain in Bracket 4 for our one rank a week.
---
A guildy got a freezing band and gave it to me for 300g in a run I wasn't even in.
---
Can‚Äôt have a pally ever kill anything, that‚Äôs against blizzard policy
---
Blizzard will do something eventually. There are many topics on this matter.
---
Heart of the wild 1/29/ rest in resto
---
That‚Äôs a good idea! Eventually would like to learn how to air brush.
---
Edit the Original Post with the poll.
---
You want as much critical strike as possible in both PvE and PvP due to the Vengeance talent. But for PvP you only want to wear plate gear since you'll actually be taking hits. So you'll have to build two different Ret sets (with a lot of crossover of course). You'll also need to take a healing set to raids for the fights where you can't DPS (such as Rag). I've got four different sets of gear so far on my Paladin. One for tanking, healing, PvE DPS and PvP DPS.
---
My level was 47, group mates were...
---
53 healer
---
46 mage
---
47 hunter
---
48 warlock
---
Arms is generally more bursty, in addition to the debuff. You might not notice the debuff that much, but the other teams healers do. 
---
Imp hamstring can be fun, and sweeping strikes when in a big brawl. 
---
The most important factor however, is your gear, not your spec.
---
Arms for sure. Mortal strike debuff is insane and the root from the hamstring talent is really nice aswell.
---
It was the trolls, but I‚Äôd do 3/4 at a time but more would aggro (don‚Äôt want to blame AOE, but probably that)...
---
I'm already in a guild, it's a small guild but we do scholo, BRD and strat sometimes. 
---
I dont understand the point you are trying to get across here, I posted that I'm focusing on pvp and was just asking to either focus on crit or spell damage as a ret in pvp 
---
All I wanted was some advice on which to choose while I'm PVPing and which ench 
---
I'm not struggling in pvp, I'm having a fun time, just wanted some advice from other players who play ret.
---
Freezing band is effectively bis. No guild as a whole has enough rings of spellpower right now to not be getting massive use out of it.
---
when the loot drama begins noone will remember how "noble" you once were..
---
Just keep the ring. They shouldnt hold a grudge against you for that and if they do then they are a shitty guild.
---
First impression should come from your performance in raids not who you give boe epics to...
---
Wait wait, what's that guildies problem, we're not asking the right question here, what's bullshit
---
Thanks man really appreciate the advice
---
No, it's def more horde than allies here, but it's a fun server with a good population, and STV always has pvp going on.
---
Something to think about: freezing band is mostly a PvP item. It‚Äôs not even that good in PVE and is replaced by the spellpower ring that drops in MC.
---
Nice guy always finishes last ):
---
You can't tell the difference between having 25+ people in a voice chat together, who all know the strats, have epic mounts and enough tanks and healers and just random pugs with slow mounts who half die in the middle of the map and sit defending for 30 minutes?
---
I just read the title.
---
SO TRUE
---
Man, I got one of the first generation commercial 3d printers and the resolution sucks compared to this. I can't afford a new one though and I don't have a use for it other than playing around. Oh, well.
---
Offer it in Trade chat and see how many people try to low ball you and tell you it‚Äôs worth less and to sell it to them.. scummy people just trying to get the best of nice people and rip them off. No different then your guild who knows your brand new and pressuring you to cough it up for free. Then pressuring you more to sell it for less then half price. 
---
It‚Äôs honestly the reason why I haven‚Äôt raided yet or gotten to invested in big content/guilds. It‚Äôs a huge cluster fuck of people who turn into loot goblins when the loot actually drops.
---
Ive been jumping on the Christmas tree on Org
---
Cooldowns are different per item and the value is different per server. On most arcanite transmutes sell well because the bars are in demand.
---
Double-checked and the cast and aura-application is normal res chance, but the partial is 1/10 and lasts the whole duration
---
You've entirely missed the point of "value" in this context.
---
considering upvotes reddit likes big dicks! &lt;3
---
Very true , I hate it.. they should just say grats dude enjoy your new epic mount
---
Fuck you I‚Äôm happy for this guy I have never downed Rag myself
---
Yeabut is not a word.
---
Raid tank here, and I still do plenty of AVs, but mostly with premades. Going with randoms simply isnt worth the time.
---
Really focus on line of sighting the trolls and pulling them back then. This will help  ensure that you don‚Äôt aggro too much.  If you have the crit rage talent for bear, using swipe is good for generating a little more threat than maul on packs like this (due to each hit of swipe being able to crit).  The extra rage goes a long way.
---
Gotta play the long game
---
The only things I can think of that would cause the price to skyrocket would be
---
1. With everyone grinding AV, there are fewer people doing strat/Scholo/DM, restricting the supply of essence of Undeath, but I think this is unlikely, because I haven't seen it happen on my realm
---
2. More likely, someone on your team bought up all the essence of Undeath and relisted it at a higher price, in which case the price will *probably* return to normal in a few days. This is why I try to keep a buffer of essences of Undeath and buy up to 10 when the price is low so I don't get screwed by market fluctuations like this.
---
I‚Äôm using a Ender 3 pro. Pretty inexpensive. I didn‚Äôt use mine for much at the start so I get it.
---
Goddamn who shat in your cereal this morning?
---
Who is cheating exactly?
---
Sure lol.
---
which cooldowns do I do in that case? just the arcanite ones?
---
how to get into AV premades?
---
Yeah I have a stock, but I dont think the price reset. There is still like a full page of listings. Hopefully the price goes down back to 2-3 like usual
---
Is stacking defence on warrior tanks ever good? Looking for the situational, not the norm.
---
Honestly, you getting epic mount is just as viable as he getting that ring. Imagine you all are heading for BWL, all with world buffs. You are the only guy with a slow mount making them having to wait for you, taking way longer getting to the instance or leave you to a solo run risking being ganked and losing all world buffs. Having an epic mount is more value than this ring. Also would ease up getting flasks and consumables for BWL. 
---
I usually run with the same peoples in dungeons, and we have agreed to share gold selling epic/rare valueable drops.
---
So you can also consider selling it and split the gold with your guildies in that group.
---
On NA this one seems open, idk if there's any blacklisting going on since I never tried actually joining it: http://discord.gg/avpremade
---
On EU I only know two "mafia" ones where all the big guilds are. You'll have a hard time joining it if you're not part of your server's ranking group.
---
Even after BGs? What losers. PM me their names here if they cause you trouble and I‚Äôll tell em to fuck off.
---
Hardcore pvpers like APES went alliance for the extra challenge.
---
I agree and this is a mostly PVP item..
---
You won the roll and I'm assuming since it was a guild run the leader must have instructed everyone to roll need or greed and you won. The ring is yours. It doesn't matter how the raids go, it doesn't matter who needs it, the ring is yours and you can do whatever you want with it. There should be no drama whatsoever.
---
Soda is rank 7 which is extremely low right now considering he is going for R14. He won't get it anytime soon. If ever.
---
I agree with you but you need to prioritize hit first, then crit then ap
---
but what exactly in the deep prot tree will help mitigate crits?
---
Why those?
---
Jesus man, your entire post is flaming ppl you don‚Äôt even know beyond the fact they are saying ret is not viable (which btw ret is not viable)
---
You don‚Äôt even support the OP... literally just bashing from the first sentence to the last
---
Guess what you can play rogue/warr/mage in a non-dumbass manner. You cannot play ret in a viable manner for the entire life of classic
---
I‚Äôm using this as my motto. Thanks man
---
On Horde Orcs get axe skill making Flurry Axe or second Deathbringer the ideal offhands.
---
If you're tanking with randoms put a shield on. Thats why its in the game. The math lets warriors generate threat just fine in defensive stance. You don't need to be duel wielding. You will if your dps are super geared and they don't wait 5 to 10 seconds for the tank to generate threat on the boss.
---
Why was that in 4 separate chunks and not all at once?
---
Lots of assumptions..
---
That sounds exactly like what we are looking for :)
---
It's not my decision if it's against the rules, but it's pretty bad behaviour since they not only get an advantage but also make queueing worse for everybody.
---
You act like this dps ceiling is an issue in 99% of fights. When all dps need to do is wait 5 seconds.
---
You‚Äôd be tailor/alchemist and do mooncloth and arcanite on cooldown. If your lucky you‚Äôll find a undeath to water xmute recipe and do that instead of arcanite.
---
I am in this boat. Just ally side. 
---
What's worse is I don't fit in well for some reason (I know it's me,  just don't know what cause I don't troll), I got 1 friend on my dead server because my other one left,   so I'm not in the honor mafia, so the ones we can get into AV wise are disasters and lose to 40 minute horde honor farms if that helps. 
---
All I wanted was to make some open minded friends and enjoy a game I used to love. Bah.
---
Na man this av lasted over 6 months.... Looking at patch notes.
---
I'm not complaining. The guy I responded to said "hard to blame Blizzard". I say "hate the game, not the players".
---
ULDAMAN theres couple weapons that drop from final boss, MARAUDON also has gatorbite and princess' scepter
---
Ele shaman is as garbage as ret
---
it's BiS by the smallest most insignifcant amount of extra damage, the frost damage is nice but the proc is what makes it valuable.
---
Couple of good crits and u will 100% rip threat from any deep prot tank. And im not even that good. There are thousands of players way better than me who have this same issue. Thats why the top guilds all use furyprot so their dps dont have to be threat capped constantly.
---
w**(i)**ll t**(h)**is w**(a)**rlock become **(t)**he b**(e)**st pla**(y)**er in the t**(o)**p bracket on e**(u)** servers ?

If you wanna wait an hour for the cooldown, you can stack them that way. At least that is what I've read..

Its simple for them yes. Stop thinking about your personal situation and how it should work for no one because it doesn't work for you.
---
Problem on ally site right now is we dont take towers, NO instead we try to "rush" drek like 45 min+ (when the game takes that long!) towers etc are worthless (yes someone said that!) and they die all over again! I mean when you are there for honor, get some fucking towers and stop rushing drek and when you try to argue with braindead people that rush south every goddamn time, you just cant win!
---
There‚Äôs a good pole arm in Maraudon
---
Yes and they‚Äôre real dicks about it :)
---
That's what I was thinking. You can get +hit from a bunch of pieces. But +weapon damage from only one place. As long as your hit capped; which you are with DJB/TER and tier with the +3 hit talent.
---
Arcanite reaper and good dungeon plate gear.
---
Thank you

Figures.

On my server undeath is basically free, waters are ~15g, so you're making 10g every 2 days. Assuming the recipe goes for 700g, it's gonna take 140 days to recoup your cost. Given the context of OP's thread, I'd say it's definitely a better idea to just sell the recipe.
---
As for everyone else: it isn't as simple as "perpetual free gold," there is an opportunity cost. What could you do with that 700g right now that would make you more money in the future? I, personally, could invest that and make a fuckload of more gold in 140 days than I could letting 30g a week trickle in, but obviously every person is looking for different levels of engagement/return.
---
You can literally premade AV, and Horde have the advantage.
---
I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs how it works. I‚Äôm really close to finding it and I‚Äôm rank 8 grinding about 100k honor per day.
---
Lol AV‚Äôs Design alone favors the alliance. You‚Äôre just bad.
---
Only DoT application can be resisted, once the spell hits and DoT is applied it is not affected by resist at all. Resist only affect the chance for a spell to ‚Äúmiss‚Äù you basically.

I wouldn't be deep prot i'd probably tank in pvp Arms spec. As long as you're properly geared it shouldn't be an issue unless you're min maxing or something.
---
I mean the gear is really good. It would be silly if it was just being handed out to everyone.
---
You just have to make sure to at least get 15 HKs a week, and try to get as much honor as you can. Eventually you'll rank up to the point where you can get some stuff. You won't get any epics though. Those ranks are for people who just pvp all day every day.
---
People think that you will gain a ton of respect in the guild if you fork it over. Truth is people might not even respect that move. People respect time and effort, being present for raids, etc. You need to build a longer rapport with them for your actions to mean anything. If you give over the ring as a new recruit a lot of people may see you as naive. It's unfair to ask for that much of you this early, so imo it shows lack of judgment to agree with it. At best you're probably seen as a nice guy for the move.
---
Cool, I‚Äôll run uldaman today.  Thanks
---
Nope, you should fill your raid exclusively with classes which are incapable of doing more threat than the tank in any circumstance. And to be extra safe they should ideally be doing the same or less dmg than the tank.
---
I‚Äôm sick of these dumbass dps thinking they are hot shit for pulling agro!! Give me a couple paragraphs to rant about it in a completely unrelated thread!!
---
I sold the freezing band I got to a guild or for 500g when it was selling for 850g at the time. I needed the money and he needed the ring. Worked out for both parties. Doesn‚Äôt have to be a big discount but a small discount to guild members is a good thing.
---
Yeah, this is the stuff I'm talking about.
---
Well that feels good to hear. Gotta be tough after getting cheeks clapped in IF for a month. Shit got bad late at night.
---
Focus on being a holy pally so you‚Äôre useful
---
Im leveling mining so this will be me soon
---
Agreed
---
Innervate, rejuv, and thorns are pretty great.
---
Wait. You can upgrade the archers??
---
No problem.  I'm sorry so many others felt it necessary to rant at you, and I hope you guys got your DMN clear!  Happy Holidays.
---
Yeah I offered to sell it for 600g on the spot, but no one said anything
---
Undeath to Water is the most profitable transmute there is, you can do it daily instead of every two days like Arcanite.
---
The problem is the recipe is a rare world drop so you can't just grind for it. You have to buy it on the AH. And the recipe is very expensive, 600-700g on my realm.
---
But it's the absolute best way to passively make money, if you can afford the initial investment. You make the initial investment back after 2, maybe 2.5 months of logging in and clicking 1 button daily, and after that it's an easy 10-14g profit a day, probably for the entire rest of Classic. It didn't sound like much but it really adds up over time.
---
So just to be clear, you just said it's not working here, while arguing above that it works just fine?  Got it.
---
As an orc warrior who just got Viskag last night, and has edgemasters. Is flurry axe my best non-raid OH option?
---
 
---
Asking for a friend.
---
I knew you'd say that... Ugh.  No, not everyone is in a top guild.  But top guilds use SUPERIOR specs and strategies.  You said deep prot is the superior spec.  It isn't, and the proof is top guilds don't use it.
---
You generate more threat as fury tank.  If that wasn't the case, guilds doing world record speed clears wouldn't use it.  But they do, because the higher threat potential allows their dps to go all in faster. 
---
So no, deep prot is not superior.  It's a math problem and it's been solved.  The type of guild doesn't change the math.
---
I'm rank 9 Disc Priest with 5/8 and all that, could you msg me an invite?
---
I have a 60 healer and a 60 tank and boy if I can find full groups of people that need it you can too :p that shit was painful pls don‚Äôt ask all that of me
---
Can you imagine if horde only could do premades right now in AV?  Can you imagine the oceans of tears?
---
Maybe you would have a better chance at finding something if you include which region you are from...
---
Transmuting arcanite bar will give you ~5-8g each  48 hrs depending on your server. Transmuting essence of undeath to water is probably more profitable. On my realm undeath is ~1g each and water 15g. I would charge 8-10g for a transmute. The transmute has 24h cooldown.
---
As far as I can tell hes asking about pvp stuff for which ret is completely fine. If he was complaining about not getting into raids or dung groups you may have had a point. Instead you and a lot of other commenters seem to lack basic reading comprehension but have ample stupid ass comments.
---
Distorted.
---
I wasn't comparing to vanilla, I was comparing to retail
---
You know you can just take a screenshot right?
---
U can stack roids by popping one and the grabbing the other so have 2.
---
WSG jumps are absurd
---
Crit isn‚Äôt a given 32 ap though, it scales with your total ap doesn‚Äôt it?
---
Then why comment?
---
No guild that actually respects its members would offer you such a shit deal for that ring. 300g is nothing for it, it's basically a scam. Another thing was if they said hey, we would like the ring to stay in the guild, would you mind discounting 100g from market price or something along those lines.
---
Not to burst your bubble but ranking in pvp is simply a measure of how much you play over how good you are. The fact that holy paladins is considered the best pvp healer by far means that any paladin who don't go that is pulling down their team simply because they don't contribute as much as they could. 
---
But as someone who mained a paladin back in vanilla I do feel a little sympathy for your position, so I'm going to be a little serious here. 
---
My experience has been that a reckoning build is better for pvp, simply because it gives you the option to actually get burst damage. Since you can store up charges, it gives you the option to unload 5 attacks at once on an enemy (you always try to stun them before you unload to remove their parry/dodge chance). 
---
You want to focus on getting as much plate as possible, with only 2-3 leather pieces at most. Your main stat to focus on at first should be hit (about 5%). After that, Strength (or AP) and Crit should be the main stats you focus on, but getting a little int is really helpful since you should be tossing a heal here and there even as ret. Healer/damage is nice, but honestly, you don't scale that well with it and your holy damage isn't that significant that it matters too much.
---
It's definitely not about balance, that was never their goal with classic. They made EM work this way on purpose because it's in line with their "reference client", but I'm asking why the same didn't apply to other similar effects. It's really weird that the same "bug" behaves differently in very similar situations.
---
Where do you mine?
---
That was entertaining af
---
true. at the same time, you can still easily clear mc with warbear. I mean, you do you. I don't feel like it's worth it, but if you do, go get it
---
It is a small upgrade. The hunter discord seems to pin the AP difference at 4 more for alliance and 9 more for horde. If you think grinding for 9 hours or more is worth 4 AP, more power to you. I personally think it‚Äôs a waste of time if you have any restrictions on how much you can play. Just get the rep for the quiver for the attack speed.
---

Oh cripes, lol. These things were thousands of dollars when I got mine (won it in a contest.) A couple hundred bucks is super reasonable! I just used mine for dicking around, only learned CAD and not things like Blender so I can only make mechanical parts :p
---
Mr. Everett at work. Good job!
---
Something like that happened with me too. I was power leveling my enchanting so I sat in Goldshire making wands for all the lowbies for a solid week. Then about a month later I had a group of people tell me I was on their horde guilds no kill list because of it.
---
Personally i would skip arcanite reaper and get unstoppable force
---
Horde outnumber allies by a pretty large number - throughout the entire population.  Horde queues up and has to wait for enough allies to fill the game.  Allies don't have to wait because there are so many horde waiting to get into games.
---
Nothing at all. Crits are also a good thing in furyprot cuz it keeps up enrage. If u get low u can swap on a shield and shield block to prevent being double crit.
---
Should make one red and one blue, then fill the hollow parts of the red one with black and the hollow parts of the blue with gold ;)
---
I win 80% of wsg pugs. I even beat premade quite often. So uh ok
---
Haha. Basically the reason I never bought a few years ago was because of the price.
---
We all agreed to roll need, they later recanted and asked if I‚Äôd sell it to them for 300g
---
Sell it!!! Even if you would like to help the guild and give it to the mage, there‚Äôs no guarantee that he will stay in the guild.
---
The pvp decay by it's nature forces you to do this. If you don't reach your goals, you will have to play even more next week to make up for it which would make it even worse.
---
Or you could just ignore pvp ranks entirely ofc, which is what I do, but you know, participating in a game's systems is a normal thing to do.
---
I just want to see what happens there, just for the lels.
---
Take that complaint, put it in an envelope, and shove it up your ass

&gt;Allies: WTF these zerg fest games are too fast. AV is nothing but PvE this is dumb.
---
Spoken like a true horde player
---
This did not work in retail vanilla. If someone new joined your group they wouldn't automatically recieve the same que as you. Your entire group would need to drop que and reque.
---
Here's a list of stuff you can pick and get: foror, cloudkeeper, edgemasters, black dragonscale set, battlechasers, force reactive
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter I already figured out the name
---
I would try to get full Lightforge first. The set is okay for PvP for now, but when the quest chain for T0.5 becomes available it rocks! Spell damage Ret is the way to go IMO; damage is pretty good, especially versus high armor with big crits on SoC and JoC. In a pinch you can throw a big heal, and you don't OOM as fast as you would in AP/Crit gear. I don't know the amount of time you want to spent on ranking, but getting R10 seems really hard at the moment.
---
If you do want to stay AP/crit, try to get the blacksmithing gloves that make you immune to disarm, that way you don't lose your weapon enchant slot.
---
Good luck out there! Looking at the average commenter in this thread it sounds like the stigma is still going strong. I know it might only apply to ret DPS in raids, totally not to ret in PvP.

I'm new to wow (started in September) and just got lvl 55. I'm a hunter. I'm feeling very overwhelmed with all the new "end game" dungeons and content and don't know what gear/quest to focus on.
---
 I'm not obsessed with obtaining the 100% most optimal set but I definitely need to upgrade my eq ... Basically all the guides I've seen focus on "best in slot" or maybe 2nd best ... But some of them seem nearly impossible to obtain
---
And what the fuk do you want to do about it other than whining on Reddit?
---
Your guild is asking you to shell out 600+ gold to "help the guild" ? No, fuck that, find another guild.
---
Extract art files thru the game itself.. [Here](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Extracting_WoW_user_interface_files) is pretty well explained how to do so.. Then you just visit the unpacked files, find those two I mentioned.. Copy them over into your actual Interface folder (The folder and names order has to be exact) and then you just edit those 2 files with some software capable of editing .blp files.. Maybe Gimp, surely photoshop with basic .blp pluging.. Believe me it super easy esp. because .blp has transparency alpha level and not the actual alpha levels that you would need to edit.. so basically is as straight forward as .png
---
Abusing a bug left over from the Legion back port to get instant ques while your competition must wait in line sounds like cheating to me.

This is super late and I'm so sorry for that, I didnt get a notification :( Coincidentally, I'm alliance on Incendius! If you're ever interested in taking that 50 to 60, I'd love to help ‚ù§ There will be others who care about you. Those who lost you didnt deserve you.
---
Gehennas!
---
Opportunity cost of arcanite transmute or other free transmutes you would be doing anyway means it's not as simple as 10-15g profit.
---
All 4 tanks are bis. Nice try though.
---
You‚Äôre right ofc, I forgot that sometimes you get favorable rng and can do some semblance of dmg! Which is why ofc every serious premade runs a ret
---
Ideally you run multiple rets so you can cycle them in when their ONE mobility spell (rockethelm) which allows them to get in melee range is off cd
---
Let me know when your crit montage is available, I‚Äôd love to review!

This is my BiS set I'm trying to get as a resto druid currently. 
---
What pieces should I prioritize while raiding (we use DKP) and are there any changes or other pieces I should try and get?
---
This is what I have right now:
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/2cJ58P2THekRT5qj97HRgi
---
I'm not really trying to get T1 since prebis blues and other pieces are just as good. The only T1 piece I would take right now are either the legs which I would eventually upgrade or the boots, but I have Verdant Footpads which are almost as good.
---
So it looks like I should be trying to get T2 helm, T2 legs or Salamanders, Choker, Aurastone, Cauterizing Band, and Shard of the scale.
---
Any advice on what to prioritize? Which I should bid max DKP on and which are less important?
---
They don‚Äôt even really funnel him loot. Look at how geared his whole raid is.
---
Warrior life is sometimes suffering.
---
Like, on one hand, I find tanking hideously stressful and hate it. But on the other hand, all the coolest looking gear is for tanking, and I'm already a 300 armoursmith, so it'd be a waste to not use it...

---
That doesn‚Äôt work.

You‚Äôve obviously done your research and came up with your own pro/con list.
---
So why are you just asking people to TELL you what to do? Why not play the game how you like it instead of following the meta like all the other sheep?
---
You wanna see some big cries then go for it, you want high survivability then go for that.
---
Thanks for the suggestion.
---
It does... /played 2.5years on Shaman cast lightning bolt, pop trinkets and then cast chain lightning + earth shock. Time it right and alot of burst
---
Thank you, good feedback
---
Ur responding to the wrong person lol
---
how is this still in the game but they won‚Äôt stop nerfing pally reckoning?
---
I said that to them, he said it‚Äôs hard to farm lol
---
Prioritize Cauterizing Band Aurastone Hammer, ignore Choker and let the casters have it while you get the +33 healing neck,
---
Ah! Thank you so much for this! So what does the "Point.blp" and "UnablePoint.blp" refer to?
---
And what will happen to all the different graphics like the sword when hovering mobs and bags when hovering merchants etc?
---
Fuck no dont spend all the gold on arcanite reaper when you can just get the unstoppable force (which is way better) for being exalted with av (which you should be as a warrior anyway for don julios band, also frostbite at revered)
---
I'd sell it for half price to a guild member but make them aware that you're doing them a big favor. That's 400g more than you had yesterday, think of it that way.
---
Nice :D now I can put ‚Äòpublished author‚Äô on my CV
---
I keep my 60 mage at diremaul and just solo the first boss + trash of north then jump down east herb, look for books, and reset
---
In what would do those few minutes cost the game?
---
Horde can turtle a Drek rush just as well as they can anything else. Not to mention that pugs can never pull Drek correctly.
---
I queue a lot of premades and also random games when i can't be as attentive. The random games these days are either a sub 15m win, or a 25m+ loss, often not even getting 1k honor.
---
I don't think I've even seen a successful drek rush since reset.
---
Yeah the GM doesn't sound organised or smart. When an epic drops you should always have a discussion unless you all have been playing together for a while and know how things go.
---
Got one crystal off my first rich vein. Haven‚Äôt seen one since in over a month. RNG gods can be quite cruel. Just need 5 more for my mount quest.
---
Can you make it so it stick to the HP bars of mobs just like the debuff WeakAura? So you can see all threatlevels on each mob?
---
Imagine caring about non existent consequences 
---
5HEAD
---
We are race purists.
---
&gt;that waz giving 8 attacks at once
---
It was never doing that and you're wrong, you should get aone extra attack when you get critically hit, end of story. And that's not what's happening because stacks are vanishing.
---
We mass reported one who got standing one by blatantly botting and he hasn't been online for 10 hours so fingers crossed he is gone. We had at least 20 different persons reporting him.
---
If he offered 650 it would be okay but 300? Dont fall for that
---
Ret is a support class not a dps/ADC class. They're amazing paired with any other classes.
---
ToEP does not exist! Damn!
---
Oh! I'm and alchemist myself and I've used frost oil a couple of times! It's really handy! :) 
---
Dont worry about the crusader ench, I have  good friend who is an enchanted and I have some righteous orbs stored away
---
I'll be quite honest though, so far I havent came across many disarms in pvp than I thought I would expect! When it happens, I usually have a stun backed up just in case and if that's ok CD I'll just pop a BoP and heal up while my weapon comes back haha
---
Thanks for taking the time to write!
---
Hence why I posed the question: based on what? You can't claim a favorable AV design to a faction if it does not statistically translate into wins. Who says you're correct in your assertion and why? Based on map design, i'd argue horde have two of the biggest advantage map imbalances and the stats back that up.
---
Some may not be aware, but there is an entire faction that does not have the ability to queue (successfully) as a premade due to 10-18 minute queues.
---
But we all have problems.
---
Thank you! :)
---
just buy an epic mount and join lol
---
The Hunter T1 set has less hit rating then you're prebis, so as you start to get more tier set pieces and lose hit rating from your prebis is when you want to get it. But if you're only raiding once every 3 weeks it's not that important
---
he's a 58 druid, he literally cannot even equip the gear he's won and yet he has won FOUR pieces of loot. you told him beforehand that you were only interested in that one item in the entire raid and this 58 druid actually tried to take the chest from you after winning 4 pieces of loot.
---
you're absolutely in the right here, the fucking greed and absolute lack of humility in some people makes me so triggered. if i myself was allowed into a raid before i was even 60 i'd only be willing to take loot if it was about to go to disenchant or if i was competing with other non-60s.
---
Some people work 18 hours a day, some play 18 hours a day, not sure what triggered you so much to write this conformist wall of text
---
Some will account share but most will play a lot and sleep little. I don't think you have any idea whats required to get top bracket spot, skilled and experienced players farm honor a lot better than any average player.
---
VtheVictim is his main, dope guy, parses high.
---
Everyone feels differently but if a person says they will equip the item on the spot, I tend to think it should go to them. But that's just me
---
Wait for me to pull
---
Mograine
---
Time to just reword this... Looks like PvP systems happened on battleground servers.
---
Ret focuses on CC and support if played correctly. Sometimes support is getting in an extra fee attacks.
---
And yet, here you are.
---
I don't play anything other than WoW, sorry can't comment
---
That's very assuming. You don't know who this guild is or what they're like. That's just bad advice really. This might be a very cool guild and you throw it away over "muh Epix".
---
Ret isnt about dps, it's about countering the enemy and supporting your team
---
MS &gt; OS always
---
Just wanted to have a friendly discussion thats all. Thought it would be nice to talk about it and get some tips
---
Ret can heal too
---
&gt;By the time TBC came out
---
This isn't even moving the goal posts. This is putting them in the next expansion.
---
I'm using painweaver and Julio (day rogue) can't decide if tarnished is better than pain at this point. I'm getting diminishing returns on agi investment it seems.
---
Just because something is beyond your imagination doesn't mean it's not real.
---
If everyone needed, then you've done nothing wrong. If you wanna be a good guy, you could sell it him for cheap. I imagine the mage just saw purple and wanted to do what he could to secure the item, sometimes when you see purple you don't think as clearly. I myself had Skull flame shield drop when I was with guildies, and they all passed it for me. But I was prepared that if they needed and someone won it, it was there's to do as they wish.
---
Another way to look at it is it's just 850 gold that only one person can loot and you all roll for it. If the mage won it, he'd then have the option to exchange that gold for a ring.
---
In a week or two everyone will have their rep and no one will ever play AV again.
---
At a dollar an hour still better bang for our buck than most other forms of entertainment
---
Yeah, and horde quit as well, but I checked on my server frequently and about 1.7 ally quit for every horde. I think the world pvp nonsense tipped the imbalance further.
---
If you‚Äôre want to tank anything decently you‚Äôll appreciate holy shield far more than a crit heal heal once every 2 minutes (which could possibly crit anyway even without popping the cooldown). Holy shield while off tanking or on trash will prevent thousands of damage (on top of the decent threat/mana ratio)
---
I dont even need to open it... Best part is "HOLY FUCK"
---
This guy got out dpsd by a Ret and prot paly in UD strat, I can tell
---
I‚Äôve gone against a faerlina premade a couple times, they lost every time tho
---
You can participate 24/7. It's called account sharing. Or methamphetamine.
---
Yeah a PVE nerd ass lock maybe
---
We all needed
---
On horde side we mostly talk about food and meme stuff.
---
So what‚Äôs the link for this discord....üòè
---
It‚Äôs ok lol I am surprised too but whatever lmao :) have a good holiday !!!
---
Survive my ambush + backstab if their shield isn‚Äôt up lol
---
The truth is that premade discords exist. People already use them and win tons of games within 10min. 
---
Now you take a good look at the honor system and tell me how good your chances to gain ranks when you play random games only.
---
Very little skill in this guy because he didn't get 15hks, the people getting top bracket on the other hand is a different story, top bracket on active servers was close to 2 million. AFKing will only get you so far, certainly not to r14.
---
Escorted
---
Good way to look at it
---
Thank you for this. Nice read! Really appreciate the time taken to type this out for me

Why does everybody think they have to be the most caustic version of themselves on here?

We passed that point long ago m8

Also, try 18+ hours a day.

Remember that they only drop from rich nodes, not small ones.

I've always heard crit gear for ret. You want vengence to proc as much as possible. Yes you'll be more squishy but with your bubbles/stuns/heals/pots/ bandages you can stand toe to toe with the best of them. Now I emphasize crit gear but you wanna make sure your hit% is maxed too because if you don't land that swing then you have 0% chance on all procs

I didn't make the assertion, you did. Claims require evidence.

Get gud

A premade against a pug wins? You're so good.

Duely noted, thanks man!

Well my point is that excessive behaviour is damaging. For example you could argue someone who plays video games for 12+ hours a day might be addicted or using it to cope. Its certainly not healthy to do this. Don't you feel irresponsibility for promoting this damaging behaviour?
---
getting healing gear
---
DB+DB is better than DB+FA. Especially if you put an elem stone on OH.
---
it's fine to call out an addiction, especially if that person isn't successful outside of WoW
---
No it doesn't lol they have to get through the only chike point and the entire alliance raid standing the the CY to get to the RH flag.
---
that¬¥s.. not even that much. I guess this is only vendor trash not including rnd drops?
---
The unstoppable Force is very good for Paladins in PvP because it's a very slow mace (Speed 3.80) and this gives you better procs from Seal of Command. Seal of Command proc is holy damage so you should spec into spell power and enchant it with spell power. Spell power is the best because Paladins are an hybrid class, this where they shine, spell power allows you to do decent damage, very good burst if you go shockadin (31/0/20), and you can still heal very decently in dungeons, raids and bgs.   
---
It's very satisfying when I heal in bgs and a rogue or a war attack me, thinking me an easy prey and I turn around and take half their health off, with a SotC judgement+Divine Favor+Holyshock+Hammer of Justice+SoC judgement combo. You pair that with engineering and you can OS people.

Might start back up after the holiday is done next week =) late is fine just appreciate the kind words. Can send me your tag or character name and ill let you know what I plan. 
---
Happy Holidays!
---
One could argue it helps the alliance actually win some games they otherwise wouldn't.
---
Pretty much everyone who is rank 14 is a NEET who lives off parental or government assistance to subsidize their addiction
---
*A few exceptions apply
---
18+ hours a day for how many days?
---
you sound unemployed
---
I, uhh, should I call a doctor?
---
Obesity and lack of exercise in general is harming them
---
So how do they maintain employment?
---
Likely your raid is only carrying 1-3 druids, so the gear isn‚Äôt in as high of demand as say the mage or rogue T2. If you run MC/Ony consistently for the next few months until BWL comes out you‚Äôll see more than enough Druid T2 for everyone in your raid. Therefore don‚Äôt worry about spending DKP for something that will likely be defaulted to you eventually.
---
no BOE epics are just ffa. only if you like personally you can donate it to another friend or whatever.
---
IT DOESNT matter if guy A saves 800g and doesnt have to buy freezingband
---
or
---
guy B gets 800g and can buy another valuable gear/whatever for himself.
---
people thinking strangers have to pass on such big numbers of gold are just selfish pricks
---
You're high horsing for no reason, you're assuming quite alot and don't know what anyone's situation maybe be. Also where did I ever say I promote this. I didn't, I nearly stated that you have no business trying to tell people how they should have fun. Why don't you go back to whatever hole you crawled out of troll.
---
You need more clearly defined or better loot rules. The situation went: the ML sees something drop, shrugs his shoulders and asks if he can even roll, loses the roll, then gets the item anyway. That‚Äôs totally fucked.
---
From the start of phase 2 until at least the first week of Feb.
---
2 months in a best case scenario
---
Latency has everything to due with how things register with the server, learn your facts small dick. #getlong
---
... they don't, obviously
---
It's a bunch of neet's.
---
Tbh given the situation I think it‚Äôs very unfair of them to put him in this spot.
---
The fact that they had a whole discussion about it where they were trying to convince him to just hand over the ring is already a bit iffy. Making a massively lowball offer is also pretty iffy. Like if the guild has enough funds to just drop 300g for a random mage then why not just buy it full price? Why can‚Äôt the mage pay some as well? 
---
Just not sure why this entire thing is falling squarely on the shoulders of the new recruit.
---
It‚Äôs 850g though... but I see your point
---
It‚Äôs like you‚Äôre at a party and that one guy jumps in on the joke but halfway through everyone realized he‚Äôs not joking...
---
Tears in his eyes toward the end, you could hear a pin drop, until someone has the good sense to turn the music back on and pretend like that never happened.
---
Hmm yeah maybe
---
Been on the receiving end of these more than once you evil bastard lol. As a Boomkin, I approve of these crits.
---
I just got incredibly bored right after phase 2 launched. My main who's geared as fuck is on Alli would constantly get ganked by groups and then camped until I completely left the area. If I knew it would be such a problem, I wouldn't have played on a fucking pvp server. Now when I go back to the game AV is boring as shit and WSG has absolutely no one communicating in chat except for me. This game is too Boomer to be fun anymore. Life goes on.
---
I‚Äôm not the best with macros but have you tried a castsequence macro ? Maybe something like  
---
Castsequence /use WSG bandage, /use AV bandage, /use Heavy Runecloth Bandage. 
---
Keep clicking until you get the appropriate bandage ?
---
As the other reply said, it's unlikely there's more than 2/3 druids in your raids. Inevitably the T2 pieces will drop and be granted to you for minimum bid (if your guild uses one). My guild runs 3 druids (MT, Heal, Heal) and we have de'd 2 Stormrage Covers and all 3 already have Stormrage Leggings in just 4 Rag kills.
---
i got "lucky" with a bunch of off spec rolls, esp when some of our tanks took some holiday off (or just no showed) and is now the backup tank
---
i think i should have never rolled rofl, i wanted the T2 and what nots to help me farm Savage glad (since I have to be hybrid there) and for breezing thru 5 mans, but then now I am the (theoretical) backup OOT on council fights when we need like the 4th tanks.
---
Oh well, i guess having some stuff for 4horse won't be bad.
---
It really should only go to a diehard PvPer or ranker. No other mage has any business getting it for as log as 300g really.
---
That... what IS that?  I don't know how people can play this game without a clean UI.  :/
---
Nightfall uptime for an enhancement shaman is about 30% iirc, slightly higher for warriors/retadins/melee hunters, but the shaman is probably the best pick for it.
---
You're really obsessed with dicks aren't you. Got something to tell the class? It's 2019, no one cares if you're a little fruity, you be you boo
---
Yeah then NEETs are 100% fair game to insult
---
LortiUI it's not on twitch app though
---
LortiUI
---
If the GM wanted it for the mage he wouldve passed and told the rest to do the same. If he said all need on it, he wabted it just for the g.
---
Lightforge also offers some int which is hard to find.
---
You just called me ‚Äúboo‚Äù fruitcup
---
It's probably going to take more than 12+ hours a day on most servers. Probably closer to 16-20 hours per day once you are above rank 10.
---
Tbh, there is better gear for healing than tier 1 in dungeons, so id say druid tier 1 gear is OS/pvp either way, so you had every right to roll on and win that item.
---
They've got so many idiots worshipping them we have to restore balance in the universe by giving them some shit
---
its an RP server  
---
you didn't need to confirm it
---
LortiUI for the dark bars with Leatrix Plus for the player border.
---
Get essence of undeath &gt; water transmute
---
Only one wack with dense stone... Indeed bullshit.
---
I don't see anyone paying 850g for that thing.
---
I'm a mage, and one time a freezing band dropped when I was doing 3 man jump runs with a warrior and a pally. The entire reason I was in those runs to begin with was to farm money so I could buy a freezing band (was like 300-450g on my server at the time) so it was kind of fortuitous. 
---
I asked if I could need on it and we agreed that I could take it if I paid the other two 100G each. It was a fine compromise.
---
The day AV came out, alliance was winning almost every one in 8-9 minutes.
---
Damn thats a fresh UI
---
You dont even know these people. You win it fair and square.  I won two epics with the guild since I've joined and not once has they asked for anything but out of the good of me and willing to help the guild I've handed out many mooncloth bags and mats for raids. Likely spent around 250g on shit that is not for me just to help the raid out, between the two epics I got about 900g.
---
yeah, amongst their in-group. They wouldn't farm as high as they do if they had agreements.
---
It's because all the good players use that exclusive discord to queue together and avoid everyone else.
---
God you're dumb, but yes if that makes you feel better.
---
I got one farming Mara, they don‚Äôt sell for 850 that times passed the most you‚Äôll get is like 600 or less. Can‚Äôt even sell mine for that. If it‚Äôs a good guild you plan on raiding with for a while i‚Äôd say sell it if not it‚Äôs whatever
---
Thanks so a proc on around 1 in 8. Or so.   
---
I guess Anni is better, and then if we change setup other goes for it in BWL. Thanks.
---
Ok, how do I get 800g to maybe buy the recipe on the down low?
---
I mean, do you think they just magically hit 60 and got good gear/gold for consumables and were working out that whole time?
---
Imagine this if your small mind can, having enough money that you don't have to work everyday. I know I know I just blew your mind. Again stop with your stereotypes. Sure there will be some unemployed some college and high school kids, but you know who else is amount them, the independently wealthy.
---
I don't think that's exactly what happened. He asked if he could roll for it and the words that the other guy said was "it's all yours". If the other guy really wanted the gear he definitely should've used different words. It kind of set the expectation wrong. Had he said you can roll on it and then OP lost the roll, then got the item anyway it would be fucked.
---
I'll PM you my stuff! I hope you do come back :) 
---
Happy Holidays to you as well :)
---
Join pre-mades
---
yes I am 12 years old and making bank as a FANG software engineer.
---
Git gud.
---
After hitting rank 14 I think a lot of horde players on my server will just return to world pvp with an occasional premade AB or WSG
---
Its because for some reason most alliance still think that day 1 meta tactics still work. For some reason tactics on the alliance side just don't really evolve. Sometimes you get into a good game were ppl actually change up the tactic and then alliance usually wins quite handily, but to many alliance still want to "Zerg Drek" instead of playing tactical games that you can actually win.
---
I asked before we even entered the raid about the specific piece and was told "its all mine" which changed later on.
---
Any Alliance players queueing AV have been in games where the gate opens when there are fewer than 25-30 Alliance players in the match? I've been in a few of these games recently and the lower number of players essentially crippled our initial offensive effort.
---
I'm suspecting this is due to queue dodging (leaving the queue after it pops) by premade groups because last night I accidentally took a queue after 10+ players in our channel dropped it. Gates opened with only 26 players but we still managed to pull of a win after 57min. Therefore I knew for a fact that around a dozen players dropped the queue during our warm-up period. Just curious if anyone else has experienced anything similar.
---
Lmao hurt a nerve, so I'm wondering what you do for a living and where your degree is from if you're so intelligent and successful?
---
Blind, dark iron bomb, reflect trinket+sprint 
---
Mage/rogue is a great fight
---
When there's a demand people are free to charge whatever they want for their "service"
---
Hiya like they're free to charge you to rank for them, you're free to decline and find someone else.
---
no part of me is envious of a video game, I have success in real life
---
play resto and let hunters and warriors do nightfall duty
---
Alliance Av premade cross realm (Epic Mount Required!!!) https://discord.gg/7pdVRN7
---
Honestly if i was paying a tank, he wouldn't be allowed to roll on anything. If he doesnt need gear, he shouldn't roll. He could have his reserve or whatever, but everything else he would be required to pass on. I would also pay half up front and half on completion. That's fair imo.
---
&gt; botched batching that blizzard added
---
I've heard how others used to do this with the Paladin's Divine Favor to get double-crits back in Vanilla and BC, what do you mean by "botched"?
---
What the fuck leap is that lol.
---
Yeah just buff the civilians for the weekend so you can't grief.
---
Good for you
---
Just fucking beautiful. Keep on disproving those alliance scumbags. I‚Äôm a rogue on Kromcrush, but now I wish I was a shaman üòÇ
---
You hate streamers as much as others love them.  You're just two sides of the same coin.
---
I think you're missing the point of this one. The whole point is that it may not be an achievement right? Like the Super Size Me documentary. Everyone would love to eat McDonalds every day. In fact everyone could do that if they decided to. Its not difficult. The question at hand is... Is it a real achievement?
---
It‚Äôs true it‚Äôll be ok, but is a bummer that every jill doesn‚Äôt give ya that 5. But I‚Äôm in it to win it!
---
It's okay, about a month or two after they finish ranking to rank 14 and purchase their gear they might get suspended for a week.
---
^ this guy gets it.
---
Due to our quick queue times, most of us genuinely don't care if it's a win or a loss. It benefits us most to have a quick match.
---
So when the horde force a turtle, and the option for us if we want to win would be to turtle as well, we don't want to do it. It's better to lose a match in 20 minutes than extend it to 40 and possibly win.
---
For human - stormspike MH/Mirah's OH, vendor Deathbringer.  
---
For non-human Alliance race - Deathbringer MH/Mirah's OH with edgemasters, since edgemasters don't give you mace skill.
---
I walked on the moon with Harriet Tubman
---
This is so annoying. I printed all those written guides and maps, made notes on it. Today, I constantly have my phone open. It's annoying.
---
Edit: No, I don't have a 2nd screen..
---
A couple things.
---
Horde have advantage in pure pug games because they have 15 minute queues so they're more likely to actually try when they get into AV to maximize their rep/honor gain. Alliance don't care because their queues are instant and they'll do two more AVs in the time it takes a Hose player to wait for their next one, so each AV means less to Alliance.
---
The other thing is the Alliance's most skilled and dedicated players are doing premade AVs, so the audience they get in pugs has even fewer skilled players than otherwise. Horde can't really do premades because of the queues so they have a mix of skilled and unskilled players in every AV.
---
This guy doesn't understand that some people could actually be wealthy. I wish he'd stop embarrassing himself but here we are.
---
Couldn't agree more. The tank invests their own time and effort into something nobody wants to do, likely not even the tank themselves. It's very normal to ask something in return.
---
It's the old hardware, you don't need powerful hardware just somewhat new. In todays standard the core 2 due intel cpu is ancient and he uses onboard graphics too.
---
On my i5 3470 with an rx 580 classic runs way better and smoother with more fps than vanilla. So the pendulum swings both ways.
---
How do I find a guild as a casual who‚Äòs only solo questing and logs very few hours? I‚Äòd love to chat with people while questing / mob grinding, get some help here and there and maybe swap items or something like this.
---
I‚Äòve had a very familylike, easy going guild back in TBC but I have no clue how I got in there. The original members were all coworkers and it was a really nice guild. I love Classic up until now but I miss my old guildies since they don‚Äôt play anymore.
---
Yes, and the vast majority of people who hit rank 14 are not wealthy. There are exceptions to every rule
---
Disabilities would certainly come into the exceptional cases. No doubt about it.
---
Powerful no, but still a hell of a lot more than 15 years ago
---
Equating degree with intelligence and successfulness is why you are dumb.  People with different sensibilities chase different things.
---
Your reading comprehension sucks. ML asks only other Druid if he can roll on chest *prior to* the raid, other Druid says ‚Äúyou can have it.‚Äù After winning four other items they can‚Äôt even equip yet, chest drops, and other Druid rolls in a fit of greed, going back on their word.
---
ML only laments they lost the chest roll as master looting it to other Druid, so other Druid gives it to him. Other Druid then gets overtaken by greed again and wants it back. OP does not give it back.
---
There, maybe you can understand that.
---
I can assure you the 3 level 60s meleeing the AFK lvl 35 was not a display of a skill. The next scene a 42 eludes our god tier attempt at killing
---
I'm the same way, allows me to farm in between queues.  Just this week I've leveled fishing 240-275 and farmed 20x Juju power/might/flurry. 
---
 It certainly is nice to have a break between, it'll be interesting to see what the top bracket is this week with the queue times way up.  Last week I was easily getting 50-60k in 8hrs and now I'm closer to 30k/8hrs.
---
Why would you pass loot if you weren't 60? When someone ding their final level magicaly they learn  to play better?
---
Sell half and save half for after the hoarders sell out their stockpiles, you gotta wait it out though. The first half you should sell in the peak before patch, then watch for the market to dry up and spike
---
They‚Äôre the two classes with the most cc + escapes. None of the other classes have that many buttons to push.
---
Or they could have enough money to sustain themselves without slaving in a 9-5 job everyday but reddit REALLY hates the thought that some people might be more successful than them.
---
Where do I find these premades?
---
Tbf a healer and tank have an infinitely easier time forming a group than a DPS ever will. The number of times I have invited someone to a group only to have them immediately leave and even get mad at me because we didn't have a tank or healer is really high.
---
As a caster you do, less competition for toep/mageblade/RoS/CoE
---
&gt;It's better to lose a match in 20 minutes than extend it to 40 and possibly win.
---
This never happens, alliance wont stop defending so each turtlegame lasts 40-45 minutes, this has been like 80% of my games.
---
It was just for fun man, relax. Just take a deep breathe and realize it wasn‚Äôt a serious thing.
---
I told someone to get naked and kill themselves yesterday.
---
He went in the wrong Stratholme entrance lol
---
70% of the time in the steppes, 20% in DME duo and 10% in EPL i would say. My server is not overcrowded so some in-world gathering is possible.
---
Never give it to them.
---
Yeah,  lemme know if your still playing.
---
Yeah except you literally chose to be a tank. If you hate it so much why'd you choose tank?
---
I use ClassicCastBars and have had no issues with it since I updated it.
---
If I was to guess, it's likely named incorrectly in your addon folder.  Lots of times you need to remove certain things from the folder in order for it to show up, so if the folder is like "ClassicCastBars-master" you need to remove the "-master" part for it to work.
---
Big if true, and absolutely sucks.
---
The patience and mental endurance to do something not particularly enjoyable for 16 hours a day for several months can be described as difficult.
---
A concerto pianist does scales and arpeggios at a tempo within their abilities for 10 hours a day which is not difficult to them. If they do it at speed which is difficult, they are sacrificing their perfection. That's not to say it's not still a feat.
---
R14 is highly sought and very unobtainable. If it's not "difficult" or requires sacrifice, then get it yourself.
---
you should join an AV premade. AV can be very fun.
---
Okay. Imo it should go to the mage, I'd not need roll on something I don't need :p
---
"You chose to be a tank so you have to enjoy tanking dungeons over and over again even if you don't need anything or feel like it atm"
---
What stupid argument is that? I'm DPS and I don't do dungeons I don't need and noone expect me to (unless to help guildies/friends) so I have to hate to DPS right?
---
Things have chilled out since BGs released. I can stroll into BRM solo these days. For a bit, tho, every zone and major city was infested with horde. Had to be scrappy and resourceful or you were going nowhere. We always seemed to have the upper hand when the numbers were even though.
---
I think he's just a triggered neet or addicted to videogames 
---
His responses are quite emotional
---
I‚Äôm Horde.  AV premades are a benefit that are currently exclusive to Alliance.
---
250g is insanely high, lol
---
So you mean it sucks when they play the BG hoe it's meant to be played? As an actual battleground rather than a zergfest...
---
See this is exactly the problem though. This is pretty exclusive to people with mains. New players arent going to be able to afford tanks and therefore wont be able to run dungeons. I can understand first orb reserve but the whole idea is a bit toxic, and creates a shitty atmosphere for newer players.
---
They can, I said there's exceptions to the rule, but the vast majority of people who devote a lot of time to WoW are not successful
---
Successful people have other hobbies
---
Where did it all go so fucking wrong. Horde win at everything else, why did they have to take AV away from us as well. Greedy fucking bastards. I can't wait for my subscription to be up so I can guilt free quit this biased disaster. Have fun farming no one ya bastards.
---
With a fat bowl next to it.
---
aight it actually is a great server, welcome
---
Also note, it's very easy for people to say what they would have done when they aren't in a situation. The other members of the group essentially get free karma for something that isn't even an option for them by doing so. I'm sure we have all had those stupid "oh if it was me I would have done X" conversations after the fact.
---
The other thing I've unfortunately discovered the hard way is that people in guilds aren't nearly as appreciative when you help them out as you would expect.
---
Scenario I've faced a few times is where you help someone farm a particular item until they get it. Then you say "oh can you help me with this item" and their response is either that they suddenly don't have time or now want to focus on getting another item.
---
Premades
---
TLDR: Please horde stop turtle
---
Isn't such a strawman comparison also a logical fallacy? :O
---
Arcanite reaper is 1 epic mount worth of arcanite - for a blue quality weapon.   Absolutely not worth it.  It literally would be quicker to farm frostwolf rep to exalted and buy the unstoppable force - a better weapon, than it would be to farm all the materials for arcanite reaper.
---
Above is false.  There has been definitive testing on this; besides the %spellhit resist chance, a partial resist based upon shadow resistance is also possible.  It usually seems to result in 25%, 50%, or 75% reduced corruption or CoA damage for the entire duration of the spell.
---
This means if you know your corruption normally ticks for a set amount and you're hitting for &lt;50% of what it usually does...recast immediately.
---
paid time off for how long? Most places give maybe 3-4 weeks pto unless your high up/government, in Europe it‚Äôs more but still not enough to commit to rank 14. You think your going to play enough in 4 weeks to make up for the other 48 weeks the person without a job has on you while your back at work? Even if your a high up cop in Canada and have up to 14 weeks pto, that‚Äôs still 38 weeks you won‚Äôt be able to keep up.
---
well, join WSG then - you win every bg!
---
It‚Äôs because all the good alliance players already have exalted and therefore aren‚Äôt playing AV or they are in premades. Horde can‚Äôt do premades with their long que‚Äôs so they are all mixed together good and bad players.
---
I think you underestimate the RP value, friend.
---
Just /afk past 10 minutes if you see that alliance can't get the important graveyards.
---
Happened to me in WSG and problem stayed even in Ironforge. Only relog solved it!
---
What caster? Warriors do more dps you arent invited
---
LFG chat, trade chat. Say you‚Äôre looking for a premade. Or start one yourself. There‚Äôs also certain discord‚Äôs for premades
---
Ok and what about everyone else trying to save up for their shit? What about new players? You are the one who chose to be a warrior, and now you think people owe you for that?
---
that's what im saying, most of the same big youtubers from 5 years ago are the ones at the top today. it's too established. the big channels stay on top, while most flash in the pan new fad channels will burn out and not be around 5 years from now.
---
I‚Äôm also resto Druid same build. I went from 500g to 900g in 2 weeks time. What did I do.....UBRS. I no joke formed groups non stop when I was on for 2 weeks straight. My main goal being obtaining Finkles Skinner (I am still on the hunt). I had a blast along the way met a lot of new friends who all know me now as the Druid who can‚Äôt get the skinning knife who‚Äôs constantly looking for UBRS groups. 
---
I skinned mobs for the dragon scales which sell well as does rugged leather. Guess what I‚Äôm saying is, just play the game gold will come. I got an epic gun which I sold on AH for 100g. Grind on and the mount will come, hang in there you‚Äôre more than halfway there
---
Can confirm this is what better groups do. If we have enough time and a large enough group, we pull Drek solo without killing ant WMs.
---
I play horde and I agree.  And I don't care at all about rank.  I just queue, alt tab out and play something else or surf until it pops.
---
You don‚Äôt have to be Prot to tank...
---
If you were rank 9-10right now it is within reason that someone could push 14 if they are committed to attempting this.
---
My question is, why is it ONLY the horde who do this shit? Why doesn't a single alliance mage or Hunter or warrior ever charge the rush head on to slow them down. It's like there really is a difference in the mentality and skill of the average player on both factions and it's starting to really drive me crazy. The whole thing feels really one sided.
---
Or any other meta combination for that matter.
---
Not sure what you‚Äôre complying about. So you‚Äôre complaining that Alliance afk when they face a moderate horde defense? Is that your issue?
---
Fresh level 60 and severely undergeared warrior over here!
---
Trying to find ways to farm my epic mount and I‚Äôve been solo farming SFK. Gold is alright and I‚Äôm using ravager to kill the mobs lol. What‚Äôs a proper spec to solo farm efficiently? I‚Äôm currently 31/20 spec and scared to waste gold on respeccing lol. And are there any other solo areas I can farm as well? 
---
I should also add that these mobs still hurt when I pull them in stacks of like 15 lol. I‚Äôm probably doing something wrong.
---
Thanks!
---
If the classic.db drop rate is true this is 0.0027% chance.
---
Higher priority than lion heart? Even if u can cap at 9% hit?
---
I still cant decide on a server.... I really like the "feel" of a pvp server but I don't want to be ganked senselessly to a point where I can't progress in the game. Im thinking of either Grobbulus, Sulfuras, Incendius, Earthfury, or Pagle. I wouldn't mind playing on a PvE server, to be truthful I dont really pvp very much (wpvp and battlegrounds), but i do enjoy the extra dynamics that a pvp server affords. Has the introduction of BGs taken away the nonsense of Wpvp on these pvp servers? Will i be able to play in relative peace for the most part? 
---
Edit: On alliance side.
---
How do u choose when to use edgemasters and cthun?
---
We had a 2 hour and a 11 minute match yesterday.  We got galv and stalled out at frosrwolf gy. 
---
We had lots of people drop out.
---
Turn into a long battle in the where we lost all but are back gyard.  
---
About 1 hour half in things slowly turned. The new people that joined did not complain.  Horde wiped on are general.  We split are forces.  Half dropped to def.  Other half started to push  forward.  
---
When we won everyone was super excited.  People were yelling in chat.
---
Did we max are honor.  Hell know.  But I had a friggin blast.  A year from now i will remember this.  Not some zerg win.
---
What it took was for all the complainers to leave and having a new adapted plan
---
It's a nice idea, but so risky. Possession is 9/10 of the law, he has the band now and they want it so the negotiating power is all with him. The second the band is gone, even if they said they'd give him a joker, they don't have to stick to that and there's basically no recourse for him if they don't. He could /gquit and call them names in Trade chat but that's one person yelling into the wind.
---
I say it's better to resolve this here and now for a fair price, if he wants to stick with the guild then sell it for 600g (rather than 300g) and then everything that happens from here on out goes the way it does.
---
Yeah, Ebn is the fucking man as far as druids are concerned.
---
IIRC, in one of his YT vids, he was in Felwood showing how to pull 3-4 satyrs at a time which I‚Äôd guess is as good as farming efficiency gets for Druids.
---
Who even does dungeons anymore lol
---
Deep Prot is not the best tanking spec. It has its advantages, namely mitigation and Tactical Mastery. However, good geared dps will pull threat off of a Deep Prot tank. Once your raid reaches this point, the threat generation provided by Fury/Prot is more important because your dps will not have to hold back allowing you to kill bosses faster, beat enrage timers, etc.
---
You can do all those things with instant que‚Äôs. You just don‚Äôt que and get up from your computer and go do IRL things. Perhaps you are at a loss with honor since other Ally are spamming them back to back but you rank up to exalted way faster than horde. And honesty after rank 5 I stopped giving a shit about min-maxing honor, it‚Äôs not worth it.
---
God forbid that any of us actually have fun playing the game.  I played 2 AV's yesterday.  I waited in 15 minute queues and each game was 15-20 minutes long.  I enjoyed literally every minute of it.  Dude if you feel that people on the internet are foisting their will upon you in a way that makes you not enjoy a GAME, it's probably time for another hobby.
---
You referred to me as a troll first, then you called me small minded. Its disrespectful. I showed you no disrespect. Point it out if you disagree.
---
Now you say sorry I didn't say anything hateful? We are not on the same wave length... Not that I care... just standing my ground you know? PM me because I honestly think your posts are of low quality.
---
Is that at all what I said? Can you read?
---
You should probably take an internet break.
---
Ok.
---
I know first hand, used to run an nvidia geforce 560 ti before switching over to radeon rx 560 and rx 580. The last years of it's life were painful and frustrating.
---
Technically a dual core 3 ghz processor ain't bad on paper, but it's missing alot of the newer instructions and has to work extra hard to do certain things...if it even can.
---
That said he does meet the minimum cpu required so he can buy a sh older gpu. But it ain't gonna be fun.
---
That was my point. Some DPS warriors offer to tank for a compensation!
---
It‚Äôs died down to a comfortable level. I play alliance on Sulfuras and sure, there are times when I get muscled out of a grinding spot by horde but the opposite happens as well. I‚Äôve never felt like world pvp has held me back in the slightest.
---
2 reasons:
---
1) Ally can premade. So everyone who takes pvp serious is sitting in a premade
---
2) Horde has queues. They sit for like 15-20 mins waiting for a queue to pop, this means that once they are in-game, they want to maximaze the honor gained from that game. Slow game? Sure, as long as it has high honor it's worth it for them.
---
Lol alliance making AV premades hah.And getting into huge drama
---
I dont run crit. I'm holy reck. And I dont need crit gear to burst people down. It's even easier when my opponents have gear because they crit me more often. You're also forgetting about one of the single greatest pvp utility spells (blessing of freedom). Regardless, retribution paladin is capable of merking people, and its satisfying to play when you're good and play to your strengths (cleansing, freedoms, healing)
---
Okay so explain WITH MATH how the extra 30 milliseconds are gonna make a NOTICABLE difference with 200ms batch ticks? Since you seem to know everything about it, how much is it making you ‚Äúlose‚Äù. Get some knowledge kid you just know buzzwords and not even how they apply in the context. Again, show me the math how badly the 30ms in a batching environment affects you
---
You never know when you're going to get another drop though. One of our top rogues is still using thrash blade cause nothing else drops for him and he refuses to buy a krol blade 'because it doesn't last that long'. Hell, he'd have been using it for 2 months now if he had. And he is just sitting on thousands of gold too.
---
You should ask your guild to provide you Nightfall, and if they refuse, you should find a new guild.
---
If I didn‚Äôt need them for Lionheart helm I would. I‚Äôve seen plenty of healers that don‚Äôt care. People are so weird about etiquette in this game though. Had a Scholo run last night where Flask of Supreme power recipe drops and the healer flips his shit when we all roll need on it because ‚Äúhe‚Äôs an alchemist‚Äù he loses the roll of course and then whines the rest of the run. Bitch just because you‚Äôre an alchemist doesn‚Äôt mean you don‚Äôt give the rest of us a chance to roll on something worth 200 gold. If it was a guild run sure but not in a pug.
---
A blocked attack cannot be a crit. So 1 rank in Improved Shield Block will cause Shield Block to prevent 2 attacks from being crits when you need to wear a shield, instead of 1 attack.
---
This is ok in theory but most people seem to treat passing on loot as something you should just do, rather than something that will make you regarded as a good person in the guild.
---
It's also questionable why the group all agreeed to the loot rules, then later on changed their mind. I wouldn't be surprised if they have agreed to pressure OP into handing it over with the aim to sell it and split the profits.
---
Who said i charged teammates?
---
Why not just post this in the comments of the other 100 posts about afk in AV??? A new post was not needed dude.
---
Yeah I've been trying to catch a low recipe. I started about 2 months after classic release so missed some good stuff like this.
---
Yeah gotta find a good group of people who are in mutual likes
---
It has been said already but I might as well fill in, it is about premades. Because of Alliance can join instantly it is possible to get premades going for AV. Ask around in LFG or trade (or even in /s at Battle Masters) and you should hopefully get invited.
---
These premades should have around a 90 % winrate if they are worth their salt. Good luck!
---
Does +shadow damage affect shadow damage from wands?
---
Spoken like a true PVPer!
---
9% hit for yellows is a massive dps loss. you're missing out on probably 4% to 5% crit and over 100 attack power just to make up the hit chance missed without having edgesmasters. if you play a race w/o wep skill you're only priority outside of epic mount is edgesmasters 100%. 
---
otherwise you could always go daggers. ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
T2 (Judgement) and eventually T2.5 (Avenger's) are your end goal for both PvP and PvE. Only 2 pieces of Judgement are in the game at the moment. Literally no one wants this gear except for Ret Paladins. You aren't a burden for taking it - you're helping your raid progress more quickly.
---
In the meantime, for PvE, you can dress like a Fury Warrior with your Truestrike Shoulders and all of that fun stuff. PvP you still want plate gear.
---
I'm really baffled that the mage did not automatically get the item in a guild-only run. In my guild it would be absolutely normal for the mage to call need on the item, and nobody would even think about rolling vs him just to sell it.
---
Very true. Several of the original Warcraft / wow creators had a DnD background, and it really shows if you know what to look for.
---
For sure. Keep in mind this build was built for pve and recoking was splashed in for pvp. There are some obvious talents you can move around to make pvp a bit easier. Get rid of righteous fury for I'm hoj, and you could run less toughness for 1h spec if you want. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuzxoZVGtIMzx
---
You‚Äôre braindead if you haven‚Äôt seen the horse qq posts lol
---
No it's a percentage of the servers factions playerbase probably about 10-20 at a time
---
Try to take your own advice, you're literally missing the point because you don't read what he wrote (or didn't understand it).
---
You cast a NORMAL lightning bolt and after it finishes you cast elemental mastery + chain lighting. He didn't say you should use EM before casting the lightning bolt.
---
/r/Iamverysmart
---
What zone is this
---
Yes but I mean u can have 1 active and 1 in bag and they stack with Elixir of Giants and stuff.
---
Someone who got blacklisted for mass reporting because someone was selling the Lionheart Helm for a more reasonable price than their own guild and is now trying their damndest to justify their saltiness.
---
OH in the video.
---
Looks like someone fell asleep at the keyboard.
---
Have a look at these, my dude.

It's a sick class. Great fun in PvP in particular.
---
I play retail a lot and can definitely say that there happens almost same amount of conversations.
---
Even got the 2 R‚Äôs!
---
When fighting rogues I suggest just eating their stuns while letting them rack up crits on you for reck stacks, then bomb them afterwards. Save your trinket for when they blind you and go for a reset. I use a 1h/shield when fighting melee and hunters, then swap to a 2h for the casters.
---
Edit: also I always use blessing on sanc when fighting melee with retribution aura (swap to concentration aura if you need to heal) divine favor, hoj max rank holy light for a full heal is sweet too.
---
Lol so you think people owe you for a decision that you chose to make? What your saying is that because you chose to play a class that there is a known shortage of, people owe you some sort of recompense? Just so were clear
---
Yeah hit rating will play a big part in your tanking ability. Also, dps that go ham usually won't expect 100% agro retention from the tank. So unless you're getting flamed, don't stress it too much. And even then, some players are simply toxic. Give yourself a chance and have fun along the way !
---
Just taking this opportunity to ask any bigbrain Ret God in here - Is there a way you can beat me as an ele shammy? If I purge seals and ground hoj I feel it is literally impossible to lose.
---
I mean literally everyone knows this and it has no bearing on the parent comment of how batching allows for the big burst.
---
Yes I can read and I took the one you responded to "likely not even the tank themselves" as doing dungeons they don't need over and over again for nothing. There for a payment might make it worth the time. But you don't have to hate tanking just because of that.
---
I‚Äôm a simple man.  I see Critical Role, I downvote.
---
Quit pretending that only PVPers have reasons to run AV.
---
&gt; the talents Vanilla launched with were absolute trash vs. 1.12) 
---
Oh yeah... I still remember things like distract aoe increase and throwing weapon specalization for rogues. You didn't really decide between talents, you tried to go around all the useless things :D
---
It wasn't that bad until the survey came out showing the server at 58-60% horde and the alliance all freaked out and transferred
---
What on earth do you do in av and how do you farm rep all I do is kill people and follow the zerg and usually end up third or second on the leaderboards on kills but the rep seems so bad like 500 an hour?  that would take an eternity to get exalted. Is there a faster way to get rep. were are all these premades people are talking about and what objective are you supposed to go for in av
---
Did it in classic and used yeti.  No cleaner spawned. 
---
Hmm now I can‚Äôt remember if I used yeti after I started quest or before.
---
Dreadmist is 51 ally 49 horde this guy just imagining things and wants more ally pop it seems.You can check on wow classic population
---
Yes please. That would be worth the watch/read. I imagine the aftermath will be tough for the players who agreed to participate.
---
I always compare loot council to dictatorships. If you get a good one they are great. 
---
But we all know how often that happens.
---
Haha nice! I like the color.
---
Found the mage
---
Seniority, as in how long the player has been raiding with the guild, should be factored into every LC decision. A LC that doesn't reward seniority to some extent is guaranteed to diminish the loyalty of long-time members. 
---
I've seen a handful of new guildies join in the day and raid with us on the same night, only to abruptly gquit after being funneled several pieces of gear after 2-3 weeks. Now the LC almost never gives gear to new raiders unless nobody else wants it.
---
Tanks want to res first orb, sure, whatever. Every orb, all greens and access blues, and charge for wipes?
---
Do yourself a favor, and switch from that server, or find yourself a Guilded that will help you gear up
---
Bothered by people who are bothered.
---
Don‚Äôt let the salt rub off on yah man*
---
Bruuuuhhh, how long has it been since I've heard Ronald Jenkees??! I miss his videos.
---
I've been passing shit like this to randoms who would actually use it because I'm not a selfish dick and others (pugs) have been passing other valuable stuff to me too like flask recipes. Of course you first need to make sure everyone else in the group is on the same page before you fuck yourself over when everyone needs but you pass. No way I would have collected all flask recipes without buying a single one if everyone needed just to sell it. In an actual guild where people help each other the band gets passed to the mage without question. Your post doesn't really say if the others also needed which is very needed context imo. If everyone else needed and then you needed too then sure you're fine, no reason to get fucked over. But imo sounds like a bad guild then that they don't pass it to the mage and also the message with the 300g is a huge red flag. Don't pay that 300g. If the GM didn't like that behaviour they should kick you from the guild or just not take you to raids, blackmailing members as GM sounds shady AF.
---
Because people who roll on alliance are bad at the game.
---
Pretty plain and simple tbh.
---
You have power in the guild. You have access to officer chat which is not shown to the entire guild. You have favor with the other guildmasters. You're trusted enough to be masterlooter, an automatic position of authority. You publicly express your displeasure about a guildie in front of everyone. The fact that you're a guild master completely changes the dynamic of the situation. Atleast this is the way I see it. Hell, even asking him if you can roll on something that is OS for you is a pressure power play. What's he gonna do? Say no? Is he really gonna test it? I'd personally be annoyed that you even asked.
---
He switches to mage armor to regen mana due to the nature res it gives.
---
But why do you say that as if one raid isn't all you need to funnel loot? 
---
Please though, tell me how he was 65ilvl october 2nd and how that wasn't funneled? Dude had more gear by the end of his first logged raid than most people do right now, lol.
---
If someone can retain it for that long they deserve it.
---
It seems likely he will cause more drama down the line. He got 3 pieces of gear in his first raid -at 58 no less- and he still wanted more?! Not only is he an ungrateful, greedy fuck, he also went back on his words.
---
OP is asking a question. Telling OP to not play ret is not answering the question, which means they are wasting everyone's time by writing non-answers.
---
Thank God for classic where we can...clear current content in greens without any need for communication, just listening to deadly boss mods and pressing three buttons.
---
You should be fine since u get 5 hit + wep skill from talents and racials so go w the crit
---
"Already known"
---
Doesn't matter, because you still agreed with his assessment or else you wouldn't have chimed in about top guilds.
---
Once you agree on the loot rules...that's it.  You rolled...you won.  Beyond that its some one trying to undo the agreed upon rules because of "circumstances."  You have 0% obligation.
---
I passed on it
---
Best crit video of all time
---
Thank you for the zoom.
---
Am a priest :p
---
I would understand if guild required it from us, that they should help with some of the mats, but not if its just because i "want to"
---
We are not hardcore raiding, besides we ofcause got every cleared and will clear BWL pretty fast also but still.
---
There really is no secret to it. It simply sucks now. I just got to exalted last night. The best thing I can advice you to do is to do turn ins as often as possible. The storm crystals and the armor scraps are decent so loot every body. Killing half gives 137 rep so that's gonna be the main one since alliance rarely wins nowadays. If you can stop by your flight guys do it cause you can give some turn ins too. If I see my team has lost momentum I start focusing on that and asking people in chat to do turn ins too.
---
That guy looks exactly like what i picture every female gnome player to look like.
---
What addon shows you what mob drops the item you've moused over or the mob that drops the recipe/pattern/formula?
---
It's pretty easy to go look at top guilds logs and see what they're using.  No one is parroting anything. Facts are facts.  You see the same answer more often because it's the right answer, not because people are parroting. Lol.
---
Same, medium/high pop. Maybe this is more of an issue on high/full where there are more potential "buyers".
---
Is there a way to tell how much time is left on a 2-hr buff? The difference between 1 hour 1 minute and 1 hour 59 minutes is immense, but it always just shows up as 2 hours.
---
I'm doing it currently, I know how to use commands and edit database pretty well.
---
i've been doing some testing without full optimized buffs and i'm already doing over 500dps this seems really good.
---
i'll give you detailed numbers soon
---
Do i need to take a video ?
---
sounds like you have some reservations.
---
Actually my experience is better without a prot, J get to actually heal and we clear a lot faster.
---
Only alts lol. Ret pallies are salty today
---
You're full of shit.
---
Full druid tier 1 drops every mc, how is there loot drama over druid tier?
---
Then they‚Äôre not very good or their scaling hasn‚Äôt set in.
---
Even with the map i still get lost in BRD
---
Haven't seen your stuff since like WotLK/Cata. Great to see you back dude.
---
Truly outrageous
---
what exactly did he funnel, he got girdle on the first raid, all ony heads  went to tanks and officers first to control weekly ony buffs, helm of destruction and true flight are ret items as hunters need tier, OEB to ret as warriors were 1h fury, and then he has dungeon loot and 3x crafted gear. Look at any other raider in crusade and you'll see they're geared out just as much, we're all just waiting for bwl at this point.
---
Really? Name a raid boss that requires 0 coordination nor communication that people can go into and just follow DBM
---
Alright despite all these idiots in this thread rets an absolutely wonderful spec in pvp, and if you play it correctly youre a massive asset to your team.
---
BUT full disclaimer you are NOT a warrior, you ARE a hybrid, so be embrace the hybrid.
---
I played to rank 13 in vanilla as a ret, and with the current talent trees imo the best spec you can play as ret for pvp atm is 21/0/30.  This gets you divine favor, illumination, healing light, and vengance.
---
As for gear and enchants, you want plate, high stats in stam and int, spell power, and mele crit.  Seal of command benefits 43% from spell power as well as attack power.  So spell power benefits both your offense and defense.  Stam and int are just as important, and mele crit to activate vengance when you do go offensive.  Mp5 is also a great stat, if youre oom youre useless.  So as ret, you want ALL the stats.  The pvp gear is almost perfectly optimized honestly, valor/lightforge/lawbringer and eventually judgement are also GREAT, mix and match.
---
As for the tricky part, playing ret well in pvp.  Honestly your job is to support your team, freedoms on warriors/flag carriers, protection on clothies, divine favor holy lights on anyone who gets low.  
---
Thats your priorities, if everyones stable, THEN bring the pain.  Stun your target and drop a judgement of command for extra damage during the stun (this works with grenades too), swap to sword n board carry the flag, throw out a few more heals, attack when you can or are oom.
---
Your damage isnt going to be great, but your utility in pvp is game breaking, so play to that strength, and youll see how big an impact youll have on your teammates.  Remember support your team FIRST, then bring the pain.
---
This makes the most sense to me. Appreciate it. Ill test it out as soon as I can.
---
Why roll a PvP server if PvP is not a maim focus? Just play on PvE so you can choose when to PvP, the people who rolled on PvP servers without wanting to PvP are the ones who constantly complained during phase 2 that wPvP was to much to handle for them and I dont want that to happen to YOU!!
---
You also forgot all the other little perks Rogues have: lockpick, and amazing cc. Both classes dish out great DPS when played well. But a well played warrior can tank even when not tank specced. I'm leveling both a rogue and a warrior simultaneously and I cant decide which one I like more. I too like tanking with my warrior, but DPS on rogue is more fun to me.
---
IMO, if you want to gain most of your leveling xp from dungeons go warrior, but if you plan on doing it from quests and grinds, go rogue
---
What does a Noggenfogger do for you as a FC? Just the part that makes you tiny?
---
Drem is outrageous
---
Yes, that was when horde chose not to use their advantage.
---
You can just google one and join it.  Wins about 90% of the time.  Just have your epic mount or you'll get booted.
---
Been farming for my charger quest and got a twofer this morning.
---
This is really cool. You can use the horde ones for drinks and the alliance ones for fixing wobbly chairs.
---
Had a group that got here. Mage mentioned the pattern, said it's worth the extra minute to kill them. Tank refused and continued. Mage and Tank proceed to spend 5mins arguing about if they should kill the extra trash, wasting way more time than just doing it.
---
Mage decides to just pull the trash anyway, Tank ignores them, runs ahead and pulls boss. Group wipes, everyone rage quits. GG. This is why I don't PuG.
---
Fuggin' peepeepoopoo the Crocolisk
---
Ah yeah word
---
Dude, most r14 players are going to be account sharers anyway.
---
Just sell that shit. I have no idea why people have such huge boners for this stupid ring. It‚Äôs basically a twinking item. There‚Äôs plenty of options instead of it. The 800ish gold you‚Äôll make on it is far more valuable then the marginal dps increase a mage might receive having it and they‚Äôll probably very quickly replace it in the grand scheme of things. It‚Äôs not even a great 60 PvP item as the raw stats you‚Äôd receive from other options are almost always more desirable than its underwhelming proc. 
---
The ring basically does nothing for the guild. Very little for the mage. And does a lot for you. It‚Äôs offensive that they‚Äôd even make a big deal of it to begin with.
---
If they really cared that much they would have already hopped on the AH and bought the mage a ring.
---
Freezing band blows sell it and get yourself your mount. There are several better rings for mages in pvp and pve
---
Now get the greater arcane elixer recipe to drop in the same run and you're rich.
---
Lol Wowhead guides
---
Definitely keep it its yours. Helping out guildies is great but keep it within reasons.
---
Common farming methods such as DM:E lashers etc. net around 40g/h. That would be worth over 20 hours of constant grinding. Cant seriously expect that kind of generosity even if you would have been in a guild for ages.
---
Guildies should give you water for free, portals, make enchants without a fee etc. Thats something what you should expect. I would have hard time accepting if someone offered me something thats worth +20 hours of hard work.
---
That would be the chance to get 3 arcane crystals off of one swing, he swing four times so the chance is higher than that. Still unbelievably lucky though.
---
I mean I‚Äôve passed on two dragon slaying compendiums, one on the first day DM was out, so our tanks could have them. But I‚Äôm personally a big fan of need rolls not being for selling things and wish hitting need bound the damn item to you. But that‚Äôs just me.
---
When it dropped did you immediately hit need or did you wait to see what the others (especially the GM) did?
---
End of the day if nobody specified the loot rules and everyone else hit need on it as well... sounds like they‚Äôre being a sore loser. If you all hit greed then same deal. If you smacked need before anybody else could say anything then it‚Äôs possible they would have all passed to the mage but tried to stop you taking it.
---
Who cares? It's for gold
---
All the potions and bandages and foods are in (which are all very convenient) but none of the gear. It is very strange haha.
---
Theyre going to nerf it because of allies like you. Thanks!
---
Also youre completely correct.
---
I used the same approach for these pants off of Fineous. "DROP YOUR PANTS" worked on the second try. I was less successful when I tried this on that girl that works at the kiosk in the mall .....
---
You couldn't be more wrong. Most r14 people are those who paid r14 boost out of their disposable income, face the truth.
---
You‚Äôre looking for a server to specifically grief people in stv? Lol
---
WoW was heavily influenced by DnD so not very surprising
---
this isnt high school anymore, grow the fuck up
---
Yeah, why not. Not much different from excelling at any other hobby.
---
Yeah. I think about leaving it often. And that aline makes me think I should. I just miss the days of ppl who showed up and did their part got to roll for loot from a boss they killed. Instead all u here is "core raiders rol l for new bis purple" ok no core needs ? Raiders roll, ok no raiders need ? Trials roll. It's fair and very unfair at same time tbh. Lot goes into it.
---
Nightfall is traditionally paid for by the guild
---
Ret main here.  Ret'd all throughout vanilla and TBC, and Retting again.  Got FM when it was still cool and Glad in TBC.  Fuck the haters.  Ret is a super flexible spec that when done properly lets you fill multiple roles in both raid and PvP.  My spec is 20-0-31 (taking 4% in deflection which is MASSIVE in PvP) which lets me ably heal in raid AND PvP while taking Repent all the way down in Ret for that all important CC in PvP.  You'd be shocked how effective a ret can be as a secondary healer in PvP that can self peel and create pressure with 2 great CC's and bubble.
---
Your #1 stat as ret is hit to cap.  In PvP that is 5% hit.  With my 20-0-31 build, that does limit your gear options in this phase a bit.  Get Don Julio's, Bloodmail Boots, Trueflight Wristguards off Domo, Ony head neck, and Brigam's Girdle to reach PvP hit cap.  These also all happen to your BiS for PvE as well.  If you are lucky enough to be in a cool guild that isn't full of try hard losers who want to min/max a 15 year old easy mode game with their 3 button rotations, get Onslaught Girdle off of rag.  Your legs for this phase should be Eldritch From DMW or Judgment legplates, I prefer Eldritch when swinging.  For Helm, either Crown of Destruction or Judgment Helm.  I use judgment for PvP and Crown for PvE.  The resistances and plate on judgment are too good to pass up in PvP, and the bonus healing/damage are great for those off heals and hammers to catch runners.  Shoulder itemization SUCKS in this phase.  Unless you are ranking for the PvP set your next best is going to be lightforge, Bile Etched, or (believe it or not) the Earthslag shoulders from BRD (which is what I use for everything because I have never seen truestrike).  For your chest, SGC is obviously your best until AQ for everything, but if you don't want to endlessly grind Arena for it, the Ogre Forged Hauberk from Tribute is pretty close to SGC and gives you int which is hard to come by for Rets.  Your cloak for PvP is Gargoyle Cape from UD Strath with a +5 all resist enchant.  PvE is Cape of the Black Baron also from UD.  Your gloves are Flameguard Gauntlets from MC until AQ40.  Your perma trinket is Blackhand's Breadth and swap in HoJ while PvP trinket is on CD.
---
Now you're a fucking ret god. Don't ever spec reckoning, it's a meme that only lets you kill warriors and rogues, which you should already dominate unless greatly out geared.
---
\-Andro
---
I use it daily. It's not against any rules or their terms of service so idk how you would get banned for it.
---
need before greed is about vendoring BoPs. period.
---
BoEs are a liquid asset. Warden staff = 300g = krol blade
---
change my mind.
---
The comment backed by nothing! Lol
---
People who are trying to rank love the queues. Rankers in alliance have to sit in AV literally 24/7 with instant queues, whereas horde get 15 minute breaks in between each game. It‚Äôs amazing
---
Blizz hates fun.
---
I bet we won‚Äôt even see the blood plague outbreak when ZG opens.
---
fight club, a discord primarily moderated by people in these top guilds, explicitly discourages the vast majority of guilds from fury dualwield tanking.
---
this is because most groups do not have the dps to rip threat off a correctly geared and played deep prot tank (a rough figure given is ~800-850 dps on magmadar/single target fights for horde side, ally is even higher due to salv). 
---
if threat is a problem at lower damage numbers, often more underlying issues like "tank not pressing shield slam on cd" and gear itemization mistakes are involved. in such a case furyprot serves as a poor bandaid for such issues.
---
if the raid doesn't reach that dps threshold (and 90% of guilds don't), then fury prot is situationally inferior as it stresses the healers for no gain.
---
 I've seen logs of deep prot tanks generating 900+ threat per second on golemagg, there are relatively few groups that wouldn't be sufficient for.
---
Wise move IMO.

Thrash blade is far more than enough for current content and the 300~400g he'd spend on krol blade can be saved for when BWL comes out to go balls deep on consumables that'll have a larger overall impact.
---
If you really want some gold, take 3 hours a day to farm Zul‚ÄôFarak, you won‚Äôt be getting good passive income with transmutes because so many people have them readily available at the moment its inflated as hell. I would grind gold a couple hours a day to really see some income over time
---
If everyone rolled need then it's free game, if everyone but you and the mage rolled need then the mage should get it or you should reroll with everyone rolling need (or just have the people that didn't need roll to try and beat your original winning roll). It being a guild really shouldn't change anything, etiquette should be the same inside and outside a guild, only inside runs with stated loot rules should things be different.
---
How would you get banned for account sharing? If you are logging in via a remote desktop you are always playing from the same IP. They cant trace the IP for the computer routed into your original one
---
I love how people think 40/60 is reasonably balanced.
---
The other faction has literally 50% more members. Fucking 50 percent. That's 50% more people in every zone, 50% more items in the Auction house, 50% more guilds, 50% more groups and the list goes on.

---
Sure, but these are like &lt;1 minute fights currently, as fights get longer they become more of the meme spec.
---
Wrong its not batching. Em  is done so you activate it and the buff goes when the target takes damage. I'm a shaman and I fuck with this all day and talk with other shamans regarding it.
---
Legit gold farm for rogues but I‚Äôm not seeing how a priest gets here solo

I thought for sure this was gonna be the group of us jumping onto the Christmas tree.

What I don‚Äôt show in the video is that 10 minutes later one guy just leaves out of nowhere and we wipe, then tank has to go. Luckily we found 2 other guys and finished the dungeon.
---
&gt; they've done nothing for you so why help them
---
OPs situation aside, what a shitty attitude mate.
---
Shitty tanks are rampant in the game.  It was a simple request that everyone would have agreed to if the tank requested it, but everyone is so scared of upsetting a tank that stuff like this happens.

Not entirely sure but it looks like quartz

As an ally player, p2 was horrid. I quit playing til bgs lol. Swapped servers, loving life. But I see an equal amount of bitching from horde here, just about different things. I think it's just people.
---
Ye
---
Thoughts and prayers.
---
Alliance have a clear advantage when it comes to rushing last boss meta that dominated the first few days.
---
Due to that, horde decided on the honor farm meta for ranking. So where alliance was getting 700 rep per game and like 1k honor for a win, horde was getting around 300 rep for a loss but 4k honor.
---
Yo who knew the top guilds had tanks in blues?

I like the dynamics of a pvp server, theres also some relatively faction balanced pvp server according to some data, and there isnt a single pve server thats balanced. I like there to be some opposing faction players around, just gives the world a nice feel.  And i like having to run into horde pvpers once in a while just not all the time.
---
 It literally does though. The travel time on the lb allows all 3 spells to hit roughly the same time and therefore the burst is increased.

IDK what it is but I find this clip extremely hilarious.

---
Using most available consumables, using only Onyxia world buff, not dire maul. Not using boomkin and feral aura either.
---
NPC is lvl 63(boss), armor has been set to 330 so I don't have to waste time applying all the debuffs, 330 if what it should have if it had 3700(normal mc boss, casters even have less) with faerie fire, recklessness, sunder.

Priest: *starts casting MC*
---
You can't get enough RP to hit the highest ranks by AFKing, there will always be people actively farming honor much faster than your AFK.
---
Orbs are like 25g. Thats less than an hour of farming for any class. Just buy them
---
What dungeon is this?
---
Yeah the Robe of the exalted is not only BiS but also he can use it at 58. Seems like he needs to put in some effort pre-BiS farming. Cenarion Boots are the only T1 raid gear that‚Äôs actually raid BiS. Cenarion chest is at best a placeholder for pre-raid BiS and a pvp piece MAYBE. No reason he can‚Äôt share the love of Tier pieces. T1 is mostly just to flex in Org.
---
stay mad butthurt ally

How are rogues the least valuable pve class? They are second highest dps behind warriors.
---
edit: pvp-&gt;pve
---
? ive got like a 97% win rate as ally. lmao
---
Lower blackrock spire
---
That‚Äôs also a great deal for ANOTHER BiS that‚Äôs super expensive. He shouldn‚Äôt complain if you‚Äôre willing to throw down for a free Hide of the Wild. Honestly I‚Äôd feel so lucky if you did that for me as that Druid.
---
time to reroll a bettter class
---
I've been in way too many LBRS PuGs that don't want to bother with those 3 pyromancers and refuse to listen. It's just baffling and downright awful.
---
There's a toy that people can put out that has festive costumes. It lasts 10 minutes once the costume is on.
---
Yeah just shy of rank 6 and said fuck this. Before the battlegrounds putting in decent hours a day I was floating around sub 500 players. Now with the BGS im double that and progress is futile. The sheer amount of hours required is fucked.
---
if youre wasting mana purging my rank 1 SoC and not doing damage to me, and I time my seals with my weapon swing timer then I got a good chance with bubble up.  If you immune or resist a stun or Repent, I'm in trouble.  I've killed plenty of eles.  But the good ones that went Orc with 100% fucking stun resist in PvP are really tough with their CDs up, pretty much have to predict the win macro and immune it with bubble.
---
I don‚Äôt see anything wrong with what you did. Raiding is all about the team effort, he knew you only wanted that piece and he got 3 pieces and a weapon. If I was in his shoes I‚Äôd have gladly passed on it, plus it‚Äôs Druid loot so I doubt he has much competition for the next time that chest piece drops. I‚Äôd say greed got the best of him and he should have stuck to his word when you originally asked him. I was in a raid last Tuesday and the lead pally only needed his belt for his set, I gladly passed ;) because like that Druid I too got like 3 pieces of tier loot and a weapon last week. But I‚Äôm not a fan of pve healing so the healing gear doesn‚Äôt excite me that much.
---
How are you able to check them if they are online or not, unless you are online yourself?
---
They already had the honor farm meta either way. I think horde was just tired of losing, even if losing benefitted the horde more than defending and winning, and decided they wanted to win.
---
It's spell batching because elemental mastery applies to your next spell but spell batching puts them together in the same batch. Can't thing of a better way to word it. Otherwise you could lightning bolt then chain lightning so they hit at the same time and they'd both crit if I'm understanding what you're saying correctly. 
---
This is why it works in classic but didn't work this way in vanilla. I'm a shaman too, playing a class doesn't mean someone knows every mechanic with them.
---
If you roll PvP I strongly, strongly recommend Rogue.
---
Levelling a Warrior and being ganked by Mages, Locks and SPriests is a fucking nightmare, past Lvl 40 you kind of just have to hope for a lucky Mortal Strike Crit on Clothies, otherwise you get kited to Dalaran and back.
---
Pally PvP healing &gt; anything shamans can do in PvP, it just doesn't look as cool in a YouTube montage.

Still waiting on that Pink Whitney in Ontario

Tanks are scarce so everyone else is willing to appease to some extent in order to get the dungeon done. However this has enabled shitty tanks to perceive themselves as literal gods who gets to dictate every single move of entire groups, and they sometimes flat out ignore anything dps/healers say while in the dungeon.
---
It takes five to be a team.
---
Buh, buh, if we take 27 minutes instead of 30 then I can do 11 runs in the time of 10.
---
In my experience half the group will go afk into the tunnel while the other half turtles. So it‚Äôs basically over but even just half the group can stall for awhile.
---
Is that a guess, or has Blizzard made a statement?
---
I had R14 Grand Marshall before TBC hit so I really do. Obviously the people that do this 24/7 will have a more optimal way, but it still comes down to who can spend their entire life in a BG.
---
The only things they provide is situational high dps, (on SINGLE target fights where there arnt mechanics hindering melee dps), sap I guess (much worse than polymorph), unlocking doors (which engineering / blacksmithing can still do)
---
Name a class that is less valuable? My first toon on retail was a rogue and I learned how much more value other classes have to PvE from playing one. 
---
On PvP they have tons of value. That's the trade off as I see it.
---
yeah it pretty much looks like a classic war vs mage matchup, nothing amazing or i'm missing something.
---
Which is a shame because warriors and priests are also hybrids. Yet they don't pay much tax at all.
---
Clearly it's not hugely important.
---
 So what?
---
But they‚Äôre three independent events. So 0.03^3 right?
---
I like warrior it definitely was fun to grind out and get through the experience.. if you do not pay attention sometimes you can suffer the consequences.. not sure other classes but I‚Äôm sure you can mindlessly play some classes not warrior usually. I do enjoy tanking it‚Äôs fun times to dictate the speed of the run etc. it can get tedious and shit when it goes bad but when it‚Äôs good it‚Äôs great... pvp can be fun if you have a healer warriors can make big moves but on your own ehhhhh it‚Äôs not fun ..  I would saw play both since you have made choices but warrior can get wildly demotivating late 20s or mid 30s but I guess that could be any class honestly
---
Dremlock the fuckin god. His WotLK video still the most viewed shaman pvp video on warcraftmovies. Legend

I Said name a boss. I‚Äôm not going to go thru explaining each and every boss why an addon can‚Äôt do the right for you.... Because you need some type of idea of how to do each fight before you go in.

131 runs no HoJ. Took a break for a while now...
---
What is your passion? What would you be doing with out having to worry about money and responsibilities?
---
Yeah but most people can't get invited to those premades.
---
Yea exactly my point. Thanks for explaining it better as well
---
There was nothing fun about that bug and anyone who thinks that shit was, wasn‚Äôt actually there. If the player base can‚Äôt handle PvP server ganking they definitely won‚Äôt tolerate the blood plague glitch.
---
There are plenty of balanced PvE servers out there, and any data you find on numbers is totally incomplete as they are not offical blizzard numbers, what you describe is a PvE server...
---
you run down, past the pat, then jump down on the ledge to evade/lose aggro. Then you leviate, pop invis pot right before you get to the ground, and run between the spiders and the packs. Then from there you kill them.
---
Because it‚Äôs not boring ass lame ass PVE that‚Äôs why, already got suffer thru a raid once a week, not gonna repeat that process every time I step into a BG
---
Private server players are known to be very racist so I'd guess that every server has them
---
&gt; designed not be better at any role than the "pures"
---
"But what about hunters?"
---
Nobody influencing balance played a hunter. So now we are at our peak relative to other classes. Our bis weapon until Naxx sports a juicy TWO dps upgrade. Now, it's slower, but still. The damage range barely moves.
---
No its not a shitty attitude, this is a game and not real life. It's reasonable to give and take in games, enjoy being made a tool of
---
T2 is amazing for protection paladins. Its the best threat gear for us.
---
&gt; what is my purpose.
---
"You get hit in the face and yelled at."
---
Wait so if you join a group that's already queued you just skip ahead instead of the group going to the back?
---
Yes, because the 40 random Hordes include some people who know what they're doing.
---
The 40 man ally PUG is all 60% mount people who can't get into the premades that require epic mounts.

This is whats wrong with WoW classic. Everyone plays for himself. I would have given the ring to the mage and be happy about the Karma..

its 25%+ the default resist chance.
---
Yeah this is true, we only run 2 or 3 resto druids max.
---
I've been really unlucky so far though. Been raiding for a month now and only seen the T2 helm once and haven't seen the legs drop.

I'm sure RNG will hopefully come around though.

Is there an addon that can track if a dot application was partially resisted?
---
Naw not with DOTs. It doesn't have a hit penalty but it has a damage reduction penalty
---
if you're defining greed as "value," then there is nothing wrong with greed, and only unfairness from "need."

druid still gets the benefit of 300g and no longer has to go to the AH and spend 300g. it's the same thing.

I'm using classic cast bars, but that doesnt seem to be it.  I'm trying to disable one of them, but can't seem to figure it out!

I have mined 61 Rich Thorium nodes in DM:E over the last three days and got 4 arcane crystals, spent like 12-14 hours to get 200 gold, feels REALLY bad lol.

Your guild needs to clearly establish loot rules. In all honesty you deserve the piece, but I can see both sides. Just change the loot rules, that should make him happy. I mean this dude cant even equip the gear yet. Tbh he shouldn't be allowed to roll on anything. Period.
---
Rend runs are 5 mans. You do not need two tanks, lol.

You can play around threat issues by chugging limited invulnerability potions. You still need to manage your threat but it lets you push you a bit harder

Im usually deep prot for raiding but often respec arms in between raids and 2h arms tanking is viable assuming you have the mc bis tank gear to back it up
---
Oh my god. This reeks of 2004. The fraps trial, (purposefully) shitty music, (purposefully) shitty editing in Movie Maker, the introduction of guild members one by one, yeah. This shit is the OG shit. Hahahaha, I'd love to join you guys, too bad  I don't play at the moment. I'd love to though. For real. This is so so so retro.
---
Hmm, maybe 250 DPS on Onyxia since she's airborne for 33% of the fight but Ret should be able to do 450-600 DPS on all of the current MC bosses.
---
Assuming you have shatter and improved CoC:
---
Frost nova &gt; flame strike &gt; cone of cold (spell batched), sometimes arcane explosion.

Looks like Quartz to me. I‚Äôve been using it for years.

Does shadow reflect trinket work?

You can solo farm them as a mage with a lesser invis pot and careful timing. The two three mob packs are a bit tricky sometimes if yout get unlucky, but doable.
---
I got tired of not seeing it drop on my runs, so I solo farmed it. Took only a few resets to get it.

Dude! Was this on Mirage Raceway EU?
---
I forgot about that, but that's already in the game, and I don't think it's gonna push down the price any more than it already has.
---
%spellresist is only used to determine if the dot lands.  It has no other effects on the dot damage.
---
It's alright, I do it mostly for the demonic runes. The farm itself feels too slow as a druid, even when pulling multiple mobs and using hurricane.
---
"Clever use of game mechanics" is just another way of saying abuse of game mechanics.

Depending on how desperate the group is, you can get in MC as a 58 or 59 with blues and greens. If you‚Äôre 60, you definitely don‚Äôt need pre-BiS for a pug.
---
Really depends on what you mean by group. I was one of the slowest levellers in my guild so they had done about 8 runs before I was attuned. They brought me at level 58 and carried me which was no problem. 
---
In PUGs it‚Äôs different since the only way to judge someone you have never played with is by gear. Most pugs almost expect you to have MC gear already or at least close to pre-raid bis. This is to make up for the lack of coordination that guild would have. 
---
As a healer you most likely get away with less than optimal gear but still don‚Äôt expect to be taken in all freshly dinged level 60 greens

---
I joined my guild a couple months and had a similar situation but with a krol blade and a rogue. I ended up giving him the krol blade in hopes that the guild would be equally kind to me in the future. 
---
I ended up not only receiving the first eye of divinity from loot council but I had over 20 people stay late after raid to farm eye of Shadow. On top of that after completing the quest a group of 10 or so guildies took over the essence of waters in felwood for a couple hours to help with the healing enchant.
---
Same guild had a priest who never helped anyone and charged ridiculous prices for certain things. Would need for off spec gear in guild 5 mans. Dude always complained when he got passed up on loot and eventually got frustrated and left the guild.
---
I fully believe you make your own experience in this game and karma comes around. Hopefully this helps make your decision easier
---
How does 1 do Domo with 0 marks and 0 call outs. DBM doesn‚Äôt mention to poly anything. Or to focus anything down. 
---
Garr DBM doesn‚Äôt mention any Banishes or who should tank who. 
---
Maybe Magmadarr could be just tank and spanked. 
---
What I‚Äôm saying is though, the beginning MoP raids were all just Tank and spank bosses and everything you needed to know was just told to you on DBM. Whereas a majority of classic bosses are not(excluding magmadarr)
---
Bla bla bla 100% sure that you wouldn't do it
---
I'm honestly surprised you don't have a loot maximum or loot decay in place, when rolling for loot. Most groups have a 1-2 item limit. And if no one is rolling you can open up more for this one item. What's to keep 1 person from rolling on all items and getting lucky and winning them all. It doesnt seem fair, regardless if they won every single piece
---
sure, but there‚Äôs a difference between fairly and clearly factoring seniority in your decisions vs. starting loot council with your buds to get 35 other people or whatever to gear you up. i think it can be done right and that is a good point but it‚Äôs also far too easy to create an exploitative situation
---
In my experience horde pugs beat ally premades maybe 50% of the time. That should tell you all you need too, under no circumstances should a pug beat a premade.
---
Warrior is def slowest leveler, hunter def fastest.
---
By ditching the BG early you are just screwing over the rest of the alliance who stayed behind, and those who will inevitably take your place.
---
This honestly reminds me of the prisoners dilemma. I understand that you want to avoid a turtle but by doing so en masse you are screwing each other over.
---
Great post. Thanks. Seems like such a cool and fun thing to bring onto unsuspecting players,  it's too bad Blizzard nerfed it like they did.
---
That's like 30-40 mins of time. Theres other methods as a mage that make just as much for the time investment.
---
were fine dude but thanks for the concern
---
More like 10, considering Rich Thorium isnt depleted in one tap.
---
You can easily get 10 veins an hour.

---
How much was the boost? Game gold or IRL cash/btc?
---
It's not the only way, but it's the way that makes the most sense, it's like if the main tank was expected to grind flasks, consumables, BoE gear and Thunderfury mats all by himself, it would be completely unrealistic for them to do so, but if you have a 40 man raid group throw a few of the crafting materials that drop his way, perhaps fund a few consumables here and there, that would take a ton of the stress off his already high workload, all for the cause of make the guild more stable. If you want to take the burden upon yourself then that's fine, but if you're part of a community to fine to acknowledge that you may not need to and that other people may be willing to help out.
---
Don't let him drag you downnnnn!
---
So just because content can be cleared with ret pallies that justifies them being carried by classes that contribute a lot more to the group? It honestly sounds like Ret pallies are the selfish toxic assholes.
---
Cool thanks! That was it!
---
Very nice, and honorable of you. My situation is a little different. I‚Äôm a alliance Druid, it‚Äôs nearly impossible to farm gold. As a mage he can easily farm and just buy the ring within like 12 hours of farming ZF. Druids are screwed when it comes to farming

Is there any way to use 2 monitors in Classic Wow where my character is centered on one screen and my map, chat box, inventory and other menus can be on my side monitor?

Ty for your response, not Quartz though.  Didnt have that.  just installed it and now I have 3 haha.  Damn I wonder what I did to get this lol

Yes real men drink 97% isopropyl

I dropped tailoring with pretty much every pattern available, and picked up mining.
---
I did solo dm:e jump runs and made roughly 3k gold in 2.5 weeks per TSM doing it.
---
Couldn't be happier about my decision, tailoring sucks.
---
Not true. For example, Now as a horde player that is pushing for rank 14, I can farm gold in the downtime between BG ques. I couldn't do that before due to the need to maximize honor/hour
---
Yes and no.
---
It's much more selective, both in terms of roles and players, than a regular pug. For instance, you know you'll have X number of tanks and healers, and you know you'll have everyone with a 100% mount (at least from your group, since it's almost impossible to take all 40 slots - but you can get most of them).
---
All of that makes a huge difference, in having a bunch of well geared progression minded level 60s who know the strats, will follow directions, and work together - and who also won't bail at the first minor setback.
---
This, Found an alliance discord for premade AV's with a few hundred people active on it all day every day. Going pretty smooth stomping pugs all day today so far
---
Hit chance, glancing blows, etc are calculated based on level difference. Your level matters a lot more than the +5stats you see on the surface..
---
Given how many players wiped to my mechanic, I'm going to say that checks out. :)
---
Just test it. Have you tried logging out on your warrior inside the dungeon? After that, kill the boss with your lock, log out and log in on the warrior and try looting with your warrior. Or loot boss first with your lock and log in with your warrior to see if you can roll on it. Gotta be in range when you log out to be safe.
---
Another thing you can try is dotting up the boss with a tiny bit of health left, alt+f4, log in to your warrior and have the boss die with your warrior logged in. Only issue is it might give an error like ‚Äúaccount already in use‚Äù which I think means it takes 20 seconds for your character to disconnect before you can log in to a different one if you alt+f4.
---
Yep. Super frustrating when some greedy player rolls need just to sell it.

List your add ons please

I used to not eat for long periods of time in college so now I don‚Äôt get my period anymore.

---
Unless you somehow get your hands on a toep, in which case you spec destro and occasionally erase one dude before getting crushed.
---
If druid wants to wear it, they roll need. If druid wants to sell it, they roll greed. Everyone in the group follows the same logic. If you want to wear it, roll need. If you want to sell it, roll greed. Rolling need is for wearing. Rolling greed is for selling. If an item drops that you want to equip, you roll need. If it's a decent value on the AH or at a vendor, you roll greed.
---
How many times would you like me to reword this before you fucking understand?
---
Ah my mistake, still though you'd be passing up on 15 minutes of passive honour &amp; reputation gains, and the potential to grind out 15 minutes of kills, the game may end in that time and even if it doesn't, you may end up in a similar game immediately after the deserter wares off, so surely it makes more sense to stay in the battleground. Worst comes to worst the games lasts around 45 minutes and you've spent 20 minutes extra for 1.5 tokens (assuming 50% win rate) and a bunch of honour and reputation.
---
So many interesting  graphs to illustrate flipping a coin...
---
Get as much +healing as possible. I've never actually seen someone in full pre-bis gear, and I've been farming rag for months. Show you understand how to gear your character, and you'll be fine.
---
Yes, weapon speed is huge, and when you have aimed shot with a ranged weapon slower than 3 sec you can weave in aimed shot without clipping auto shots.  It doesnt sound that big, but it is.
---
If they die in five seconds, thats an issue on you not them.
---
Dude you are a healer. Where do you sew groups that want full prebis? I'd take you to raids the moment you reach level 60.
---
Yea, it was a bit annoying. Oh well.
---
BASED
---
man your insults are bad and your lies are really bad too. I can't believe that you made up that you made a bis list months before classic and that you actually tried to then use that to sound impressive. Really wild stuff.
---
Think about who actually spends their time on this subreddit / wow forums. Small minority that really like the game sure, but lots of people with nothing better to do but whine. Most people who enjoy the game are too busy actually playing it
---
What server? I'm thinking of re rolling to horde
---
Uh... No. They need damage mitigation. They're literally dead before I can cast lol
---
Ateish 80% ally as well
---
You are an officer, you should follow a strict of conduct, this is not optional.
---
You rolled, he won. You should have congratulated him and not be a whiner. You say you didn't ask him to trade you, then you shouldn't have accepted the item. 
---
I guess we learn by our mistakes, time to apologize. Such behaviour by officers is what makes drama break a guild.
---
Yes :) you already know
---
Guz Zug?
---
the history of wow also thought tier 0 was pre-raid BiS and rogues should have thunderfury
---
Here, take these circumstances:
---
Druid has 500g to his name
---
Rogue has 200g to his name
---
Druid plans on paying 300g for a warden staff after a dungeon
---
\--------------------------------
---
* Scenario A:
---
Warden staff doesn't drop
---
Druid pays 300g for a warden staff after dungeon
---
Druid has 200g
---
Rogue has 200g
---
* Scenario B:
---
Warden staff drops
---
Druid gets it uncontested because "he can use it"
---
Druid has 500g
---
* Scenario C:
---
Group decides to roll on it
---
Rogue wins and sells for 300g
---
Rogue has 500g
---
No matter how you look at it, giving an item to someone, even if they can use it, is giving them gold. need ***is*** greed for high-price BoEs.
---
**If Dal'Rend's Sacred Charge drops, the rogue gets much more value from it than a druid who can vendor it.**
---
**The benefit is asymmetrical between "Need" and "Greed"**
---
**With a BoE, the benefit is perfectly symmetrical and should therefor not be defaulted to who can use it.**
---
**This being said, with greens and who-gives-a-shit blues, its negligible, easier, and culturally-accepted to just greed/need on these BoEs, but for an item over 50g, it is a dick move.**
---
From alliance PoV, fuck that spot. From what I've seen, alliance can't defend Vann even nearly as efficient as horde can defend Drek (no LoS break, marshals don't aggro as easily). Even though this is a weakness, defenders in Drek's room are extremely favored.
---
Skullflame is cool realm
---
You made a post to complain about people complaining ?
---
Nice.
---
It's fucking druid gear lmao
---
I didn‚Äôt was just explaining it to you, glad you thought it was impressive though, and sorry me calling you foolish cut so deep. Also still waiting on any proof, and still will never get any because you are a wrong and cannot accept it. So sad seeing people like you...
---
None really. As soon you get 60 you are qualified.
---
What does choosing tank have anything to do to be obligated to run a dungeon for you, that we don‚Äôt even need?
---
Plenty other things for us to be doing for ourselves, our friends and guildies. 
---
When we carry pugs that are in need of a tank I expect something in return.
---
This is pure horseshit. It's his first raid, he gets showered in loot, and is only willing to share when he feel "pressured".
---
No, fuck that. He traded it back because he felt guilty that he was breaking the agreement he made up front. And now he's whining over it. Loot whore much? Drama will follow this person.
---
Do you just pug only if you never saw people in fullprebis gear?
---
In 21/0/30 do you prefer divine intellect over divine strength?
---
I did the same thing when I was 51 against a level 60 warrior, frost mages can't lose against warriors if they're not equipped to counter you (free action potion, engineering, ect). Their best chance is one shotting you for the 1 second they're in range, outside of that it's kite city. Though an unlucky resist (especially on frost nova) could land you in the deep end.
---
Mage player, but here is how a mage does it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1qejZ3B_GBQ
---
not sure the difference for priest. Probably something with mind soothe
---
we are not comparing an axe
---
we are comparing a sword to a mace
---
axes are irrelevant
---
read thread title "Mirah's Song or Stormstrike Hammer?"
---
read thread content "Fury Warrior - I got Deathbringer in my main hand and wondering what would be better in the offhand? Mirah's Song or Stormstrike Hammer?"
---
MIRAH'S SONG OR STORMSTRIKE HAMMER
---
Does it really depend on the race? The race that get sword skill also get mace skill.
---
Barbarous is far better.
---
Everyone on your server is in the same boat dude... the difference is some people will find those extra honor kills to push rank and some people won‚Äôt... get good and figure out the best spots at farming solo kills on your server. ... it‚Äôs not my job to do your pvp research pleb.
---
Woho man, that has nothing to do with the Blood Plague, it's literally just bringing an elite mob to a city. It's not like it's killing everybody around unsuspectingly. It's pretty inoffensive if you do not attack it first (safe for the bigger green dragons and their AoE, but those were leashed since launch anyway).
---
Later Tom, RIP
---
I remember those, one minute you're hitting a guy in the back, next minute your still hitting them in the back because the server still hasn't updated what's happened
---
13 minutes to solo a Jump Run as a Warlock.
---
2 veins per run.
---
That's a weird topic. Personally I would love a steroid Olympics. Imagine everybody there being a superhuman.
---
We discourage steroid use because it has harmful effects on the individual. What harmful effects does group queue swapping have?
---
The ‚Äúthat bug‚Äù I‚Äôm referring to was in regard to the bug plague glitch that the previous poster referenced. I used to love when hunters would kite bosses, elites, and shit to capital cities
---
Just goes to show you how broken this match up is. Even with 9 levels a warrior doesn‚Äôt stand a chance. If those 2 novas weren‚Äôt resisted this wouldn‚Äôt even have been close
---
I'll be fair with you and preface this before I respond; I burnt through the grind ASAP because I knew that that it would devolve into a shitshow in less than a week, I'm also a PvE player.
---
I really don't care about honour and rep gains appeared to go to shit past a certain point. I may be wrong but I didn't see any significant rep gains past a certain point in a game. 
---
I don't know what it's like in your battlegroup but the monkeys start flinging their shit at around the 10 minute mark and it makes the idea of doing battlegrounds wholly unappealing. 
---
I'd rather chance it and just bounce if it's a shitty group and go do other stuff instead.
---
The honor system isn't the problem. This version of AV is. It invalidates all other forms of honor grind because it's leagues better.
---
Warrior is slower to level but so much more fun to play at 60. You can get into whatever group you want as a tank. You can even reserve items, mats and charge people for tanking service. When you get some gear you‚Äôll be doing great in PVP and PVE.
---
Fairbanks
---
No spell has a cast longer than 5seconds, they get plenty of mitigation from heavy armor and the prot tree. A shield isnt as useful as threat. Its 100% the healers fault of a tank dies in 5seconds.
---

---
They can mediate some of this with double honor weekends / AB release. Atleast then depending on que times you need to play wsg / AB premades on the weekend if you wanna make bracket 13/14.
---
Not to discount the fact that alot of people make lame excuses such as this but I know I have, on occasion, put off a real life issue for a few more minutes to try to get something done, wipe, and say fuck it
---
Definitely not an easy choice either way and you have to out a lot of faith in other people to make it worth it. I feel incredibly lucky to be in the guild I'm in after hearing some of the horror stories of others
---
The issue with ret will always be taking loot from the class that needs it most and giving it to the class that needs it least.
---
If you want a raid dunce that everyone can feel great about outperforming sure, more power to you, but when you start looting them onslaught girdles and quickstrike rings thats when your warriors go for a walk
---
Not even half the damage tbh lol.
---
I like classic. I just want pve content that‚Äôs actually worth doing
---
The literal top ranked ret pally only pulls ~450 dps the number 2 is ~400. That is likely with PIs and Innervates, full world buffs and potions/flasks. The top 100 pull less than 300. So maybe I was exaggerating a tiny bit but the average ret pally will not be pulling 400-600 dps lol that is a gross overestimation.
---
Makes about as much sense as these lines
---
Not anymore, I left my ex in march.
---
you're free to blindly follow your rhyme-derived morality system, but its empirically a dick move
---
My post was me celebrating finally hitting raid level and having friends and guildies together to successfully kill Ragnaros after me playing casually on and off for 13 years. Sorry if this is found to be boring or offensive.
---
I like to mine in Un‚ÄôGoro. I also have skinning and since the mafia is gone I can get the occasional devilsaur leather as well.
---
I must say..... that stuff tastes HORRIBLE!!!!!
---
Definitely do NOT vendor Deathbringer. Use Deathbringer with Mirah's Song but edgemasters handguards are necessary tho.
---
The only 'no difference' here is talking to you and a door. Except perhaps the door might be more intelligent.
---
"Rodents Of Unusual Size ? I don't think they exist"
---
I don't understand why people say that the Habs suck..... they've won the most Stanley Cups in history.....
---
Oh my god. I‚Äôve never wanted to play a shaman till now.
---
Deep prot for flexibility, ease of play, low gear, newer players.  
---
Fury prot for maximum threat in cutting edge guilds with insane dps.
---
Rule of thumb: If you have questions about fury prot you're usually better off not using it and any issues you might have with your threat should be fixed by optimising rotation and gear.
---
It tastes horrible
---
&gt;  wish hitting need bound the damn item to you
---
that would be soooo good.
---
Who said anything about making a new character? Just do jump runs and you'll make significantly more (or sell your tanking services in return for the unwanted blues/greens that drop)
---
The **L**eetest BRS
---
gO tO reTAiL
---
Imagine trying to be smug but not knowing how the honor system works and that its percentage based LUL
---
Is this EU or NA?
---
If you guys didn‚Äôt lose the war all servers would be German, think bout that
---
They should've just put in 3 day AV, people would've still used it as the main honor farm but just via HKs instead. It'd be more active use than afking.
---
That‚Äôs what the average idiot on here says anytime you criticize anything with classic... hell I casually mentioned I hate pvp and would never step foot in a bg... I rolled on a pve server and everything and somehow that‚Äôs sacrilege I don‚Äôt get it haha
---
Share with me your secrets wizard.
---
This is just an assertion, and I don't really buy it. My sense is that casters and hunters are going to catch up to the melee, and some of the inflated numbers from non-'meme' specs are going to normalise. 
---
I also went looking thru the logs. Still seeing upper 300s on 3 min Rags.
---
That comment just spoke volumes. It's clear you are incapable of empathizing with other players.your entire position can be summed up as a selfish person with selfish desires that sees greed as need in order to justify being selfish. You are exactly the person I never want to meet in game &gt;&lt;
---
What are you even on about? 
---
"I like classic, BUT I want pve content worth doing".
---
We are not even into the next year, do you realize that more pve content gets added??????
---
What are you actually having a gripe about when you say world bosses were a waste of coding? Do you think the way they work is dumb, or do you not like that you never get the tag? Im just not following.
---
It's called LortiUI
---
You can dps for Rag, you just need to stay 20 yards from the other melee and tanks.
---
Those you play with are real people mate... I for one treat them as such and I don‚Äôt play with people who pull the ‚Äúit‚Äôs a game it‚Äôs fine to be a shit person to everyone‚Äù. Hell I also don‚Äôt associate with people like that in real life... you can really see someone‚Äôs true colours by how they treat others when they can‚Äôt suffer any real world consequences. It‚Äôs exactly how they‚Äôll treat you if given the opportunity.
---
Maybe that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm always in guilds with really solid awesome people who always help each other out while others deal with ninja looting, drama, and other endless problems. Since paid transfers came in I‚Äôve already seen 3 raiding guilds disbanded after their GMs took the bank and fucked off to a new server with thousands of gold.
---
But you do you, my way has worked great for the last 25 years or so that I‚Äôve been playing online games so what would I know.
---
Nah, ZG trinket is better than that. NAC is the worst of the burst trinkets. 20% damage is roughly equal to 200 spell power, and the mana toll and 5 minute cooldown suck ass. 2 vs 5 mins is a huge deal, even if you lose a bit of spell power with each cast. It's still 250% more uptime.
---
World bosses, on my server atleast, are farmed by one guild who just macro spamming bots and nobody else can even do them.  So they are a waste of coding and not actual pve content.
---
I have really doubt about Onyxia shard.  
---
How long average boss fight last - 2 minutes? 
---
16 mp5 will net you 384 mana during this time. That's one Rejuvenation. Less if you kill bosses faster.  
---
mp5 is a good additional stat, but IMHO it's not worth chasing.  
---
So hammer and band are solid choices.
---
The pve in classic has always been lame. Literally the only reason to play classic is to get fat loot to roll on nerds in PvP. If you don‚Äôt want to PvP then don‚Äôt play. Retail is right there for you.
---
And yes I know they‚Äôre adding stuff later that doesn‚Äôt help the fact half the people log on for raid and nothing else as it is now
---
That only works for gear that drops in a chest like DM Tribute or the Chest of the Seven/Dark Coffer in BRD, I believe.
---
You cant follow the rules so your entire guild should be blacklisted?  Lol and to think how nuch this sub bitched about horde being mean
---
We‚Äôve had horde try to kill us at galv every game and it‚Äôs just free honor. Please keep doing it
---
Somone should report that person, odds are they are botting if they got that much honor without a single kill, as opposed to afking and moving once in a while. I played the entire day yesterday and ended up with just about that much.
---
They don‚Äôt need to be good since they get near instant Queues
---
Lol... what
---
Or maybe I‚Äôll play exactly what I want when I want and never pvp in any version of the game because I don‚Äôt like it?  How ab that?
---
???
---
Ya but simple economics shows that the BoE is of equal worth to both of you regardless of whether you use it or sell it.
---
GFPP recipe drops and I‚Äôm an alchemist. Easy need right? Well what is the recipe worth to me? If less than market value then I really have no right using it instead of selling it (literally destroying utility by doing so) if more than market value, then why haven‚Äôt I bought it already? Not enough gold? Well then what I gain by winning the recipe is the same that another who sees just gold from it gains which is its value.
---
BoEs are fungible assets and prioritizing them to one or another person because they would use rather than sell them is nonsensical because selling it IS using it
---
Thought you were treestick, my bad I have no idea how selfish you are. I can however tell you don't respect other people's play styles if your answer to someone doing something different to you is essentially for them to go elsewhere.
---
Play both, ez
---
It can be hard to always do that. Never really expect the chain to drop when farming HoJ. Then you can‚Äôt take rogues, ferals, hunters, Paladins, or other warriors if you need both. That‚Äôs a little crazy.
---
The decision was made before you guys rolled. It's your ring.
---
&gt; get good and figure out the best spots at farming solo kills on your server. ... it‚Äôs not my job to do your pvp research pleb.
---
im rank 10, buddy. im talking out of experience not out of my ass like you are.
---
gotta have failed basic math if you think 1 kill per queue is difference between ranking or not. go drink paint
---
Im sure theyll let the guild back in after they shown proof they kicked the offender
---
5g and the blues? That's a rip-off
---
Looooooooooooooooool
---
&gt;  P2 was cancer for alliance but now it's good again!
---
For everyone. The Alliance farmed the lone/leveling Hordies too. They weren't innocents.
---
220 ap for ret when crusader procs.  I am so rarely disarmed outside of duels it is a complete and utter waste of an enchant as ret.  In group PvP the Ret isn't going to be disarm prio, that would be a rogue or warr.  Yes crusader is net better than chain over the course of your career in BGs as a ret paladin.  30% of our damage isnt even related to our weapons anyway.  Weapon chain is not worth it as a ret.  But what do I know, I'm just a fucking ret paladin.
---
Same
---
I personally use chrome remote desktop, no specific reason it was just the first one I got and it worked for what I needed. I imagine they're both at least similar, both will work for what you want.
---
Its not meant to be pve content for your average guild..
---
Shit I totally didnt read the header. Sounds good
---
Benediction
---
I'd say priest.  Shadow while leveling up is very strong, especially once you get to 40+.  Most other classes fall off a bit in the 40-50 range, while priest actually gets stronger.  Spriests are one of the DPS classes in PVP and Disc priests are the top healing class in PVP.  Priests are always in demand for level 60 raids/dungeons because they are the best healer.  Shadow would be a bit more difficult to raid or dungeon as.
---
Hunters are also quite strong solo and for leveling, but (and correct me if I'm wrong here hunters) fairly weapon dependent for PVP at 60.  It's also harder to get into groups/raids as a DPS versus a healer.  Specifically Hunters arent nearly as sought after for raids either because they are very dependent on their actual skills to deal DPS and they dont get new ranks until AQ.  Other classes like mages have their abilities get significantly stronger with +damage gear.
---
You know... that reply is entirely what I expected from you. Good job, now carry on being terrible.
---
There‚Äôs nothing wrong with asking people for help. Just ignore these threads if it bothers you.
---
So basically what's going to happen, is that all tanks will eventually start doing this. Then, an already hard spot to fill FOR FREE will cost a ridiculous amount for new players. New players will quit, and then you'll have a dead game. You guys have SO MANY options to make gold. If you dont need the dungeon, dont run it. You are going to create a huge problem.
---
He was epic‚Äôd out... chest was his only blue slot. He could have waited till the next fucking lockout
---
This exactly. It's an easy 15-20  min run back. That's an additional 15-20 mins I don't wanna procrastinate. So I just spirit rez and log.
---
Yep it would solve *so many issues*. Need if you need and greed if you want to sell it. 100% the design behind the system and is just straight up fair.
---
Depends heavily on the fight. I just checked Warcraft Logs and Esfand is indeed breaking 600 on some fights but hovering around 450 in others.
---
My guild has two Rets (one Sulfuras, one OEB - which is me) and we are between 350-600 on most fights. I think technically the best I've seen on Golemagg was 597 DPS from our Sulfuras Pally (I was at like 430 on the same fight).
---
So what's the problem? Did some words break your safe space? Did your NPC script activate upon hearing the n-word?
---
Dude what is wrong with this guys roommate? Is he fighting demons?
---
If you use a Fist weapon, can you still be disarmed?
---
Yea, hold it hostage for loot on your first MC run imo. You owe nothing to these dudes.
---
I found my guild through LookingForGroup as well, but most of the time you can venture out to major cities and some just look for people not in a guild and will whisper you, or you whisper them.
---
Do you take the blues as well? That's kind of pricey considering it could take 300+ runs to get SGC.
---
Hey man is that Healbot you're using? If so how did you skin it like that?
---
Which is low, and also everyone has.  The racial has only a 25% chance of causing you to resist a stun.
---
Casters spells will be resisted significantly more, I have raided Mc from 57-60, and while I did get a little more spell hit (1%) the spell resists went down by a large amount
---
They have always pulled together
---
Speaking as an Alliance player, I can promise you that if you‚Äôre up against an Alliance pug it goes down like this in our chat no matter what the Horde are doing:
---
‚ÄúEveryone get south!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNot enough people are south‚Äù
---
‚ÄúBut they wiped us at Galv.‚Äù
---
‚ÄúNot enough went south, gg‚Äù
---
At this point a few will try to cap IBT and TP while half the raid waits at RH for the Horde to cap bunkers and kill Van. 
---
‚ÄúGhost run to FWGY!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúStop pulling around Drek!‚Äù
---
‚ÄúEveryone not at RH lost this game for us!‚Äù
---
 Then the game ends with the Horde having killed Van.
---
Not to mention how it affects glancing blows
---
How does cdew play both his main and alt at the same?
---
You're just hurling sentimental bullcrap at me instead of actual points. As I said in my earlier reply, you're the selfish one for assuming total strangers to give you 300g instead of rolling for it fair and square, with the winner getting an upgrade, no matter if they can use the actual item that dropped.
---
Assuming others are incapable of empathy when they don't look at every dungeon run like a DnD game is, I'm sorry, ridiculous.
---
Thanks dude
---
Lol twitch.tv/theunclejoeshow is my roommate. Go to the channel and all will make sense üòâ
---
&gt; The aforementioned elemental mastery bug letting two spells benefit so long as the second spell lands less than .4 seconds after the first one (since it gives 100% crit chance while active but the artificial delay means you actually get .4 seconds of 100% crit chance before it's removed instead of the intended effect of just one spell.)
---
You're ignoring the anecdotal evidence I gave to the contrary, were you a Blizzard programmer back in '02 or something that gives you all this knowledge? Or are you just going off of the same non-dev assumptions that led to the various different private server interpretations that have popped up throughout the past 15 years?
---
Zug zug
---
I love tanking but hate when groups treat me like the leader because of it. Just let me pull and we're cool.
---
I believe Faerlina horde has seen an influx of new players. No clue about how the alliance are faring
---
Separate accounts
---
afking / botting AV is more of a problem :-) at least they still have to play and win the WSG
---
\*be none of 'em, kek
---
It‚Äôs not a hard fight it‚Äôs just easily cheeseable by guilds using bots.... therefore it‚Äôs a waste of coding.
---
Thats why the GM saying all need turns the rest he said later into total BS
---
Hey, i've been trying to import it into the !details addon but kept getting an error. Still unsure how to import it into classicthreatmeter since that has no import function. if you could explain how to import it into the classicthreatmeter that'd be great!
---
Elemental invasions.. also players mostly have their enchants now. Wait for next raid tier for new demand.
---
Or don‚Äôt encourage clutter of the forums with easily searchable questions.
---
I roll for the blues. It may be pricey but there's clearly a market for it
---
Myself and I imagine more than half of the active population aren‚Äôt exalted yet. Your dismissive/elitist attitude comes across as rationalization more than actual impressiveness.
---
Yes it kinda does. Alliance have to choose between guarding Relief Hut flag or be involved in anything going on around Drek building.
---
Horde can guard Aid Station flag WHILE fighting against Marshals.
---
Unless we don't deff Galv, right? then you win.
---
I think you and people like you have a different idea of what the word fun means
---
Mandokir ES has remained the same practically.
---
Except the person throwing the snowball also might as well be afk for all the good they're doing in the BG.
---
thanks man, I'm flattered

M'goodboi has a healthy frame. Get him some tendies and dewey to keep himself in the best shape of his life.
---
&gt;painweaver is much better if you're already hit capped
---
Using the rogue spreadsheet with current full BiS and raid buffed(no world buffs), tarnished elven ring is 2 dps better than painweavers. Then, say you're going for max damage and getting ony buff and songflower and trib buffs, tarnished is over 10 dps better. That's huge for a ring slot. Painweaver is almost never better for rogues outside of PvP, only if you're desperate for 70 health. Quit this nonsense about hit cap, hit still scales very well even after the yellow cap. Even if you want to derp about the importance of 7 stam "much better" is far from the term I'd use. More interchangeable depending on the content(raiding/dungeons tarnished, soloing with absolutely zero buffs painweaver).
---
*looks at flair*
---
...somethings fucky...
---
Every voice matter.... but dont share it with anyone!
---
psuedo-random is not random
---
random is random
---
Yeah we all rolled, they some of them said if I won I would‚Äôve just given it to the mage..
---
You try snag a soulfire, immolate, immediately conflagration and searing pain then shadowburn for ultra burst damage. This mostly works on a target that is seduced.
---
Otherwise if you need to stay light on your toes and move a bit you can shadowbolt into immolate, spam searing pain and kite with other dots, and then conflag/shadowburn when immolate nearly expires.
---
It changes because you can't move much but searing pain can have 15% extra crit chance talented so it's a great filler spell.

For me it's about 50/50. but I make an effort to try to convince people that rushing to Belinda is not *de way*.
---
respeccing holy
---
Gotcha, thank you!
---
Thing with hit cap is that you limit your crit cap by having less hit, and in a raid environment and with enough gear you're going to get tons of crit.
---
Haha as a rogue you can solo farm this area. I‚Äôve had at least 15 epic patterns (15% rate from the pyromancers) and 5 GFPP (3%) recipes
---
Could argue that priests/warriors can only do 2 roles while shaman/paladin can do 3 (melee dps/healer/tank or ranged dps) while druid can do all 4.
---
Yeah, but literally every class has pieces like that, is the point I'm making.
---
Holy shit your guild does a lot of dmg
---
Nice!!
---
I heard their latest expansion was pretty great so I wouldn't be surprised if they had an advantage for a while before Classic came out.
---
Mats+250g is what it was on a mega server until more than one person had it.
---
There hasn‚Äôt been a single horde spotted in the world since paid transfers either, but that has nothing to do with paid transfers.
---
It‚Äôs cuz everyone is afk in AV.
---
Sidegrade for one of the best specs in the game&gt;upgrade for a dead weight spec.
---
And you can get better gear from MC and have rest prebis.
---
Actually going first is an advantage. Especially when rolling starts at 100
---
eCasting bar is similar.
---
It took you 12 hours to do ~24 jump runs?  You‚Äôre doing it wrong
---
We have a 58 priest that didn‚Äôt have all pre bis amd is now geared before they hit 60.
---
I mean he has gotten every single loot that would be good for ret paladins, which isn't much in MC. That's more than almost any other ret, let alone that they have a ret in their raid at all.
---
"I can respect your right to your opinion without agreeing with it in the slightest."
---
"I can tolerate people who have stupid trains of though(t)"
---
I think respect is a strong word.
---
I'd argue that anyone who wants to play the game differently to minmaxers shouldn't be relegated to an rp server. 
---
Like I said, narrative is important to a lot of people that don't want to turn wow into an excel simulator. If rogue items drop on a run and a rogue is in the party then let the rogue wear them. 
---
Don't make everyone run dungeons so they can stack gold and then go to the ah to buy their items.
---
The monotony of that is soul crushing. 
---
If everyone is fine with it then go ahead. If a the majority is fine with it then go ahead. But certainly don't expect it to be an unspoken normalised institution.
---
SFRs will never understand this simple concept
---
Except a raid geared tank has no reason to run dungeons without pay. If they stopped charging they simply wouldn't run dungeons and the supply would diminish even further.
---
it also not meant to be farmed by BOT's.
---
i think most people in this thread are not debating in good faith. i think your generally idea is true and evident, i don't think world boss is a "waste of coding" and i don't think thats your general idea either. world boss's are a awesome but how the player base has changed to min/max everything has changed how world boss's  work. i think your general idea is it would be nice to blizzard try and have things be the same way they were originally intended to be, thats a big ask and will never happen. i agree i wish the player base respected the idea of the game more and that blizzard would work to achieve that (by deleting bot's).
---
How much are they now?
---
It slows down the queue for those who arent abusing an exploit.  It's like someone cutting in line at a roller coaster, getting off and then cutting in line again, rinse and repeat
---
And it‚Äôs a pve server so it‚Äôs not a pvp encounter as there‚Äôs nothing you can do to stop... a waste of coding
---
Dunno. Maybe.
---

I usually just say "sorry, looks like this isn't happening with this group" if it's the 3rd or 4th wipe. Or I tell the group exactly why I'm leaving because usually it's them not listening to things like "LOS pull please." or "don't attack the mob until it gets to the tank on an LOS pull".
---
Mage, hands down. Gives our free goodies, has heaps of utility in fights, competes with less classes for gear, and even takes you home and tucks you in to bed afterwards.
---
Yup! I was the priest.
---
Why? I don't think so. I'd have to check, but the comment above makes more sense to me. PlayerA (following steps above) is on average rolling once more than PlayerB, thus increasing the odds of getting a 1 and losing. Not sure exactly what the win ratio would be though.
---
Earthfury is the only correct answer.
---
Try VPN
---
What's the most populated Alliance PvE EU server atm? Wondering if I should make a druid and I don't want a semi-dead realm where finding groups for early game dungeons/quests is a struggle.
---
people pay him to do this with their alts in the group.
---
When I tanked in Vanilla I would get like 10 group invites every time I logged on.
---
I use this kind of macro too, mine just goes:
---
#showtooltip Regrowth
---
/cancelform
---
/cast Regrowth
---
It seems to work fine for me.

---
What a lump of coal.
---
Because the chances of losing the first roll are so low they dont matter. Ok 1/100 times ill lose first.... on average 1/50 times the 2nd roller will lose first.
---
I understand your logic though. Not sure... but over the course of about 50 10g death rolls im up 150g
---
He‚Äôs the GM and everyone knows joining that he‚Äôs Ret. It‚Äôs really not a good spec but Esfand and most of his guildies are pserver players who have all done this several times with him playing Ret so I don‚Äôt think anyone in that guild is worried about it.
---
Mage competes with less classes for gear?...
---
As a shaman I begin to salivate, if I see a lone alliance warrior that isn't more than 3 levels above me.  Basically a guaranteed win.
---
Dont work as mouseover , what OP was asking for...
---
In the end its better to agree to loot rules before hand to prevent arguments
---
I did this to get twink gear and should apply here if u can solo the boss. 
---
Basically you have two chars, a killer n a looter. U get them both into a group and into an instance using a Guildie for invites. Make sure u are dcing to swap chars and not logging off. You do this by having two clients open with same account info and swap logging. 
---
When ur both inside the dungeon make the kill character master looter. U then clear to the boss u need on killer. U then dc killer with looter and run him close to boss to be in combat for fight. DC  the looter with the killer. Kill boss with killer. Master loot the drop u need to the dc'd looter. hop on looter and loot boss or run both chars out And reset dungeon on killer. Repeat 5x n hour. This works because a dc player is on the loot table for 2 mins after a kill. 
---
Got legs of the fang on my alliance hunter after 25 runs with zero xp gained. Good luck 
---
Tip : You must run both dc chars out before resetting or the dc one will be hearthed.
---
Fun fact: you can see ur dc character for 10 secs or so you can buff or heal them like a reg player.
---
Two downvotes and a derogatory comment. How about instead, ‚Äúwhat I would recommend is...‚Äù and then post any improvements that you might suggest.
---
Otherwise you‚Äôre not doing anyone any favors, myself or the OP.
---
I rolled Horde because I liked the aesthetic more. I had no idea this imbalance was going to take place. There was no way any of us could have anticipated it being this bad. You're being unreasonable and smarmy.
---
-Michael Gretzky
---
damn, the answer would have been hunter but you already it. Can buy good blues from AH for very cheap, doesn't require mega gear, buy DMN items double ring and chest, dmw helm, buy weapons. You can have "near prebis" so easily.
---
I had this thought the other day, I don't think it is :(
---
He can't be an orc because orcs can't even buy Stormstrike Hammer.
---
Yep. People ask for tanking runs all the time for specific gear. I asked to be compensated 7g because my raid let me die to trash 5 times in MC. Nobody helped me with repair cost. Welp. Guess I will be out grinding for mats instead of tanking for peoples gear
---
Just ran 100k one vs. one games and the win ratio for the player that goes first is basically [50% in the long run.](https://imgur.com/yUEFnxj) Somebody do the actual math (I'm more of a programmer than pure mathematician myself)
---
My server tanks charge 30g a run any run 52 plus. If its live they take 1st orb and if its multiple runs for a specific item I've seen them do 10g n all non needed greens n blues.
---
&gt;I think respect is a strong word.
---
I respect anyone's right to say whatever you wanna say, but I don't have to respect what they say. Not a hard concept to grasp.
---
But you're right, I'd either adhere to group rules or find another group. Regardless of what you think of me, I'd never ninja an item against the wishes of the majority or break any loot rules, even if I thought they were unfair or whatever the case.
---
&gt;The monotony of that is soul crushing.
---
Big reason why I don't play Classic WoW anymore, endgame is boring as shit in an MMO (and it seems you share my thoughts on this since you said this) and it will never be anything more unless you pretend, which you seem to prefer doing. And pretending the numbers aren't just numbers is roleplaying. I think it's not an insult to you or anyone else to say that out loud.
---
&gt;But certainly don't expect it to be an unspoken normalised institution.
---
Yet you say this, which is weird. How is expecting everyone to treat it as a video game that's been figured out for 15 years, rather than an RPG, on a normal server not the expected behavior? Assuming others want to roleplay on a non-roleplay server just seems to be asking for a bad time.
---
We are fundamentally at odds here and I don't think either of us can understand the motivations of the other. Why you would willingly set yourself up for disappointment on a standard realm (it's been obvious for a long time what sort of atmosphere Classic WoW would have with minmax vs. roleplay) is something I just can't wrap my head around.
---
Yeah cause warlocks r bad
---
Hey so is that!
---
Keep going, I always like to see how many responses I can accurately predict in a row.
---
I don‚Äôt know what spell batching is
---
I saw that it's pretty much 50/50. How does it feel when questing there as Alliance?
---
If you want a PvE server with a good alliance community, decent split, and pretty great economy I have to advocate for Atiesh 
---
Reading all the server/guild drama lately has really made me appreciate how great my experience has been on PVE alliance 
---
I‚Äôll even give you free bags x)
---
You can cast 2 spells under a second due to the 500ms delay on skill/spell server detection or whatever it is. Someone can explain better i'm sure.
---
Sword better than mace with human racial?
---
Do you realize humans have a racial for swords AND maces?
---
nice try mr orc
---
If he is smart he will put a thorium spike and use the skullflame to farm with, that way hes getting some mileage from it
---
Divine Favor is absolutely *broken* when soloing.  Healing yourself to full for free every 2 minutes means you can *literally* chain pull without stopping to drink.  
---
Divine Favor can get good value in PvE and PvP as a healer or DPS.  
---
Holy shield only gets good value when tanking or aoe grinding.  Divine Favor will get you the most bang for your buck unless you want to focus mostly on tanking.  
---
If OP is going for versatility, Divine Favor is the better choice.
---
Wrong game my guy.
---
Boring.
---
Think a lot of the alliance already got exalted, only people I know doing AV are just doing it for the honor grind. It was insanely easy for alliance to get exalted the first week when most games were over in 10 minutes.
---
Raid starts at 830 I‚Äôll keep posted
---
no it‚Äôs not, it‚Äôs a 50% chance. Either it happens or it doesn‚Äôt.
---
One thing I've noticed is that the eyes don't agro people I bring in to sell my DM Trib loot to.
---
Then wait a few months for the harder raids.
---
Do you skin the hyenas?
---
Completely disagree, unless he is in a guild that is strictly rewarding loot based on meters/raid logs. And needs to shine on DPS.
---
Yeah I have the only one on the AH rn, and I‚Äôm over pricing it
---
In my own experience, things can also come up in the time leading up to a wipe. You can put these things off for a while but maybe a wipe makes the time commitment too much?
---
what are you using to change your model
---
These are not the only option horde as turned it around so that a few groups stay back and defend while everyone else moves north on the offense ... it‚Äôs not a turtle or a race it a little of both and it‚Äôs been working and it‚Äôs a lot of fun matches take long and yes you may not win but it‚Äôs nice to see people actually trying to play the game rather then concede from the start and go for min/max  I rather longer que times with fun games then quick que times just for fast honor
---
i win probably 80% of my AV's.  Maybe it's you that's the problem?
---
You sound like one of the ragers in chat that get butthurt anytime anything goes wrong.  After one mistake you give up (rerolling horde?) and rage on others. Everyone else is the idiot right?  That attitude is contagious and i hope you do reroll and spread it there.
---
Shoulda just said yes, I'm detecting a super weiner here.
---
Well, these are both virtually worthless. Sorry lol. As for the math ... roughly a 4%chance for 1 of the 3 pearls to drop. Then for another one to drop you've got like a 2.6% chance so I suppose its .04 x .026 someone correct me if I'm wrong pls
---
"blizzard sucks because we can't kite bosses to cities and grief players anymore" is my new favorite complaint about classic. i'm far from a blizzard fanboy but give it a break.
---
Tough luck green skin the raid loggers have already gone back to sleep
---
Yeah it's only &gt;1 million on alliance with instant AV queues.
---
What Hack is that to change your Race?
---
I'm not saying that Blizz is doing it because they hate us and wants to piss us off. Nor am I saying they are not fixing any bugs. I am simply pointing out that their bugfixes seems haphazard and that they seems to use their explanation of "this is how it works in the reference client" is being used for some things but not for others. 
---
It has nothing to do with hate. Blizzard doesn't give a shit about us. It's a business. They maximise profit and minimise costs. Putting a skeleton crew on this Classic thing to give it a semblance of there being support, while milking it as long as they can makes total sense from a business standpoint. Classic is not meant to last. Anyone who believes that it will last or even be further developed is just fooling themselves.
---
Until you look for a raiding guild and everyone already has their tanks and fury dps. Warrior is one of, if not the, most over represented classes in the game.
---
Oh....you're one of *those players*         
---
Edit: At this point I really want to hear the proper representation
---
Okay, I clearly made a mistake, but would it have been so difficult to mention that in the first place? This is that ‚Äútoxicity‚Äù people keep talking about. Don‚Äôt berate people who make mistakes.
---
I have a 60 warrior and love it! But, I would say level a rogue because you will be able to get a lot more gear right away (as dps). As a tank you can basically wear your whole class sets, but as a rogue you definitely can. Stealthing nodes in silithus will net you some gold too, rogue is a solid class, the only downside is group finding
---
p2 was just alliance whine but since AV this sub has been pretty much exclusively horde whining
---
I hope you recover soon
---
Thought it was gonna be golden pearls, disappointed.
---
Vuhdo
---
yes i saw a tripple with gold  on reddit :P
