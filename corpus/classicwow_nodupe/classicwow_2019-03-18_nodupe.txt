Is void walker REALLY that good for leveling? I thought felstalker was not bad. I get the taunt stuff but can't locks just fear stuff anyways?

1.12... 1.12... where have I heard about that specific patch?  Oh yeah, the one Classic WoW is using.
---
Undercity has always been a favorite, up until the latest expansion. The first time I came across it as a young lad I though, oh just a torn up version of stormwind... then you die to the elevator boss a few times only to find an amazingly designed underground undead hub with a giant worm puking up all the bile used for the river. Thought it was the coolest thing back then. 
---
I have heard that sound file at 2:09 in a couple of videos now. Where is it from, does anybody know? 
---
Thats why mulgore is so green. All that fertilizer. 
---
Cross-server is not content.
---
Cross-realm queue only available with premade?
---
"hey man, can you stop pulling before the tank?"

---
"fuck u"
---
...Is usually how this goes for me.
---
"It's vanilla unless it doesn't fit my opinion."
---
Alive said in tips video that demo is better for pure solo play, it comes out just ahead of a more aff heavy build. Affliction build is able to do a lot more in groups and with other players, also pvp. I think he said something along the lines of Demo for super tryharding and being ahead of the pack. But if youre stuck with the pack of players aff is probably better so you can handle yourself in pvp a bit better. Most of it comes down to player preference. Personally I played the affliction build for years, only recently did I try the demonology build and I much prefer it. 
---
Check out Amazon I see them on there.
---
They said:
---
&gt;"However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days."
---
I can't find the word "traffic" at all.  The sharding has to do with mob spawn times, not server load.
---
Is that with esfand and the other two losers? How anyone makes it through that is beyond me. 
---
It's part of the 1.12 patch, if they decide not to include it then what else should they choose not to include? It's part of vanilla for better or worse.
---
A lot of that math has to be based on rng, you would need perfect mob spacing and density as well as no competition. With skinning you’re at least getting a base average of silver per kill. It could very well be more optimal to skin but not very many people are going to be able to pull it off effectively. 
---
Asmon isn't on Classicast all too often, he's on Allcraft.
---
Classicast is usually Esfand, Tipsout, and Staysafe
---
But the servers cant handle shit in retail so why would it be different in classic?
---
I'm going to abuse it specifically so Blizzard will fix it. :) 
---
That in turn will also ruin social norms. 
---
Cross realm BG's never fixes anything though and just accelerates further imbalance in population. It "fixes" one type of pvp in a instance. 
---
There are much better options and it was probably because TBC was already in design and resilience and all of that where BG's really no longer mattered . Games have like a 2-3 year dev process. The new honor system and Arena and all that didn't magically appear. They were being worked on when we were in MC/BWL. 
---
They couldn't fix things with a faction queue (used by private servers) when it was already so broken.
---
They didn't want to merge and saw no reason to when TBC killed world pvp and they wanted to turn a MMO into a esport. One reason arena was so popular is it was all that mattered and that was probably intentional to push the esport.
---
A faction queue might work fine on pvp servers where population is usually close (don't be confused by private servers where the players tend to flock to certain known guilds factions to avoid them). 
---
There is no fix for PVE servers because Alliance is simply better for PVE. That isn't a problem you can really fix. Just leave them broken. If people want to pvp they can join a pvp server where you fight to get in instances and to get gear and over world bosses and for resources on and on.
---
Please explain.
---
When something makes massive changes to the game for the worse at the very end it's pretty fair to say. 
---
exactly the same as any other server
---
if you go to certain areas you will find people rping, that's literally it
---
I’m worried that I meet a bro in game through raiding, questing etc... but then won’t be able to see them again, even if we’re right next to each other. I can understand sharding starting zones but not major city’s. 
---
&gt;But if this really bothers people for social reasons I have an easy solution. Enemy team is cross-server, your team is not.
---
I think anyone that cares about the PvP community will say that the enemies matter just as much. The social aspect is not limited to allies. By the time I got to R13 back in vanilla I knew every frequent Alliance PvP'er. I knew their skill, their playstyle, the build they'd usually use.
---
There was this pair of the Alliance top guild MT who liked to queue together with a really skilled Paladin healer. Even when they queued alone, PuG chats would start panicking the moment their names.
---
I even got such good bonds with a number of them that, together with a R12 friend of mine, I believe we had access to 4 Alliance accounts, just from talking to them after a good match and getting along.
---
Personally, cross-realm BG's are just a non-feature to me. I have no interest in playing with nobodies that I'll never see again, be it on my own team or the enemies. As much as 1 hour queues suck, at least then BG's still exist to me.
---
Saying we should have cross realm BG's because it was in 1.12 is like saying naxx should be out because it was in 1.12. It makes no sense.
---
I think you're assuming the problem is a technology problem and not a game design problem.  The zone scaling problem they're talking about isn't strictly the number of people in the zone, it's the number of people who are trying to complete PvE questing content.  That content doesn't scale when packing large number of people in a zone.
---
All your examples doesn't matter, you can pack a large number of people in a zone and the content works just fine.
---
Ok let's add TBC talent trees, it was technically in vanilla 
---
They can't handle shit due to the Cloud-based technology they moved to. Each and every kind of "server" is now an actual "server"--the World Server only requires few resources to operate normally. Same probably goes for the Instance Server. They host them all in a chunk and allocate small resources to be efficient, so that as much resources as possible are still in use.
---
Of course these are all assumptions (other than the world server / instance server / login server etc, those are well known). However, many kinds of services have a very similar setup, and WoW's remarkably reduced peak performance capability has closely matched Blizzard's introduction of sharding and the discarding of server blades that are an "entire realm."
---

---
Does anyone remember a horde or alliance binder that came with the guide originally in some stores? 
---
It would be good because it would spice up pvp like it did back in patch 1.12 where people had been playing with the same players for 2 years. Some spice is nice, but it is not necessary on launch. 
---

---
I hope you realize, that a lot of reason of it being a single realm to pservers, is being there is only a single server...
---
I'm glad to see Ironforge is winning. 
---
I got dragged into WoW by my girlfriend in 2006 in junior year of high school. I talked with my friends a bit and decided that what I wanted was up-close and personal sword and shield action (more the fool I). So I picked up warrior (FOOL) which worked out okay because my girl was running a priest and we were both human because we were both basic bitches. She was about 30 levels above me so I was on my own for a good while. Elwynn was peaceful. Stormwind had me in awe with the game's orchestral score and the big statues... and then I found the tram.
---
Living dwarven cities seem to be something that is typically lacking from popular fantasy. Moria and Erabor being the two biggest ones and both being abandoned hell mines by all description. So when I stepped out into the Great Forge it was the first time I had ever seen one. Then I stepped outside. I *love* the snow. Then on to Loch Modan. 
---
The only thing that inspired anywhere near the awe that iron forge did was when I first stepped into Ashenvale. Darkshore was such a drab place but the transition into the ethereal purple forest was the second time I was filled with wonder.    
---
&gt; NO changes
---
Has Blizzard explicitly said "zero changes"? When they announced, it wad 1.12 as a starting point. I know Ythisen said that no changes is winning more than they think, but that still does not mean ZERO changes.
---
What us this BS post, when have I ever pushed for crossrealm BGs? We literally had an episode where we were talking about how it was implemented in 1.12, but we still don't like it. Staysafe brought up that it may eventually be a necessary evil in order to allow for some servers to be able to do battlegrounds, (play the game) and it's a fair point. It's something that is likely a necessity for Arenas in Burning Crusade. But we'll get to that when we get here. 
---
This entire post is bullshit, and OP is a liar
---
So why would you do that with loot trading but not master looter 
---
19 in 2006 when I started which makes me an old man in my 30s now :(
---
This. Crossrealm BGs addressed a serious problem.
---
I had a similar situation, though I was Alliance on a EU PvP server. We were so flipping happy when CRBGs came.
---
Because you feel helpless and desperate. For doing dungeons or raids you just can find a group with your friends. For BGs what you CAN'T INFLUENCE is the other faction. You can't do anything about it. So you can't play BGs at all (or very limited during prime time). OP, what's your advice on that? To reroll on another server?
---
Thanks Captain Obvious.

Roblox death sound
---
Wouldn’t be too opposed then tbh. But isn’t your concern much more applicable in a raid? Like tbh who cares that much if you get ninja’ed in a group, rather than if you spend x hours or so in a raid and all of that is just flushed down the drain. 
---
I can't imagine ever wanting to stay in a guild with a leader that shouted like that over the vent chat all the time, sounds like Dives was a complete nutter. But &lt;Wipe Club&gt; is such a cool guild name. 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
&gt; there was constant banter in vent of people talking and no one was concentrating. I got a bit pissy and told people to get serious wiping was not fun. Later in the week they QQ'd to the GM who didn't even raid about my attitude. Left shortly after as shit just wasn't fun I like raiding with people that can chit-chat but still do their job they signed up for. 
---
this sort of thing happened quite frequently, in the sense that, I think some people take the attitude "it's a game, just relax", while others are more in the "well, if I am spending time doing this then let's do it properly". A lot of it is about expectations. If a player is expecting it to be a serious raid then those who are more set on the 'just relax and have fun' idea are less likely to join in the first place. 
---
I joined a "serious" raiding guild because I wanted people to take it seriously. There was always a waiting list to get in to our raids and the raid leadership and guild leadership made it clear that was the expectation: if you were one of the 40 in the instance, that was a privilege and you had to treat that with respect. That isn't to say that we didn't have fun: we absolutely did. But everyone who joined the raid understood that we wanted them to be focused on following instructions as best they can to get gear. Everyone understood this was what they were signing up for in joining our guild or our raid so I only recall a handful of times where there were any issues at all (mainly around people not being able to get in and complaining about people who were able to jump in ahead of them, usually due to raid/class balance and makeup).

[Clip of classicast response to this post](https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyProtectiveAirGuitarAMPEnergy)
---
lol. No, they were not. 2.0.1 is called the TBC prepatch--it was literally TBC with Outland turned off. You were even able to see Outland on the World Map.
---
The same goes for 3.0.1, 4.0.1, etc. They are the expansion launch patch--already all balance changes, art, instances, maps, everything is already there. It's just turned off--it gets turned on 2.0.3, 3.0.3, 4.0.3 etc.
---
AMAZIN

Another person that takes things out of context while trying to farm upvotes. Go back and watch a Classic cast pod-cast then make an opinion about it don't just pleb it up. 
---
TY FOR BEING 5iq &lt;3
---
Wouldn’t you rather have a personal tank than having to cast fear and risking pulling another entire mob when he runs off?
---
Thats it, thank you!
---
19 in 2014. It was a simpler time. I don't believe I'll be able to 60 this time around :/
---
Honestly, I recommend herb-skin for the money, at least while leveling and maybe even at endgame.
---
If you end up wanting something more productive, you can drop one to become herb-alch or skin-lw - but honestly neither of those are exceptional and you may be better off just keeping the money-makers.
---
Seems like you dont watch their stuff since what you say is so wrong and twisted
---
Same, brother. Kaching! Who needs bank slots when the AH can hold it all anyway?
---
Vanilla lasted from November 23, 2004 to January 15, 2007. That is about 26 months. 
---
1.12 and Cross-Realm Battlegrounds went live on August 22, 2006. That is roughly 5 months prior to The Burning Crusade. That is less than 20% of Vanilla.
---
1.12 is vanilla. 
---
2.0.1 isn’t vanilla. 
---
Stop making false analogies.

If sharding is needed so new players can complete their starter quests without 1000 people clicking on Cactus Apples, then it's fine.
---
If sharding is needed because Blizzard's server infrastructure hasn't been asked to do this type of load in 10 years, and Blizzard has given up on making it work, then we are fucked. AQ Gate event will be sharded. 
---
To add on to this, I played in a guild on a private server with a mage. He had his epic mount like 2 days after hitting 60, and basically every epic that found its way to trade chat or AH he'd buy it. He was fucking loaded. I was asking in guild about something, and he said he had it, I don't remember what it was, materials or maybe a blue, but nothing too expensive. I'd been saving up gold for a tank item, probably stonegrip gauntlets. He refused to take my gold for it even though he was notoriously stingey and the previous week, I'd booted him from the guild for saying something really offensive. He told me, "You're a tank, you can't really farm. I can farm like crazy and have tons of gold. We all bring different strengths to this guild, so I'm going to give you this for free, because that's what I provide." I had always been pro-dual spec because as a Tank Warrior I wanted a viable way to make back the cost of my consumables, repairs, ect. 
---
That was the moment that I realized that only having 1 spec at a time with a high respec cost really does make the community stronger. You have to use your time and reputation to get things, and you can't always just go out and solo it yourself. 
---
The presumption in this scenario is that the guild is giving gear to their ret paladin that could be used on other characters. So yea, I'll concede that in a position where guilds are giving ret pallies BIS gear, they sit at about 40-50% rogue/warrior dps.
---
I've seen a pre bis warrior with all consumables and buffs pull on average 600-700 dps. But they were also a good at playing warrior. But yes your dps as a ret is beyond garbage. Warlocks pull more dps and they have to physically stop casting because they make to much threat.
---
Calling me captain obvious, while defending OP, who can't grasp obvious things.  Face it, a lot of people here are complete fucking morons, including yourself.  
---
Naxx is not vanilla either then.
---
Fuck the copy. Why is everybody so obsessed with the copy? This allows for gold hacks. 
---
Blizzard has a system of character transfers already in place. Pay the $25, transfer a character. If you don’t want to pay $25, reroll. 
---
AT MOST, everybody gets one free character transfer. 
---
Character copy is not the way. 
---
Thanks 
---
He doesn't. Judging by this post he hasn't watched a minute of Classicast
---
What are RTVs?  Google's not helping.
---
Because maybe people dont want to have to choose between leaving vanilla and TBC. Can split the community easily
---
You stated the most obvious thing as though it was some kind of revelation... It's pretty clear who the moron is.
---
I always felt like the MVP when I was the only one the group that knew how to navigate ST. 
---
They’re only worth farming when the server is at/near the AQ patch. There’s no drops worth much to vendor and the only thing worth farming them for, Elemental Earth, isn’t going to be worth anything on the AH early on. 
---
IRL: if you jump from your feet on the top of the cliff to your feet on the bottom of the cliff, height doesn't affect anything.
---
Those were new servers.
---
There’s never enough breadcrumbs to find my way back to what their topic was.
---
Horde always but Iron Forge is so nice. Just feels so massive and grand.

---
Sorry! Rich Thorium Veins!
---
People are going to like one more than the other regardless. I don’t see how character copy will prevent the community for splitting to people’s preferred version of WoW. 
---
TBC Trees/Arena was **Patch 2.0.1** (Before the Storm Pre-Expansion Patch)
---
Cross Realm BG (Battlegroups) were introduced in **Patch 1.12**
---
While I agree that Battlegroups should not be there from the start because they may cause PvP/Server imbalance, lets not ignore facts. Saying that Arena/TBC talents were 'part of vanilla' is bullshit. It was in the pre-expansion hype phase for 1 month of people dicking around. Cross Realm BGs were introduced in August 2006, with TBC coming out Jan 2007. They were a very real part of the last few months of Vanilla.
---
Having said all of that, I am definitely not keen on them - especially not for the first 18 months.
---
I don't want to play with faceless players that I'll never see anywhere else in the world and might as well be NPCs. That doesn't "spice up" anything, it just makes PvP boring.
---
Because creating a character copy makes for seamless transition into a TBC realm while keeping vanilla ones in tact. That being said if they made it just fresh realms for TBC I wouldnt mind either 
---
Imagine you have played with the same players for TWO years, you know all of them. Being able to see how other servers do BG's and pvp and how their gear is, that is spicing things up. 
---
That's the point. You are arguing that it is like content, while ignoring that it is a game system. If you don't want 1.12 game systems you are waiting for the wrong product as that is their plan. I too would like to see a 1.1-1.12 progression but it isn't going to happen, so we are going to deal with some compromises. 
---
No sharding. 30 servers. 3 hr que times. Welcome to vanilla
---
Hopefully the click report will scare any ninjas. 
---
Nopp. All shards have the same global/local channels. Its only /s /y that gets affected. 
---
I was 11, when I started a few months into 2006.
---
Show us some tips in it please? 
---
If people would rather play TBC enough to transfer their characters, they will not be playing vanilla anymore regardless of transfers, copies, or rerolls. Transfers will not fragment the community, when the community that would transfer would not be playing vanilla anymore regardless. 
---
Yes it just wasn't super widely known my friends and I power leveled characters in TBC instances by mob tagging and having them drop group tag mobs and inviting them back before the 1 minute instance kick booted them out.
---

---
I agree with the bulk of what you are saying, but please remove the bit at the end where you attack people for being ignorant about Vanilla minutiae.  People don't know things, and then they know them.  It's literally how life works.  There was a time when you didn't know all of the things you listed.  Just calmly make your argument and let it stand on its own.
---
Yet, the person who made the dumb comment, that they should of known was "obvious" isn't the moron.  Ok dude, yeah...  You aren't a moron at all, gotcha.
---
I have done this exact thing before. I hit 58 and started to get prereqs like ony attunement and other dungeon quests ready. The problem is, unless you have guildies or friends that don't mind you tagging along, it's hard to find a group outside BRD or a rare LBRS. Even as a healer with no real drawbacks from being lower level, people still just won't want to take you, even though the 2 level difference in stats is miniscule.
---
It might make a difference on a pvp server, but then again on a pvp server I'm not putting my big Tauren ass on a giant Kodo mount when I can slink around in cat form
---
I would prefer if they had Premade Match making prioity. If 10 people on both sides queue up they should play each other over 10 randoms. 
---
Premades still want to compete against each other for server bragging rights. Leave the X-Realm bragging for another time.
---
I'm in full agreement with the idea that if they want to stack alliance for their pve, then they get to play on pve servers, and even if battle groups are made available due to imbalance in the PvP servers, only the PvP servers get to be in them.
---
Otherwise, reroll. 
---
I'm not even sure what you two are fighting about, but please, it's not worth it for either of you. Insult flinging only serve to make the community look worse as a whole.
---
What are you even arguing? Original were vanilla realms only played BGs against the other faction on that realm. This is how PServers work. Just because everyone, from every continent can play on that one PS, doesn't change anything.
---
I trust Blizzard on this. I think modern WoW struggling in large events has to do with the modern abilities when stuff updates that makes the modern game a complete mess in large events. We have private servers using third party nobody hosts with garbage server hardware on frankenstein back engineered code doing this on Nostalrius.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fYFD06UFscw) 
---
I expect we will get even better performance on Classic, especially on a hardware level because the old client is DX 9/Old OpenGL and it frankly sucks. 
---
I think they are being completely honest and just doing it in the starting areas. You have 100 million people who played WoW. You had sub peaks of like 15 million. Say 1 percent of that 100 million tried it and are tourists as Brack said. That's not unreasonable with a summer release and it topping twitch etc. Now factor in that servers were designed for 3000 players with spawns and resources and quest timers. They aren't going to open 333 servers that won't be sustainable if a million people logged in. No business is also going to turn away customers even if they are tourists and even if they don't like Classic, their sub lets them try out the modern game that they may like.
---
With sharding they can accommodate the rush while ensuring healthy server populations and no has as many "dead servers".
---
If you want to blame something for this blame the modern gamer who follows trends like lemmings. Classic isn't going to have a few people trying it. It's gonna get swamped like Apex and every other big streamer game and a lot of that will die off when the streamers move on to their next thing. 
---
I DO remember people when I get to like Deadmines or Wailing Caverns but before then on a "fresh" packed private server. Not so much. A lot of the initial rush will be gone before 10 I think and long before that first BIG instance. You are looking for most players to spend like 5 hours to get to 10 and do a class quest and play around with professions. That is 5 hours of game time and that is if they can easily access quests and mobs. That is as long as a lot of modern single player games. A lot will also quit when they can't solo those 10'ish group quests because some people are just anti social. 
---
In real vanilla (don't use private as a barometer) most people took like 3 months to level. Blizzard will have time to adjust for all of this, but they have to do something for the intiial rush.
---
I've seen you make this ridiculous slippery slope argument in another reply. First of all, your assumption that the classicast guys want CRBGs in **at launch** is completely unfounded. I don't know if you watched the episode on 2x speed, or skimmed through it or what, but they only addressed adding CRBGs as a "necessary evil" if faction imbalance becomes too great. I don't think faction imbalance will be that much of an issue until we're far enough down the road in the classic timeline where CRBGs being implemented would be no changes. It's clear to me you just dislike streamers for whatever reason and you try to justify your reactionary beliefs by making a hate post and spreading misinformation. I hope you rethink your statement.
---
P.S. I really don't want to see CRBGs in Classic, I think it hurts the game overall and I disagree with classicast on it being a necessary evil, considering you always have the option to server transfer if it really gets that bad. 
---
Lets consider launch
---
2500 people roll on a server. The server has to handle login events, character spawning, tracking, etc for all of those people across X zones. Let's assume, at best, we have even race distribution.
---
8 races / 2500 characters is about 312 per zone. Orc and Troll start at the same spot, so that alone is 624 people. Is over 600 people a normal thing? This is "best case" scenario, with an even racial split. Consider that if you roll on a heavy server, you might roll somewhere else. Now you are adding extra CPU cycles on every server you log into and nope out of because too many people. 
---
So youve spread the population out, and its fucking impossible to quest because there are SIX HUNDRED FUCKING CHARACTERS ALSO DOING THE SAME QUESTS.
---
Stability here doesnt necessarily mean "server go boom". 
---
You can collect nodes while shapeshifted, so it's a good idea for Druid. So probably Herbalism and Leatherworking would be a good idea, as said.abovr, to gather money early on. Then later you can swap Leatherworking for Alchemy and make flasks and stuff for your guild.
---
Also, 
---
You are arguing pserver dynamics vs official server dynamics.  If everyone plays on 1 server, there is zero reason for battlegroups.  Battlegroups were introduced, as a way to balance factions and populations out, from underpop servers / unbalanced faction servers, which is an issue you have, when you have multiple servers, in an official release of the game.  
---
At the start of the game, I can agree, that single server PvP will be fine.  Although, as time passes, server imbalances WILL HAPPEN.  It is in inevitable fact, that some servers will have less players / more or less of a certain faction.  It will 100% happen and battlegroups being added, alleviated more issues for the entire playerbase, than problems created by lack of single server PvP.
---
Don't talk to me about community, I have been playing MMORPGS since 1995, I have many years in Asheron's Call and Everquest, since they released and played WoW from Nov 2004.  Along with having a few 60's Pservers.  (Reposting, because I cannot post names, do to automod.)  
---
Just because you have one opinion, doesn't invalidate other's opinions, who have as much, or more time spent on WoW and other Old School MMROGPS.
---
Because you dont understand how infrastructure works.
---
I remember glitching behind the Warsong gulch flag room with the enemy flag. 
---
Calling /u/EsfandTV \+ /u/TipsOutBaby for comment.
---
Should Cross Realm BGs be introduced at all in Classic WoW? If so, should they be introduced as part of the final phase of release, for a true "No Changes" approach (seeing as they were introduced at Patch 1.12 in Vanilla, 5 months before TBC)?
---
If you want them from the start, why? And also, how can you help avoid the negative potential outcomes of faction imbalances and the potential death of World PvP?
---
Would love direct input/answers on this discussion from yourselves.
---
Both of these are great! MadSeasonShow is one of my favorite WoW content creators. His voice is really relaxing to listen to. I've watched both this and the Onyxia wipe animation, both are great!
---
Descolace is your friend
---
The stone drops are worth a decent amount, about 10-15 silver per mob.
---
This needs more upvotes. No idea why OP is lying about this.
---
MadSeason is a legend and this is quite good, but perhaps needs moar dots to surpass the Ony one 
---
Hold up. Are you fucking dual weilding?
---
That's a one girthy, chungus-sized copypasta. 
---
It's not a necessary evil as much as LFD isn't a necessary evil.  "it was in vanilla" is also not a valid argument, arenas and 2.0 talent trees were in vanilla but people don't want them.
---
We shouldn't  even be arguing about this, it should be a obvious "NO!" as it completely kills the community aspect of vanilla which is the most important part of vanilla and something you can't get in ANY OTHER VERSION OF WOW.

I've always loved Ironforge to this day, it's still my favorite city in WoW's history. It was the very first big city I ever set foot in and it blew me away that an entire city was inside that giant mountain. I spent an hour just running around and exploring it. The inn and the houses just seem really cozy and relaxing to get away from the cold and snow just outside the gates. 
---
Interesting, I never heard about this. Makes sense though, there were a lot of low pop realms.
---
I would think so. They were pretty clear that they were willing to do whatever the "community wants" which I feel like was partially a nod at something along the lines of a TBC server.
---
I would think it would be hyper dependent on the success of Classic. Since there really hasn't been any booms of TBC pservers only vanilla. Not to say there isn't a desire just that there hasn't been a movement of people actually backing it up with action. So I'd say if Classic succeeds and people speak up about TBC it would happen.
---
But what if you can choose?
---
What the fuck are you even trying to say?   You are trying to compare a single pserver to multi-server official release of the game.  
---
Your logic is complete trash.
---
Battlegroups is a product of imbalances of population / faction over MANY servers, because overtime, these imbalances WILL happen.
---
Its not hard to understand, but there are so many fucking morons here, its insane...
---
Where do you draw the line, then? Should they also not have 1.12 talents? No 1.12 bug fixes, itemization changes, dungeon changes, profession changes, etc.? [https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch\_1.12.0](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0) 
---
If 1.12 isn't "real vanilla" then what is?
---
The amount of communication classic characters do with the servers is fraction of what current retail characters do.  The change to the slower combat speed from retail should bring massive performance boosts.
---
It would have to take off in a major way. Not saying it is impossible but it would have to REALLY grab the public's attention to warrant a Southpark Episode.
---
But... well... 10+ Million subscribers. Who knows how many are going to come back? Maybe it'll be worthy of hitting the 24 hours news cycle in a big way. As long as it doesn't get the "Mom let's baby starve because WoW" attention any publicity is welcome.

If it was an option to queue up for x-realm BGs atleast it would be you making the choice to do it as opposed to it being defacto. I can be for person choices.
---
Back to the swearing eh? If there's imbalance, then you have to queue longer. Battlegroups were a sledgehammer to crack a nut. Not every server has massive population imbalances. I'd expect most servers, especially populous ones to operate fine as a single realm fighting among it's self. There's no need to roll these up into battlegroups. You're ruining the experience of the many, to satisfy the few.
---
Server pairing would be more sensible and only dynamically when 2 servers are judged to have gone out of balance. 
---
Don't just stick every realm in a fucking battlegroup from the start. It's totally unnecessary and detrimental to the Battleground experience.
---
&gt;things that the original WoW designers called a mistake (arena)
---
Where can I get more info about this?
---
Esfand responded to this post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2b6x0/curious_how_classicast_has_tried_to_push_for/eiross5/).
---
Then they should manage server populations properly, instead of destroying a community aspect of the game. it's not a necessary evil, it was a shitty solution to a problem, and since this is WoW 2.0 they should think of a better solution that doesn't  compromise a very important MMO aspect(the community).
---
Just when I thought I was out..
---
Amen
---
You have my pity
---
So if you are going feral druid after 60 you want enchanting to 265 and get http://classicdb.ch/?item=11811
---
You can have 2 gathering professions and plan to drop 1 closer to 60. Skinning + herbalism and then go alchemy when you get closer to 60 as it is quicker and way more gold efficient. 
---
You want herbalism at 60 if you are going to raid as a feral druid or you are going to need a really good gold income to buy consumables, or you will be way behind every meter and be a drag to the guild if you dont come propped up with consumables. As a feral you might be expected to tank meaning you will most likely need tank consumables aswell.
---
So dropping enchanting after 265 is a good idea. I would have gone skinning+herbalism, [mail enough herbs](https://legacy-wow.com/alchemy-1-300/) to get alchemy to 300 to a bank alt, drop skinning close to 60, get enchanting to 265 and make smoking heart then level alchemy after you have dropped enchanting.
---
All the push? I don't think there is a "push" if your an active PVPer then your going to want fast que times, I don't think I know a single person in my friend group who wants to sit and wait on BG ques.
---
Like Esfand said though, its a problem for the future, not for Classic WoW pre-TBC/Arena phase. There are a lot more important things to focus on between now and then.
---
Single realm is great, but cross realm is better than sitting around waiting imo
---
Also, for people here making the argument, that battlegroups destroy the "feel" of community, that worsened that feel, was BG's to begin with.  BG's aren't were the community PvP is best experienced at, at all.  
---
The real community PvP was in the uninstanced world, Tarren Mill/Southshore as the most popular example.  
---
Battlegroups are a product to alleviate issues of MULTI server imbalances over time, that happen over time.   
---
Of course you're going to think single server BG's are better playing on a Pserver, because there is no other valid option.  You aren't going to split a playerbase, that can fit on one server, just to link with in a 1-1 connected battlegroup, that makes zero sense.
---
The dynamics of a smaller Pserver community, vs a large official release of servers, is completely different.  There are a much bigger demand overall, that has to be addressed.
---
Please, put aside the circle jerk and actually try and think logically.  Don't be a sheep. 
---
Thanks, missed it/posted while he had replied.
---
Its really not comparable at all imo, I can't go into world chat and spam the other faction to come join me in some pvp, but I can easily throw a raid together from world chat.
---
My thought was similar. Technology has come a ways in the last 10 years. I'm sure the hardware can handle the stress - it's just a matter of everyone having to stand in line to kill kobolds and the amount of players that will drive away. 
---
Thanks. Yeah I will probably go with the heavy Demo for leveling then switch to DS/Ruin at 60. Plenty of time to decide for sure.
---
Cross realm BGs are a very major trade-off, so I can see why it's polarizing. 
---
It wasn't uncommon to see multi-hour waits for AV or WSG on both of the two servers I played on prior to cross realm BGs (Darkspear-Horde and Stonemaul-Alliance). 
---
But indeed, there was something truly special about running into familiar faces, especially in twink brackets. 
---
I think the tradeoff is worth it: Cross realm BGs suck the soul out of WoW, but I can understand why others disagree.
---
Sure I'll make another post soon, any requests? 
---
An absolute sperg has a brainfart and makes a post 50% rant and 50% lies, and reddit hive mind culture thinks he's speaking the truth. What else is new.
---
Agreed. Battlegroups made me not hate PvP being on a dead server. 
---
Were arena's in Vanilla? (I don't think so? But I forget. I hope not, arenas absolutely sucked so much). 
---
Demonology is better than affliction for both world PvP and dungeons.  Being able to fel domination summon another voidwalker to sacrifice it is a gamechanger in PvP, and soul link is just incredible. In dungeons the demonology warlock gets 20% threat reduction with imp out which will allow them to do up to 25% more dps.
---
It sounds like they expect launch to be bigger than wPvP/world bosses/city raids... pretty straightforward
---
I don't know if what you say is true. Regardless of what classicast is pushing for my opinion on CRBG is that it will be catastrophic for classic.
---
&gt;they shut down a city raid in retail a few months ago because the servers couldn't handle it.
---
Because retail servers are not designed to handle 500+ people all in the same area, since sharding and CRZ are so heavily ingrained in the game's structure now.
---
I'll just say that, if some Russians working in their spare time can run a server with 10k online and no sharding, then a multi-billion-dollar game dev should have no problem running servers with only 4-5k online.
---
Imo, neither of them are a bad idea and I can't say I would mind if they were implemented, but what makes you so sure that we'll see either of them?
---
Haha, believe me you will be highly desired come classic. Youd be surprised how many people dont know how to navigate ST
---
Would I shit my pants in anger if they were implemented? Nah.
---
infact the barber shop would be very handy for me so I can change my hair from black to pink depending on if I'm dps or tanking.
---
And guild banks would be very convenient instead of needing a guild bank alt which is honestly just another hassle for the GM.
---
But I still wouldn't advocate for them to be implemented, if they are in then nice, if they are not then it's simply more authentic, either for good or bad.
---
i mean....people were saying the same about vanilla/classic servers not that long ago...
---
What came after vanilla ran its course?
---
It's been discussed to death, all we can do is try to interpret the few tiny statements they've made on it. Which we have, every day, for months. And it's obvious now that it's impossible to tell how much they're going to use sharding or alter their infrastructure to accommodate Classic because they simply haven't told us. All we can do is wait for more comments from Blizzard.
---
So long as it doesn’t hurt grouping and community nor gameplay, I’m good with it. 
---
Asmongold is a dipshit. How anyone enjoys his content is beyond me. He's super entitled and the majority of his content is "reactions" to other people's videos. Why do people enjoy being told what their reactions to videos should be? People should just watch the damn videos that people invested time and creativity into and form their own opinions.
---
Yeah, everyone knows that sitting in a queue for 3 hours before you can play is just part of the experience! Anyone who doesn't like 3 hour queues is just a RETAIL BABY!
---
ಠ_ಠ
---
seriously
---
What about engineering/mining if the focus is pvp?
---
Hello,
---
I've only played Vanilla and I'm in favor of battle groups.
---
Preferably not mixing PvE and PvP servers together, but still locked in small regional batches.
---
That is all.
---
Sincerely, my twinks waiting for 2 hours for a match.
---
Needless account security issues when they’re trying to cut down on customer support as much as possible? Guild banks will def be in.
---
&gt;You're ruining the experience of the many, to satisfy the few.
---
Ironically, keeping a multi-server setup, as single server BG's only, does exactly this.  It punishes the majority, for the benefit of the few. 
---
People on underpopulated servers, will be punished, in the race to Rank 14.  
---
You are trying to compare apples and oranges here, which is logically very flawed. 
---
I am not advocating, that Battlegroup system to be implicated from the start.  It wasn't a thing that happened, at the earliest time frame in WoW's initial launch, because the demand wasn't fully there for it.
---
At the start, servers are pretty much all equal, without taking any prior agreement of what is going to be a "popular" server.  
---
Although,... overtime, if you do not address this, then you have players that initially started on server X, being punished, because server Y is just faster queue times.
---
No logical person, Esfand+ClassiCast crew, is advocating for Battlegroups from day 1, it was brought up a topic for how to address server populations, going forward over time.
---
Then, its being spun and taken out of context in this thread, by OP to create a false narrative.   Sadly people buy into it and believe it, because of being lazy to do a few minutes of actual research.  
---
They will not do cross realm BG's because that would mess up the entire ranking system.
---
I'm more worried about (some of) them pushing for non authentic server caps. Having played on both I can say that they're two completely different experiences. 
---
True, true. It makes sense. They were originally implemented to curb account sharing and the drama that caused. With people using authenticators and being linked to battlenet and stuff now, it'd be a pain. 
---
&gt; but the #NoChanges part of me doesn't like that
---
The developers released patch 1.12.1 in 2006. At that point, they'd tinkered and toyed with AV's PVE mechanics, but the 2005/2006 community had made their decision - they don't like it.
---
If we're *really* going to say /#nochanges, then Zerg Fest it is.
---
Now, personally, I'd like to see the original AV return. AV is largely unchanged from the start of TBC through today. If Blizzard wants this game to restore history, then I'd like them to restore something that has been lost. 
---
It's also possible that the original AV data/tuning was overwritten and there's no way to restore it.
---
Precisely. So many people don't seem to understand that sharding is NOT for "server stability", sharding is so that you don't have 500 people all in one area all trying to kill the same mobs.
---
Remember that in vanilla, mobs often took 2-3 minutes to respawn. 500+ players all fighting over those 2-3 minute respawns? Yeah, that's not going to work at all. Private servers fixed this by changing the respawn timers, but that created a whole host of issues on its own, like cave areas becoming warzones and people just standing in 1 spot and killing the same mob over and over for super-fast grinding exp.
---
We *NEED* sharding just to control the population during the initial rush, or else there will just be too many players and nobody will be able to do any quests.
---
This reeks of YTMND
---
I think arenas came with TBC. 
---
it does thanks
---
Ah yes "if it's read it's dead" players (*as long as they're more than 4 levels below me and alone).
---
That's not an ingame dance though..? 
---
IDK, maybe there should be a negative for playing on the majority faction (65/35), as in a QUEUE system specifically for that faction. That would solve so many issues, and reduce the need to xrealm bgs by a ton.
---
When xrealm bgs happened, my queue times went from 2mins or less to 5+mins. It ruined the community and pvp started to matter less from that point on. We need to figure out how to not let xrealm BGs become a part of classic for as long as possible, at least not until phase 6.
---
I mean, yes, technically cross-realm BGs were a thing in 1.12, but did not exist for 90% of vanilla. But at the same time, people who played back then said that before cross-realm BGs, queues could be an hour or more, and once they were introduced, queues were much faster and more people could actually PvP.
---
Because an outraged circle jerk &gt; facts and reason
---
If you plan on doing pve seriously gnomish engineering is required. Enchanting is worth keeping if you can get the raid enchants and are willing to farm out rep/rare drops. I will be leveling with skinning and enchanting exclusively to de and bank until I am ready to focus on leveling enchanting closer to endgame. I’ll drop skinning and level engineering pre-BWL or BG patch. Until then it is super useful for devilsaur leather farming and if you get your hands on finkle’s skinner you have even more reason to hold on to skinning for a bit. 
---
Herbalism and Alchemy are solid money making professions, but personally I would put them on a character I didn’t intend to raid or pvp seriously on. Personally I am planning on leveling a rogue specifically to have herbalism for a few farms and alchemy for obvious reasons.
---
I don’t know how many times it has to be said, but no changes consoldiates the discussion and argumentation around how Classic should behave solely to states of the game within the 1.1-1.12 timeframe. You can be no changes and also advocate for original AV/new AV, no crz bg/crz bg, no honor system with DHK/ or DHK’s. These are the discussions that no changes people want to have. 
---
I found PvP on private servers to be exactly the same experience as cross realm BGs if not worse. The population is so massive that you're essentially playing cross realm constantly.
---
Yeah, I don't really get into the whole alliance vs horde thing anymore. Maybe I'm just getting old but it's more of a background noise to me now. Getting randomly ganked is just a fleeting annoyance now -- not a call to arms. I've got limited play time and I just want to level in peace so I'm seriously contemplating rolling PvE this time. 
---
They brought joy to me because it meant I could actually do battlegrounds.
---
33 
---
A simple solution to the imbalance worries would be to add a QUEUE system that punished the dominant faction past a point. Say it's fine up to 55/45 split, but once it hits 60/40 or maybe 65/35, then an automatic QUEUE happens for the dominant faction ONLY (allowing only alliance players to join freely as the non dominant faction, while the dominant horde side must sit in a queue system before allowed in game).
---
The bats in EPL is a really good start as a fresh warrior. Other than that profession stuff, mining, herbing, devilsaur farming with buddies or when full prebis you can 2man DME with a healer (you want mining for this). 
---
Cross realm bgs and LFD are not comparable like that... Some realms will not be able to play bgs due to faction imbalance and they will implement it sooner or later if something isn't done about faction imbalance.
---
These are two things I think would fit well in vanilla. Make it pricy for a gold sink, I wouldn’t want to see a barber shop if it was something people would do every few days. With a high enough cost I think it could work. 
---
The bank gives the guild a common goal to build toward without any real negatives. More transparency with the guild items your donating is a good thing. 
---
I'm glad this sub's manufactured drama isn't getting to ya! Keep pumping out the quality content
---
I really enjoyed Stormwind before it became super crowded. (Back in the days when IF was all the rage). Otherwise TB is my second favorite, followed by Darnassus, then Org, then IF. I hated Undercity.
---
Haha I was in my 30’s when I started in 2006 so you aren’t old at all lol. Of course you won’t realize 30s isn’t old until you are in your 40s lol
---
So if you get 265 Enchanting, make the trinket and then stop being an Enchanter, you are still able to wear the trinket I assume? 
---
&gt; I think it's pretty much guaranteed that we'll see guild banks.
---
Why? They were not in Vanilla - they came half-way through TBC. I understand it isn't a total dealbreaker change, but I can't fathom why you'd believe it's pretty much guaranteed. The barbershop was added with Wrath *(instead of the advertised Dance Studio ...)*
---
Also, I'd be worried on how hoarding items and gold could affect the economy. Guilds did it with alts in Vanilla, sure, but the inconvenience and required trust would have prevented mid-level guilds from having a central bank.  
---
In this one he sounds way too much like the french guy from Monty Python.
---
Is this the guide that explains night elf extra dodge is good for casters
---
18, and in 05! I always made fun of RPGs and was doing so when my wifes cousin told me to try wow on her account. 3 weeks later I had my own account and an addiction!
---
I can’t speak for other people.
---
You can't really punish people for playing on the "majority faction" because then you're punishing prior people, who played on that faction, before the server became overpopulated.  It just doesn't work that way and is a very bad way of handling it.
---
As for your queue time going up... Just because you experienced something you perceive as a negative, doesn't mean its a negative for the game.
---
Game balance happens for the game overall, not for a select random few, please understand this.
---
Your queue going up, was a result of balancing, so that players over all, have the same equalized chances and opportunities, at the grind to ranking up.
---
Its about game health overall. 
---
&gt;Poor Darnasus and Undercity, coming from Warcraft 3, those cities have the most lore, but WoW didn't do them justice. Mostly due to location.
---
As a guy whose first ever computer game was WC2, and I eventually played through WC Orcs and Humans as well, Stormwind was AMAZING. 
---
I hear you, they definitely didn't do Undercity justice. Although I don't recall much of Darnassus in WC3 lore, though it's been a while since I last played through TFT (finished RoC again just last week though). 
---
🤣 I'll have to look now
---
You for sure can still wear the trinket.
---
And Majestic, thanks a lot man. Really informative. Appreciate it. So do you really think skinning for the gold is worth not having the potions leveling 1-60 and avoiding all those deaths / speeding up your downtime?
---
I was never one to have strong opinions on which side to play. My first character was an undead warlock, my first lvl 60 was a NE druid, my first character to do progression raiding was a troll shaman... I like things on both factions and have great fun playing either. And this making choosing a main for classic even harder than it is already, feelsbad.
---
I can sum up this whole thread and the complaints of OP and the people in agreement with him:  
---
You literally want classic to just be 1.11, why dont you just say it like that instead of going on this tirade? 
---
Cross realm BGs will be necessary like a year or more after launch when people end up leaving or migrating to bigger servers and the faction balance will rocket to 80-20 ratios. But IMHO it should be the part of the content release plan way way way down the line when really needed.
---
It was in 1.12, thats what we're gonna get, your whole argument literally gets factually stopped by a single google search or reading the wiki patch release info about what was in 1.12 - which by official announcement is what we're getting
---
Just say you want 1.11 instead of going on this attack against people
---
I like that server pairing idea. I absolutely hated battle groups, but I also don't think 1 hour BG queues are something to just be ignored. I'd rather find a good solution than just go with battle groups as they were out just not care that some servers will have shit PvP for a lot of players.
---
There are dozens of us.
---
You're welcome to your opinion! I really enjoyed WotLK and felt like Cataclysm was when the game jumped the shark.
---
Come now, don't you know that people with different opinions are enemy infiltrators sent to drag classic into BfA? We have to get the pitchforks out!
---
Their whole argument in here can be summed up by them saying they want 1.11 instead of going on this tirade against official facts of releases and people
---
DOZENS!!!!!!
---
Disagree
---
I stood in line at midnight at the local Best Buy for my copy. By the time I made it to the front of the line (there were at least 75 people ahead of me) they were all sold out of collectors editions. So I had to choose between waiting till the next day, or buying the standard edition.
---
Hindsight being 20/20 I regret the choice.
---
I'm against both of these. I understand the account sharing concerns of a lack of guild banks, but as with most things, this change will influence other things and it would be hard to assess all the potential changes until it's too late.
---
Even a barber shop will influence the economy, as you mentioned, by sucking gold out of it. I'd be very surprised if a barbershop is added, and also surprised if guild banks are added.
---
The first sentence in the blizz quote says that sharding helps keep realms stable. Did you read the quote?
---
It's less about my personal queue times, and more about the community. Adding xrealm bgs is a start to a worse off community, and, and it really doesn't solve the faction imbalance issue at all. Crossrealm BGs doesn't change the fact that my individual server might be 65/35 split, which is the real issue. 
---
By adding a queue system (that blizzard already had in game, just not faction based) would alleviate this issue, and there's a really good chance it would help with the BG queueus as well. Since it would mend the population imbalance from 65/35 close to 55/45, reducing queue times by a TON for the dominant faction, without completely ruining the community.
---
Except that wasn't the main reason they stated at blizzcon for sharding. Ion stated it was being used to preserve server community post-exodus because they are assuming large amounts of players will quit.
---
I'm just interested in the leet pro tips that book suggests compared to what we know now. Kinda see if the book was worth purchasing at the time.
---
Tips isn't old enough to play vanilla ??? I'm not even 22 and I hit level cap and played vanilla extensively even doing some light raiding in zg and MC.
---
Bob Ross of WoW
---
I played on one for a while, got max level and raided for a while. I rolled on it because it was a fresh server so I could level up alongside everyone, and also because I wanted a smaller group of people, a more community feel. I didnt RP much, but I would speak more formally and never use "thx" or "sry." There was one super successful raiding guild on each side, but in general the quality of raiders was much lower (not a knock on RP players skill, but I imagine most RPers simply dont care too much about that part of the game.) There were events, both routine and one off, a compendium of people's blogs for their character stories existed on the forums, and in general the atmosphere was laid back and non-competitive.
---
As for it being "more mature" I would say no. Definitely less people running their mouth and fewer eight year olds, but still numerous immature and annoying people. However, they were ostracized. Small knit community makes it hard to exist if nobody likes you.
---
Overall it is not something I would do again, but not because the experience was negative, but due to the fact I feel people who roll RP servers should want to RP...and I never did. It is fun at first, but unless you're really into it and have a uniwue character dynamic to roleplay, it turns into a chore.
---
Basically, roll RP if you want to RP. If you don't, don't. You won't be doing anyone any favors if you want to go there to stand out as a good/skilled player...the majority of people won't give a shit. They will wipe for hours and enjoy it because being successf isn't their main reason for playing.
---
Thats just my experience.
---
That would be another interesting solution. I don't know the answer but if they could get server balance close that would be fine too. I really hate cross server battlegrounds, but 1 or 2 hour queues isn't really a good solution.
---
I think the issue here lies in the definition of "heavy launch traffic."  A long time ago, Blizzard revealed that 70% of characters never made it past level 10.  To account for that kind of touristy drop-off, then servers are going to need to launch with populations of 10-11k, if the goal is that 2.5k-3k sweet spot from vanilla.
---
A few thousand people online for AQ gates or world bosses is a far cry from 10k+ people all in starting zones.
---
Yes, I read it, and I'm saying it's bullshit. If some Russians can run a 10k population server in their spare time with no sharding, why can't Blizzard?

Why do you change your hair color depending on your role?

Even when you know the layout like the back of your hand it can be a pain to get around, and if you zone out you can get turned around or too low/high instantly lmao. Still my favorite though personally
---
my dude, he probably means 39 degrees celsius which is fucking hot, not cold!
---
I think that's what they were going for back then; WoW was very mainstream for the genre and they embraced that in these commercials.
---
So you don't want crossrealm BGs until TBC? 
---
God damn that is a THICC phone case.
---
Black if I'm tanking because it fits the set armor better, pink if I'm dps because warrior dps gear is already a rainbow and I might as well embrace it.
---
You may get the chance in 2033 when WoW Classic: Battle for Azeroth comes out! 
---
Well it definitely breaks down all the quests for each zone gold and loot rewards also breaks down where to find the quests and so on, even going into the social aspects of the game.

The quote is from Rob Pardo, and the interview in question was at warcry.com, [now only visible via archives](https://web.archive.org/web/20170530063959/http://www.warcry.com/articles/view/interviews/6773-Five-Years-of-Warcraft-Speaking-With-Blizzards-Rob-Pardo.2)

The oft-quoted section is 
---
&gt;If I was going to pick on a game design thing that I look back on and think was a mistake? We really never designed WoW to be a competitive e-sports game; it was something that we decided to start tackling because there was such a desire and demand to evolve it in that direction, to introduce competitive arenas. I'm not sure that that was the right thing to do with the game.
---
&gt;We didn't engineer the game and classes and balance around it, we just added it on, so it continues to be very difficult to balance. Is WoW a PvE cooperative game, or a competitive PvP game? There's constant pressure on the class balance team, there's pressure on the game itself, and a lot of times players who don't PvP don't understand why their classes are changing. I don't think we ever foresaw how much tuning and tweaking we'd have to do to balance it in that direction. 
---
Best capital music too. The entire place is just so *warm* and *inviting*
---
As long as it's all in good fun, it's a blast to remain childishly, exaggeratedly dedicated to your faction of choice.
---
Having said that, I played Horde for 5 years and I would literally rather gnaw off my own feet than play those Fisher-Price "Baby's First Fantasy" Alliance races.
---
&gt;put aside the circle jerk and actually try and think logically. Don't be a sheep. 
---
Mate, have you seen this sub? Fat chance
---
Reading through all this heated discussions already shows me that Loot Trading should never be implemented. It creates an issues which was never one to begin with. Even if we remove the option to opt for a ticket in the rare cases of mistakes.
---
Personally the only time I ever experienced people writing a ticket (like 2 times or so whole vanilla experience back in the days) was in RAID, with MASTER LOOT on. Maybe restrict it to there.
---
South Park is one of my top favorite shows and fills 80% of my daily quotes used in any given context. The wow episode was the first episode I ever watched, and was playing wow at the time. It holds a dear place in my heart...... 
---
The show has not been that great in a long while, and I must share my appreciation at the idea of them revisiting something as wonderful as classic wow. 
---
I love the show, love classic wow, but in 2019, I just don’t think they belong together. 
---
The only solution (free transfers only exacerbates the problem) is to implement a type of sharding that auto balances zones based on the current population levels of a server, taking into account who is logged in and for how long, in addition to other metrics. 
---
Cross realms BG’s are going to be the only way some servers can get queues 
---
Imma bout to be duel wielding these ***PITCH FORKS***
---
Question - rant aside, do you think  
---
A) Players will naturally balance themselves across servers, in absence of CRBG  
---
B) Server imbalance is tolerable as long as we don't have CRBG  
---
C) Blizz should enact un-blizzlike policies to combat faction imbalance
---
Sounds like a good guy.  
---
You forgot about the Red Snappah!
---
Upvoted, as this seems to..... completely dismantle the OP? Im all for a good flogging when its justified, but this topic seems like BS...
---
Where is this guy now lol
---
Exactly.
---
The first and second run, you can still do full guild, then you have to pug a few people. You have to keep your key person unsaved from 1st to 3rd/4th run 👌 this allow you to skin multiple onixya for the cloak 
---
"...You can be no changes and also advocate for original AV/new AV, no crz bg/crz bg, no honor system with DHK/ or DHK’s... " Yes, you are right in the larger sense of  NoChanges, and that is a fair point point. I'm concerned that tweaking numbers in this way in order to make AV "more fair" to the Horde has two issues. 1) It is fair to say that the damage from NPCs were reduced during vanilla, and therefore are potentially "open" of discussion, even though these changes may not have occurred at the same time throughout the various patches. However, 2) What is "fair" may be a somewhat subjective argument, and that's a potentially tough call for Blizzard.  How much of a damage change from the Alliance archers on the bridge is "fair" to the Horde? Is the bridge bottleneck worth -50 damage per archer shot to even things out? -100? I have no idea.  Also, there is also the general idea of a slippery slope here, because small tweaks here or there making things "fair" could be expanded to other areas as well. (Ex. Previous versions of talent trees may have made classes more or less adept at certain things, so lets make some small changes from things that were all within the 2004-2006 period in order to be "fair" to those classes, etc.). More to the point - Did you play Horde, and did/do you think there an issue with balance here? These are, after all, the discussions NoChanges people want to have. :-)
---
No. I didn't find the first one very entertaining and I doubt I would this next one. UNLESS they were making fun of 30-50 year old nerd virgins who are coming back to WoW to try to recapture their youth and end up beating their families for interrupting raids, etc. That would be entertaining.  
---
Eh asmon is just hanging out with them, he doesnt really speak for anyone outside of transmoggers and mount farmers i guess,   however the Classicast guys probably have more time spent on private servers and just have more overall knowledge of everything vanilla wow than majority of this subreddit, not to mention they have the platform, which is the biggest part,  if you dont like them thats fine. But dont say ignorant things like they are clueless about vanilla
---
Punishing players for wanting to play a certain faction, is not the way.  You have your opinion and I have mine.  You add a queue time to play a certain faction, while a friend is trying to get their buddy to try WoW, but he has to join a queue, or simply cannot play on that faction.   
---
When battlegroups solve all of this and for people that bitch about "community PvP' can learn that actual community PvP has nothing to do with BGs what so ever.
---
Community PvP is in the un-instanced world, not in an instanced BG. 
---
&gt; I can still remember my specs in DAoC when i went to RvR. 
---
I played for a while on the server vs a guild named "Dem Hibbies". Those dudes made  RVR videos of themselves slaughtering us in Emain. Ill never forget the names of their healers I chased all battle while their dps melted me.
---
The Ahn'Qiraj gate opening event will be the big test for Blizzard on this topic.  
---
Imagine the gate event, except everyone is sharded into groups of 100 or so. Try to imagine recapturing the feeling you had back then, but with only 100 people instead of the 800+ we had back then.  
---
I played Herb-Alch on my resto druid. That was WotLK mind you; but I was the life of the party when it came to running 5 mans. Buffs for days. 
---
Glad i can help
---
It takes time and gold to invest in having potions, including having your bags filled with potions and elixirs. I have not looked into the details, surely you can improve it with making potions while on the boat and such, but in my experience you spend far more time making elixirs and potions then you make up in time lost and bagspace used. 
---
Skinning for gold is also a contested issue as you will be spending time to skinn mobs instead of killing more mobs, increasing your level faster and making you more gold (as you make more gold in the higher levels). As a melee its not as a bad trade off as you will be standing on the mob as it dies (since its a beast and dont run away when its low). 
---
I am going with skinning as i would rather have a good chunk of gold when i arrive at 40, i am leveling with a partner aswell meaning I will be having a range mage that can continously pull while i skin mobs hopefully making it dramatically more efficient. 
---
I have the internet.  
---
I would imagine this effects of the respec cost hard core players very little. They will farm the gold. Definitely effects the 2 hour a day player more. 
---
On the thought of identity of character, I definitely can see that aspect of it, but at that point why not just make talents final or specialization final. Would you have liked that approach more (obviously theoretical), something like at 20 you picked your spec and were unable to change?
---
Absolutely, the lvl 40 switch is a very good idea.
---
1. Dungeons become revelant for lategame when you are in your mid 40's so that is when you want to start finding dungeon groups which is much easier if you have a good healing gear and already specced some points in to Resto. Damage dealers have a much harder time to find dungeon groups. As a tank or healer you will find one very short amounts of time.
---
2. Shamans are generally weak in solo PvP situations because they lack mobility and hard CC. But they are extremely good in group PvP / Battlegrounds when specced into ele/resto. Also ele shamans have less solo matchups that are awful than enh shamans.
---
3. In terms of leveling/grinding Shamans are on the weaker side. Enh is gear dependand and melee which increases downtime. Ele shamans after 40 are similarly fast as mages who don't AoE grind. They need to drink a lot but kill mobs very fast and don't take much damage, not only because mobs arrive with low HP but also because you can wear a shield + 1h.
---
Exactly this.
---
I have a feeling people buy these old guides to post a picture here and never open them again.
---
Forcing a cost onto any decision makes the decision more involved and thoughtful. And there being a cost associated with 'changing jobs' makes real-world sense, too.
---
Classic was full of decision making 'problems' ( or 'opportunities' for the optimists) like job identity, sunk cost, opportunity cost, tactical decisions, prospect theory. ~~(and other buzz-words)~~
---
Some folks like to maximize satisfaction. Some folks like to maximize efficiency. Some folks are in the middle. When you attach a cost to the way folks play (that "I better spend this talent point wisely" feeling), you create gameplay just out of the decision making.
---
&gt; Yeah, I don't really get into the whole alliance vs horde thing anymore... I'm seriously contemplating rolling PvE this time.
---
Plus, old gods are breaking out. We've got bigger shit to deal with.
---
So you're supporting adding cross-realm BGs when Naxx comes out then, right?
---
REALLY?!
---
I was such a bad mage -_-
---
You really should save your breath man, Its not worth arguing with these people. Appreciate and agree with your perspective. Hopefully they keep it out until its needed.
---
I first started playing WoW around the time the original episode came out, I remember asking in my guild at the time whether or not it was possible for me to just level up to 60 by just killing boars, one of the girls in the guild must have thought I was trolling her because she got really upset about it, an argument ensued and after a good 20 mins I still didn't know whether I could level up by killing boars, I guess she didn't like the South Park episode. Good times!
---
As for now, there is 0% chance of another South Park episode, in 2006 WoW was the most popular game in the world and was culturally relevant, these days WoW is a whole generation removed from being that, Fortnite is the only game relevant enough to possibly make it into a South Park episode.
---
Would I watch a new episode? It's kinda a pointless question because a new episode will never happen, loved the original though.
---
Someone who picked a server and faction day 1 should be punished a year and a half later when queue timers are impossible because servers havent been grouped when they need to be.  And go against everything vanilla and give up his character that he progressed on because he made an impossible to know choice day 1?
---
I didn’t read your post, I just wanted to say:
---
“THATS A 50 DKP MINUS!!!!!!”
---
Agreed.  So cozy
---
That is a very rpg aspect that I never thought about. I have never been one to role play/be entwined with my toon so maybe thats why I never thought about it. I can see where you are coming from because I remember people running around and you knowing them as "oh thats the ele shaman" or "ret pally". 
---
Coming from a non rpg player I see the respec cost as only hurting casual players. Which I guess could be the point of vanilla wow. So maybe that's why I don't agree with it, because I don't get the hardcore mentality.
---
they like re-hashing old themes, i think it makes total sense. they could do something with them live streaming and make it a 3-part story arch. I have a feeling they will 100% do it, they are smart
---
troll.
---
it would fit in PERFECTLY with the tegrity farms theme of keeping it 'simple' and going back to the 'good times'
---
I would be down for that yes. 
---
Dude you have no idea what you're talking about. You're saying "punishing players for wanting to play a certain faction, is not the way". Then you immediately argue that as long as it's not YOU being punished then it's fine. Have you ever played on a server where the other faction out numbers you 70/30? You literally don't get to have legit world pvp, and you damn sure don't get to ever engage and kill world bosses. So by your own logic, we need sharding. 
---
Without a queue system to balance the factions, then the lesser faction is actively being punished.
---
Xrealm BGs does NOTHING to the actual root issue of faction imbalance.
---
Hopefully blizz will add a player count/tracker to each server. Something simply showing the % horde to alliance would solve so many of these issues.
---
hah the shows never been better. past few seasons have been on point. speak for yourself.
---
you miss the fact that video games in general are huge right now...see fortnite. they could absolutely have episodes about fortnite kids versus wow kids. 
---
You're going to be that guy camping level 30 quest hotspots aren't you
---
Even if you are built to fear/drain tank, putting the vw on at least one mob always helps.
---
Also, the alternative is succubus for more dps, felhunter is your anti-caster pvp pet 
---
&gt; So you're supporting adding cross-realm BGs when Naxx comes out then, right?
---
Hes got you there craghack.... Maybe its better to just admit, that cross realm bgs is no changes and completely logical to add, but you dont WANT them.
---
Nothing wrong with that, but trying to argue 1.12 content doesn't need to be released in classic at its proper timeline is inconsistent as fuck.
---
Is it Classic Wow or Wow Classic?
---
I only ever played rp pvp servers in vanilla, I couldn't see the enjoyment in a grey guy walking by and spamming rude at you knowing they wouldn't get a smack.
---
Like I said to him, I have no issues with adding cross realm BG's later in the game like it was done in retail.  I completely support that.
---
What I don't want, is for them to be immediately shoved in my face. 
---
The recent glorification of Alterac Valley is really bizarre. Long Alterac Valleys by those that actually experienced them are among the most hated thing in the history of WoW. 
---
I wana see this damn war everyone keeps talking about.
---
Sorry "mate".  We all know what's going on here.  It's elitest douchebaggary by you.  The end.  Now fuck off.
---
Launch day sharding is being considered to prevent long term underpopulation, not because they don't have the tech to support all the players. The vast majority of players who play on launch will be tourists who will quit after a week, in order to ensure that servers have a healthy population once the tourists leave blizz will have to set the server population caps crazy high on launch. Assuming a 90% drop off (which is an underestimate if anything) you'd need a population of 30k on launch for a 3k pop server long term.
---
These same conditions do not exist for the other scenarios you list. There will be no mass Exodus of players following the AQ launch which necessitates massively over-capping the server pop. Realm populations will have settled into relative equilibrium long before that point.
---
Time is the only important commodity for hard core raiders. Forcing them to invest 2 more hours a day away from farming their consumables is definitely meaningful. 
---
What about if you play on a populated pvp server and could get jumped at any time? 
---
These are awesome, thank you for the contribution!
---
Usually when you get jumped without realizing it, its against a rogue. 
---
VW is your anti-rogue pet. Sacrifice can keep you alive long enough to drop a fear
---
If my math is correct and if both factions have to collect copper, purple lotus, etc and it is not shared. You would need 555 bottomless bag (all slots including full bank(grants a total of 220 stacks per character)) Alliance characters or 610.5 mooncloth bag (all slots including full bank(grants a total of 200 stacks per character)) Alliance with nothing but the war effort items **AND** 320 bottomless bags (all slots including full bank(grants a total of 220 stacks per character)) Horde or 650 mooncloth bags (all slots including full bank(grants a total of 200 stacks per character)) Horde with nothing but war effort items. You a underestimating the shear amount of items that is needed. 
---
For there to be an episode of Fornite vs WoW kids there has to be some real world event or scenario to allow for the story, outside of core WoW fans nobody cares about Classic WoW, it has no special significance or cultural relevance in 2019, certainly not to the extent where a TV show is going to make an episode about it.
---
If WoW was still popular you could have kids vs their parents scenario, because that's how old WoW is, it'd be a 300 scenario, 300 men vs an army of thousands (of kids). It's never going to happen anyway, South Park make episodes on current events and cultural phenomenons.
---
Some guy did a massive study on which enchant was best, and I think the end result was... they're all kinda the same in the long-run. Also, Frostbrand did surprisingly well.
---
IMO the purpose of releasing Classic in phases is simply to slow the minmaxers down. If they released everything at once, they’d be farming low-level raids before the majority could get a pre-raid set ready.
---
For that reason, I’d see the majority of minmaxers staying on one server, because with six month release cycles, they will have completed everything and be geared up for the next raid. 
---
As for casuals, they really shouldn’t get too many choices where they’ll go. They won’t do the thorough research and they wind up on low pop servers with a diminished experience because of it.
---
I see what you’re thinking by staggering the content, but packing people into fewer servers is probably the best case scenario for players and Blizzard 
---
Like, i legit love the aesthetic of the place, and the music is great, but when i made my Tauren alt, i couldn't get out of that place fast enough. LOL
---
There were increased spawn rates for a period of time. I’m not sure how they are going to do it for classic though.
---
Been trying to remember, Im pretty sure PvP weekends were on a 4-week cycle, WSG, AV, AB and then a blank. I remember when EotS was released in BC, I thought that filled in the 4th week.
---
But Ive been playing on pservers so long that just do a 3-week cycle of WSG, AV, AB repeat that I cant really remember anymore.
---
So was it a 4-week or 3-week BG weekend cycle?
---
or they just make it so you cannot do characters on a faction that are at X% of the pop
---
But I definitely wouldn't say it is a difficult choice. I would say it is an inconvenient requirement. From my recent private server experiences as a warrior, your spec doesn't mean anything because its either the "correct" or a "meme" build. I am just glad people can't inspect talent trees. 
---
I think sadly, the "flavor of the patch" is something that comes from having more information. It will be in classic, it already is in classic and it hasn't even started. 
---
(all my opinion obviously)
---
Hell yeah it is!! It’s a tank. And you get it way before felstalker 
---
“Just make it so...” 
---
You say it like this is a solution. It’s not. This does nothing to balance a server. You’re not taking into account attrition rates or rerolling rates vs new subs. 
---
Not to mention how many folks don’t care about faction balance and would flood the forums with complaints that they can’t play the game on their realm because they’re horde only but have to make alts on Alliance because of these draconian faction balance rules. 
---
Sorry, I guess I wasn't talking about people racing to compete for like world firsts or higher ranks in pvp. I meant hardcore in the sense of people who had more free time than say someone like me who might get on for a few hours a night. 
---
No you're making up excuses because you know you're wrong and can't bare to own up to your ignorance, this has nothing to do with 'elitism' I'm a casual player giving you a reason not to overuse macros, which themselves are 'elite'
---
They removed portals?  What does that mean?  From dalaran to org etc?
---
Probably not, i kinda outgrew south park humor couple years not sure if its me age now that im 35
---
&gt; So you don't want crossrealm BGs until TBC? 
---
Not sure if you read Esfand's comment:
---
&gt; Staysafe brought up that it may eventually be a necessary evil in order  to allow for some servers to be able to do battlegrounds, (play the  game) and it's a fair point.
---
Then:
---
&gt; It's something that is likely a necessity for Arenas in Burning Crusade. 
---
He is saying that Staysafe suggested it may be necessary eventually, and that he thinks it will probably become a necessity when Arena's arrive.
---
What? You're wanting servers to be merged or grouped? 
---
I'm saying we should push blizz to not add in the cross realm bgs until phase 6, or even later, similar to how it actually happened. Even then, think of it this way. You're on a high pop server, such a high pop server that everyone on the server has queue times during peak. On this server, 70% are horde, and 30% are alliance. Think about how unfair it is for the alliance (even though they get instant bgs) that are sitting in these queues, due to the mass amount of horde players. So instead of this we could have a balancing queue, that lets more alliance in than horde down to like 60/40 or 55/45. It would reduce bg queue times for the overpopulated faction, and not kill the single server community. 
---
It just might suck for a little bit here and there during times at which the faction imbalance gets ridiculous. But this would also help the lesser faction stand a chance in killing world bosses as well. Fixing an imbalanced server isn't just about getting BG queue times down for the overpopulated side, but the lesser side also has HUGE negatives that effect everyone, even those that don't queue BGs out in the world. Have you ever tried to kill a world boss on a 70/30 server? You don't.
---
I'm just wanting blizz to think it through and not add in xrealm bgs from the start, but instead think of a balancing solution to the core problem. Xrealm BGs make the problem worse, not better.
---
They added a new portal room condensing a lot of portals around the capital cities, but they removed all of the portals from Legion Dalaran like how they did for Wrath Dal and Mists Valley. 
---
You think void walker would be better vs. Succubus? If you play horde I feel like succubus would be really useful against ganks. 
---
So much ally scum here. 
---
Agreed, I'm neutral on the implementation (but was still downvoted regardless, due to the awkward nochange guys) and wouldn't really care one way or the other. But I think if they're to come, gameplay needs to support them.
---
I’ll be that guy that comes swooping in to help murder this person. 
---
&gt; While leveling dungeons I feel we will be very flexible in finding groups, however I worry about still needing a dedicated healer. I played an alliance druid at launch into the mid thirties and was turned down often as a healer and people didn’t believe in druid tank either back then. I am hoping that a shaman/druid duo would be able to tank\heal all leveling content.
---
We'll be starting with the 1.12 balance patch so Druids will be really strong dungeon tanks. They will ship with their massive armor buff in bear form. Alot of people on pservers prefer tank Druids over Warriors now.
---
Shamans are in my personal opinion the best dungeon healers for Horde because their totems are so powerful if used right. They also prevent wipes because of Ankh, so they can self-rez and then rez the whole team.
---
Tip: Make sure you prefer Mages over any other DPS class when you are building dungeon groups. They are incredibly useful and straight forward dungeon damage dealers unlike for example Rogues or Hunters who require more finesse, plus Mages can decurse while the druid is tanking. If you already have a healer and tank you can pretty much *choose* which people to bring if you take a couple of minutes.
---
Another plus: You will both have travel froms that increase your movement speed pre-mount while questing.
---
&gt; What spec should the Shaman level if playing with a druid the entire way thru.
---
When duo questing the Shaman will not have to focus entirely on healing. But it is very efficient to first rush into Nature's Guidance in the Resto tree, while getting some healing talents along the way. After that it doesn't really matter. A mix of Elemetal and Restoration is recommended though as the Shaman will mostly want to wear caster gear.
---
&gt; How effective is shaman/druid as a roaming duo in BG's, seems WSG should be good combo with Shaman, how about AB\AV and WPvP?
---
Similar to Warriors, Shamans are vulnerable in solo situations, they just don't have the best tools for that. But they really excell at group PvP and Battlegrounds, because they can switch between healing, supporting and dealing burst damage from range. On top of that they have Purge which can shut down important support class mechanics, Earth Shock to fight casters and Frost Shock to fight melees.
---
Feral Druids are extremely powerful in solo pvp, I would say they are the best duelers in the game save for a full PvP specced Rogue who has all his big cooldowns up. Druids in group PvP/BGs are crowd control monsters and they have multiple ways to engage and disengage while switching into different froms. Feral Druids specifically are not the "charge the backline and fear everyone while critting someone to death" kind of guys like Warriors, but they are more about weaving in and out of combat, while switching between high value cooldowns of different forms. Also they are top tier flag carriers.
---
&gt; What type of stat gear should we focus on for druid/shaman while leveling.
---
Feral Druids scale best with Agility and Stamina and to a slightly lesser degree Strength and Attack Power. Intelligence/Spirit shouldn't be focussed on but are useful as well.
---
A Resto or Ele shaman should primarily focus on Intelligence and then later on spell crit, mp5, +healing/damage on spells.
---
&gt; I imagine most pulls will begin with the druid moonfiring a series of mobs, casting a regrowth and entering Bear form to tank. I anticipate the Shaman then dropping fire totems, spamming some AOE, melee'ing and tossing out heals when needed.
---
The Shaman usually drops totems before the pull and the Druid only pulls with Moonfire until he gets Faerie Fire. Fire Totems are usually avoided until mid-fight and placed in a way so they don't pull additional packs. Shamans or any Healer only use offensive tools, even melee/wanding, when the pulls are very small or the dungeon is generally easy. But the "correct"/save way for the healer to play is to precast a heal (Healing Wave) and canceling it (for example by making tiny movements) until the tank loses a significant amount of health.
---
&gt; If things get dicey the Shaman can drop grounding totem as the Druid peels off and heals himself and re-enters Bear.
---
I assume you meant Earthbind Totem to kite back mobs, which is a good tactic if you have a Mage/Warlock in your group.
---
Ultimately, the idea here is to let anyone at any given time join a fresh realm so you can have that 2005 experience, whether it's 2019 or 2029. Yet, land everyone in the same exact place long-term.
---
If this idea were adopted, I'd advocate Blizzard have less realms than otherwise. If there are \~200 retail WOW realms, I'd like to see Classic have 10-30 realms, each with 3 temporal dimensions and an eternal dimension.
---
Depends heavily on what you are doing... If you are grinding mobs between going from quest to quest well you can't do that while mounted, so you only really use it while running without grinding which isn't that often. If I recall correctly joana didn't have mount until like lvl44 when he did the world speed leveling record.
---
Not sure what you're getting at here.  
---
Yeah, you are right.  In a perfect world, we would have perfect server balance over time and it would never be implemented.  
---
Its not about it being a perfect system, or myself liking it, I do not innately like it, but I realize that it is what as referred to, as a "necessary evil"
---
People should worry less about circle jerking for and against people like like or hate and focus on getting actual changes we need for Classic release.   Like focusing on sharding, loot trading, content releases, etc.  
---
Blizzard has shown to be listening, with releasing 6 phases of content over time, instead of 4 and alluding to progressive itemization, etc.
---
You don't end up with a great end product, my trying to divide the community, by spreading falsified information.   Debates are welcome, but false narratives and straw man arguments are counterproductive and ultimately harmful.      
---
Welcome to the club!
---
Do you like doing BGs? Alliance typically have a higher presence on PvE realms due to Paladins and Salvation being so good for PvE content. But if you queue BGs, then being horde on a PvE server has a nice perk of low queue times.
---
You have to realize this was done at a static level with static spell ranks. There will be times levelling when a new rank of WF, FT, or RB comes available and supplants the previous weapon enhancement you were using. Also, this doesn't account for differences in armor of opposing mobs/players
---
I really appreciate the buzz words. Right up my ally.
---
Would you find an X day cool down on the respec give the same decision making process as the actual cost?
---
Not really the same scenario, clicking the wrong ability and dying doesn’t mean you need to make a ticket to complain to a GM about it. I just thought a small change to the UI would lessen the number of cases where mistakes were made. If the problem happens less, less tickets are needed, pretty simple stuff
---
Thanks I've had this since 2005 ah the memories totally looking forward to classic.
---
That's blatantly false. The most important thing in all aspects of the game is how much fun you're having. 
---
To prepare for MC are you supposed to be trying to stack fire resistance gear or following pre-raid BIS lists? What if you just collect Dungeon Set 1 or 2 gear, will that prepare you?
---
I’m so lost when it comes to gearing for raids.
---
And of course it will be. Any fuckwit can (and will) log in on day 1 just to experience a once-in-a-lifetime gaming event. Launch will have orders of magnitude more players than anything that happens later.
---
Not really. You could queue BGs on a specific 14k pop server for a while, and then go to BRM and find the exact guys you were literally just queueing against out there trying to world pvp.
---
&gt;	I think it’s pretty much guaranteed that we’ll see guild banks
---
Clearly, I mean, when someone makes absolutely no indication that they’re going to do something what they’re really saying is that it’s 100% going to happen. 
---
Oh yeah, absolutely; but aside from ranks, armor and resistance considerations, there's basically no reason to choose one enchant over the other in terms of DPS.
---
I never used Frostbrand because at the time I did a Shaman on a server, the conventional wisdom was FT with a fast weapon, or if you wanted to meme people in WPVP, WF with the biggest and slowest 2H you could get (I picked up the Cobalt Crusher for like 3g at level 29-30 and for ten levels, I was an RNG God), but it's interesting to note that at equal ranks it's competitive with the others, and the movement slow on it would actually be pretty useful in WPVP.
---
I’m educated though. Try acting tough to someone else who buys your shit. My point is that we now know what gear is best, unfortunately for melee dps that’s mostly leather. For healers that’s mostly cloth. I’m not saying you’re boring for going that route. I remember an old website that discussed the best Resto Druid build. It included the frickin’ hammer from Strat Live. But it looked like a fun build. Now every Druid will look like any old Priest: Robes of the Exalted with the Holy Shroud.
---
The only time you’ll actually use a 2h is Nightfall for Procs, and Sulfuras obviously. Most of the time they go to a Retardin, and Ashkandi probably goes to Huntards too. I reference Arcanite Reaper because it’s a pretty iconic 2h, but the stats are not great. It’s not worth the cost so we won’t see it much. I said ‘2h is mostly gone’ and that will probably stay true because dw is the best dmg. People will not use an Arcanite Reaper unless they’ve already decided to go for it.
---
My Frost argument was shitty, but it remains true that everyone will go Frost until AQ. But who can blame them? The game is designed that way. I guess my point is, the community will probably play a heavy factor in what people play as, but I hope I’m wrong, which I probably am.
---
Yeah I think you're looking at this all wrong. 
---
The large world events you talk about were meant to be mass raids of horde and alliance battling it out over certain targets and such.
---
Starter zone leveling was not meant for that in the slightest. They want you to level up not be stuck in a starter zone because you cant tag hogger faster than the other 500 people trying to do the quest. 
---
Me and my cousin will be grinding mobs in stv, swamp of sorrows etc the cats and dogs drop decent verndor drops and skinning adds to the profit not to mention mining and skinning. 
---
Playing mage if that matters.
---
9 I got it for 05 Christmas
---
Oh yes. I'm very excited too. I want to a second chance to do the things i didn't have the brain capacity for when i was a kid. I got to MC and Onyxia, but i was still such a wee noob. 
---
I play alliance on pve servers primarily because it's all my wife will play. It's fun in a character advancement way but not as fun as a pvp server for immersion. When your out in a zone and your enemy runs past you should be able too attack them. Your at war after all
---
If it's important enough to raise a ticket about it was important enough to actually pay attention to what you were doing. 
---
If it's not important enough to pay attention why are you wasting time raising a ticket?
---
DKP with only certain classes bidding on certain items for raid progression and /roll on pvp items.
---
Agree. I typically roll my eyes when people say "it's just nostalgia", but day long av's are the exception. It was cool the first time, but was unbearable everytime after that. If it was 2006 I'd recommend changes but it is what it is at this point and that's ok.  If they try to change it we'll get warfronts...
---
I would love to see added vanilla content with new raids and have some buffed gimp specs 
---
Hi, /u/knog96
---
What do you think of a queue type system that is implemented on the more populated faction once it reaches a threshold (like 60H/40A)? Once the threshold is hit, then a queue is added to the more populated faction, letting the lesser faction bypass it. This would kind of balance BG queues too, since it would work in a way to get the factions closer to 50/50, without hurting the lesser populated faction. It would also help in the whole PvE aspect of trying to kill world bosses. It's impossible to kill world bosses as the lesser faction on a highly imbalanced server.
---
Idk, I think something like that would work pretty well.
---
My dwarf paladin was called Stoutheart 
---
Alright dude whatever you say
---
&lt;3 you teebs! Keep up the good work mate.
---
Ironforge and stormwins are the only cities that has the bank, auction house, flight master and battlemasters all fairly close to each other. Landing in org or uc and then running for 5 minutes just to get to the battlemasters is shit.
---
At least you found the questlog.  My brother made it into the teens before he found out what a quest was.  Yep, straight grinding. 
---
It encourages people to pick one thing and focus on it. Each point you spend is a meaningful choice, and deciding to change from playing one way to another is a big decision. That’s just the nature of vanilla, even if it’s inconvenient. But you need to respec a lot of times for it to reach 50g, you can change your talents a few times before it truly becomes expensive. So you can switch from a leveling build to a raiding build easily when you hit 60 with almost no penalty (and you can respec again with the cost still being low)
---
These are actually very good, thanks for this. :)
---
Just follow a pre raid BiS list. The dungeon set gear is terrible because it doesn't have +spell damage.
---
No, you said it only affects Frost spells. You're wrong.
---
My guild awarded a point for each epic that a raider saw, and the cost of each epic was 40 points. Each class had an officer who coordinated loot during the run (interested parties sent tells to their officer who checked against their totals and sorted out cross-class items in officer chat). Whoever had the most points would win the item. Players far enough in the positive could also spend 80 points in a blind bid if they really wanted to win an item. 
---
The officers would decide who was eligible for items (classes/specs). If no one needed it for their raiding spec, an item would be opened up to others. Once content was on farm items that were used for PvP or screwing around could be bought with an epic shard instead of points if it would otherwise be disenchanted. 
---
When starting new content certain individuals were at times prioritized sending them into the negative despite competitors having more points. This was usually the main tank. It didn't cause issues that I remember, but you better be sure that individual isn't going anywhere.
---
I think every loot system and every guild comes down to the composition of the players. If they are mature and committed you're good to go. If they're coming and going and full of drama, the best system there is won't hold it together.
---
Not with that attitude, there won't be!
---
Like others are saying, it’s more fun if you don’t 
---
I could see them making a reference to Classic WoW in an episode about another topic. But they're not going to make an entire episode about it. They already did that. They need new material.
---
It would be like if they started killing Kenny in every episode again. They already did that years ago. That joke is played out. You have to move on to keep the audience's attention.
---
These are awesome, thank you!
---
i like making a character and going slow once in a while for an alt.
---
Teeeechnically... Spell pushback
---
Its as really tough situation. I feel like they need to come up with something as it would solve a lot of problems (might create some too)
---
I'm rolling on a straight up PvP server. But me and the buds always find time for a little RP here and there. Especially with random people out in the wild. It's always fun and gives us a few laughs, especially when someone plays along for a couple minutes.
---
I know what you mean back then I had no idea how big MC was and as we were talking a break I laid down in my bed and passed out, little did I know  ragnaros was next and I missed out on the kill. 
---
No solution is ever going to be perfect as long as separate servers exist with separate factions. Imbalance is literally what the game is built on. 
---
With BfA’s Warmode they’re transitioning to a more server-agnostic architecture where you hop in and out of shards based on faction balance, and that just might be the only viable solution that doesn’t require a complete restructuring of what WoW’s realm/faction mechanics are all about. 
---
That's a little overdramatic. 
---
Really great, thank you :) 
---
Thank you! I've been using the first pack you made as my rotatoing desktop wallpaper. I give it credit for getting my gf to start playing. She'd see the pics and say "ooh, that place looks cool."
---
so much lag!
---
I fully understand blizzards desire to use sharding for launch (note, i said UNDERSTAND).
---
So long as it remains true to what ion said at blizzcon i find that acceptable (no further then the end of elwynn/durotar/etc, and no longer then a few weeks).
---
But lord have mercy if we see sharding ruin tm vs ss world pvp, world bosses, high level material gathering and aq launch event. 
---
There's no way you're not trolling at this point, thanks for justifying my opinion that loot trading advocates are either ignorant or just trolling.
---
That WoW logo just reminds me of WoD and how Blizzard baited me into playing that trash. That was 100% their intent.
---
Psychologically, It certainly injects *cost* back into the mix -- but I think *'time cost'* is actually worse than *'gold cost'* from a practical perspective. 
---
Imagine a Warrior (let's call him Jeff) respecs to DPS for some PvP -- then the raid main tank calls in sick and they need him (Jeff) to tank. Jeff is screwed.
---
Or a guildie (Bob) respecs his priest alt to shadow, and then the guild is down a healer. Bob can't respec. Bob and the guild are screwed.
---
The guild would happily pay for the respec cost (generally speaking). So the gold cost makes a bit more sense -- to me at least.
---
10 years old, she’ll be fine 
---
Why can’t we have more content like this than the same 5 questions over and over again.
---
Thanks for putting in the work, they look great.

---
This is true...but also, earlier versions of wow had a way of either ostracizing shitty players or forcing them to convert. Sure, there were still plenty of asshats back then, but you had to find people who were willing to stick out long, unforgiving dungeons with you and if they were asshats, they were far less likely to get invited back and may eventually develop a server wide reputation for such.
---
I had way more friends in gaming back when it required time commitment and everyone actually wanted to learn how to play better...despite the few and far between asshats, which imo became far, far more common when they could hide behind game mechanics like LFR/LFG
---
Don't turn on pvp flag?
---
Troll.
---
I'd rather the server crash from instability than shard and take the MMO out of the game. 
---
Fornite was a phenomena they make episodes about massive trends. You are ignorant ¯\_(ツ)_/¯  
---
I can definitely agree with that point. I don't think there's an ideal system for everyone, just an ideal system for a specific guild.
---
I didn't even consider how DKP is allocated in my post, my guild gave 10dkp per most bosses (higher for Ony because some weren't showing up because of it not being "worth" due to the weird reset). That flat pricing system is interesting as well. Maybe I misunderstood but you could only bid 40 or 80? 
---
And blocked haha
---
Vanilla private servers
---
I believe generally every single server they have will be full and have queues. I doubt they start with too many servers opposed to too little. 
---
Depends what you want to do. I'll assume Feral DPS main with some off tanking as well.
---
Mining &amp; Skinning for leveling.
---
Send ALL mats to a bank alt while leveling. Save all cloth too. Set aside LW mats for [Wolfshead Helm](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8345) (BiS Feral helm for the entire expansion assuming you're powershifting).
---
At 60, drop skinning and level enchanting. Use your farmed skinning mats to get a LW to craft stuff you can D/E. Use your farmed cloth to do the same with a Tailor. A level 5 alt can learn both tailoring and LW to do the low level stuff for you. Get enchanting to 265 and get [Smoking Heart of the Mountain](https://classicdb.ch/?item=11811) (BiS tanking trinket until BWL).
---
Drop enchanting and level Engineering. Use your saved mining mats to level it up and go and farm the rest that you need, as you'll still have mining. Engineering is important for Feral DPS PvE and PvP for any class.
---
From here you can stick with Mining or drop it and level up Herb to supply your consumables for raiding. 
---
I used to always ask GM's for a lap dance before they left.
---
Exactly the first paragraph, that is what I understood at least from what they said at Blizzcon. But you bring up a good point --&gt; if their servers can actually handle it or not. I'm leaning toward it being the first option (quality of life change so hundreds of players aren't packed into starting areas) and not a problem with the tech, but we could be very wrong. 
---
That's why you don't play from a computer desk. I've been gaming from recliners since Molton Core. Currently in a La-Z-Boy electric recliner :) With a secondary 4k monitor that is connected to the PC, a TIVO, Roku, and 4k bluray.

My guild fell apart in vanilla and I controlled the guild bank. I was one of the only officers the guild master had quit wow all together abruptly.
---
I had a chunk of gold, some epic mats, consumables including flasks etc. Nothing crazy but probably say 2k gold worth of stuff back then (so nothing to sneeze at).
---
No one asked about it at first. After about a month I decided to keep the stuff / sell it/ give it to other friends (many of which from the original guild) etc. 
---
Like 3 months later someone from the fallen apart guild questioned me about it and I told them what happened. I was planning on offering him a hundred  gold or something because he was around for a long time and a dedicated raider but he absolutely lost his shit before I did. Told my new guild I ninja the guild bank and I was put on "suspension" while they investigated.
---
Did I do the best thing? Probably not. But I figured equitably distributing the bank would be very difficult / impossible and at the time no one was asking any questions. I did hook up quite a few core members from the guild but I probably made 800 gold and had some nice consumables. 
---
So yea, there was guild bank drama in vanilla. 
---
I feel like Bliz will do something like this - assuming Classic is successful. 
---
6months or so after release, the Classic Forums will just be hundreds of posts like "WHEN WILL WE GET NEW FRESH SERVERS".
---
And the posts will be right - 'Fresh' servers are loads of fun. And it's not *that* much work for blizzard to implement them, because they've literally already done it.
---
Then it's a matter of *how*...
---
Exactly what you're saying makes good sense - having server groups (you call them 'Dimensions', I'd call them 'Seasons') all ending in 'Pristine' realms (what you call 'eternal').
---
Let's say you have 3 realms (just as an example - obviously there will be more)
---
* [Blackhand PvE]
---
* [Illidan PvP]
---
* [Southshore RPPvP]
---
Once there is sufficient demand for "Season 2" to start, these servers get a "Season 1" tag. So then you have
---
* [Blackhand PvE] (Season 1)
---
* [Blackhand PvE] (Season 2) *NEW*
---
* [Illidan PvP] (Season 1)
---
* [Illidan PvP] (Season 2) *NEW*
---
* [Southshore RPPvP] (Season 1)
---
* [Southshore RPPvP] (Season 2) *NEW*
---
I would also like to see things like 'Server start date' and 'Current Patch' on the server list.
---
Then when hit 1.12 (or a few months after 1.12) they lose the season tag and fall into "(Pristine)"
---
The obvious caveat I can think of is names. You can't have a "Legolasxxx" on a Season 1 realm and a Season 2 realm -- because they'll both conflict when they merge into a Pristine. So bliz would need to have character enforcement cross-group.
---
Shit I did that same shit on my orc hunter when I first started. Never quested, because I was young and thought killing thing was fun, and I kept everything on hand for my pet. Even foods it couldn't eat. Kinda wish there was still pet happiness, but thank God ammo isn't a problem any more.
---
Yeah, don't. 
---
You can't dodge while casting :')
---
24 in 06
---
Did you do any without the logo?
---
Sharding should be in all zones level 1 to 20 (or 1 to 25 including Barrens for horde and Redridge for alliance and I believe by level 25 people level at such different speeds that it will be tolerable at that point 
---
Do your worst!
---
Perhaps.
---
People who say "facts and reason" are such losers. 
---
Excuse all of the normal people who aren't willing to sit through that neck beard podcast and take a post at face value. 
---
If it wasn't in vanilla, it shouldnt be in Classic.
---
When are people gonna understand this....
---
I'm going to rp as a redditor. 
---
Yeah I would also agree that it would be more of a cost than the gold. But suprisingly for a casual player it could debatably be less cost as they were not playing for x days anyway. 
---
Obviously not going to be implemented in classic wow. More or less figuring out if more or less they put thought into the Respec or just threw it inside there for the fold sink.
---
agreed with everything you said,  the last classicast was stupid also. 30 minutes discussing blue post about patch cycle and 2 hours talking about how great TBC was. . . 
---
They want TBC immediately after Naxx so they can keep their stream numbers going. It is unfortunate. 
---
If you didn’t vote for TB then you got it all wrong 
---
Darnassus, even though it is completely deserted, holds a special place in my heart. The first time I got here in my youth was so amazing, so wonderful. God, the music still gives me the chill and fills me with nostalgia (every night elf zone actually, teldrassil darkshore ashenvale etc... They still give me much emotions today)
---
Come to think of it, why is Org the main hub for horde?
---
I don't think it will be anywhere near as big as you think.
---
&gt;Maybe I misunderstood but you could only bid 40 or 80 (and the ties were whoever had highest total)?
---
Correct. You'd pretty much just say if you wanted the item. Whoever had the most points would win and it would cost them 40. If they had more than 80 points they could say they wanted to spend 80. If no one else wanted to spend 80 they would win for 80.
---
One thing I noticed was people came into the guild with different gear levels. This led to geared individuals always having a ton of points and would win whenever new items dropped. Other people would quickly go far into the negatives as they collect gear no one else needed, and so would never have points to get "new" gear--though they did get a lot of gear fast.
---
Also, at a certain point you have to stop charging and awarding points for old content (and ultimately stop running it as well).
---
Eh, maybe. Remember that Classic is most likely not going to have 10k player cap like recent mega-servers, and a lot of the "tourists" aren't going to make it past level 10, or at least, take much longer to hit level 10 than Vanilla players.
---
Mounting is actually worse than travel form unless you are riding on your mount for more than 21 sec, given the 3 second cast time.
---
The #1 reason extreme faction imbalance happened in vanilla retail is because blizz released dead on arrival servers a year into vanilla that nobody really cared about since nobody wanted to start over besides a few. Then those servers became insanely imbalanced population wise and were used as example why cross-realm was needed. 
---
Here is a solution. Don't release new servers a year into Classic release, and we will be fine. 
---
Alchemy doesn't make any money or benefit you personally very much from 1 to 59. Potions are easy enough to come across - tons of vendors sell them in a limited supply for only a few silver. I've always been able to keep a stack of health and mana pots on me no matter what my professions are.
---
Those professions take off once you're close to max level and you have access to the endgame herbs. For leveling and only leveling - you really can't go wrong with skinning and leatherworking. It helps you keep your gear up to date and gives you a great source of income that's independent from your server's economy. You can vendor all of the items you craft with leatherworking and make real money, while potions only vendor for a few silver at most.
---
I would only level with herb/alch if I knew that I wanted them as my endgame professions and if I absolutely did not want to change professions after hitting 60. It doesn't take long to level up new professions and I think the benefits outweigh the time invested, but if you're playing fairly casually then time might be a more valuable resource for you.
---
why is there no volume?
---
Which is huge running to new zones etc! 
---
I mean it's not the same thing but I've got the old classic box with manual, discs, etc. Also the boxes for TBC and Wrath. Can really see how much they skimped out on how much information and material was given with games later on in years haha.
---
It's pretty obvious it's the second reason.
---
Their modern servers can't handle loads of players in one place:
---
https://youtu.be/hQ8lsMZOu_E?t=120
---
The clouding tech is already there since they down ported from the modern client. They'd rather go down that route instead of addressing server stability issues for Classic. They're all about cutting costs now.
---
Tell us how you really feel
---
Who hurt you?
---
Depends on the way you word it. If you just say it's not accurate, people will accept it. If you're an asshole about it and you go on a tirade about how private servers are nothing like vanilla and private server hero min-maxers will be BTFO in Classic then yeah, people will take an issue with it.
---
Love these!
---
Also I just confirmed that Gnomeregan still gives me PTSD
---
I've been in guilds with every system, from TBC to Cata, and I prefer blind bid DKP to all others. Whisper your bids to the loot officer, and the highest bidder pays the next highest bid plus 1. Simple.
---
Hi, /u/Mr-Miggs
---
Why though? You're missing out on all the fun!
---
I honestly think the only people that will be RPing in the sense many players on RP servers think of the hobby as will be those that vastly prefer the lore of classic to that of retail. Like you said, retail has higher res models, more robust addon support, much more transmog opportunity, more areas in the world to RP in (And easier access TO those areas), more support for varied character concepts, and so on. I cannot think of a reason why someone  that's into the traditionally guild-based or walk-up in a capital city style of RP would prefer classic over retail.
---
Succubus charm is really hard to micromanage.
---
Those pvp montages make it look easy, but when shit hits the fan, and you don't know wtf to do, a bubble is going to feel alot more useful than a charm.
---
Okay, it's a smug view point that implies everything you say is inherently correct and anyone who has a brain will come to the same conclusion. Except it's the bitchboy passive aggressive version. 
---
Redditors love to bust it out in nonsensical situations too, like this one. As if listening to their podcast is using logic and reason. God, it was difficult for me just to type that out. 
---
That's how I really feel. 
---
I'm an "if it's red it's dead" player and I always prefer a fair fight. Sometimes I'll even wait for an enemy to finish with their mob before engaging.
---
When do you need resistance gear? I know that’s a thing.
---
Omg I bet NOBODY will RP oh mannnnnnnnn.  
---

Tips here, talking about sharding. 
---
Good, get it all out. When you're ready we can talk about how it's fine to sling mud at people because you can't be arsed to verify the false claims about them
---
Anyone caught without the WoW Atlas book though...filthy casuals amirite?
---
Classic WoW.
---
If you used logic and reason you'd realize this thread is barely about them at all rather than the merits of the view point in the first place. 
---
Trust me, I don't give a shit if you want to be a douche on the internet. I like to do it myself. Just have the self respect to drop the price to aggressive nonsense. 
---
Level 30? Nah. The elite quests in Redridge. Suckers. 
---
WoW is not popular enough for South Park anymore 
---
Fresh start realms should not be a thing until after Naxx patch. Force new players to catch up using DM and ZG, dont ruin the server stability by making casual players think they'd be better off rerolling every year.
---
This is retarded
---
I wonder if you looked around for 2 seconds before replying, if you could figure that out.  
---
See you can't even argue your point. 
---
If it's worth wasting customer service time and waiting 4-5 to get your item then it's worth spending that extra half a second to click the right button in the first place. 
---
The only argument for loot trading seems to be that something worth waiting a week for is not worth paying attention to in the first place. . 
---
If people know there is a fresh realm launch in 5 months, they will spend that 5 months second guessing themselves on where to play rather than just playing. Watched it happen on the past three major private servers to launch. If there had only been one, people would be a lot happier.
---
&gt; Any thoughts on the carebear PvE server life?  
---
Yes, these are my thoughts:  
---
Pvp servers are the only complete WoW experience.  
---
Very cool! 
---
Moving the logo to a corner would help with those shots that have a very important focal piece in the middle, like Uther's Tomb. 
---
Would be interested in this too
---
bracketed bg's was a vanilla thing anyways what does it matter???  It's a necessary evil and was deemed as such in "Vanilla"  I was there and I know first hand.  It was necessary.
---
Neat, thanks for this!
---
Nochangers already lost and are a minority.
---
it might be best to give you an example. let's say you roll on a rp server and make a human paladin named... john. you decide on a backstory for john - maybe he was born in westfall and seeing his beloved homeland fall into ruin roused him into action, so now he's a good boy who wants to help people? or maybe he's just a stormwind city boy and is a paladin because he was brought up to love the light, whatever. some people go really in-depth with their characters, some just stick to really standard archetypes, there's no wrong way to do it. 
---
okay, you got your character? now you could say, go to the blue recluse in stormwind. write about john getting a drink or two, maybe have him strike up a conversation with one of the other bar patrons.
---
it's a really common misconception that when you play on a rp server you have to be ''in character'' all the time. not true. newer rpers might not do this, but it's common practice to download a roleplay addon, which lets you make a profile visible to everyone else with the addon, and allows you to set yourself as ''out of character'', meaning anything you do or say does not actually represent the feelings and actions of john, so you're basically just playing the game as normal. and then you mark ''in character'' when you feel like rping! if you need to say something ooc, you can put ((brackets)) around it, and some chat channels like world defense, trade, general, ect are usually out of character no matter what.
---
if you rolled on a rp server you would probably see more players with lore-abiding names like john instead of holysheetz or whatever. not always, but usually. you'd see more players milling about in the major cities and out in the world, talking and interacting with one another as if they were actual denizens of azeroth. people say that players are kinder and more mature on rp servers, but i can't really confirm or deny this because aside from dorthnale and a brief stint at the beginning of my wow journey i only ever play on rp servers.
---
one of my favorite rp stories is the time when i, a young lad of about twelve years old, was just plugging along through the cataclysm leveling experience. getting pretty bored of it by this point, i climbed to the mast atop the ship sticking out of booty bay and, on my goblin hunter, declared that i was bankrupt and had given up on life. before i could make the five feet plunge to the watery depths beneath me, two goblins rushed out to stop me.
---
one of them was The Boss. what he was The Boss of, i do not know. the other one was his lackey. they took me under their wing, both in and out of character. oocly they showed me how to really get into the swing of wow roleplay, icly my goblin also began working for The Boss and Doing Crime. we had a whole arc where we decided the lackey was my goblin's brother and that he would have to come to terms with the fact that my goblin was deeply, madly in love with The Boss, who by all accounts seemed to be using them to kidnap blood elves to sell as snacks to hungry forsaken. we eventually parted ways but that was a wild ride i will not forget
---
side note - it's fine to join a rp server even if you don't rp! the immersion is still great and if you ever do decide to jump in, there will be kind people who can help you get the hang of things
---
Imaging having HoJ drop and everyone roll need just to sell it to the highest bidder in the group. It's ridiculous. These things will happen.
---
Correct, it's a logical inference considering they put loot trading in for a similar reason - less GM interaction required.
---
I'm looking forward to the simplicity of Vanilla RP. Can you imagine, genuine Horde RP without a million obnoxious blood elves?
---
I was 15
---
I've seen numerous people comment that this is indeed the case, and even more so that blizz is keeping it tightly under wraps.  It might not make for a bad classic situation in the end, but large scale events were huge in vanilla, and will likely be even more prevalent in today's connected world.
---
I fully expect to see videos of large group pvp events get sharded, and simply don't plan on playing until I've seen otherwise.  This is a fairly big deal for a lot of players.
---
I just wish it wasnt so steep (50g maxed). I love playing all aspects of the game, and I know I'll just be broke respecing because I legitimately enjoy everything, and I'm likely going to be respecing a lot.
---
In Wotlk, my mate and I would be grinding arena right up until raid time, and then we'd just jump right into whatever raid we were farming at the time. Dual spec allowed this playstyle that we both thoroughly enjoyed.
---
I'm definitely on board with #nochanges as much as possible, but part of me gets a little dejected knowing we wont have the good features that were introduced in tbc and wotlk. I guess it's sort of a natural reaction to knowing what we know with hindsight.
---
Look great, any chance of 2560x1440?
---
Great zone!!!
---
*"DAE not like sharding/loot sharing??1!@"*
---
Can druids even use bombs and such in forms? Could be an issue like with the potions.
---
Well it is official.
---
With a fresh start available every year on a schedule and everyone ending up in the same place regardless, it actually reduces fomo for those playing on non-fresh. 
---
Also, if you’re a non-casual player, you’d purposefully avoid fresh so you’re not disadvantaged by being capped waiting for higher level content for months or years.
---
As a mage you won't need resistance gear until Sapphiron in Naxx. Back in vanilla people used resistance gear because they didn't know better, but now it's known that using resistance gear on non-tanks lowers DPS by more than it saves healer mana, making healers end up using more mana since the fight takes longer.
---
Lost...as in..Blizzard doing everything they can to recreate classic as it was in Vanilla? This comment confuses me
---
just want to jump in and give a quick run-down because these terms can be confusing, let me know if i've got anything wrong here:
---
POWER GAMING: focusing exclusively on the strength of your character and ignoring all other aspects + trying to lord that over people. it's fine to have a strong character, just remember that even the strongest people irl still have goals, wants and fears, and a personality that doesn't revolve around their muscles.
---
GOD-MODDING: controlling somebody else's character. eg; if your character was attempting to murder somebody else's, you don't say ''character A stabbed character B in the heart killing them instantly'' you would say ''character A lunged at character B with the knife, striking at their heart'' or something but probably written better
---
MARY SUE: a character with no flaws OR a character with flaws that are not treated as flaws (she's really clumsy but everyone thinks it's super cute) OR flaws that would never realistically come up (she's perfect in every way except for being unable to ride a horse... she's an orc living in durotar)
---
METAGAMING: to give your character knowledge they shouldn't have. eg if this person's rp profile goes into their backstory and talks about their dead parents, your character shouldn't know about that unless they're told about it.
---
agree with finding a mentor and/or marking yourself as a newbie! you'll probably get lots of people to help you out
---
As far as I remember, they can't. Ferals should also generally assume you CAN'T use most things in forms during vanilla. They start fixing this in TBC, but it probably isn't fulled addressed until Wrath.
---
People breaking the tos is the account security issue. It isn't fair or reasonable to imply the reason is because of guild banks or lack of. 
---
Classic Wow. If (big if!) they release TBC, it’ll be Classic WoW: TBC
---
One night I fell asleep to an Elwynn Forest ambience and music video on YouTube. I had a terrible nightmare, and woke up to find that YouTube autoplayed the Duskwood ambience and music.  
---
Ahh so you want the perks of playing on a low pop server while also having the perks of players on a higher pop for pvp... how convenient for you 
---
Mmm. Yeah. I am the ignorant one. Not the guy who posted a blue post from 3.2 and thought it was relevant to the discussion. That was not ignorant at all. That guy is clearly on top of all the relevant facts and is civil to boot.
---
Reasons Teebs is the best. 
---
Would never use anything else.
---
Then don’t play on a low pop server? 
---
RPers disproportionately enjoy looking 'good' so I'd expect it to be a similar situation to retail Moon Guard. 80% Alliance to 20% Horde. I'm sure there will be classic Horde RP just.. Not so much of it.
---
There's a very good reason the servers can't handle many players in one area without sharding, which I genuinely believe will be "fixed" so I'm not too worried.
---
I can't remember where I read this, so I can't dig up a source, but anyway, the reason for the all the lag and instability with many players has to do with character location precision. The way retail works, the precision is much finer, so there's more work being done behind the scene which causes the lag. In Classic and on private servers, the precision is set much lower, so there's less work. This is as "ELI5" as I can explain it, but that's the gist of it. 
---
Now, as I said, I can't provide a source, so feel free to call bullshit, because it might very well be.
---
That was part of the fun in Elysium launch, more players = more fun. Once in a lifetime event is getting robbed from us. 
---
Correct! So very common pre-pull to hear the raid leader shout, "shields on tank!" ) for heavy hitting mobs. This is usually to allow the tank to get in a couple hits for threat before the aggro-generating fat heals go off.
---
I’d be much happier with this version.
---
Ah yes, the old blame the customers for using the game systems wrong because you didn't provide basic features. That always works so well.
---
What if both versions were available to choose from the battlemaster?
---
Fire res is more for tanks. You need hardly any in MC (but 1-2 FR) is recommended for average raider
---
I understood your position on a certain level (that was my answer to the loot trading issue before hearing about this idea).
---
Why not let the master looter get the item back if it was assigned to the wrong person? I dont see any drawback. 
---
There will be faction imbalance and dead servers. people will come to visit early on then leave when they are bored. people will flood one faction on big influencers servers causing massive imbalance. It existed then outside of "DOA" servers... It will exist again.
---
They are all the same reason. They need to have both (a) a good experience at launch not ruined by overcrowding and (b) a good experience the month after launch not ruined by empty servers.
---
Argument from incredulity. "I can't understand it, so it can't be true."
---
For a second I thought "what the hell is the Temple of Atal'Hakkar?" and then I remembered that that place wasn't actually called Sunken Temple.
---
I don’t want to play on a low pop server. 
---
The only times we allowed "PUG"ed mc. It was our second/alt raid and we couldn't always get enough guildies / alts friends. 
---
Our rule was that everything was /roll if someone needed it for an upgrade. Except for bindings or eyes. 
---
Spend All DKP. In this variant if you get an item it always costs all your DKP. When more then one person wants an item whoever has the most DKP wins. This stops older members from horeing points  and getting everything first yet still rewards the people who show up the most.
---
Dun Morogh for me
---
Just make it so the master looter has to assign the item again and its public. Could put a short time limit on it so it's not abused after the raid. 
---
why would you link an alliance video. there are bloodelfs because i changed my patch mpq file to show orcs ass bloodelfs. its the vanilla form of tmorph. and yes i had rec. its not a rar hefty-dps phase. this is how it looks on any cleave boss in mc. without rec i do 800+ btw
---
Vanilla apologists with 200 IQ arguing that 50g respec cost is great to fight gold inflation and make each character unique. In practice it doesn't really do either. In fact it discourages people from experimenting with builds and forces you to grind extra 100g on top of all the consumables for PvPers that want to do BGs.
---
/signed 100% agree
---
Except that battle masters existed in 1.12 which is the version of wow Blizzard is using. Because they believe it to be the best version of classic wow. If you accept this logic. Then X-Realm battle groups. Fit right in with logic of #nochanges. 
---
You truly need 200iq to come up with point 2. Might happen in dungeons, but it will never happen in raids.
---
This is very nice. I love these. 
---
There is no such thing as character identity past your name, race and class.
---
Talents, itemization, release schedule, loot trading, sharding, right click reporting, different client with different addon potential, etc. They aren't doing everything they can. Guild banks will be in.
---
Thunder bluff is far superior in almost every respect.  I'm normally alliance but tb is the best city.  Bank and ah are super close with flight path right there as well, and as a bonus the forge too.  The layout is intimidating but most of the profession hubs are central rather than on the annoying islands.  The battle master is a bit apart but the bridge is actually convenient to the bank, far more convenient than org or sw especially.  Plus the place is just peaceful and pastoral.  On the other hand, Orgrim and uc are hectic and unpleasant, with tons of clutter and jarring color schemes.  It sucks that tb loses just because it has no zeppelin.  
---
Stormwind is pleasant and sensible but far too spread out, and the canals make auto running a bad idea. Ironforge is thematically interesting and easily navigable but still big enough to be inconvenient.  Particularly since the fp is a decent hike from the bank, although it is overall central which is nice.  We don't even talk about Darnassus.  It's pretty but that's the end of it.  Seriously, off in a far corner of an already backwater continent, it's 90% empty space and you need to walk, teleport, walk again just to get to a hippogriff which is automatically 3 flight paths from anywhere anyone over level 20 would want to go.  Or you can walk, teleport, walk, fly, and then long walk up the dock to get back to the good continent if you don't feel like taking 2 consecutive boats instead.  The only good thing about Darnassus is that there isn't a Trogg filled tunnel separating it from the starter zone if you decide to roll your bank alt there.
---
-Citation on no beta if any being planned
---
-I don't require any type of educated guess on if it's possible or not because I didn't make a truth claim like you did.
---
-Making classic wow comes with risks, this being a risk isn't any different.
---
Gold sink that only fucks over only certain classes and PvPers.
---
&gt; Also people aren't talking about Chuck Norris or whatever in general chat as much
---
Did you know, when Chuck Norris does pushups, he's actually just pushing the world down.
---
Deadmines is actually the worst for this if you ask me.  Everyone knows the path now but if it weren't a lvl 18 zone that everyone has run many times, it would be just like ST and the run up to the portal would claim many groups.
---
It doesn’t take the mmo out of the game, this argument is so fucking retarded.
---
You will still be competing with people for mobs, zones will still have people all over them it’s just you’re fighting g 10-20 people to take each mob and not 100-200.
---
I’d rather not play at all than play a server that crashes every 20 mins and has 200 people in goldshire abbey fighting to tag kobalds, it’s not fun, there is no community built there, just a lot of pissed off people.
---
Hi, /u/The-good-twin
---
&gt; The Ahn'Qiraj gate opening event will be the big test for Blizzard on this topic.
---
I see folks saying this, but will it really? I imagine launch will be worse. On my server the AQ event **lagged and crashed the whole damn servers for what seemed like hours**. Thats a pretty freaking low bar they have to clear to match that....
---
Just saying. It feels like we are all pretending city raids in classic didnt crash and lag out like crazy to when we know damn well they did.
---
It breaks when you hit in combat, at least on private servers.
---
People leaving the current server for fresh is the problem.
---
It's largely used to fix the melee range issue for combat forms.
---
Who cares? Does your dick get hard every time they add something that wasn’t in before? I could care less as long as it’s not game breaking like xrbgs or permanent sharding. That wouldn’t be classic, it would be World of Warcraft 2. But, what I’m trying to understand is why you’re so proud of every little change? People fought for a classic version, it’s here, and people like you rub dumb shit like this in their face as if you’re the one inputting the code. Its kind of pathetic. 
---
There is like 3-4 threads a week on this go read those rather than have people anwser the same question for the 50th time.
---
I second Warlock, and suggest playing priest yourself.  It's a godly duo for leveling and world PvP, and asking her to play the healer is kind of a shitty way to try and get her excited about the game.  You should be the one escorting her.  Heal until 40 and then go shadow.
---
If you want to play something else, save it for when you play alone, but you will probably be surprised just how fun it is playing a priest if you don't already know. You can pick up tailoring and enchanting to help her gear up, and she will also appreciate the free mount. 
---
I think a sign of a healthy guild is when you have a raid lead who's chill 99% of the time, he finally blows, and the guild as a whole goes "We done fucked up" and knows to fix their shit.
---
Stone Talon's out for me because of the giant lime green spiders. Giant lime green spiders actually ruin a lot of areas for me. Otherwise I'd be chillin in Arathi or something.
---
Yeah man pure unsupported speculation about the intentions of the dev's is a topic which will lead to a lot of reasoned discussion.
---
The Wolfshead Helm doesn't stack with Furor, and is outclassed by a few things at 50+.
---
Then you wont have an issue bgs 
---
Super interesting post. Great read. Very good to have the community discuss cross realm bgs vs non cross realm. I really like your viewpoint in this and fuck all the people getting upset I think this is a great post for the community. 
---
Must be nice to have the hindsight to choose a server that you know for sure won’t be low pop and won’t die off. 
---
How does the changes to gear drops in the new six phase content plan change pre MC BIS lists?
---
But why was she the thumbnail? Surely Mr T should have been. 
---
Well done you managed to sperg out over an even and completely ignore the question.
---
Truly outstanding 
---
This is perfect. The Virgin vs Chad format is so good.
---
This is great, but do you have these images in 1440p? I'd really like to use these.
---
I’m 100% for them, without it queues take forever and chances of getting a BG at 4 in the morning are almost none existent.
---
I just have a positive mindset if there are realms that are that low and your bg queues get to an unbearable point that Blizzard will allow transfers or merges. 
---
I honestly wouldn't worry too much about that. As far as my pserver experience as a mage, yes there are plenty of mages around but we are in high demand for end game content. The only real downside to a high mage population is competition on drops
---
Going of current wow I’m choosing not to get my hopes up. It’s been quite a long time since blizzard has offered us such a free service. 
---
In what universe is Undercity easy to navigate. 
---
Like he free game they’re giving us in a few months?
---
I think having a big, open flat place to duel easily actually has a lot to do with it. 
---
Pro tip: you can skip the cactus apple quest. 
---
Absolute quality
---
Also healing is one of the more difficult concepts of vanilla. Too many people don't understand spell downtiering and mana consumption.
---
Saved! Subscribed! 
---
This looks awesome!
---
What is the next dungeon you will do? 
---
Hard in the sense that mana empties out FAST. As a fresh 60 you’ll feel like you can get 10ish wimpy max rank chain heals and be oom. The progression can really be felt however as your rank 1 chain heal and rank 4 healing wave grow in worth as you stack heal/mp5. But you’ll never get to a point where you can “heal forever” like you could in tbc onward.
---
Putting tanks aside since they're the ones needing full sets of fire resist gear and stuff for Rag.
---
1-2 pieces of fire resist can be neat for Vael, but you should be grabbing the UBRS buff which is more than enough.
---
Melees/hunters need nature resist for Huhuran in AQ40, as you need 15 people to soak up the huge nature damage that constantly goes out when she hits 30%. Healers/casters don't need any. 
---
You want a lot of frost resist for Sapphiron for everyone in the raid because of how much frost damage goes out throughout the long-ass fight.
---
I asked this question and it got banned....
---
My War buddy in Vanilla always said the way tell the noob priests from the pros was noobs cast shield and pros cast renew.
---
I can't help but think that the issue might be more than what people are expecting...instead of 800+ we are looking at a possible percentage of WoW players that have ever played WoW from any generation of the game going into Classic. Even if we were super super generous and only count for the 100 million accounts created announced in 2014, and again generously say that only 1% of players are going to be playing-1 million players. Split between lets say 50 servers (I don't know how many they will have, but I bet it will be closer to 30) 20,000 per server. Even if only the top 1% of the server show up for the event, the event would be twice as strenuous as the original event was on their servers. Not only that, but the size of the event would have to reflect the increased number of players. 
---
That, or they might be able to shard the event "slightly" making each shard roughly the size of the original event, maintaining awesomeness while not bogging down the servers too insanely hard.
---
25g max was really nice on private servers.
---
Not really the place to be asking this, try /r/stocks or /r/investing, but I'll bite.
---
ATVI seems to be showing buy signals after it lost 50% in 6 months. Piper Jaffray recently showed optimism for the stock and put a price target of $52, saying that the refocus on key franchises and E3 announcements around a mobile take on Call of Duty are great signs for 2019/20.
---
My personal opinion on ATVI is skeptical at best, I don't believe in the company any more. Oldschool staff have been leaving in droves, I feel like they haven't got a solid franchise for the future. I don't see Call of Duty competing with the likes of Apex &amp; Fortnite. I don't see Destiny 3 being that stellar, nor do I see any future Starcraft or Warcraft game being a big hit either. Diablo Immortal is an unseen variable, it could be ludicrously popular and boost ATVI into unseen heights, or it could be a total flop in the already saturated mobile market.
---
Male Night Elf Priest is the ultimate Chad. 
---
Probably. Pretty sure I've still got mine all the way up to Cata stored at my mother's though so who knows, assume that's when digital purchase became available. Wouldn't bother posting them though, personally, because fuck going in the loft to find them!

That's amazing!
---
Actually one of the worst things to do is put a renew on a warrior prior to a pull. If the warrior pulls with that HoT up, you’ll get aggro fast. Best thing to do is let the tank pull, use cheap heals as possible with cast times, don’t bubble unless the tanks in danger and you need to buy time to cast a big heal. You can put a renew on after the tank establishes threat, but generally it’s not a good spell and is just meant to keep damage from getting too spikey. Bubble is expensive, renew is kinda week. Focus on mostly using downrank heal. 
---
Every Retail player will get free access to Classic and there will be tons of players resubbing to try it. We are talking about millions of players logging in on day 1.
---
I'm starting to think that the game would be much better off with slight sharding. Nothing too crazy...definitely a much much higher number than 100, but at least something that maintains some semblance of normalized latency. Hell, I wouldn't mind if they made an item specifically designed to show your shard and allow a shard swap (thinking along the lines of the hearthstone, long cooldown, long cast time, instantly cancelled when attacked to stop fleeing pvp). I think the real problem exists when people don't know they are sharded, or are unaware of what triggers the shards/how to work around it.
---
I’d love to live in Lor’Danel in Darkshore, where I’ve got a place to fish as well as a forest right behind me. Lots of potential, and I’m into the dark aesthetic. 
---
Dwarf priest would have been the virin imo.
---
Ignore resistances until Sapphiron, second to last boss in Naxxramas.
---
For preparing for raids, there are a bunch of lists floating around. bonus frost damage, bonus spell hit and bonus spell crit being the stats to go for. The dungeon sets are generally sub-par except for a select few items spread across all the classes. Hunter being the major exception, 4 piece bonus granting +40 attack power.

Heres the real problems with AV 1.12
---
1. I havent heard ANYONE say they actually like playing 1.12 AV. I hear, "I like getting my rewards fast and never playing it again" as the only argument FOR it. Instant gratification rewards is a big factor people are trying to get away from with Classic, this is a really bad argument to make to keep it 1.12. Finishing something as fast as possible so you dont have to do it anymore isnt liking something, thats retail level of design.
---
2. Tying into my first point, the Honor and Rep rewards are broken for AV 1.12. The bonus honor and rep were designed around the long games of previous patches. The rep rewards were pretty well balanced when compared to WSG and AB in terms of time spent. In 1.12, its completely broken, as well as getting tons of bonus honor for quick victories.
---
3. The PvE race. This is really what broke AV. You might not have liked the big push fests, fine, but do you REALLY like just running to the end, killing a few elites and one boss? Do you think that qualifies as a PvP battleground?
---
4. Some people actually do like old AV, as opposed to just about no one for 1.12 AV. I certainly wouldnt say I would sit in there all day, but it was a nice change of pace sometimes, it was different, it added variety to the type of PvP you did. 40v40 raids, while not the most exciting, had different dynamics and tactics to it. Since playing on pservers, I get exalted and never go back myself, in old AV, I would be in and out occasionally for fun.
---
Whether you want an old AV version or not, the fact is that 1.12 AV is broken as hell. They either need to make a rebalance, nerf the rep/honor bonuses (which im sure would induce the most whining of all) or rollback to an old version.
---
I also really dont accept this argument of #somechanges, when all of vanilla was vanilla, not just 1.12. Did anyone ask Blizz to make 1.12 client and nothing else? No, people asked for vanilla in general, which is very broad in terms of patch changes. Id be much happier with 1.11 rather than 1.12, Im sure there would be a lot of people happy with a pre-BG patch, but whats happening is trying to come to a consensus as to what would make the best version of classic possible, rather than just 1.12 or nothing else.
---
No he's visa le I believe when alive also. It's the MC attunement quest I think? 
---
It was in classic and still is in current retail. 
---
It would be even funnier if they just remade the original episode but with just slightly updated graphics in game/of the characters of the show. Everything the same.
---
im gonna play full plate paladin and nobody is gonna stop me
---
Maybe they changed it since I tested it there, but for a while one of them had 1.12 talents and balance while allowing the pre-nerf shadowmeld.
---
Same one that had pre-nerf Lupos (which they will change if they have not already), which is also definitely not 1.12 either.
---
Ashenvale ❤️
---
I'm gonna be a Ret Paladin and raid, no one will stop me damn it.
---
I dont think it will be a (bad) problem, not until lvl 60 dungeons and people working for prebis. Same it wont be a problem for guilds that can muster up raids. 
---
Im afraid the 60 dungeons turn to gdkp loot rules.
---
I don't get this one. 
---
The priest one I got but this one is confusing.
---
Orcs look badass and have an OP PvP racial.
---
If we were min and maxing. It would be gnome over orc.
---
Duskwood 
---
i lol'd but true haha
---
Fair enough haha
---
What the graph doesn't show is the time the tester took to measure each weapon buff.
---
If you were to hit a single target with somewhere around medium armor for more than 5 mins, sure you could say they are pretty close in average dps on such a big chunk of time ( given same rank ).
---
But once you factor in mob to mob this process is altered because you don't really care about the overall dps for extended fights , you only care about the first 10-20 secs because anymore than that is basically downtime.
---
WF procs are great on some mobs sure , you can delete the mobs in 2-5 secs ! so WF must obviously be the best choice right? that's unfortunately not the case, the proc can occur at any point during the fight meaning that you could be swinging that 2H for 20 secs straight without a proc but only proccing at the last 1% hp the mob has, basically wasting the damage, you could also go on unlucky streaks where you'd not get a single proc on 2-3 mobs in a row basically forcing you to waste more mana healing yourself up and wasting more of your time when your primary focus should be on efficiency first.
---
Then you have the issue with armor, hitting a low - medium mob is fine for WF but once you start attacking heavy armored mobs your damage is reduced a lot.
---
Flametongue is consistent , does the same damage regardless of armor type and procs everytime you swing, it is obviously the most boring buff because there isn't anything interesting proccing every once in a while , but then again consistency is a staple for efficiency , if your goal is to minimize downtime you should run with FT.
---
Hi mate, is it possible to get those wallpapers without the wow classic logo in the middle? Thank you for your hard work they look amazing.
---
Engineering isn't expensive to level up to 300. You typically do it twice (gnomish and then goblin). I always keep herbs because the amount of consumes I use in any spec is a lot.
---
I recommend making a lvl 35 alt with alchemy and lw.
---
While closeness is nice, you've got to remember the tram system exists. While I hope IF becomes the capital due to how awesomely laid out it is, Stormwind was the hub for so long, a good chunk of people will likely stay there from the start. With the tram system allowing fairly quick movement between areas, there isn't all that much downside either. 5-10 minutes tram system means nothing compared to the hour or more it will likely take some groups to find a full set of members. Each member will likely have plenty of time to get in position before they find the last man for the group.
---
Assuming that blizz is using kubernetes to do container orchestration in their sharding implementation, I have hopes its just a matter of memory and cpu limits on those resources. Read more here https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/kubernetes-best-practices-resource-requests-and-limits.
---
Kubwenetes is probably how most online games do it nowadays, especially battle royal games that need near unlimited scale and performance to boot. I'm personally not too concerned about blizz getting this wrong in classic, they could probably run these containers on bare metal if they really need to be close as possible to those old server blades.
---
A nice apartment in the Mage Quarter in SW.
---
Don’t listen to anyone else, it was glorious.  Imagine both sides rushing the middle graveyard on top of the hill to fight for Korrak at the beginning of the match.  This was the only way to get your ice barbed spear / crossbow.  
---
40 people on both sides knowing each graveyard, tower, and choke point was a mandatory part of winning the match.  It was extremely hard to Zerg your way to the end without taking over each point along the way.
---
Battles lasted days, just like real life.  Summoning the faction bosses was an event, each one needed ten people to meet up and perform the ritual (this turned into a PvP skirmish as well).  
---
There were long quests to capture rams/wolfs to summon a band of riders to charge the enemy along side of you.  Many matches needed the coordinated attacks of both the wolf/ram riders and faction bosses to be summoned at the same time to make the final push to the enemy base.
---
My favorite moments were laying traps down and setting my hunter up in one of the tower bases sniping incoming attackers.  It felt like you were in Saving Private Ryan.  
---
OR, they will just remove most of the NPCs and make it a 15 minute match where everyone zergs from start to finish without PvPing at all.  I prefer the war.
---
Huh. I didn’t really remember anything about AV being redone, but I knew it felt different on private server. I assumed it was just the people, but it looks like they basically removed the PvE elements and just made it a race? That’s weak as hell. I used to actually enjoy AV because it was the one form of PvP a Prot Warrior excelled. I seriously hope it goes back to an earlier version. 
---
They disappear 15-30 mins after you log out from what I remember
---
I don't recall the patches very well, but the best version of AV in terms of game play enjoyment was definitely in the middle somewhere.  I remember during the time when AV's were still viewed as to long to be profitable normally, a guild on my server started running AV's as open raids, with raid leaders and set number of classes who could AE.  The result was hilariously fun as we rolled through 99% of the AV groups while facing the PvE and PvE obstacles together.
---
Occasionally we would get an even match and those battles were epic as all hell too, as the struggle and tactics employed would generally be pretty coordinated.  
---
After some patches I remember that strat had totally died out and was in favor of AVs where most of the time players on the opposing faction would run by each other to get straight to PvE objectives.  That definitely felt like the least enjoyable version of AV, although the mammoth 15 hour marathons of the early AV's weren't to rewarding either.
---
Also just way easier to go to different places in the city - even saves a few steps running bank &lt;--&gt; AH &lt;--&gt; Mail
---
I feel like the zerg is only done for honor. If they remove deminishing returns on honor, the war would probably be preferable
---
It is a decent system, but it has only two drawbacks
---
A) It's convoluted to new players. There's loot trading, but ONLY from the person who obtained the loot trading back to the loot master. It's just a bit unintuitive.
---
B) It allows secret collusion with the loot master. Let's say the loot master wants item X. The loot master secretly asks his friend to help him roll on item X. His friend wins the roll. The loot master sends X to the friend. The friend then trades back X to the loot master. Effectively the loot master got to roll twice. It's a minor gripe but certainly notable.

Unfinished Mount Hyjal.
---
They called Classic a "Passion project" If you think they will invest in severs for classic I think you are really over estimating how much time/money they are willing to put into classic.  It comes with a  base sub with hopefully no micro transactions which means not much money. In their last earnings call they said they will lose money this year. I doubt they will really keep classic, classic.
---
Not the same guy.
---
So 15k population is exactly the same experience community wise as an original authentic #nochanges 2500 population? You can't be serious.
---
I'm fairly sure the proc rates of weapons are just made up on private servers and have little relation to what they will be like in classic.
---
Definitely one of the best wow content creators right now. I wish he'd do audio books.
---
Yeah that's the problem with Dran - you're near nothing of importance late game. Unless you needed to go somewhere for a handful of quests... even then you're on the wrong half of the continent most of the time.
---
I agree, a bit odd. What’s wrong with orc shamans? Sure, people might pick them for the racial but they also look awesome and it fits their lore. Human Warlock lore on the other hand...
---
Well my quick responses:
---
A) Assuming master looting is only used in raids I'm not sure this is really an issue.
---
B) I'm picturing this being seperate from normal trading. The person has an option to return to master looter and then the master looter has to assign it again. So it will all be public. 
---
That's classic, there was no sharding there were a ton of people to contest. If it pisses you off quit. They said starting areas will be sharded which I'm sure will include 1-15 at least. I'm okay with that but end game it makes the least sense for sharding when you want people to be able to run with and see constantly on the sever. 
---
In which world would you even skip ancestral healing ? you already have a high crit chance with spells and that only gets higher once you properly itemize,you will crit heals alot and 25% extra armor is a lot, it's 25% extra armor value not 25% extra armor from gear, that's a massive boost to armor , especially on classes that wear leather and above, armor matters in classic.
---
Something like this :[https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/BPET83AABDOcQxA](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/shaman/BPET83AABDOcQxA).
---
Also 2/2 improved fire nova totem is such an underrated talents, makes it procs really fast and you use it to destroy melee classes all the time, you also don't really need elemental warding much , you can cover yourself vs direct nukes via grounding /shocks quite well, the only spell damage you might need a static damage reduction vs is shadow which the talent doesn't cover, which is why it isn't that important, you can put that 1 point in improved fire totems if you'd prefer.
---
I am really looking forward to roleplaying in Classic. 
---
Retail WoW just doesn’t have an appeal to me as a game. Models etc. are not enough of a draw to actually spend time in that version of the universe. Pretty but dumb would be how I would describe it.
---
Classic has such a better feel to it. Less forced. Less fancy. More suited to what I want to roleplay.
---
Darnassus isn't in wc3 at all
---
Cabin in Winterspring
---
"has written backstory about himself"

"plays the same adventure since his childhood"

"chose race for RP stuff"
---
Sounds more like a different type of virgin to me.
---
There's a giant worm?
---
The chad in this pic is more of a virgin than the virgin.
---
That seems really sucky of a system if you think about it...you could show up every day and have absolutely garbage gear not using points-then dump them all when you have more points than anyone else going for things...its basically a pissing match of how long you can go without gearing up and not getting kicked out of the runs...
---
They removed a ton of stuff between 1.8 and 1.12. I think 1.11 was actually the big nerf patch. The first big updates removed a bunch of quests from the midfield, but 1.11 removed a ton of the guards on each side that made the field basically wide open for rushing.
---
Doesn't matter how big it is in absolute numbers, all I'm saying is that the vast majority of those people will never level to 60, therefore AQ gates and such will be way smaller than launch
---
Can you give your source on this claim?
---
I fucking lost it at "Alliance Warlock"
---
Agreed: SP is still quite decent. Somehow SP keeps it up, while The Simpsons have been shit for many seasons, and Family Guy has always been horrible.
---
The point is chad wins without trying, min-maxing, or reducing the game down to number crunches.
---
Pretty sure it's in the wowhead comments for said item. Though, maybe I misunderstood them and it stacks properly in Classic.
---
Either way... You'll be missing out on some *major* stat bonuses  if you insist on using it post 50.
---
I don't know why they wouldnt be talking about Chuck Norris, he's got a commercial for it and everything.
---
I dont know know who Chad is but he seems like a noob...
---
I don't think 99% of the Private Server min-maxers realize that they're going to be stuck in ZG wiping for months when they think they're going to be 1 shotting AQ40 in 3 hours every week.
---
Im definetely going to rp. 
---
I lied about nothing. **They keep saying it's necessary** and somehow has to exist based n nothing and Asmongold was the first person to spin it as "no changes". Rich Campbell is also a Blizzard employee whose entire career is based on esports which vanilla doesn't have. I don't give a single darn about anything he has to say about anything.
---
Ah Gnomer, the lower level BRD. God, running that place was awful but looking back it was so awesome. Basically a low level raid experience in a way, place took hours to complete. I couldn’t imagine trying to do that place as horde either-no thanks 
---
LOL no. They 100 percent spun it as necessary and a good thing. Tips Out also did the same thing in a stream.
---
As someone who's played Horde exclusively, I'd want to vote Stormwind for design, but Orgrimmar just hold a warm place in my heart for the memories. Can't wait to finally roll a max level Alliance alt this time and hang around in SW though.
---
Thelsamar, Loch Modan is where I would go to have a “vacation” consisting of fishing after I got a toon to 60. 
---
Going from the Plaguelands and Blackrock Mountain to the peace and serenity of Loch Modan is just unparalleled. 
---
I think they succesfully managed to do that on a private server and some other MMO. It’s definitely worth trying. Even if it ended up not working, they can just turn it off.
---
Seriously. Him and that other clown regurgitate the same stuff. Best part is neither of them played vanilla 
---
&gt; B) I'm picturing this being seperate from normal trading. The person has an option to return to master looter and then the master looter has to assign it again. So it will all be public.
---
.. Maybe.. but the issue then is you might have situations where it initially looks okay for player X to get that item -&gt; X clicks NO to the  'do you want to return to ML?' window -&gt; Player Y returns from being AFK, says he actually really needs that item -&gt; X says damn, because he can't trade it back anymore -&gt; X's guild makes a loot ticket to have X give the item to Y, which defeats the purpose of the loot trading to begin with. Idk.. every solution just has such annoying edge cases. I think it's just simple to have a 'hands off' approach to loot.
---
I'm not sure there is a good way to go with AV. It's so massively unbalanced and laughably hard to win in it's original form and then becomes silly with later forms that it's just hard to say "do X version for Y result."
---
It's one of the things where if it weren't the start of a slippery slope/opening up for modern game design in Classic that I'd be for changes. If I could magically just choose a few things for them to "fix" AV would be one, because it had such potential but was so rarely good. That said I don't believe that's really possible so I'm all for the long drawn out bullshit AV because at least that was fun occasionally.
---
Started '05. Was 14 at the time. Stopped playing just before cataclysm dropped as I didn't enjoy the direction the game had been taking over the last year or so.
---
How did it dismantle me? Did Esfand address how he is going to harass players by not identifying which server they will ruin until he gets the name he wants? Did they show empirical proof that this will help server balance when we had the opposite happen post cross realm BG's.
---
Hi, /u/Aiprotsid
---
Not anymore. Classic was just too casual for the RP I was used to.
---
For that to be a problem you would need a lot of players deciding they don’t mind the queue. Not sure if that is realistic. However, I thought about that possibility for a while and had the idea that early adopters of the server could have a flag that puts them to the front of the queue along with other early adopters. This way the queue will be quick for them and slow for late adopters, who knowingly made their character on the overpopulated side.
---
I hope it sounds awesome then :p 
---
Sure but at a certain point you can get to such extreme edge cases where either the gm tickets are either extremely rare or they can just say "too bad" - and people wont get too salty. 
---
I think if this system were implemented like this then your example is one of those cases. 
---
And I do see where you are coming from - this is just the first compromise I've heard that I think will actually work. 
---
Bingo. Not sure how people are having such a hard time understanding this. I blame the 10k pop private servers for misleading people into thinking there are going to be like a thousand people on every worldboss.
---
Explain how it will fix balance problems and not accelerate it. Defend harassing all the users on a server by not identifying which server your group of streamers will ruin beforehand all to get a stupid name Esfand. I told ZERO lies. Asmon was the first one to sell it as no changes and now you have sold it as the same, with Tips having a stream the day before doing the same. **You are spinning 5 months of 2 years as "no changes".**
---
So what happens when the Alliance is trying to raid but half of their guild is stuck in a queue??
---
I go skinning leatherworking first, because there are tons of awesome feral recipes for tribal.
---
And then I at least get herb. 
---
You might not be able to consume health pots, but meele classes have in general 2 million buffs they have to farm. 
---
What servers? PVE servers ruined by streamers like the guy that made their entire career with hosting that is sitting at that tabel?
---
These are amazing! Any chance you have the wailing caverns / mauradon wallpapers without the logo? They're such damn good screenshots.
---
Those people will probably not play classic for very long if at all.
---
It's similar to how the current game holds no appeal to many people excited about classic, so it's great they can both soon exist and then you pick the one you like and play that.
---
Shouldn’t be a character copy. Should be a limited offer 1 time transfer. Copies cause a lot of issues and allow for exploits. Limited time character transfers remove most of the exploits and still keep player-base separate. Doesn’t force TBC and allows you to have what you want.
---
Why would they get stuck in zg? 
---
He doesn't have an answer for that. 1.12 had lots of class changes too. They belong in classic because all of 1.12 is classic. If its no changes then cross realm bgs should release with the Naxx patch to emulate the release of 1.12.
---
Thats why OP is being downvoted all along this thread every time he posts. People finally got around to reading the shit he was posting and realized he is crazy.
---
In retail vanilla it was way worse than 1-2 hrs AV queues .  Nobody got to play it for weeks on my server because there wasn’t enough horde players.  The rare AV would pop up but would soon kick you out because it needed at least 20 or something horde to keep it open.  
---
We made alt horde characters and begged the horde in orgrimar to queue up.
---
Current wow can handle 'around' 100 people before it gets a little dicey.
---
The difference is, in vanilla, there isnt 100 big aoe spells applying 10's of thousands of combat calculations.
---
Im in favour of sharding in the 1-6 subzone (though it will probably be the entire 1-10 areas) because the demand is going to be absolutely intense and not just because there will be some lag, but because questing will be impossible.
---
Large scale WPvP shouldn't be an issue, City Raids and World Bosses will be very dicey and the AQ event i have no idea, but it will probably be even more insane.
---
There is a big difference between 40 people pvping and 300 people trying to make lvl 1 human paladins.
---
&gt; the 800+ we had back then.
---
Sorry buddy but there's no fucking way you had 800+ people in one spot during vanilla. The servers would have crashed at half those numbers.
---
23 in Feb 2005.
---
Even as a Horde player, Ironforge had me in awe when I first ran up to it. Best capital for me! Dwarf master race!! (Ofc only after the Trolls)
---
Esfand's Response "We didn't push for this but it's a necessary evil and Rich Campbell who is a Blizzard employee through MLG says "it happened right before TBC but it was a good thing", which contradicts Esfand trying to insinuate cross realm BG's was in more than 5 months of 2 years of content. 
---
Thanks for the laughs Asmongold fans. There was ZERO response there.
---
 
---
So...Esfand's Response "We didn't push for this but it's a necessary evil and Rich Campbell who is a Blizzard employee through MLG says "it happened right before TBC but it was a good thing", which contradicts Esfand trying to insinuate cross realm BG's was in more than 5 months of 2 years of content. 
---
5 months out of 2 years.
---
Yeah, its called cross realm battlegrounds.
---
Desire to know more intesifies.
---
sure, giant spiders right around the corner! would kill myself!
---
So  the rebuttal you have is "We didn't push for this, but it's a necessary evil  (based on nothing) and Rich Campbell who is a Blizzard employee through MLG says "it happened right before TBC but it was a good thing", which contradicts you trying to insinuate cross realm BG's was in more than 5 months of 2 years of content. 
---
I am not sure why people want the servers to progress to TBC. Maybe a heavily modified TBC might work but like 40 man raids are dead, dailies are a thing, flying mounts are a thing, shared capital hub. 
---
There are people who settle for classic but would play TBC, that's why some don't want TBC servers.
---
&gt;They said starting areas will be sharded which I'm sure will include 1-15 at least. I'm okay with that but end game it makes the least sense for sharding
---
This is basically what Ion already said during Blizzcon.
---
Having land mines might be one of my favorite mechanics. Just keep that at least.
---
Watching more of this laughable "response". StaysafeTV says "how can you be for 1.12 talents and be against cross realm BG's, you are a moron". Sure thing StaysafeTV, I fully expect all of Classicast to make videos tomorrow lobbying for no AQ opening event and Naxx in at sevrer launch to you are "morons". If you can't see how badly they are trying to manipulate people I have some scrap metal to sell you in the middle of Paris.
---
I just woke up and already have to read retarded shit like this 
---
maybe if you are no playing alliance 
---
Sounds like Suicide Kings with unnecessary math.
---
What we actually need is the dance studio we were promised so long ago.
---
We didn't wipe for months in zg in 2005, why would we start now?
---
Private servers will have some features that are close to vanilla but at the same time a lot different as well. At this point there will be three main versions of classic WoW: WoW that existed from 2004-2006, WoW classic coming out this year, and the nost core private servers that a lot people have been playing on. Each one is different and have unique metas. 
---
Actually no, people are generally nice. I'm sorry if your life have made you think otherwise.
---
You should think about what you just posted.
---
username checks out
---
Sharing an account isn't really a game system
---
Nice to see those 6-7 year old raiders coming back for classic wow.
---
It's not a great  idea to go against the ToL, any abuse or exploit of their in game system is a bannable offence. Was in WLK when it was introduced and will be in classic.
---
But have fun trying to get them to remove it by being banned over and over =)
---
Better than TBC rep and exp rates in almost every quest.
---
And there’s peeps out there who never heard his Razorgore one either, which is our fav.  
---
“You pressed your macro that fears... because you had a latency problem.  That about covers it... Good explanation.”
---
Gnomeregan not on the poll omg =(
---
But that isn't vanilla. The launch population will be much higher in relation to eventual server population than it was in vanilla, so either way it won't be accurate. 
---
It’s my fav.  Always lose my shit when he says “that about covers it... good explanation”
---
IF will be the capital city people gather in, just because of those reasons and because of nostalgia.
---
Love this format, but this one in particular is meh. 
---
Don’t agree with them all the time but I think Esfand is spot on here, only implement it if it’s necessary or at the very very end.
---
Yes, people will RP.
---
Oh geez yeah, I forgot about the AV queues. I was thinking like 1-2 hours for WSG and AB. I definitely remember times with essentially no AVs up because it was like 2:1 or 3:1 Alliance to Horde, AV was so imbalanced to Alliance at the time, and so we just would chain queue for WSG or AB.
---
I love the game but there are definitely things from Vanilla that can be fixed, and avoiding the impossible to play BGs is something that probably needs to happen. I'd prefer server balancing in some way to cross server BGs, but if they kept the battle groups small (ideally 2 servers if they can't do just 1) it would be better than some stuff just not existing.
---
I still think a large battle group is the worst option though. That's why I keep posting for the small battle groups, because 5-10 servers together or whatever is just the end of PvP rivalries IMO.
---
Chad would be a dps purist.
---
dps &gt; style &gt; everything else &gt; rp
---
A blessing and a curse.
---
Soooo many “XxLEGOLASxX” NE Hunters lol.
---
My optimistic side tells me that Blizzard is working on making better servers just for Classic but that’s just me being delusional.
---
1.0 AV with bug fixes/exploit fixes please. Was enjoyable to play, I don't care about rewards because the **game play** is what matters to me, and 1.0 had the best **game play**.
---
Hybrids would be overpowered, raiders would have more advantages than just gear are two quick examples.
---
They're not. He just doesn't like them. 
---
Ah yes just make 100 extra servers for all the BFA players that will log on for 1 week max to see Classic for the lolz. Brilliant idea.
---
This is quality 👌 Thanks for putting in the time for this. 
---
And for anyone who played since launch, you know that cross realm BGs totally ruined the PvP community of the server.
---
Instead of fighting the same "Iconic" players, those everyone in Alliance know was good. You fought random nobodies.
---
When you saw the enemy team, and noticed it's players from guild X or that player named Y. Things got realm.
---
Oh man shadow panther! You da real og mvp.
---
EP/GP and you use LC for tank items, etc is what you want then.
---
But if you use it you get considerable more energy and thus, dps. It is BiS for cats and pretty good in 5mans for bears as well. Having 20+ rage before a pull is pretty useful to get initial aggro.
---
I think he’s pointing out that the idea of “no changes” isn’t going to happen and, therefore, is a dumb argument against his suggestion.
---
I see math isn't one of your strong suits
---
[Well yes, but actually no.](https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/028/596/dsmGaKWMeHXe9QuJtq_ys30PNfTGnMsRuHuo_MUzGCg.jpg) 
---
Macros are fine to a point but a huge part of playing a warrior is managing your stances and you can almost totally disregard that aspect by having macros that on first click changes to the required stance and on second click uses that ability.
---
But that’s the authentic vanilla experience. I would be excited to fight against a unified team of Qiraji guardians and server instability to see the opening of Ahn’qiraj.
---
Only a little sarcastic.

There's a lot of reason to be concerned about how vague they have been on the subject, and I'll continue to be concerned until they clarify.
---
This company is clearly  making the right move by removing the dude who makes bad suggestions and uses twitch memes in a board meeting.
---
&gt;The only good thing about Darnassus is that there isn't a Trogg filled tunnel separating it from the starter zone if you decide to roll your bank alt there.
---
On the other hand its good idea to use your bank alt for auctioning as well, and darnassus lacks an AH...
---
I always loved Thunder Bluff myself
---
Sometimes i /walk.
---
Vanilla was way more into staying and putting effort into one thing. If they remove cost from respec then people are going to just change their spec all the time. We might even face issue in raids where people go to capital city to change spec between bosses.
---
In Vanilla respec was there if you really needed it or if you made horrible mistake with your build. It wasn't there so you can change spec for every single dungeon/raid you are running. That's more of retail way of thinking specs.
---
None, really, but purists gotta rage over something.
---
Yep.  All the people who are notorious enough to have a known public "identity" are typically hardcore enough to afford respecs on a whim.
---
The overpriced respec costs does nothing except hurt the less than hardcore player.
---
No it’s an actual off hand frill.
---
I'm guessing it'll be a pretty small community but some people will prefer the vanilla lore and gameplay. 
---
awful gameplay lol
---
I second this. Sure we could make all kind of fancy solutions for this situation but I rather keep it simple. No loot trading and that's it. There was a really good suggestion in other thread about this:
---
&gt;Make it so you can only trade loot with the Master Looter himself. So if you get mis-assigned an item, you need to give it back to the Master Looter, who can then give it to whoever was supposed to receive it.
---
what is it about 1k needles?
---
every new server ive ever played on has these types of pvp clusters. do people just get delusional from killing scorpions for an hour? 
---
Absolutely do. 
---
Why are you nerds downvoting this man who clearly likes wow in a wow sub
---
Who cares even if they did? Aren't people allowed to have personal opinions?
---
Its actually a version of zero sum dkp with all the complex math taken out. It requires next to no bookkeeping, has all the advantages of SK plus it let's you reward people for out of raid contributions like herb farming for the guild bank.
---
Lol dude Idk why youre trying to spread straight up false information, but no point in doing so, anyone who works in tech knows you're full of shit with this (myself), anyone else either wouldn't care or still would be smart enough to realize it wouldn't pass the smell test. It's a lose lose either way for you, so I might as well not even waste any more time responding. Peace 
---
Shifting too frequently in a group BG will kill your Mana, and render you fairly useless. There are better "Tanking" pieces, like the Bone Ring Helm, and better DPS pieces, like the Eye of Rend.

In Diablo 2 you had to re-roll your char if you messed up you skill points.

[Shatterspear Vale](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Shatterspear_Vale), but I guess it requires a bit of whatever those trolls are on.
---
Good luck enforcing that nightmare lol 
---
Cause it takes effort. Why don't you do it?
---
You say that, but think about an item like staff of the shadow flame. I’ve known multiple casters who have cared about specific weapons more than ANYTHING else in the game. If that weapon was their #1 desire in all of vanilla, why wouldn’t they outbid the DKP and ruin the system? All it takes is one person being temporarily greedy to “ruin” the system.
---
I was in a different guild with Wipe Club on my server. ( Dives' guild ) A lot of my guild would consistently level alts, join his guild since he struggled to get past vael in bwl consistently, and farm his guild for loot until it met my guild's standards, and we'd just quit. A few other guilds were doing the same method as well so it was fairly easy to get in without jumping through too many hoops. Essentially you just had to be attuned and you were in. 
---
I always found the in-game name randomizer to be helpful if I was just making an alt or something. Otherwise, I always name my characters by myself, with some help from the lore I've gleaned over the years. Great tool, though!
---
Booty bay all day every day, friends. Used to have my mains HS there back in Vanilla and found an unoccupied house that I claimed as "mine". I was 12.
---
I don't think I've ever seen someone on these forums claiming warriors are good at pvp... Funniest thing about this video is at the end he says the only class warriors can always beat is druids, and here people always go on about how good druids are at duelling and how the always beat warriors.
---
The only way to really enjoy a warrior in PVP is to outgear your opponents and have a couple healer focusing on you.
---
Prepare to be very disappointed otherwise, a casual warrior is a frustrated warrior.
---
Same, i always loved that camp
---
Awesome
---
Not really most PS really have no clue to how most of vanilla worked

---
Even if the timer is something like 5 minutes, you really think everyone will not leave the raid by then once the last boss is down ?
---
You are incorrect, that is all. 
---
I think any problem that LC has is inherent to DKP as well, except that people just think it's fairer because "it's nunbers bro". There are going to be sad fucks crying over unfair loot going over the place either way. I would rather have people be served with a genuine explanation as to why some guy got the item and they didn't instead of hiding behind an arbitrary number system devised by humans.
---
I mean, it's literally the name of the sub.
---
But honestly, Wow Classic sounds better to me, even if it's wrong.
---
yeh i think arenas were a fun mini game but desigining balance and pushing it to be an esport was the issue.
---
Previously Dire Maul was going to be included in the first phase; this would *dramatically* change the the MC pre-BiS list, as many many many items in DM are BiS til BWL. It would make a good chunk of the loot in MC trivial. Taking DM off the table alters the top items in many slots for many classes. BRD, Scholo, Strat, (U/L)BRS are going to be *much* more important and farmed much more frequently.
---
It's honestly hard to give you specific examples because Dire Maul changes so many things. Google 'Vanilla BiS list patch' for any class and compare the pre-BiS list at patch 1.2 versus 1.3. This is the difference not having DM will make in MC progression.
---
he’s playing a shaman?
---
because sometimes rthe retarded majority, control the majority vote.  or casuals.  and that, is why voting isnt always a good idea.
---
My guild used DKP with "secret bids". Players would send their bid to the GM (or raid leader) and the one who bid the most, would get the item for the 2nd bid + 10 or something like that.
---
So if you really wanted an item, you could bid your entire  DKP pool, but only lose 1/3 of it  if not many others bid high.
---
If they are worried about it they could stay till the timer goes off (make it so no one can get removed during timer). 
---
Or make it a minute or two? That's enough time to fix a miss click.

Either way I think we are getting to a really rare edge case here and I think having the feature for master looted raids would be better than not having it even if we cant solve all edge cases. 
---
What changes?
---
I literally raided this place every day when i was in high school. Maybe not a great place to live.
---
I was 15, started march-april 2015. Youngest irl friends from school that played were 13-14.
---
ITT: minmaxers getting upset nobody thinks their cool
---
Stonetalon is just chill. My favorite zone ever.
---
Dungeon Set 2 (also known at Tier .5) is also not available until patch 1.10 or phase 5. If you start playing at Classic launch, chances are you will be full tier 2 before tier .5 ever becomes a thing.
---
But yeah, as others have noted, it has particularly shit itemization for mages. Just google mage pre-bis and I bet you can find a patch-by-patch list of what you're aiming for.
---
Retail wow doesn't have spell batching anymore so all combat data is updated every 20ms instead of every 200-400ms that it used to be in vanilla-&gt;mop.  Combine that with a shit ton of more spells and procs in the game and you'll end up with a laggy shitfest. Spell snapshotting is also gone so debuffs are updated more frequently. I don't think movement itself is updated more frequently but it could use more CPU these days because of stricter anti cheat. Classic won't have these issues (besides stricter anti-cheat) if they decide to recreate it as identical as possible.
---
but orc isn't the mix/max race for warlock because gnomes are. 
---
Oh look it’s this thread again.
---
They already annouced they won’t do any sharding for world bosses.
---
But we already knew that in november.

Skinning is great and very east to keep concurrent to your level, especially in crowded zones. Other gathering professions (like mining and herbalism) are hard to keep leveled proportional to the zones you're naturally questing in when there is a lot of competition for nodes (as I expect there will be in the beginning of classic.) 
---
Still, I recommend sticking with two gathering professions all the way to 60 and then dropping one or both to make room for a crafting one that compliments it.
---
I love TBC, I have a level 70 right now on Netherwing. While it's a great game, I think it'd be more interested new lv 60 Vanilla content than a refitting of TBC. 
---
Question in regards to this though. Wouldn't it make sense that BFA servers are more taxing than what the classic servers will be? This is pure speculation, but I imagine that BFA has *way* more things going on in regards to player experience; quest interactions, instanced events etc etc. All in a way that Vanilla WoW never was (as most quests for example was go here kill x).  And thus, a 200v300 fight could potentially work.
---
I also have to wonder about the case of having 500 players engaged in a PvP fight. Back in the day the biggest I remember seeing was 100v100 battles, but those were rare as well. City raids were done mostly with a 40 man group. Has it ever been the case that this has worked on blizzard servers? Or have we only noticed it now?
---
Run over to Troll starting zone and do as many of those quests as you can.
---
Otherwise, start saving all your runecloth for rep turn in at 60.
---
That's kind of the point of this meme format.
---
Vanilla didn’t anywhere near have queue’s that long. The peak playerbase was in Wrath.
---
I don't know if you played when Loot Trading was implemented, but it was a welcome addition and something me or my friends never saw being abused. And people who did, cried on forums that they got banned for just "Using Blizzards mechanics" even if they knew it was abuse of their systems.
---
I don't have to enforce anything, I just have to report people who ninja =)
---
:(
---
It’s definitely going to be bigger than the recent expansion releases.
---
BLASPHEMY!!!
---
Sharding killed wow imo. The game does not feel like a massive multiplayer online game when you can't see the playerbase of the server. 
---
This is great advice for max level healing, less useful while leveling and with less than ~ +250 heal gear. You probably won't be doing too much downranking when you're leveling. You likely also won't pull threat from your hots at lower levels, and it can actually help with your mana regen per the 5 second rule, especially if you're trying to heal as Shadow while leveling.
---
But yea, later on, hots can be mana inefficient and threat crazy, while shields are beyond inefficient. They each have their situational uses, but especially in dungeons while leveling, just focus on regular heals.
---
You’re not directly reducing his threat but you are hampering his rage generation, and having loads of rage is important to building threat fast
---
they downgraded their servers so much that even alterac valley is going to lag.
---
People will need on everything even without loot sharing.
---
no
---
&gt; then we are fucked.
---
I think you mean they're* fucked. Private servers were steadily getting better and better before this was announced, handling many more players than Classic did back in the day quite well. And they'll soon have access to Blizzard's official boss numbers too. No reason at all to pay per month is there's a superior product available for free. So I'm excited for Classic regardless, excited enough to donate monthly even.
---

Druid and priest dps are just slightly over the ret pally dps numbers in the top lists. If you’re running a casual guild you’ll have enough trouble scraping together a raid group as it is. Obviously hardcore raiding will *optimise* the dps, but only a fraction of guilds are at that level. 
---
Well, you have your opinion on things and that's fine, but if we had CRBG during naxx back in the day we should have CRBG during Classic when naxx launches. That's the whole point of #NoChanges.
---
"MOOM BATHROOM!" part 2.
---
2 months later, average server pop is ~300. Visitors from BfA came, saw how slow things start and quit before gameplay smooths out at around lvl 20. Classic servers are being merged en masse with players complaints all around and the feeling it's a failure even though Blizzard keeps reiterating that they anticipated a huge drop in numbers after BfA-players that just wanted to have a look had gone.
---
Same, certainly won't start on day one.
---
I don't get all the worrying. Their servers could (barely) handle it back in 2005, modern technology can handle it easily if the configure it to do so (which by all means they will since it's pretty clear they understand how important community is to Vanilla)
---
It doesn't really have anything to do with how "taxing" it is. Its not a problem with server processing power. The way modern server infrastructure for most major applications is done is much more complex than just placing a single executable on a beefy system and hitting "run." 
---
WoW originally did that sort of system, but at some point they switched off. The modern system allows for more scalability. The ability to scale SHARDS not the ability to scale PLAYERS. Blizzard made the decision to implement it that way. 
---
I remmember it was bases on ilvl of the item. If you did the big game hunter quest in stv the final chest reward was a ilvl high enough for tbc enchants.
---
For BoE items it was lv35+
---
A static 1.12 experience on private servers vs. Patch progression (light) on Classic... what are you talkin' about?
---
Herbing and skinning are doable in form. Mining isn't, you will need to shift back. 
---
People in your party are transferred to your shard
---
I remember my guild using maxDKP, meaning if you were eligible and wanted to bid you bid with all your DKP. Simple system and fair enough.
---
You won't be happy with your dead server a few weeks later when the tourists quit 
---
As a druid, you are likely be part of small skirmishes than huge battles in BGs. Plus there are other kinds of PvP, like solo/duo brawls in the open world while questing.
---
When it comes to DPS, nothing beats powershifting with this helm and Furor.
---
Yes, there are better tanking pieces in terms of stats, especially for raiding or longer fights. But in 5mans the pulls are short enough that the added tiny health, damage or armor is much less important than having enough rage to stabilise your threat level and not let the DDs or healers get aggro. 
---
I'm not saying this helm is BiS for tanking, but a pretty good option. My druid is 52, and I've got stronget blue headpieces in my backpack, but I still regularly switch to the helm in 5mans, and use it while questing.
---
Barrnens, STV, EPL
---
Who cares about Vanilla's player count? 
---
Yup. Blizzard never said no changes and actively went against that sentiment. #nochange people are so zealous (despite most never playing vanilla) that they don't even read the OP, which didn't even advocate for adding anything, it said in the event that they do.
---
fixed it, thanks!
---
How would the economy cope with this? Sounds like people get the economy settled then shoved into a realm with people with significantly longer to build up gold reserves. So can those who were on one of the later realms no longer afford anything? Or is there a sudden requirement to play the AH to try and balance things?
---
No one has a hard time understanding that. It's basic. They just doubt Blizzard because they haven't outright stated, "There will never be sharding outside the starting zones. And even there it'll only be for a few days."
---
When they mentioned world bosses they said "there won't be two (of the world boss)" but not that they wouldn't shard the players, which is the issue.
---
fixed it, thanks! 
---
I understand! I have literally no knowledge of how servers works.
---
My laptop can play animated wallpapers, I don’t suppose you could record the zones as a GIF format?
---
Might have been part of the layoffs. 
---
Get a job.
---
&gt; Not sure how people are having such a hard time understanding this. 
---
Its really astonishing. I've explained it to people so many times I don't even bother anymore. 
---
Hunter seems to be the exception to many class set rules. T1 isn't *fantastic* for any class really, but Hunter comes the closest. You have to be pretty far into your T2 collection before it becomes worth it to drop an 8/8 T1 set. That's not true of any other class.
---
There was no loot trading other then master looter (if enabled). Otherwise you will get BOP (mostly blues) or BOE and those you can not/can trade as per usual. So need/greed in normal conditions though you can need even on stuff you cant use or equip.
---
As a Horde I'll 100% do this dungeon for the wand and staff.
---
Hmmm good point.
---
No no no ... you will not move at all but just show-off standing in a posture just outside Lion's inn in Goldshire.
---
It's the same for open world PVP and STVietnam.  
---
There was massive whines on the forum back in the day.  
---
People just quitted over it.  
---
(I will be rolling on a PVE server btw ;-)  
---
  
---
If a guild needs somebody to respec for the sake of the raid, the guild usually covers the cost. If not, its not a guild you wanna stay in.
---
Fair enough. But it might be simpler still to just say that one flask in the guild bank puts you up one rank in SK or something. It has the same effect, you jump ahead of someone in the loot queue.
---
Blizzard decided to get fancy and run the game on a completely new engine (I think that's the word) and the track record of this new engine to handle large groups without sharding or crashing isn't good. The OP mentioned this.
---
Half my playtime will be RP
---
i secretly wish that whatever guild i end up being in has a "guild house" where we all just congregate when afk or doing nothing in game
---
It won't be an issue. 
---
1. Accounts are not free like p servers.
---
2. No mega servers with 10k pop and world wide playerbase
---
3.The materials requirements are insane. It will be mainly raiders that will be collecting and buying from the AH to complete it.
---
The only thing is servers with all those dbags followers that don't play but follow streamers around all day and kiss their asses. They will collect mats and waste money/gold on it.
---
This just in: keyboard turning is bad.
---
Inside gnomeregan of course, after I assemble everyone I can to actually eradicate the corruption within
---
Maybe there are a lot of mages but then with their good CC they are also sought after so i would not worry too much about what class is most wanted (then roll a tank that will be best and quickest to get into a group) but roll what you like playing.
---
I mean if you roll on an RP server that may very well be the case. 
---
I don’t meant it as you can’t play like you want, but honestly, go play the game and you should find quests. If course that means you need to know where to go, so google “vanilla zone by level”. Whenever you run out of quest just look at what other zones are available. For example, as a level 21 Ashenvale and Duskwood just opened up and you still got stuff in Redridge Mountains and Westfall worth doing. Hillsbrad is also starting to become available and in just a few levels (around 24-25) you get Wetlands.
---
As you can see, you don’t just run out of quest if you just bother to actually play the game as it was designed to be played. It was made to explore the world. Sure at some levels you can get a bit starved for quest, but only if you never kill anything.
---
Uhh, the guy who said we’d have 3 hour queue’s as that would be vanilla does.
---
If you really duo during leveling, then a tank/healer combo would be good and fast. You can do warrior (to tank in dungeons) and she can heal. Or both roll druids so you can alternate rolls even at some stages if you would like to.
---
Probably because in vanilla most people sucked and Druids had a bit unique play style that (apparently) was too hard.
---
PvE will be fine. A lot of conversations I've had with people coming back is that they won't be able to play as much or for long periods of time. They don't want to logon and have their playtime come down to running away from level 60 rogues in redridge for their hour or two of play.
---
Engineering is still useful for druids. Popping out of forms to mind control or toss a bomb can turn the course of a battle. Nature's Swiftness can't be used in forms either and yet it's an absolute staple of Druid PvP specs. 
---
How fuckin hard is it for them to make a blue post saying as much? Is there some capitalist principle I'm unaware of: "The more anxiety and unease your customers feels towards your product, the more money that product generates."
---
I'm sitting here wondering if I should be creating an elaborate guild website, or investing my time in something more reliable, like high stakes poker...
---
I'd be more worried about getting all the gold required (especially for epic mount) instead of rep for another race's mount - at least on your first character for sure.
---
Someone's bitter their enh shaman can't raid
---
It's BiS for cat dps since it supports power-shifting which is the absolute best way to maximise cat dps. Not that I'd want to go down that particular path of agony but if that's your thing then it's what you want. 
---
Basically Blizz originally had 1 computer for the server. Like a desktop computer, that was extremely powerful and handled all 2000 people on your server by itself. The problem is that when the game starts to become more taxing, like you suggested, those computers reach their limits, and your only option really is to toss it in the trash and get a better one. (Which Blizz sort of did, they sold the servers to people at an auction as mementos.)
---
Their modern system would instead have maybe 10,000 smaller computers. Each one handles a 1 shard (maybe like 50 players.) When your character changes shards in the game, you actually switch over to a different computer. Now if the game becomes more demanding (more people playing), you can just power on another 1000 of those computers. Or if people quit, you can turn 1000 off and save money. At a major expansion launch you can easily enable 2x or 3x the capacity. 
---
However you can see the problem that you can't just stick a 500 person battle on one of those smaller computers, its just not designed to handle that. 
---
(This is a super general example, in reality its probably not as simple as 10k computers running shards, but rather X amount handling specific tasks, Y amount handling other tasks, etc... Which makes it so you can't really just input an old-school beefy computer and set the shard limit to 500.)
---
Sorry, but you're wrong. It's an opinionated matter so whether you agree with it or not, no one side is retarded. I personally would rather compete over mobs and have large queues if it meant sharding is confirmed to be out of the game permanently. I'm very aware I'm in the minority with that opinion but that doesn't make it retarded lmao.
---
God damn, that's amazing.
---
Already have one that I'm happy with as an IT Technician!
---
Woops, took your comment out of context. Thought you were suggesting Classic would have queues similar to vanilla launch. 
---
This is fan fucking tastic
---
The unoccupied house in Eastvale Logging Camp in Elwynn Forest!
---
Thank you for the answer! But, is there anything that prevents computers combining and running together? So that instead of jumping shards with different players, rather combining shards? Seems like it should be possible?
---
I will quit if they shard anything **anything** after the first week of Classic being out.
---
**ANYTHING**
---
So many people don't understand that this is what will happen. Many dead servers if we don't have sharding, no matter how much I hate it. It's the lesser of two evils. 
---
I do love seeing photos of the raggedy guide. But is there a chance we could stop seeing one a day? 
---
Starting zone only IMO.
---
Merge low pop servers 3 or so months after launch.
---
Give me swirly ball or give me death
---
Actually true though, mixmaxers live in a cold numberdriven world. 
---
#RiseoftheChads
---
Yeah for sure. I'd never want it in or even close to end game content. Go as far as needed to make questing actually possible (so probably until level 15-20 ish), and that's it. No need for shit loads of extra servers that become dead a few weeks later. 
---
Lmao could you be any more bitter about asmund
---
16 in 2005
---
Haha is the lack of water that messes with our mind 
---
I wish Blizzard would just answer all our concerns about Loot Sharing / Sharding so that we can stop talking about it every day.
---
I understand WHY we should be talking about it every day -- so long as there is a thread on the front page every day about it, there's a good chance a Blizzard employee hear some of our points, counter-solutions, etc, and know that this is what we're thinking about.
---
If we don't talk about it all day, then Blizzard will rightly think that it's not something that bothers us. We gotta keep talking about it.
---
But I really want Blizzard to address it already so we don't have to keep doing that lol
---
Lets not forget that Druids had one OP item - Wolfshead Helm - in the right hands it could do some serious damage
---
RemindMe! 5 Months

On the subject of cities I always wished the undead city was a fully fleshed out Ruins of Lordaeron(top portion of the undercity), with some scourge  buildings thrown into the mix. I never really cared for the underground portion it felt messy and poorly designed. I mean this was the major city of Warcraft 2, I felt Lordaeron could of been better represented. An undead version of Stormwind would of been really cool.

Haha, so true :)

Sure except it's a pve dps item and no application to warrior duelling at all.

A day*
---
No loot trading at all / gm intervention &gt; any kind of loot trading system
---
&gt;How about blizzard get servers that cna handle a 14 year old game that can run on a potato instead
---
You are missing one point, wow classic isnt a 14 year old game. Its literally a Legion client on current servers, with current data structures combined with vanilla graphics, quests, data and talents.
---
From the behind the scenes its a legion with new data. Not a 14 year game.
---
Virgin hardcore raider versus Chad hardcore reroller
---
Ohh we could be neighbours. I love that area.
---
Pretty sure you should play retail vanilla before saying you've played retail vanilla :) 
---
Calling people you don't know a clown is pretty silly, and I would guess that bringing new content from a 15 year old game is a hard task
---
they're*
---
Interesting thoughts thanks. I for one rolled into a RPPvP server when I first started playing and it was an incredible experience. There were often some pretty cool battles in Ashenvale and Hillsbrad. I hope this will happen again but I'm worried about the server population. The one I was on eventually died. Maybe there will only be one RpPvP server. That may help things.
---
They could use it to make fun of loot boxes and all these "special" services with ridiculous prices.  A game like Classic should have none of.
---
They will, people on this sub managed to zerg down a few bosses in raids on private servers then claim they cleared Retail Naxx lmao
---
My pleasure!
---
Teeb's for Warchief!
---
Yep, I do. Think I have pics,I'll look.
---
even on a 5k population realm, if the H/A ratio is skewed towards one side too much you will end up with unreasonably long Q times.  
---
XRealm BGs are a fix for this problem no matter what the realm size may be.
---
Very nicely done thank you.
---
How difficult will it be for me to get a full tier 1 set as a rogue raiding 1-2 times a week?
---
It's almost certainly a result of Blizzard redesigning their server infrastructure with an instance based solution. This is the way most things are heading. 
---
Basically a server is no longer a physical box; instead it is a group of instances being run. Each instance has access to a slice of the physical box's resources. As the server needs more resources, more instances are spun up, and as the server needs fewer resources, instances are killed. In periods of high load, the realm may be comprised of microinstances from multiple physical machines. It also has the benefit of fault tolerance; if a physical machine crashes, the realm continues to function and instances from another machine are transparently swapped in, with no effect on the end user.
---
However, these instances are not as powerful as an entire physical machine and so the number of players they can handle at once is much more constrained. 
---
Blizzard loathes speaking in uncertainties. Players riot whenever they end up going back on their words, or stuff goes differently than initially planned. As such, they primarily report stuff when it's (almost) finalized. That does unfortunately mean that players tend to have little input in things besides screaming loudly in advance. To be fair the current behaviour of the community to panic about any implication is one that Blizzard taught us, as waiting until they say stuff is too late.
---
pre bc, i was like in 8th grade i think
---
Just play the game and enjoy it. Thats a much better experience then following a set route.
---
Bring the chaos I say. 
---
My highest char during vanilla was around lvl 50. Im looking out for EPL the most because of the max level world pvp.
---
I hated the 50g respect cost the most in vanilla/tbc as a shaman. However, it gave me the most identity ever (this was mainy tbc but the  point is the same).
---
I raided as resto and always dreamed of pvping as enha. In a specific patch my guild kicked me because of doing premade bgs in raid time. I respecced to enhancement and nevet looked back.
---
 People would know me for my race/spec because there were only two fully gladiator geared tauren enha shamans on the server. I Spencer my time duellint in front of OG. My spec/gear/playstyle was a rarity. People from other realms (cross-realm bgs) would remember me oneshotting clothies in the Field of Strife. 
---
Whenever I watched the part in Unbreakable's video on the resto ralent respeccing I'd fully immerse. All because I was cba paying for respecs. I truly hate the 50g cost, but it is needed for Classic.
---
Yep. I'm play with being against it because you want "no changes" because you don't trust Blizzard, but I don't really buy the supposed positives here. 50g respecs were a pain in the ass and added no depth to the game on my experience and I never heard anything good about it from anyone else while playing.
---
I do absolutely acknowledge that it's the start of a slippery slope though. No argument from me there. It could be done but it would require trust that a lot of people don't have right now.
---
30g woulds be a sweet spot, adding maybe 3gs with every respec so you could do it 10 times before capping out. 
---
Have you watched Kargoz vid on dual leveling?
---
1.12 (and 1.12.1) was the longest running patch in vanilla.  
---
player count was peaking at this time and the largest amount of lvl 60 existed.  
---
almost 1/5 of vanilla was 1.12 (and 1.12.1).
---
the argument that 1.12 was only at the end of the patch cycle is moot.
---
1) xrealm BGs solve way more problems then it causes. the bigger problem BGs had was the shift to arena with TBC. 1.12 BGs were fine.
---
2) battlemasters are not solely for PvPers convenience. they keep PvPers away from the open world. until their introduction you had bored lvl 60 in a lvl 30 zone. this is just asking for trouble (griefing).  
---
3) indifferent to this one. only 1 thing. people take the path of least resistance. the goal is gear. it doesn't matter which version, after a couple of BGs the players will focus on the goal and not on the path.
---
4) who doesn't fondly remember the invite spam...
---

---
You are just a priest. Not a shadow or holy priest... just a priest. 
---
I guess you can say its free if you still play retail.
---
No. One must always do the cactus apple quest. It is the law.
---
"lock" is not how you pronounce Loch...
---
when leveling rogue what poisons do you use? i always used and still using instant poison. so many rogues now leveling with deadly poison. am i missing something?
---
These are fantastic! Thanks. 
---
One of the things that was cool with the old talent system was that you could do hybrid specs - a spec that you could run both in raids and pvp, or both raid heals and offtanking.  
---
Having free respecs would put more strain on warlocks, since you'd have parts of the raid portalling out and respeccing for certain bosses, and the locks would have to summon them back.  
---
If I ever have the experience of having to party with someone "to get them into my shard" I'm instantly quitting the game forever.
---
Joana is a hunter, so has aspect of the cheetah at lvl 20 and invest 2 talents points in it which give a total of a 36% speed bonus.
---
I think around 8. 2005, started on private servers and in 2006 retail.
---
It's based off 1.12
---
That is not a solution for wpvp though.
---
This was not my experience during retail Vanilla on an RP server. Ally outnumbered Horde still but only by a small amount.
---
This sub:
---
Respecting your 40 man team by actually trying to play the game: Virgin.
---
Rping and writing novels about yourself: Chad.
---
i'll hope they will have seperate RP servers, so the RP players have their own world.  
---
I don't dislike RPing, but i don't feel the need to participate all the time
---
They also said they understand how important social stuff in Vanilla. They said that there will only ever be one of any world boss, for example. Sharding is considered only for the initial rush.
---
I played a rogue in Vanilla with a 2 night guild and I had full T1, full T2, etc. I imagine it would be easier now than before.
---
Which problems?
---
They 100% came with TBC
---
You can choose when to do wpvp. (it's a misconception that there is no wpvp on pve servers). That's the only difference. 
---
I'm going horde again and just hope this time around, people have developed a sence of style.
---

I don't get why so many Alliance don't like PvP. I main Horde but have played a lot of time as Ally.  I PvPed just as much as Ally! The queue times were a dream! So please tell me Ally mains, why you so scared to dirty your hands with the blood of your enemies!?

I would indefinitely rent a room at the tavern in Brill.
---
That's what I think aswell, it sounds more right with "Wow Classic".
---
Is there a website showing how much class skills cost? All I can find is what skills to learn and at what level, never the prices.
---
BIS isn't an absolute idea. It's all relative to some patch or context.
---
I had the opposite, a mage in my guild charged me 2k gold for the +weapon skill gauntlets he got as a random drop, because he wanted epic mounts on both his freshly dinged 60 alts and didn’t want to farm. 
---
The tourists quit at 3845/4523 queue placement. Servers will be fine
---
Again, never argued it should or shouldn't be in the game. Only arguing against people who lie about being "no change" when they are demanding changes. The slippery slope of allowing Blizzard to change things can lead to much worse things than loot trading.
---
Very few people would record raids and gaming streams practically didn't exist 15 years ago. How exactly would anyone prove something happened routinely? Try to think before you post.
---
I used to stay in the empty cave hidden in Teldrassil with my druid, laying in cat form near a cooking fire
---
Did you make this?
---
I remember queues going past 2 hours, I wouldn't be surprised if they peaked past 3.
---
Where did you find this?
---
You can't, there's still a stance you want to be staying in because you drop to 25 rage when you switch and the stances give advantages and disadvantages.
---
Using macros lets you not have to mash the stance button all the time which is kinda clunky. It doesn't mean you ignore the stances at all, you should still be fully aware, especially if your buttons change based on stance
---
There is a ton of DKP variations. 
---
Bidding can be public,private or pre-aranged. Public usually means you can keep increasing your offer until you win or give up and private is usually highest one time bid, while pre-aranged is decided before raid as either wishlist, class officer or just plain blank biding. 
---
As for who can bid, there is sometimes class priority on some items like you mentioned and status priority (usually trials can't bid, but there can be also rank priority as in raider priority over member).
---
Most guilds will have tanks on a LC type of system, as for tank items not needed by MT and OTs, they can be again LC or DKP.
---
As for point cost for items, this can again be static or dynamic. As for dynamic it can increase based on bidding, based on overall supply/demand, based on previously agreed changes (like changing item price depending on patch) etc.
---
Point earning as well can be varied. Some systems offer DKP per boss, or per hour, or if having some buff (world buffs, flasks, or even regular buffs), or per used item drop, or based on points spend, or some bonuses (first kills, not enough people,  good clear time, etc). This can be in various combinations.
---
DKP balancing due to hoarding points can be done on varius ways as well. Decay, wiping, percentage based DKP usage etc.
---
To top all of it, DKP can be combined with other loot systems on per item basis, per raid basis, per rank, or some other way. And I have probably forgotten some variations used as well.
---
As for the system it self, DKP has advantages and disadvantages. No rules are ideal for everyone, as we are all different. Best to keep in mind variations I mentioned, and ask about loot system of guild(s) you want to join, before you do.
---
go to 23:30, put it on 2x speed, look at number 7 on his bar, in zerk stance. I think it took 5 duels for 1 pummel. Just saying.

---
Except, you know, the raid leaders 😁
---
Major cities have never been sharded afaik. 
---
It's going to be a necessary evil for servers where streamers and their communities gather. Those servers will probably have 80:20 or even worse ratios if they stick with a pop of \~3500-5000 players.
---
Do it, man!
---
Rich comment coming from the guy with "_tv" on his username.
---
Every loot system has its flaws. As for explaining why someone got the item, depending on the mentality of the players, it can be way easier to explain to someone by showing them numbers instead of going into discussions who benefits the item more, or who shows more dedication or whatever.
---
I'm not asking for a system, I'm telling people like you to stop lying about the existence of loot trading. I've never spoken about the WotLK system, you brought it up. If you try to demand changes while lying about vanilla then Blizzard will ignore you because they sit on the actual GM policies from back in the day so your tactic is just stupid.
---
This launch won't be comparable to vanilla. Back then the game started out small and grew steadily. That won't  ever happen again. 
---
for pvp orcs are 10 times what gnomes are unless there is a table a gnome can run under, especially given more context which is undead rogues don't normally gank orc warlocks.

The old client probably wouldn't work on the new servers, it's ancient and really exploitable. 
---
Always been on RP realms, will be interested to see what level of metagaming will happen. There were Kul Tiran themed guilds for instance going merely on information from theramore and the like. Now there's all this extra story and I can see people weaving it into their stories.
---
What if the is the raid leader?
---
I'm planning on re-making the resto shaman that I had in vanilla, and I'll really be missing the dual spec option when it comes to farming.
---
&gt; fingers that type prose so purple it out-itemizes every pair of BiS gloves
---
Fucking brilliant, thanks for the laugh!
---
Lots of many butthurt people in here though...
---
the "virgin" is a orc shaman not a warlock. i think op used the shaman class on horde side because similar to paladin they just look pathetic in their bis.
---
It makes sense that Alliance players have a more of a "can't we all just get along" mentality. That being said I like the taunting rituals that go along with courting pvp on pve servers, and I always jump in when a town is being attacked. 
---
If we could pvp through jousting I'd be more into it. 
---
Then why bother trying to become a self-proclaimed important online-persona?
---
I dont even care about lag anymore.
---
And it's not a question of trust for me either.
---
I just don't want it. At all. It's one of if not the single biggest things wrong with Live, How can we even consider ever using it.
---
No. Get your server pops right and after the first weekend people will be so seperated it'll never be an issue again. Done. Till then I'll deal with it the way we used to - make friends and do random adventures. 100 man hogger anyone? All run ironforge at level 1? Why? because this isn't min maxing or rushing. This is Classic.
---
No sharding. Full stop.
---
I recall there being regular Horde players when I was doing this dungeon back then tho
---
Nope, there is no logical flaw in it. The large scale world events you're thinking of aren't even close to what launch will do in terms of hindering people from actually doing content. Those don't warrant sharding, thousands of people unable to complete 3 starter quests in 3 hours does.
---
Your "argument" is a purely hypothetical response to the blue post... wtf. 
---
if they dont use sharding, then people will demand the same for retail when they notice how better the game is without sharding.  might cause them too big of a headache.
---
150%.
---
If the "solution" to the problem of not-playable content is just "skip the content" thatn it's a damn shit solution. 
---
Posted something about that over 1000 Posts ago, so cant just copy that ... TLDR Version incoming:
---
Duskwood was designed to be a "dark Zone" in wow Alpha/beta. In These zones, your Vision was pitch black and you had to get a torch from a starting quest in duskwood. With that one you could see in a radius around you. That idea however was scrapped, as it would be difficult to Balance that for Horde side and they didnt want just a few Areas to have Special mechanics.
---
Some remnants of that are those eyes for example or the fact, that your Vision gets reduced on the hill on the graveyard. Although the Vision is blue, that was supposed to be the area that was visible with a torch then.
---
&gt; I've seen numerous people comment that this is indeed the case, and even more so that blizz is keeping it tightly under wraps.
---
Blizzard has already commented trough Ion either on Blizzcon or in a developer Q&amp;A Session that they are looking into this. they are hardly keeping this under wrap if at all. Its quite well known. 
---
Its also not happening all the time. Just yesterday i had some raid v.s. raid action when 2 Assasin groups collided and there was no lag at all. Its still pretty erratic when this seem to happen. I've noticed the lag a few times now, but also quite a few times its not laggy at all in the same circumstances.  
---
Nobody wiped in ZG for months in retail unless they were undergeared or bad
---
While bombs are really nice, trinkets are absolutely needed. Because fuck mages.
---
Can't be Chad with bad oral hygiene
---
Which will obviously be the case. 
---
Back in the day there was plenty RP on both sides. There will also be a loft of players that play both factions with multiple RP twinks.
---
RP-PvP! &lt;3
---
OP lies through his teeth and comes off as a dick.
---
I mean, dude has a serious problem with streamers, jesus.
---
O think so, they only introduced ratings in tbc because of power creep. 
---
14 in 2005, damn that was a long time ago 
---
&gt; The clouding tech is already there since they down ported from the modern client. They'd rather go down that route instead of addressing server stability issues for Classic. 
---
Clouding tech? Its quite logical though that they use the modern infrastructure. You don't want multiple infrastructures to manage, especially not a old and dated one and a modern one at the same time. 
---
Also i wouldn't scuff at the server stability, the last few years, atleast in EU, WoW servers have been the most stable they have ever been. There is very little downtime if at all, i can't even remember the last time there was a server crash, while i still remember all the shit we had to cope with during Vanilla and in a lesser degree TBC, where quite a few times simple maintenance would lead to hours and sometimes even days of downtime. I still have around 30 day's worth of "1 day exempts" credited in my WoW account for all the Vanilla and TBC server stability issues. 
---
A lot of stuff was better in Vanilla than in Current WoW, but server stability isn't one of those things. 
---
Hi, /u/sdrcfc
---
Small group of friends looking for a NA-PvE Horde guild. So far all we've found is NA-PvE Alliance. If you're NA Horde and going PvE, hit me up! 
---
dont buy skills you dont need, thats prob the biggest mistake people make.  dont need all of them when levelling up
---
RAF was a catch up thing, no way it will be implemented in Classic
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **1st Cakeday** CygnusXYZ! ^(hug)
---
There should be a poll like this but for all 4 different types of servers.
---
And this is where people - specifically non-techies - are just blinded by not having the knowledge of how things work on servers these days...
---
Sharding, in essence, is a scalable technology. Meaning: Blizzard can SCALE the size (read: POWER) of any given Shard. A shard in itself is nothing but a virtual server. One Hardware Server can handle many different virtual servers at once. 
---
My ASSUMPTION is that right now the shards have a theoretical maximum that's balanced around the fact that these huge events simply don't take place anymore - and this is a righteous assumption when it comes to retail. World Events don't happen anymore in retail and when they do - well, the shards aren't prepared for it.
---
People need to understand that unused power costs money. And Blizzard keeps the money quite tight. In the event of classic things will look a little different and here's why:\
---
World Events are a core part of classic. This is why - from the ground up - shards will be scaled much higher than they will be in retail. As world events are bound to happen every single day, the zones will be up for it. Furthermore in retail there's many, many, many more effects being calculated at every server "tick" (think: heartbeat). Be it dot's, passives, trinkets and whatnot. All of these things are handled on the server and while people may think it's not a lot to calculate, it is... In classic, that's different. The most tick-generating class is the shadow priest and even an undead shadow priest doesn't create as many ticks as ANY class on retail these days.
---
So, TL/DR:\
---
**YOU CANNOT COMPARE RETAIL TO CLASSIC WHEN IT COMES TO SHARDING**. The main reasons are outlined above. Sharding is a technology that's easily configurable for the given use cases and classic and retail are VASTLY different use cases.
---
This is fantastic, everyone should have this in a frame on their desk
---
I think most people playing WoW Classic will actually be retail WoW players specifically because it requires a subscription which they'll have. 
---
And I doubt retail WoW players will have trouble leveling quickly in Classic. It's not like it's hard or anything.

 &lt;Ascendants&gt; - Alliance \[NA West - PVP Server\] Semi-Hardcore PVE + PVP Guild General Introduction: Welcome to Ascendants, we are a group of semi hardcore PvE/PvP players that are looking to start a guild in preparation for Classic World of Warcraft. We are currently recruiting new members before release and are welcoming players that are: 1. Willing to learn and work with a team, 2. Enthusiastic and Friendly, 3. Just be a good guild member and do what you are supposed to do. We look forward to meeting you and playing with you in the future. We will decide on a realm once the game is released or whenever a realm list will be made available. Raid times will more than likely be around 9pm PST, but the days will be determined at a later date and will take into consideration the vast majority of players available. The loot system that we will be using will be loot by council. Whether you are experienced at WoW or just starting out it doesn't matter, we can learn together. Contact me through PM on discord at A13X#3733 or respond to this post as I will be checking it regularly.

---
You're right, except the discussion then shifts to "why these numbers" instead of "why this person". Examples include:
---
* why is this item's minimum bid the same as that other item's minimum bid while being clearly inferior
---
* why does participating in that raid count as much as this other raid while we did this and that
---
* why is it fair that we get the same amount of DKP when I do more damage/heal etc. than the other players
---
* what about players colluding to place minimum bids on DKP, that's bs 
---
* I don't think it's fair that you should give DKP for that
---
* I don't think it's fair that you shouldn't give DKP for that
---
* I am not going to do that unless you give DKP for it 
---
&gt;Contrary what some people would wish to believe, enchanting is a money sink at every stage of the game
---
Absolutely not true. Because you can disenchant max level epix on a L1 enchanting. So, if you look at like 2man DME runs, the blues give 1.5-3g while shards are around 4-5g each. You are right on that not every GREEN should be disenchanted, but if you are doing a lot of runs, it still might be worth it to save time (and bag space).
---
If you get like 3-5 blues, the difference can be around 9-10g/reset. 5 resets a hour is your target... 40-50g/h, divided by 2 results up to 20-25g / hour EXTRA per person. Add herbs, mining nodes, runes and the normal drop gold, maybe a book.... it results in quite nice g/hour.
---
If DME is your main gold supply, enchanting will boost your gold/hour by a quite a bit. You dont have to do ANYTHING to levelup, no gold, items or time invested. And you can wait until max level just to pick it up if needed. You could do like skinning while leveling and then change to enchanting. You can do  first \~70 levels just by disenchanting, if you want to go further after that, thats up to you.
---
But for mara its not worth it, since mara is so low level, the blues wont give large brilliant shards. Getting them ghost mushrooms IS a good idea.

 **&lt;Senile Chieftains&gt;** | EU Pvp Server, Horde | Casual pve raiding guild     
---
**Introduction**    
---
"Senile Chieftains" is made for people who would like to see all the classic raid content (again), but are not able or willing to spend 8 nights a week playing. Of our 4 raids that we will run every week, we only expect you to attend 1. There are options available for people who would like to raid multiple days / multiple chars.    
---
Senile Chieftains is made by ex raiders who have grown to old to raid to many evenings a week. Back in vanilla we cleared aq40 until the 'twin emperors', but because of the "tbc" release the guild disbanded.  One of our officers has all the tbc server first under his belt up to kil'jaeden. So you can expect a mature and experienced raid environment    
---
**Expectations from members**   
---
We are looking for experienced and skilled players to realize our goal of clearing all classics raid content. New players are also welcome, but keep in mind that most of our players are now 30 years and older so we will have a more mature guild environment.      
---
**Raid information**  Raiding days will be Mon-Thur 20:00 - 23:00 (server time). Once available, we will run organized raids on off days for lower tier content for alts and those who want to complete their tier/bis sets. Loot will be distributed by a loot council aided by a hidden dkp system.    
---
Contact Kyte#1707 on discord for more information!

**&lt;For Fun&gt; - EU - Horde - PvP Server - Casual Raiding Guild**
---
**Raid Times**
---
Wednesday and Saturday: 20:00-23:00 (Server Time/CET) 
---
You are not required to make both raid days every week. We respect that you will have commitments in real life and understand that comes first!
---
**Introduction**
---
For Fun is going to be a more casually and social orientated raiding guild as Horde on a PvP server. This means we will raid and aim to clear all content, but on a more relaxed schedule and mindset. This means we accept people of any class or spec, even if it’s considered sub-par. The social aspect of the guild is also very important to us. For too long on retail the sense of community has died in the game and it is a shame. We hope to remake the original sense of community within our guild so even if you don’t raid, you have a home where you can have fun and make friends. There will be social events like hide and seek, fashion competitions, catfish dules and also a Stormwind streaking competition, all with prizes! We also have set up a retail guild on Emeriss Horde if you would like to come and hang there! Most of us rerolled without heirlooms and hope to get to know each other before Classic comes out.
---
**Expectations**
---
A casual and relaxed raid environment.
---
A friendly atmosphere both in and outside of raids.
---
Social events available for all guild members at any level (with prizes!).
---
An experienced and mature leadership team.
---
A “for fun” attitude to everything in the game. That is what games are for after all!

[the only home i'd ever choose](https://i.imgur.com/k0MtvlD.jpg)
---
buddy, you need like 10-20 people with over 5 fps to raid in vanilla. 
---
same on a PVE server.
---
On a PVP server that's a whole different story it's a god damn warzone
---
I’m not 100% on this but I’m pretty sure you could take advantage of the mobs outside of dungeons. For example outside of the deadmines there is lots of mobs/elites which often take a group. AOEing those down as a trio could potentially be beneficial 
---
No, its how playing an MMO at launch works. 
---
If you wanna sit and click an apple for 5 hours, go for it. That's your choice. But don't demand the entire game get changed because of your stupid decision 
---
Every company is always about cutting costs. This isn't a new thing.
---
it absolutely has something to do with how taxing it is. 
---
There's a very clear load difference between 80 people using 4 different aoes being updated every 0.02s. And 80 people using their 1 aoe that gets updated once at the start of each cast. 
---
Tbh they could just release new servers as they become necessary. Like start with 5 or so and then when they are all full start adding 1 or 2 more and see how it works. 
---
Worst case scenario the 2 new servers don’t get enough population and they either merge them or let them die. But alas 5 healthy servers and 1 dead 1 is better than starting out with 10 servers and ending up with all low pop in the end. 
---
IMO of course...
---
Retail is "playable" on integrated graphics, I healed some m+ on 15fps on a ~5 year old intel i5. On a sub-720p render scale ofc. Got like 4-8 fps in raids though (still doable on heroic farm) 
---
In the classic client its probably gonna be very slightly better so like you could get a shitty pc vanilla experience if there was no other choice. 
---
Blasted Lands, I could listen to the thunder all day.
---
"The entire game get changed" maybe overdoing it much? 
---
Anyway, insults don't substitute arguments ;)
---
What do you think content is developed for, if not to be played? 
---
If the way an MMO is launched results in people not being able to do content unless taking 100x the time it's supposed to take then it's a badly handled launch, not the players' fault for choosing to play content that is explicitly developed to be played. 
---
If classic fails, blizzard dies.
---
And every player that plays classic is $15 a month. If they can capture even a small fraction of the 12 million subs they had, that's totally worth it. 
---
I played in the beta on my brother's account, in 2004, so I must have been 12!
---
Always thought he said "Atleast I ain't chicken". Does he say Have? Ain't chicken would fit the situation :o.

---
Hey dude, this is wonderful work! Would I be able to use these in the background on my monitors for some YouTube videos? 
---
They give a lot of XP and can be killed as long as you have a healer or a tank. So that'd be a quite good place to farm.
---
But at launch it might not be, since it'll be swarming with people
---
A large server has a total population of around 40k players. Trying to fit all those players in at launch wont work. In the current world all of them WILL try to logg in at the same time. Hence you NEED sharding (at launch, and only at launch)
---
With sharding you can split those 40k people in to 10-20 shards and get them through the starting zone, as if they were on any old 4k pop server.
---
After a few days, up to a week. You can turn off sharding, because the players have actually started sleeping/working again, dropping the total online population to about 10-20% of the total server population 
---
I'm partial to Darnassus NE was my favourite race in wc3 and seeing it for the first time was amazing.
---
I think they'd be more likely to have a fortnite parody where little kids are turning into flossing zombies slowly walking around flossing as they moan weeeee loikkkke fortnitteee converting other people to mindlessly follow the popular games. 
---
Stonetalon Peak is beautiful too!
---
That's not true, but it was harder  to respec in Diablo 2.
---
Buddy, 10k pop is fucking nothing when you consider the 10 million+ players that will play at launch. 
---
Blizzard can run 10k servers just fine. But they dont want dynamic mob spawns, node spawns ect. Its not Classic to have every mob in the game spawn every 0.3 seconds at launch. Black lotus spawning every 10 minutes is not classic either. 
---
Lets say we let in 10k people at launch. Lets say they stay on for 8 hours to level. Do you think other people will wait 8 hours to get in, or find a different server?
---
After 8 hours, 8k people log off, 2k people decide to join the now free sever. You've now got a total population of 12k. In 1 week this server will likely have an online population of 1-2k 
---
If you want the online population to be more than that, you're gonna want sharding at launch. Because letting in 40k people without dynamic mob spawns, is retarded beyond anything you can imagine. 
---
Kharanos most definitely. The odd booking of a room in Ironforge now and again would be nice too

**&lt;Pertento&gt;** 
---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE with a social atmosphere**
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, we may also try to **vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Wed/Sun 20:00 - 24:00 CET (with Monday an extra raid day for progression)

What is this? World of roguecraft but for poor people?
---
He's had chicken. It's the reason he was afk in the first place. 
---
We had public bidding with *some* loot priority, mainly around tanking gear.
---
Also if an item dropped for the first time, second-specs were not expected to bid. On the rare ocassions this happened, the RL would usually ignore the bid, since this was counter-intuitive to raid progression.
---
Was 14 during beta, 15 at EU release. Pretty much half my life ago :o Damn.
---
If the population limit will be low enough then it should be fine as is. Especially with the sort-of-autocomplete system that it had. Would be fun if Blizzard for the lulz troll us on "day one" listing black lotuses or azerite and stuff like that. Or you go to MC and everything is frost and blue-recolored for a day.
---
I had more fun jumping over that crevice on a 60% mount more than anything. You had to time it just right but you eventually are able to learn to do it every time. I felt like a jumping God around ironforge.
---
Also. Good. Defense against horde invaders causing lag on our old pcs
---
And even a 2.5k server requires you let in like 20k+ people at launch. So sharding is actually really healthy.

The average active player to online ratio is 10-20% in most mmos

YES damnit, wanted to highlight that one too. This is the one that sold it.
---
life's too short to read quests
---
When you're leveling, you'll still probably want to avoid elite NPCs. The mage will be doing the bulk of the aoe damage but you won't have the Mana pool for it. A good place early on may be the silithus eggs in southern barrens around lv 20-24. They're a pain solo so most people avoid that area, but with VW and healing it should be easy. Later on silithid in shimmering flats. Pretty much any camp of murlocs, spider nests, or slimes. Caves or tunnels will be your friend. Mages don't usually aoe solo there because you have limited mobility and respawns block your exit. But as long as you have heals VW to round up and the lock can dot runners it should be good. 
---
My mind is blown.
---
You're talking to someone who has been farming gold for 2 years during Retail Vanilla, and 2 years on pservers.
---
You're dreaming if you think DEing in Mara or DME will make any profit.
---
Since everyone and their dog is DEing things in Mara, DME, and level 60, all the corresponding mats for enchanting at those levels, including Illusion dust for lvl 60 items, become *rock bottom* pricing because the market is so flooded with it.
---
It becomes extremely close to exact vendor price. You can even buy Nexus crystals (the "epic" quality shards) for only a few gold... because the market is so flooded with them.
---
Again, please pick enchanting, it will just further crash prices and make everything cheaper for everyone else.
---
I have no dog in this race, I don't care what people do. But if you want to make money and save yourself the money sink, you should skip enchanting unless you really like the flavor of it.
---
This was never supposed to be about DKP vs. LC, but I'll bite.
---
DKP is very very good at being transparent. The rules are (probably) very clear, I know how my competition is in relation to me, and I know my contributions are being noticed. 
---
With LC you only have vague ideas of these. The risk of decisions being made on feelings rather than reality, situations of the squeaky wheel getting the grease, and unearned preferential treatment is way more pronounced in LC. That risk translates to drama.
---
You called DKP an "arbitrary number system devised by humans". I agree. But it's an arbitrary number system we put value into. Money is the same.
---
My most recent guild used DKP up until Naxx at which point we swapped to Loot Council. I didn't care at all because I knew this was a guild I could trust. But when joining the guild I simply couldn't get nearly as clear of an idea of what I was signing up for.
---
So by your logic, because ironfoes proc rate isnt know, you cannot trust in any dps numbers (on weapons that dont have that kind of proc rates).
---
And the OP specifically WANTED to compared DPS. If you use the same private server data, both of them are based on same % of error in the data. Still it would be the best and most accurate estimation of the differences.
---
Boss magic resistances wont matter in this context (unless bosses have holy resistance, making a ret paladin WAY worse).
---
&gt; Since everyone and their dog is DEing things in Mara. 
---
It would help if you would read the comment before answering.
---
I started out at the age of 14 was turning 15 that same year, since I live in Sweden and we had that sweet release in Feb 2005. 
---
Loktar Ogar
---
you'reth
---
their modern systems can't handle it easily.
---
If I recall it correct there was an Streamer event where they tried to battle 40vs40. It was not possible to play anymore and it crashed.
---
so people are worried. And I can understand them.
---
You assume
---
&gt; which by all means they will since it's pretty clear they understand how important community is to Vanilla
---
but this is a thing about money. And we all know who's behind Blizzard holding the reins.
---
Big blue dress, paladin edition.
---
Only true wow fans play Bfa classic.
---
Stupid retail wow players with their level 500 cap and their Murloc race and undead army summoning necromancer class. Don't even get me started on the new "MMO experience 1 man dungeons" where 39 npcs form a raid with you and lead you through huge boss battles. Since Wows population dropped below the 50,000 mark in 2030 there wasnt enough players to actually form raids.
---
Ahh the good old bfa days where Facebook didn't buy out blizzard and integrate Facebook best features into wow. 
---
Yep have a look at the topic, there is a download link for the originals there :)
---
**&lt;No Plan Required&gt;** is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server. If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
**What to expect**
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it.
---
Although we are strictly against approaching the game with a crazy min-maxing mindset, we still hope to establish an atmosphere where the raiders will not miss out on the end-game experience and have the opportunity to show their capabilities. This means that all members who wish to raid are expected to arrive fully prepared and according to the schedule. We will be progression raiding 2 nights a week. Unorthodox specs such as Retribution and Feral are allowed, but are expected to work as hard as they can to retain the respective balance of participation in our raiding core.
---
We often hang out &amp; play internet games once or twice a week for fun.
---
Raid dates: To be decided
---
Raid times: 7:50 PM GMT
---

There is already a download link for the originals shots on the page (no logos).
---
&gt; This was never supposed to be about DKP vs. LC, but I'll bite.
---
I know and I'm sorry.
---
&gt;  The risk of decisions being made on feelings rather than reality
---
It's the same with DKP, except the feelings translate into DKP points rather than actual opinions. How "we" feel that items are worth, how much attendance is worth, where it matters, how much do we reward everything in terms of everything else etc. 
---
Personal bias isn't just a negative thing that should be avoided, it probably is the source of this system's strength. The problem is that it's impossible to anticipate all the situations which are evidently detrimental to your guild and adapting DKP after every mishap weakens the confidence people have in it. The difference is that, whereas with LC I can correct that error *before* the situation occurs, with DKP I can only correct it after it occurs (else it's just LC all over again, with random changes in the rules when it suits our needs).  
---
With the time invested in order to devise a real, worthwhile objective metric that everyone can agree with on every raid content, you might as well refine and drive your Loot Council process.
---
Hey Chimly no worries. If you could give me a shout out in return I’d appreciate it :)
---
Don't play an MMO, then. Not everything needs to be catered to you. High demand creates competition. Competition creates social interaction. Eliminate competition, and there's no reason to talk to other people. Why play an MMO at that point? 
---
Virgin minmaxer spotted. 
---
Yeah I know I messed that up.
---
If you want you can remake that one - the original screens are available as a download, as is the transparent background logo :)
---
Shitting on dreams is the norm 
---
They should make one of these where chad is the one who just plays the game he/she wants to, virgin is the one complaining on how others enjoy the game. 
---
I'd prefer one of the peaceful montainous areas. A house by the lake in Loch Modan perhaps. Sitting by the hearth looking out on a heavy rainfall. 
---
The fool got shamed into deleting. Good job. 
---
Pally is pretty much my favorite Class but I will NEVER wear fucking Cloth (at least not something thats noticable). The point of a fucking Pally is that you are a Healer in Plate! If I want to fucking wear Cloth I roll a fucking priest!
---
I'm on an entire other continent than all those zones. 
---
Wpvp is a thing high level players do to kill lowbies.
---
they could still merge servers when all of the "visitors that quit" are gone.
---
16 - spent my "youth" in WoW and never regreted it. Now, 15 years later I will come back with my GF. Will be great.
---
Absolutely this. I actually miss RP'ing in vanilla. There was something really immersive about the dangerous world of Azeroth that made you feel like you were actually there and invested.
---
It wasn't 500, it was closer to 40 +- 20 horde. The current wow servers stutter at 10 active players, they break at 20. I blame all the micro hidden damage shit they did with procs over procs. In vanilla you press a button you see damage, less inputs, less traffic to handle. They're digging their own grave and it's not even good gameplay.
---
the last boss only works if u didnt merge the egg first tho right?
---
I never bothered to run it if I didnt have someone who knew how to do it all
---
On that server all the numbers were adjusted to population. So although it did open 4 weeks later, a very large portion of it happened within first few days, which exceeded retail vanilla numbers anyway.
---
It really is a guess work. Although private server will probably overall have a more hardcore player base compared to classic server, it has no competition, since all the players on it will gain access to it at same time. 
---
Back in retail there was months of differences between opening of AQ between servers and this can be enough to motivate hardcore guild to stimulate gatherings (just like it happened in retail vanilla, just can happen and will happen earlier).
---
I started playing wow when I was 12 back in TBC and I'm 23 now. I think it's a good time to start but they probably won't always know what's going on, it's just a great adventure. Don't expect them to hit 60.
---
This place is constantly raided by gankers. Whole zone is unplayable for it

---
I mean, all of those are fairly simple tasks, and today's cpu's can handle a few hundred thousand of those events in a second(citation needed, but I'm fairly confident). Combat would be the most demanding, traffic-wise, but even that has been since optimized in wow's legion engine. Realistically, there shouldn't be any issues if 600 level 1's are together in a zone, where combat consists of auto attack + 1 ability.
---
Played on that server from vanilla -&gt; WoTLK. Great server!
---
Tips: Have we talked about cross-realm?
---
Esfand: Yeah, I know for me, I’ve said before I **don’t like cross-realm.** They were a necessity for Burning Crusade, right? I think while I don’t like them, Staysafe has brought up in the past that they may be a necessary evil.
---
Nano: If I had to guess, they’ll go with cross-realm - which I think is a loss in some ways. I liked playing against the same people over and over again and knowing their names and tendencies...
---
Yeah, doesn’t sound like a glowing endorsement from Esfand or Nano. Just an honest concession that Blizzard *probably* will go for them. No need for this post, this attempted character assassination on Classicast. 
---
Booty Bay! 
---
14, Vanilla. 
---
Now get ME a job 
---
I think that's actually the phone, looks like the Energizer Power Max P18K Pop, battery advertised to last a week of use
---
PvE is so goddamn easy because of the minmaxing. I remember when we used 2 evenings of 4 hours to clear MC. That shit happened exactly because ppl didn't know how to play and how to minmax.
---
if you want to play a full plate healer, please you're welcome to do so :) nobody forces the two of us to play together after all

**About us:** 
---
Mok’ra! &lt;Guild&gt; is recruiting new members to join our core group of players in the upcoming Classic WoW. Our team has experienced members spanning across WoW’s timeline and we are looking for enthusiastic players to join us and create a tight-knit raiding community. Becoming part of &lt;Guild&gt; is an opportunity to play with others who share your passion for vanilla and want to be involved in the raiding scene. We’re also rolling up on a PvP server, despite our PvE goals. You might think that you’d rather roll on a filthy PvE server to do PvE, but in the words of a man far wiser than any of us, 
---
You think you do, but you don’t.
---
**Our Goals:** 
---
\- Upon the launch of Classic, we’ll be aiming to hit level 60 within a couple of months and start gearing up in dungeons. We understand this won’t be possible for everyone, so we will be lenient on this, and help people out where we can. However, we do expect people to be levelling regularly and making progress consistently, even if this is a little slower than ideal. 
---
\- We are planning on progressing through the end-game dungeons, then jumping into Molten Core and going from there, doing raids as they come. 
---
\- We aim to try our best and clear as much vanilla content as possible. The most important part is having fun, but also working as a team. It’s rarely “That one guys” fault every time and we will openly communicate to improve our strategy.
---
**Expectations:** 
---
\- A willingness to learn and do your best. 
---
\- Actually showing up! 
---
\- Putting in the effort to have what you need and turning up prepared. This is really important to ensure nobody is wasting the rest of the player’s time.
---
**Schedule:** 
---
\- The days will be chosen closer to release. 
---
\- Time will be 7:00PM GMT and include a break for 10 minutes at 9:00PM to keep everyone at their best. 
---
We will be using Discord as our recruitment platform pre-release and as a communication hub throughout the game. Feel free to PM the Guild Leader (Orinus#1430) or Recruitment Officer (Trauzek#7247) for any queries and join our discord server: [https://discord.gg/ssmBJe](https://discord.gg/ssmBJe)
---
BiS.
---
You keep using that word, I do not think it means what you think it means.
---
no you don't. you need 10-20 minmaxers to raid in vanilla, but if you have 40 chads in game, Vaelastrastz is gonna rip your ass. I enjoy the meme, but the idea that chad is gonna "mop the floor with horde scum anyways" is just false. He's one of those freeloot targets that the minmax hardcore players enjoy so much playing against ;)
---
*Woah!* It's your **7th Cakeday** iicipher! ^(hug)
---
Instant on main hand, deadly on off hand. That's what I remember at least.
---
&gt;Buddy, 10k pop is fucking nothing when you &gt;consider the 10 million+ players that will play at &gt;launch.
---
Do you honestly think we'll reach 10 mil? 
---
I think you're living in fantasy land. I'd be surprised if we reach 5 mil at launch and I expect less than 1 mil after a year.
---
&gt;forces you to grind extra 100g on top of all the consumables for PvPers that want to do BGs.
---
It doesn't force you. You could either use a PvE/PVP or a pure PVE spec for pvp. It is up to you.
---
Website is down, any imgur album links?
---
While it does look cool, save ur DKP during T1 and spend it on T2 or crazy bis items.
---
Few t1 Pieces are great
---
that would not make any sense to me. why would you do that?
---
auberdine
---
god DAMN it Leeroy!
---
I believe it's something to do with proc rates. Main hand procs more so you get more value out of instant, off-hand procs less so you'd want it to deal damage over time until it procs again. Might be bs, but that's what I remember.
---
Thanks my firend! 
---
"Don't play an MMO" because someone wants to play content that has been explicitly designed for the early game rather than skip it? Doesn't make any sense.
---
Content being able to be done in the timeframe that it's supposed to be done (or with still reasonable overtime in peak hours) has nothing to do with anything being "catered to me", nothing at all. 
---
And how does one eliminate competition from one's own faction? 
---
And no, the always demanded "social interaction" doesn't solve problems neither with certain quests where objectives don't count group-wide or when there's just a sheer overwhelming amount of players, like 300 people trying to get Sarkoth. Good luck to your 60 groups, you better queue up in a neat line. 
---
If South Park did another episode, they would probably do it to mock adults who want to relive their childhood. Because that's what South Park does. 
---
I can't wait to hit level 10 on my Druid, teleport to Moonglade and just sit there watching the lake whilst that music plays. 
---
Hell yes I'm going to RP. 
---
&lt; It was possible to skip several packs of trash and wall-walk directly to  Gehennas. A guild was allegedly permanently banned for doing this,  which caused a lot of concern in top guilds at the time and years after  about whether skipping trash is ok or not, something that had almost  become a standard in the later years. &gt;
---
Not an exploit
---
&lt; Although never announced as an exploit by Blizzard, aside from  conflicting reports by Game Masters, you were able to mindcontrol a  Scarshield Spellbinder in Blackrock Spire to gain 75 fire resistance on  the entire raid for one hour. This helped significantly not only on  Ragnaros, but on every boss that did fire damage. The spell was nerfed  sometime in 2007 so it didn't impact any world firsts after that. I've  personally used this for several first kills in guilds I've played in,  and it was commonly used by guilds who thought it was worth the trouble  to be able to get those first kills. I would argue that it was almost  more common than not to do this, which opens up an interesting argument  about Ensidia's mindcontrolling of adds on Hodir for a buff many years  later (guess who coined the term Flower Power btw?!)&gt;

&lt; Or you could simply not bother with it and just kill the boss. What not  many people knew about but what I discovered was that if you were moving  while he was casting Blood Funnel, it would not affect you.  &gt;
---
patched
---
&lt; Something else that was common on Azuregos (and other fights) was to  have two healing teams to manage the use of mana. Team 1 would heal  until they were oom, and then proceed to run away from the boss until  they were out of combat, while Team 2 would take over. Team 1 would then  sit down and drink themselves full, to join in later when Team 2 needed  a drinking break. &gt;
---
so many of these are not exploits
---
Small addition to Nef, you could also hide behind his throne to avoid his breath. On Un'goro we killed Nef fast then Ragnaros with only the mt and two healers equiped with the cloak. But yeah, will be funny to see how the exploits work out, when Vanilla is live again.
---
Well played.
---
Trolls are the min/max race for shamans though..
---
We have a boomkin in our guild. Our guild consists of crapton of druids (for some reason), yet only one of them decided to go the hard route and be a boomkin (to my knowledge). Now, watching him hop on a ship in Theramore means that you KNOW he is a boomkin. Not just for that trip, not just that day, but probably since he was leveling, or at the very least, for a few weeks.
---
I've choosen to almost max out the feral tree. I've got all the bear tanking talents maxed out, even in the same tree level, like I have both the armor and the +threat talents. I've also unlocked the cat talents. This makes me REALLY bad at PvP and healing, but makes me pretty good tank. People know that. 
---
I'm different from the other druids in my guild who go half resto, half feral.
---
With zero costs I would lose all that.
---
That's a very strange context for RP server justification.
---
If private servers can keep tons of people at the same time and still be playable than Blizzard can as well - and if fact they did manage to do that before but for some reason nowadays when they see more than 40 people at the same place the crap the absolute shit of their pants and start sharding it - because of this events like the gnome marathon cant even come close to what they were before
---
I was 11 years old when I started playing. 
---
I actually think you're going to see a resurgence of rp, and not just the stuff that happens in Goldshire.
---
This is because the pre-cata world doesn't lead you down a path. The zones don't have their own story, and as such they are more accommodating to RP. There's much more hidden-away stuff in the old world too, which makes people go out to those places and use them for rp. The fact that travel is way more restrictive is also accommodating for rp.  
---
Essentially: The return of RPG mechanics and design encourages RP. These things have been taken away in retail wow.
---
Yes, our kind of virgin! 
---
If you take a look at the guilds currently being advetised now, you'll see that the majority are leaning towards a casual atmosphere anyway
---
Very very few people who RP actively on Retail currently are going to prefer RP on Classic.  Some may make alts, most won't even try.
---
Basis on my assumption, I read the retail forums regarding this topic frequently.  They love their toys, they can make RP characters the day before to fit their stories and all kinds of preferable stuff.
---
The best thing about the old AV was, that it was incredibly rewarding to group up with 4 other people and do objectives like mines, flight masters, wolves, and other objectives that weren't a part of the main path in AV, but helped you progress in favor of your faction nonetheless.
---
a life of Chuck Norris jokes awaits
---
100% agreed. Cannot wait to actually feel immersed in the world again. I miss the danger, I miss the world feeling so big, I miss the adventure.
---

---
Doesn't matter for me. More chumps = better for the hardcore in perspective. Cheaper enchant mats, more crashed market.
---
But I would never give the advice you're giving to a friend.
---
&gt; only certain classes
---
How so?
---
this looks like it will be pretty useful once i figure out how to use it, thanks
---
At least they are fighting for something to get the game as close to the original as possible. While everyone else takes Blizzards changes like candy from the dude in the white van. 
---
I would argue that non-'pro elitists' will enjoy classic more than the elitists.  
---
Vanilla doesn't cater much to the hardcore. Over half of the meat of the game is 'casual' leveling and 5-man content.
---
Human male laugh will always remind me of this dude we played a bit with in the beginning of vanilla. He was a human mage, and said 'haha' a lot, which made his character laugh.
---
One day, he showed up five levels above us (we where about 18 or whatever level you are at in redridge) with a shiny new red hat!
---
He laughed, the procedeed to pull two gnoll camps and tried to blizzard them down and died.
---
One of the parts that I liked was “Guys, when things look bad, you can't just give up on the world...of Warcraft.” If people lived by that, more would be playing BFA.

purepwnage episode of wow got me into wow. Worth a watch

Woid Walkers?
---
You're basing the estimations on incorrect data, this is the exact opposite of being scientific. It is completely pointless.
---
They are a fix for a single problem, yes. While creating 100 others in the process.
---
A huge reason WoW was ever successful is because it was far more casual than its competitors such as EQ.  If you'd like to see what a hard core cratered MMO life cycle looks like, research Wildstar's history and notice the servers are shutdown.
---
[I guess it just doesn't like me](https://i.imgur.com/L6I2XHt.png)
---
Yeah, I guess it wouldn’t have to be a full episode, just a reference to it would be cool too. 
---
I feel like AOE levelling will be much more difficult to make work than people are expecting. Without dynamic respawns, the bugged clearcasting talent that people have become used to, and how populated the levelling zones will be - i think it will be really difficult to lock down a zone and tag all of the mobs.  
---
Unarmed Spellpower Paladin ;)
---
LFG raiding Sunday-Thursday starting at 10:00pm EST will play a resto shaman or warlock.
---
Yeah, I could see them go with a theme about Nostalgia or something to make fun of it. And of course they would add in other random ideas of their own creation. Just a reference in an episode would be cool. 
---
Grom'gol base camp 
---
I don't get it. You think people are going to look at a PvP server that's 70% Alliance and think "Looks good for rolling Horde!", or vice versa?
---
If anything I would have thought showing the faction ratio would make the problem worse as everyone either chose the dominant faction or just rolled on a different server.
---
I’m afraid not, sorry :( my monitor isn’t high enough resolution and my GPU isn’t poweful enough to simulate it through driver software either.
---
You could if you wanted get the original screens, grab the transparent background logo (this is high enough res for you) here: https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=5&amp;t=870
---
And then scale up the screenshot and then add the logo. You’ll lose some quality on the screenshot but hey worth a try.
---
At 2:23 you see that all the action bars are filled with rend and mortal strike :')
---
I always felt around Lv30 was good for me.  Would start grinding a bit more and my class was flushed out.  Imo if you can't make grinding fun on a class than its not going to be your main.  But that's just me.
---
What? You won't be having any fun with *THAT* attitude. If you're not planning on min-maxing the perfect build whether or not you find it fun, using guides to help you no life your way to 60 as fast as possible starting the first second of launch so I can be server first in every raid. Btw, this will give me several years of enjoyment unlike you all. You all will get bored ganking, questing, doing instances, doing open world dungeons, battlegrounds, trying different classes and builds and making friends. /s
---
I'd say by level 20, around then you've probably played enough to know how you feel about your choice. Even if some classes have core abilities down the line, after like westfall or the barrens I'd say is the area where you would know we'll enough
---
And its such a shame. Wildstar had some serious potential!
---
A guild disbanded on my server during tbc in part because the GM was a ret pally that called for innervate during one of the bosses in SSC. It was the last straw, and afterwards the guy was a serverwide joke; I think he transferred because of it. 
---
Healers and tanks have massive disadvantage compared to any DPS class when it comes to solo farming and world PvP with PvE spec. For example Warlock with SL/Ruin spec will never have to respec because it is amazing in both PvE and PvP.
---
Fight 1v1 like a man
---
Keyboard turning, furry spec, no grenade, rarely using bandage, no life stone gem...
---
We can see “Played perfectly” in the dialogue with the rogue (who is in combat spec btw).
---
Guess it was a lie!
---
Why are people even afraid of another server getting aq before them? If getting classic-first c'thun is so important to them they can farm and stockpile all of that stuff themselves and see how feasible it actually is.
---
Go ahead, go to arathi and farm raptor meat. That's actually one of the easier ones to complete but let us know how many of the 1000 stacks you have after 4  or 5 hours of farming. 
---
Man, I miss DB back in vanilla. Awesome server!
---
Do you want to raid? Do you want to tank, heal, or dps? Are you going alliance or horde? Do you intend to PvP? If you want to dps do you want to be a ranger dps or melee? Answer all of these questions and it should boil down to 2 classes. By level 20 you will know if you like the feel.
---
I'm not advocating for or against anything.. but even if a barbershop is 5-10g per line item or change that can still add up as a lot of gold for most players. so it wouldn't have to be like 500g..
---
as for guild banks, I have a group of friends playing casually with maybe some new friends along the way. one likes to farm and she said she would donate to the gbank. I told her we probably won't have one since no current gbanks and I don't really want to manage a gbank alt.  would I love the convenience of the gbank? yes! do I expect it or am I advocating for it? not at all.

Of course anyone wants a fast queue time, but I ain't willing to sacrifice playing with people I actually know and care about for that.
---
To me, it's absolutely no different from not wanting to run dungeons with cross-realm people. Just like I'm perfectly OK with having trouble putting a dungeon group together, having to wait for the BG queue is perfectly fine as well. It frankly upsets me that people insist that dungeons and BG's are literally any different in this regard.
---
Yeah I love how that tauren riding a kodo is just sliding forward and then suddenly warped back

Just as there are no guarantees in life, there is nothing that states you are guaranteed the perfect experience you are looking for. The players who succeed in an MMO are usually the ones who are most resourceful. If you can't find enough quest items, then go grind boars or find something else to do.
---
We might hire if you're okey with relocating, learning Swedish in a month and have basic IT knowledge (you learn at the job) :D
---
&gt; ignores population stability issues
---
This is the primary concern. I know I mentioned CPU but there's more to the hardware than that. Plus nothing says that resource usage in this case is going to expand linearly, it could be exponential. 
---
TLDR: its not as simple as "hurr durr pservers dont shard throw more CPU at it"

Thunderbluff is equally as pretty but without the spiders
---
It is though, I have no way of telling the other faction, "hey how about a jolly round of wsg" and putting together a wsg team, unlike dungeons/raids. Let them put a checkbox somewhere if you only want to play same realm bgs
---
then we could both have what we want, but don't ruin PvP for the people who are only coming back for pvp.
---
Maybe I'm insane but I always found some of the random farms in the Barrens really chill. Sun Rock was also very cool but it felt sooo out of the way that it'd be more of a holiday destination.
---
I would move to Sweden in a heartbeat 
---
You don’t have to have retail to play. Just a subscription.
---
Not only for the reasons but also most definetly for the seasons!
---
Loved hanging out there christmas evening talking shit with friends. The ambience is unbeatable. Good times! 
---
Let's talk about new content. Should Blizzard add new content after Naxx?!?!
---
Don't worry, it is just going to be classic wow with a shit modern morph mechanic of sharding because that is fun...
---
Sharding will co platelet ruin the classic wow feel, it is literally laughable that they want to have sharding to wow, it is such a dumb idea.
---
You are asked to compare two different classes, both using same estimated data. It STILL does show basic differences between them. There is no way of answering absolutely correctly to the question.
---
Fuck scientific, because its different players playing on different content. What is pointless is you answering to a question thats supposed to give a ESTIMATION.
---
Doesn't mention that when BWL first came out you could use the "freeze egg" quest item on Razergore's eggs, thus skipping phase 1 completely
---
Unfortunately, we don't allow the advertising of merchandise, so your post was auto-removed by our bot.

By all means, go slow and enjoy yourself!

Exactly...
---
30-40
---
Name was probably taken.
---
An estimation based on false data is pointless. I'm not sure what's so hard to understand.
---
True, if SW becomes some what of the Alliance capital. It'll change over time due to the seasons! :)
---
I can't wait for OP's surprised face when realized people don't talk on vanilla pservers either, and will likely wont in classic either.
---
But if that warlock wants to be a healer, he has to level an entirely new character; the priest just has to pay 50g (if he's at the cap). That's a kind of balance.
---
The Park in Stormwind City 
---
Im sure a lot of people change their professions during the content. While this could be a great thing for early content when people get tons of upgrades and need enchanting materials... later on you might want to focus on engineering.
---
Remember, your comment was "enchanting is a moneysink through the content". One lucky drop from raids and you can make truly epic amount of gold with enchanting.
---
Anyways, i did say enchanting isnt worth for maraudon and this what this thread was about.
---
Anyway to get these without the logo in the middle?
---
I have no idea who these streamers are and am a fervent XRBG supporter. 
---
I'd be chilling in Auberdine. Had my Hearth set there for as long as I could remember just for the hell of it. 
---
Very interested in this and just posting because current raid times won't work for me as an EST player but if you end up changing it lmk. Plan on tanking and bringing some newbie friends with me. 
---
Just gone 17, half way through what we call sixth form in the UK (last two years of high school, but it's optional, or was)  Spent most nights online until the early hours, WoW probably played a large part in not getting the best results. No real life mates played really, had a few cross over mates from Runescape and that was about it. 
---
Used to shelf seeing my girlfriend on Tuesday nights as it was raid night, much to her annoyance. 
---
Was a bit late to the party being early 2006, played until a few months into TBC then sacked it off as just didn't have the time as I had started working full time. Had a 62 Dwarf Hunter and my pet was named after my real life cat at the time (only died a few months ago, sadly)
---
30 years old now and more excited than ever now. My scenario over the next few months is relatively unknown as I'm travelling with my partner and my stop over "summer" will be New Zealand. 
---
Strange re-immersing myself into a game I played when I was very much a naive young lad. I just know certain areas and quests will strike some real life nostalgia as well as digital and it will be a pleasure going through for a second time as a fully fledged adult (or close to one, anyway) 
---
I can add that on pserver, the Emberstrife disguise for the Ony attunement does not get broken by shapeshift.
---
Thanks for the information (and sorry for the misinformation)! I will edit my post so people don't get the wrong idea
---
those 12 million subs were wotlk though.
---
I don't think you can afford such an apartment. 
---
Thats really not what I see. I see much more hc guilds than casual. 
---
WHAT DID IT SAY, THE SHAME WAS LIVE ON
---
He's only a proponent of #NoChanges when it's a change he doesn't want 
---
Well, it's easy to say that now, but it's not really that stupid of a decision in context.  I remember the thrill of trying to play as soon as possible, and there is something special about that too.  Sure, playing on the second or third day is unique in its own way too, so playing then and with a CE would have been better overall, but it sounds like there was a decent likelihood you would have ended up with no CE even if you had waited, and that would be the worst possible outcome.
---
Maybe this is all just rationalization, but eh, I've done this a lot because one of the most important things I've learned over the years since Classic WoW is that regret is a horribly nasty thing.
---
Undercity or bust. Vibrant colours &lt;3
---
YOU are misleading us, not Blizzard. Why, you ask? Well, because you (and many other like you) seem to "forget" the OTHER BIG ASS REASONS for sharding at launch : THE CLASSIC REALMS POPULATION after the tourists leave.
---
Ion Hazzikostas clearly stated that sharding at launch is to ensure a healthy realm population after tourists leave.
---
We have no idea how many of those playing in the first 1-2 weeks are tourists, but there will be A LOT of them, easily HALF of the total players at launch.
---
Sharding is the ONLY RELIABLE solution to servers stability, game play experience, lag, queues, AND population. You can't just simply IGNORE one of the reasons, and make stupid assumption, just because you like tin foil conspiracies and you hate Blizzard.
---
The median population of a Vanilla realm back in 2006 was around 10,000 players, with a concurrent cap of 2,500 players. Blizzard CANNOT DO THE SAME for Classic without sharding for the first few weeks, simply because in the first few weeks the TOTAL player population will have to be EQUAL with the CONCURRENT player CAP : 2,500.
---
If the Classic realms LAUNCH with 2,500 player cap (as it was in Vanilla), and assuming a MINIMUM of 1 million players in Day 1 , Blizzard will HAVE to launch 400 (FOUR HUNDRED) realms. And in 1-2 weeks, ALL those realms will have to be MERGED, because they will lose at least HALF the number of players after the tourists leave.
---
Those 500,000 players remaining after the tourists leave, will have to be moved on 50 realms, each with a Vanilla-like total population of 10,000 players.
---
Which means that 8 servers will be merged in one. That is beyond stupid, and IT WILL NOT HAPPEN.
---
But what if there will be 2 million players at launch and 70% of them will be tourists? Classic will have to launch with 800 fucking realms, after couple weeks 1.4 million tourists will LEAVE, and the remaining 700k players will have to be moved on 70 realms...and means 11 realms will be merged in one.
---
EVEN IF THERE WILL BE NO DAMN TOURISTS AT ALL, sharding is STILL the preferable solution, because Classic realms CANNOT start with a cap of 2,500 players as it was at the beginning of Vanilla, but with a cap of 10,000 players, as it was after couple months of Vanilla.
---
Realms will STILL have to be merged, because a Classic realm, like a Vanilla realm, MUST HAVE at the bare minimum, 7 thousand players, so you will have 1,500 players concurrent cap.
---
I am sorry, but ANY combination of numbers and percentage of tourists will ALWAYS, ALWAYS, lead to the same conclusion : Classic MUST HAVE SHARDING at launch, because if not, ALL REALMS will have to be merged, and merging is FAR WORSE than sharding.
---
There isn't a SINGLE scenario where sharding at launch is NOT the best solution. Not a single one.
---
You played vanilla. It will be the same. Good luck
---
I think it will be pretty easy. I never had full T1, but I got full T2 extremely fast.  I was server first with a full T2 set because of luck. The helm and pants were easy to get, I had those for a while.  (helm - Ony, Pants - Rag).
---
The gloves drop off of 3 bosses in BWL so every class gets those really easy.  I got lucky with getting BF shoulders and Chest on our first Chromaggus and Nefarian kill.  
---
The hardest part is just getting lucky.  I had the most DKP out of our rogues and once I had 7/8, they kinda let me get the chest piece since they knew I'd be the first character on our server with a full set. 
---
I think you'll be fine as long as you have a guild who can clear one of the raids every week. 
---
Desolace might be your best bet compared to the other choices (1k needles, Hillsbrad/Southshore which are normally heavily contested.)
---
Page quests in Ashenvale and STV.  
---
Buzzard Wing.  
---
Blue Pearl.  
---
Mithril Chasing.
---
Thorium bar, twice.
---
Golden rod.  
---
Hi-explosive bomb.  
---
Unstable trigger.
---
Yes, read the topic. There is a link to download the original screenshots.
---
I know. In vanilla leveling was fun, such a journey. The best part was grouping up and doing hard quests
---
I still have some screenies from the RP meetings the Horde had in the Gurubashi arena, where 200-250 players sat in the seats while the guildleaders made their case in the center of the arena. Afterwards, we raided Stormwind I recall.
---
EU Defias Brotherhood was awesome! Although I will play classic on RP PvE this time.
---
I'd like to know this to, I don't remember. 
---
The best part is that you can be either of these players and still find a guild suited for you. I'm sure there will be plenty of super casual, friendly guilds that raid MC and Ony on the weekends and *maybe* they'll move on to BWL eventually.
---
Hardcore guilds are fun for different reasons, you can push yourself, you have more fun when you down that boss that you've been wiping on for months because there is a lot more at stake and the pressure is greater.
---
I'll be honest, I'm not a fan of those edgy, tryhard &lt;lowercase&gt; or &lt;S P A C E S&gt; type guild names either but pretentious latin or verbose names aren't much better, though they are at least more nostalgic since that was a popular fad during vanilla and TBC.
---
So whatever style suits you best, you'll find a guild to match. So neither side is in the wrong really, just because you're in a casual guild doesn't mean you're a bad player, it might just mean you can't play much due to RL commitments. The same goes for hardcore raiders, not all of them are bratty, edgy tryhard kids who can't say a single sentence without a swear word or insulting your mother. 
---
Anyway, just wanted to point that out.
---
"Succeed in an MMO" as in doing the fucking starting zone quests that are explicitly designed to be cleared by everyone, even the greenest of newbies, in a reasonable amount of time? 
---
Once again, being able to do content the way it's intended to be done (played not skipped) has nothing to with some kind of "perfect experience"... 
---
I actually always enjoyed Alch in PVP in vanilla. It was underrated and gave the edge if used correctly. If you are wealthy enough to have Alch + Eng then you have a very strong advantage....It's just costly.
---
What do you guys think is more likely? 
---
Blizzard spending a lot of money and man power to change their servers to accommodate large scale engagements
---
Or 
---
Blizzard using their already in place sharding system, even after launch because "hey, players liked this at launch"
---
Did he change his original post? 
---
They were added at the very end of vanilla during the 2.0 patch before the expansion was actually released.
---
There were non ranked arena's that you could do just for fun, which I wouldn't be opposed to if they added that.  As long as they stay non-ranked.
---
Or atleast add team duels, 2v2 or 5v5 duels would be awesome. 
---
Absolutely love this area a secluded spot slightly hidden by the mountains always felt like such a beautiful and peaceful camp ughh memories &lt;3
---
A video of a stupid ass player that happens to play a Warrior...is not a proof of anything.
---
What IDIOT is going to PvP as a Fury Warrior? The idiot in the video.
---
Not a SINGLE PvP Warrior in Vanilla, on my realm, was Fury. Yes, people weren't very informed those days ( they are still unformed today, but that is another topic), but every single Warrior was Arms specced for PvP in Vanilla.
---
do herb/mining + skinning.  Engineering isn't too hard to level when you are already at 60. 
---
I'll be doing herb + skinning and once I hit 60, I'll swap to engineering + alchemy and just use all of my saved up herbs to level alchemy and buy the mats for engineering.
---
A successful raid leader thinks about the raid as a unit and strives for a smart distribution of both spells and gear. 
---
If the raid leader calls for an innervate on a ret pally he will never be successful. 
---
Plus it wasn't even mind control on Hodir, it was spellsteal... 
---
It was in vanilla for almost 5 months 
---
Every cooking related quest item. Westfall's boar livers are good example.
---
I think the Blasted Land's R.O.I.D.S. quest parts as well?
---
Yes. At level 1, run over to the Trolls area and do every Troll quest.  
---
Then you'll have to start saving some cloth.  It takes a long ass time to get exalted, but it's possible. 
---
Great to see stuff like this from Method. Hopefully they're interested enough about Classic to make their own guild and give a shot at some raiding, maybe as a side hobby at first but if Blizzard is smart they'll release content for Classic during the off-season in modern so that Method have the free time needed to maybe chase a world first on Classic too! That would be exciting to see!
---
It's incredible how we live in a world where tech/IT things evolve so rapdily, and even then, we manage to have worse WoW servers than we had 10 years ago.
---
Probably cause any guild recruiting several months before a game is even released is gonna be pretty tryhard 
---
But muh meters 
---
Damn... you raise some good points.  
---
If only Classic was a rerelease of a game we got almost 15 years ago, so that you can look up the way different classes play at different stages of the game and make decide for yourself.
---
Ret/Reck Paladin. I play one on a PvP server and almost never lose to a rogue, not until other people join the fight. And this is coming from a guy who played Rogue all through Vanilla.
---
If there was ever a time to use an OSRS type player voting mechanic this would be it.  No crossrealm at the start for a  while and then open it up later and servers that vote for cross mechanics can then be linked into pools.  That way if the server has good balance and community they don't have to screw up their BGs to get lumped in with random people they don't know.
---
&gt;drawing making fun of minmaxers
---
&gt;people theorycrafting minmaxing in comments
---
never change.
---
The reason you don't want to cast it is if the tank needs rage to gain threat. But during raids, a shield is crushed with 1 hit from a raid boss so it doesn't slow is rage generation much at all. 
---
well yeah, obviously, thats why I say there are more hc then casual guilds lol. 
---
&gt; Ahh the good old bfa days where Facebook didn't buy out blizzard and integrate Facebook best features into wow. 
---
Oh god I feel like.. 🤮
---
Yep!
---
It will be once Classic is out again. 
---
I'd say level 20 is a decent place to judge how a class will play. You'll have access to most of your core abilities, sure some classes get some key abilities at later levels but for basic gameplay level 20 is a good spot to judge.
---
Level 20 is also when Druids get their cat form so you'll be able to get a feel for the main form you'll be using from 20-60 until you respec.
---
And since it won't take much time at all to level to 20, even in vanilla, you can check out all the classes quite quickly.
---
The invisible ghosts in the courtyard makes it all *so much better*
---
\#WarlockPowers
---
Idd, the blasted lands quest items are tradable.  
---
I don't play alliance that much but from what I remember you also have quests that require Bronze Tube and Lesser Bloodstone Ore.
---
Hey Man. Me and my brother plan on rolling horde on PVE. We're both in Michigan(EST). Looking forward to some Tarren Mill/Southshore fun and just running dungeons and exploring Azeroth again. Maybe we can get together as the beta gets closer. 
---
How many days a week are you planning on raiding?
---
It's funny how often I've pondered this question over the years and I could never get an answer ... It's definitely the nostalgia talking but each zone always had a sense of wonder to me when I first explored it; just put me in Azeroth and I'd be happy.
---
Same here, moved to RP-PVE, not being a pvper myself (more of a pacifist, I waved to horde than fight/ganked haha) but much into RP.
---
DB was truly awesome and a great experience for a newbie like me.
---
Dude, spellsteal didn't exist on vanilla
---
Hodir was in wotlk. 
---
You’re 21 now and retail vanilla was 14 years ago. What am I missing?
---
&gt; Darnassus = Lord or the Rings without the charm
---
There we go. Much better.
---
Any chance you could make Ret Paladin BiS? Seems nobody is doing that.
---
He is what got me into WoW. I randomly started watching his videos and he makes the game seem so fun and interesting that I just had to pick it up. His videos are perfect to fall asleep to as well, very calming and not a drop of obnoxious foolery. 
---
Look, let's all be realistic here.   
---
When it comes to sharding, Blizzard are in a no-win situation. For the record, I despise sharding in it's current role, it's killed the world in my opinion. I (and I'm sure others) still remember the original release, as well as TBC/Wrath and the lag made it nearly unplayable. 
---
\- **No Sharding** \- 
---
\- Servers are going going to be bombarded on the initial release of Classic. Personally I expect this to be a bigger deal than the BFA or Legion launches with massive queues.   
---
\- Starting zones will be flooded with characters, all trying to loot and collect the same singular items. Sure, people can group up for mob kills and drops, but looting items such as the Wellstones will be a nightmare.   
---
\- Servers will crash, lag and end up rolling back. People will flock to the forums in outrage 
---
\- **Sharding** \- 
---
\- A 'dead' world. Sure, you'll see a lot of players initially, but not as many as there really are. 
---
\- Easier to lose your friends, guildies unless you're grouped with them.
---
\- It's not 'authentic'. The old world wasn't sharded and we did have to fight/gank in order to get the drop we needed. 
---
I have no real love for the current game, I only play now once every few months because it doesn't interest me and I have less time to raid than before and most of my old friends have quit. I'm really excited for Classic (and maybe TBC someday) but I actually have some hope that Blizzard are taking the Classic launch very seriously so I truly have faith that when the time comes they'll do the right thing. 
---
Are you kidding me? It’s a big circle.  How hard is that????
---
Shadowforge City, become an alcoholic and spend my days in the Grim Guzzler. 
---
&gt;but don't ruin PvP for the people who are only coming back for pvp.
---
Please stop implying that you're lobbying for all PvP fans. The realm-limited BG's is by far and wide the biggest reason that I'm interested in Classic. As far as I'm concerned requesting cross-realm battlegrounds is close to telling me to fuck off entirely.
---
I still have tons of friends from my time ranking back in vanilla, and all of them that have any desire at all to play again loathe cross-realm BG's. You may be OK with nobodies, but that does **not** go for everyone, nor every dedicated PvP'er.
---
Cut-throat Alley SW
---
Well, the tile was "vanilla boss exploits" so I tought they were talking about the first Ragnaros
---
Neither did Hodir, they're talking about wrath
---
Cool, so you have no argument just "You're wrong". Well, it would require dev time they probably don't want to spend and you can find your own info on if there will be a beta or not.
---
 /cheer or a /nod
---
Unless Im on a priest or mage, then its a buff no questions asked :)
---
Dragon rp 
---
I'm a true blooded son of the Horde but even I will admit that Ironforge is my favourite city, simply because it's cozy. It's located inside a giant frozen mountain, so it's bitter cold outside but inside it's warm and toasty from the forges.
---
Undercity is also underground but it's far too cold and gloomy to be cozy and while Orgrimmar is awesome, it's also a bit too rugged and primitive for my tastes. Thunderbluff has an awful design to it, since you can't go across the bridges on your mount because the huts housing the entrance dismount you.
---
Stormwind is ok but it's far too big and it's awkward to navigate around all the bridges and canals, and it takes way too long to get to a forge from the auction house, same problem with Orgrimmar too.
---
Darnassus? Best not to just mention it, until Silvermoon got added, it was the least populated city and for a good reason.
---
Not even Classic was that mean, don't worry.  Horde got a quest just for them that unlocked a permanent teleport directly from Booty Bay to the entrance of the Gnomeregan instance.  That's what the machine in Booty Bay does.
---
Then they address it and people continue to talk about it because not everyone can be pleased. 
---
Thanks for the help :)
---
 walljumping exploits won't work in classic 
---
Giant Eggs for the cooking quest, you need 10.
---
I was both! Had the minmax ZG set wearing a vest as a mage, and had my t1 e-peen set for RP'ing / being a Chad in Orgrimmar. You can be both! Just believe.
---
If the content was gated, I'd agree with you. But it's not, and most people are able to figure out how to move along &amp; find something else to do. Maybe classic WoW is not for you - if a starter quest is so important, then you should go back to retail where the entire game is on rails &amp; there is more expectation of linear content.
---
Would still end up with dead servers. There will be a large influx of people at the start, then people will stop playing pops will die down and most of your new servers will end up dead servers pop wise.
---
Sharding allows you to raise pop caps at the start accommodate “tourists” and once they start leaving your pops die down to reasonable but not dead levels on servers.
---
Doesn’t matter how many you start with if you don’t raise caps and allow sharding you will end with dead servers. Even with sharding some may still end up ghost towns after but not as many.
---
*Laughs in world PvP*
---
You seem to be doing the same thing that you are accusing me of, like I said add an option for both, otherwise we are just both saying "mine" over a toy until daddy blizzard comes home and lays down the law
---
Yes, RP was at its heyday during vanilla. Less options is actually a good thing since it forces people to get creative and that always breeds the best RP.
---
Also, since Blizzard purposefully designed low level gear to look rugged and realistic then its super cheap and easy to get a decent looking RP set that matches and everything.
---
One of the most popular archetype guild in vanilla was the Scarlet guild. Players who RP as Scarlet Crusade members by running SC a bunch of times until they get the full Scarlet set + tabard. I'm sure these will make a comeback in Classic too!
---
I really love these kinds of memes. Please, more virgin vs. Chad memes!
---
Where are you seeing the guild listings?  General forums?
---
Clickbait obviously.... 
---
It worked.
---
On my 2nd level 60, which became my main.  I went to MC at level 58 and got Nightslayer bracers from trash mobs lol. (it was on a new server that I rerolled on with a full guild so we rushed to 60 and to MC in order to get all of the server firsts)
---
It all depends on your guild/group. A LOT of pre-made guilds will be rolling in classic which will make finding groups easy. 
---
**Real Men of Genius**
---
**Horde** || **NA-PvP** || **Loot Council**
---
**Raid times**: 9p-1a CST, days TBD (likely Tues/Wed or Wed/Thurs, TBD by a guild vote)
---
**About**: RMoG's core is made up of friends, some of which have been playing WoW together for 14 years and others which have been met while raiding on private servers since Nostalrius. Many of us are tired of finding ourselves in guilds with corrupt or incompetent leadership. This time around, we're building something ourselves that will last throughout Classic and let us accomplish our goals. We have the experience to lead this guild through Naxx and the drive to create a strong, cohesive community along the way.
---
**Goals**:
---
\- clear all content quickly with solid raid performance
---
\- avoid and/or stamp out intraguild drama
---
\- fair, transparent loot distribution
---
\- encourage activity and engagement within the guild as opposed to raidlogging
---
\- establish dominance in world pvp
---
**Recruitment**: At this stage before the launch of Classic, we're recruiting for **all roles** \- even some nontraditional specs if you're an active, dedicated player. Having experience with the content isn't critical - the important part is that you're an active player dedicated to performing well, willing to listen to criticism when necessary. With that said, there are some key positions we're looking to lock down before Classic launches - if you're interested in **tanking** or if you're interested in **leadership** positions and your overall goals align with ours, contact us.
---
**Contact**: If you want to have fun, clear content and be a top guild on the server, here's how to contact us:

I think your first point is way more important than the second. People learning how to play has more effect than having full BiS (a noob with full bis will still suck). 
---
I think that having a raid full of RP-equipped people who know their class will still have a fairly easy time clearing content, don't you think? It's the combination of them both makes PvE *trivially* easy as you say
---
Those look amazing!
---
I agree with you, but there were other reasons Wildstar failed. The devs were stretched to the limit, there was a serious issue with the staff, the person that implemented double jump got fired for implementing it, etc.
---
[I advise you check out this video and read the comments from Sam Noone and a few others.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ru0dXDz9qoY)
---
Well, but if you were in LK expansion, why would you need help to kill Ragnaros?
---
The "second" Ragnaros came only in Cata. This text is really strange.
---
Go leatherworker items usually sell for more or less to a vendor than their component leather?
---
Absolutely! I recognize the name, most of us originally played on either Daggerspine or Kel'Thuzad.
---
Loktar Ogar!
---
just discovered them two months ago.  mind=blown, then eaten by wandering scourge 
---
Also the classic nasoltalgia circle jerk “guy look at how good this looks, much we better than that recent wow release amirite hahahaha”
---
I was 15 when I played.  I couldn't imagine playing vanilla when I was in the Marines.
---
My field schedule would interrupt my raid schedule way too much.  And the barracks internet went out too much. 
---
Classic might actually make me want to role play again. It was a big part of why I played when I was younger. 
---
Maybe try reading what OP wrote before commenting? 
---
This meme was brought to you by the intentional trolling gang.
---
If it's just a farm run and you're just pushing to see what you can do then w/e.. if it was a progression fight then yeah he has no business leading a raid.
---
I remember my cousin lent me this book when he bought the game, I read it for 2-3 months before I finally got the game myself. I stayed up at night reading it, planning my character etc. 
---
Exactly, but it applies both ways. It may not be your case, but hardcore pservers players love to tell people what they have to do.
---
I don't think that was OP's point though. It probably rather was a counter thread to all that minmax stuff we can find on this sub.
---
I was 15 when I played on release. 
---
When my kids are 13-18, I need to get them addicted to a video game.  They will never get into trouble. 
---
Or....
---
Study...
---
Have time to apply to college...
---
Drop out of high school to go for R14...
---
Then why you saying obviously shit guy???
---
&gt;Speaking of Chromaggus I have to commend whoever designed that fight  because it was one of the more tactically interesting and challenging  fights at the time. 
---
And I'd like to rape whoever designed that boss with a tire iron.
---
Amazing! Wailing caverns went straight to desktop
---
The problem is everyone seems to play alliance instead.
---
Is it possible to get them in high res? :O
---
ITT: Non-minmaxers trying to justify being assholes.
---
I don't know if this is real or you're just using a certain April Fool's joke.  https://wow.gamepedia.com/Tomb_of_Immortal_Darkness  It's totally possible that the basis for this April Fool's joke is exactly what you shared here.  It wouldn't be the first time they looked at something from Alpha/Beta, if only the name, and implemented or beta tested it in WoW literally 10+ years later, though I can't remember specific examples right now.
---
Sounds exactly like Blizzard's project Nomad which was canceled right before WoW development.  These lessons learned really shaped the development process.
---
Very insightful thanks.
---
So, if the data isnt 110% accurate, you cant do any estimations ? You should tell that to client scientist, even forecasts are fucking useless ? Because its impossible to know accurate data before it actually happens, its pointless....
---
The questions you ask are all valid, but when you join the guild, you join an established system and you accept the rules. Although the questions you mention do show up from time to time and rules might change, guild members still for the most part accepted rules when they join.
---
A lot of people prefer to see rules and numerical values with them, to be able to track their values and plan their items. Although some LC systems offer that in some way, it is usually more easier to see and understand DKP values.
---
TIL: Living in a world where you care about others is cold.
---
We used Zero Sum DKP in vanilla.  Every item was assigned a dkp value before the very first raid ever happened, and then the dkp earned during the raid was the sum of the DKP spent at the raid, divided by the number of players in the raid.
---
What I liked about this system is that there wasn't any personal bias in the system. All the rules were laid out for every one to see and all loot was handled by the DKP standings. It was the end all answer to every loot dispute. People didn't always agree with the results, but they understood the system and what to expect. So despite all the inherent flaws of using DKP (encouraging hording of points to the point of gimping self to get a specific item that might never drop and new members getting too negative in points as they gear up with loots no one else even wants, etc), it was an extremely transparent system that avoided the loot dramas of why some one got loot over some one else.
---
There is a stickied LFG thread up top. Should be able to find the guilds advertising in the comments there.
---
It's definitely bad on private servers (especially for horde). I never remember it being so bad in vanilla. The ganking is one of the reasons I'm looking forward to a smaller population cap on servers. 
---
Incredible work! 
---
They have already hinted at bigger server caps than 2500. Saying things like our servers are much more capable nowadays etc.
---
Wouldn't surprise me if modern Blizzard is so ignorant to think that bigger server caps is a good thing. ESPECIALLY since they are adding sharding. 
---
2500 is not a big enough cap to warrant sharding, but 5000, 10000 definitely is. 
---
I would personally hate to play anything over 2500-3000, as it changes every aspect of the game, making it a lot less social. But I don't think Blizz understands that much.
---
1. If you plan on either Mining or Herbalism focus on grinding in the right areas and running routes to net you more materials so you keep up the skill nicely. Mining is convenient when you want to keep it for later engineering/blacksmithing, you can find a higher density of nodes in caves. Herbalism nets you the most income throughout the game but it is more tricky to run routes to find good/the right herbs.
---
2. Skinning is a net loss in time spent vs. income before 30/40, because you will vendor skins mostly before that and they fill your bags quickly. If you don't plan on making money with high value skins later on I wouldn't recommend it over other professions. The exception is if you value grinding over questing (only do the most convenient/efficient quests), then you can really optimize bag space and merge the skinning downtime with your regeneration downtime well.
---
3. Engineering is a decent leveling profession contrary to popular belief. Grenades/Bombs are very strong and can save you corpse runs if used right and at around lvl 40ish you'll start to make powerful gadgets and gear pieces if you grab the right recipees. If you are smart about not being dictated by leveling quests and keep your mining up that is.
---
4. The strongest primary profession while leveling is easily alchemy. Again, if your herbalism skill is kept up nicely by planning your routes yourself instead of by quests. You'll always have a good amount of health potions and some very strong elixirs. You can give manapotions to your favorite healer while you are in dungeons to prevent wipes.
---
5. Secondary professions are *all* very powerful while leveling. First Aid is an obvious choice and everyone agrees that you should keep it up while leveling. But cooking is the real winner during my latest leveling runs. The cooking buffs are really substantial and perfect for leveling. You'll spend no money on food. Food and water are both quite expensive. If you are again, smart about where you grind and what you kill mostly, you will overproduce cooked foods which is actually quite great, because you will generate 3x or more money when vendoring cooked foods, and again you can help out your lazy friends with some nice food too. Fishing is a nice complementary profession to cooking and has long term value as well.
---
Looking for a Hardcore to Semi Hardcore West-coast PST guild that raids early Sunday and or Saturday morning at around 6 am.  
---
Well done you managed to sperg out over an anonymous comment and completely ignore the point I made. 
---
Truly outstanding.
---
Damn, these look good. The top one is the stuff I love looking at
---
If you don't raid you should go play BFA, Classic isn't for you!
---
 **🔥 &lt;Requiem&gt;** \- Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore 🔥
---
**Intro:** We started out as a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.
---
***First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.*** Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.
---
*Don't let this intimidate you*, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00-9:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD. Loot system is being worked on by guild leadership and will be announced this Wednesday 3/20.
---
**Discord:** [https://discord.gg/MaFgeMK](https://discord.gg/MaFgeMK)
---
We are not requiring you to choose a class type for your main so soon, but feel free to join our discord and take a peak at our guild roster to see where we're at so far and what roles we have folks marked down for.
---
True, but to be fair, there is only one way for them to learn.  The whole game is difficult to master, and even noob heals are better than no heals.
---
I tried retail with the launch of BFA (big mistake). I joined a friend on a small server he played on. Pretty quickly I started to hear horror stories from the number 1 guild on the server. 
---
The guild leaders were a couple. They regularly canceled raid night about 30 minutes after it started (They didn't show up. Instead they just let everyone know they weren't coming after it was set to start) because they decided to go on a date instead of raiding.
---
In Legion the female of the couple once rage quit a raid and left the guild because she was upset that people were dying to fire. She, of course, was one of those people, but you know... it wasn't her fault that she was doing badly. 
---
After the guild downed a boss they were told to start doing the mechanics incorrectly by the male of the couple. That way, his disc. priest girlfriend could inflate her healing numbers when they posted logs of the fights. 
---
The two would always be fighting about something. The guild knew this because the two didn't use push to talk in Discord and their fights could regularly be overheard. 
---
They recruited people with the promises of running mythic+ dungeons. They would also end the few raids they bothered showing up to by telling everyone to help each other gear up by running mythic+ together. What that really meant was that everyone outside of their little circle should run them together because there was no way they were going to help anyone else outside of their 5 man group. Their group was horrific at running mythic+. They wouldn't finish a 10+ key in time to save their lives (It was extremely easy even with pug groups depending on the week).
---
Now, I'm sure at this point you're asking yourself how they could possibly be number 1 on the server? I heard of several occasions from different members of their guild that one night the male got a little too talkative. He admitted the only reason the guild had Mythic raids cleared was that they would buy the runs. At one point paying $500 to clear the end game content and get the special achievements for clearing the current raid before a new one was released. These achievements usually came with a special title and mount, but also allowed them to pretend their guild was a top tier guild.
---
It made your character way more unique. I identified with my rogue a lot more. 
---
In my guild, specifically within our rogue ranks, we knew what each rogue was.  The combat dagger rogue, the swords rogue, etc.  
---
We had that identity within our classes. This is especially true more for other classes like Shaman's, Warrior's, and Pally's.  
---
Their entire class was changed from a respec. They would go from heal's to DPS which is crazy different.  It's like playing 2 separate classes.  That identity helps make vanilla WoW what it is. 
---
Completely forgot about the need and greed options being patched in. 
---
I was a college kid in my early 20's, but we introduced my 9 yr old to the game and he enjoys it, maybe not as much as Roblox, but his favorite thing is he gets to play with mom and dad, and I think that makes it worth it for him. I hope that eventually it turns into a genuine love of the game, but we shall see.
---
If you are constantly thrown in to different shards, it won't feel like a true MMO experience.
---
A true MMO experience is to see the same people, not human paladin #46 one time and never again.
---
You won't enjoy sharing quests with random people who will disappear in to another shard in 10 minutes, as much as you would be fine with sharing that quest with people who you will meet and will stay in your world for the future.
---
There is zero reason to be polite or become friends with people if you know they're only here temporarily through sharding. If you are essentially switching between realms, then what's the point
---
There's several discords, PM me if you'd like links

  **&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
   
---
Hey everyone! 
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual". 
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory. 
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO. 
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004. 
---
**Raid Times (PST):** 
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders. 
---
**Membership:** 
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They      will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things      with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the      end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend      recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that      is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of      Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a      period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move      on. When they come back, its like they never left. 
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the      effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to      keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100%      sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they      are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have      a full 40 members every raid. 
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to      keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no      special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known      each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is      great for members of our guild. 
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and      stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any      major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and      will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals. 
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

Guild Master: Boosh

Officers: Ceyx, Sudo, Flawlessnoob, Snood, Rashek
---
Arms isn't "bad", it is just less good than fury. 
---
Except if you plan to join a top raiding guild, which I would highly don't recommend because those kind of guilds are most of the time toxic, you'll be fine raiding as arms and nobody will bash your for it as long as you're not a complete noob.
---
Paladins and maybe mages can bubble/ice block through the shadowflame.

You're a genius

You bumped into a chzbgr cat so you became an Arcane Mage? I feel like I am missing a key piece of information here.

Life sucks without multi-path flights.  Especially if you go to make food or go to the bathroom and you come back to have to fly for another 5 minutes.
---
👏
---
Read the top of the topic people...
---
I am for sure going to pick one of these up. This also reminded me about the World of Warcraft Action Figures I had as a kid, I will have to pick some of those up too. Currently working on my mancave, which will have a half WoW half UFC Theme.
---
Bronze Tube in Darkshire, Lesser Bloodstone Ore in Booty Bay.
---
I think if you click on them, it brings up the original size (they're between 1300-1500px wide) :)
---
The scary thing is I did almost all of naxx in vanilla and I'm probably not tryhard enough for these guys since I haven't been in a serious guild since wotlk. I'm almost scared to even look up what some of these guilds are asking for. 
---
Well I dont know about that April Fools Joke, thanks for linking.
---
I dont excactly know how it was back then. Some years ago I read some stuff about planned stuff for WoW that was scrapped in development. The Thing with duskwood was one of These that got mentioned there.
---
Because craghack was taken. I do stream for a smaller audience yes but it's not really remotely the same thing. I don't play pve servers, I don't get boosted, I usually don't get streamsniped, I basically play the game by my self.
---
You've been waiting 10 years to play a game just so you can save time by skipping the quest text?
---
I got it for Christmas, I played multiple free trial accounts, then I finally made my account/subscribed in Feb 2005. I was 14.
---
Same here :)
---
Running through those Elven Forests for hours (questing/exploring) and finally emerging to the Gates of Darnassus, the music swells and changes, sends chills down my spine to think about even now.
---
A players first experience in WoW is truly magical... Especially if you were a young kid. I'll never forget that moment for my entire life.
---
This is the biggest one for me, and like OP I am a casual player. I will be building my warrior as a tank (leveling as a mix, with one respec to prot at 60). What time I have will be put into making the best tank I can as a casual. When someone sees me and recognizes me, I want ‘tank’ to pop into their head, hopefully a decent one.
---
It did change with easier respecs. Identity like that was lost, IMO.
---
&lt;Murloc Overlords&gt; \[Horde\] EU-Undecided Server Type
---
We are currently a group of friends that met up within WoW. Our guild was part of a larger guild that become corrupt, which led us to disband from it and go a different direction. Throughout all of us, we have people that started at BC and others at Legion. We are open to newcomers as I only joined at the end of WoD and have had minimal experience within private servers as well.
---
Our main goals are currently to just get a community of players to play throughout Classic and depending on the numbers, we can make additions to the guild like raid days/community events etc.
---
As of now, the server type that this will be played on is not decided, hopefully by the time that we have more players, we will be able to have a goal as a guild to partake in mainly PvP or PvE activities.
---
In general, this is not a hardcore guild, if that is what you are looking for, i would recommend going elsewhere. We are here to have fun and make some new friends during that period.
---
Here is our discord, feel free to join and talk to us about anything gaming related. [https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb](https://discord.gg/B8AZMjb)
---
If you have any questions about the guild, message me on reddit or join the discord and send me a PM from there (I am Cattman312 on discord)
---
I hope to talk with you soon, and if not, i hope that you find what you are looking for in the rest of this page.
---
I'm jealous. If only I had some real talent like this. Insanely great job. 
---
I actually made a post a while back that touched on this topic, Popular streamers pushing a narrative that has no basis and quite a lot of people jumping that band wagon trying to make blizzard making it happen .  
---
I genuinely think  everyone who is participating on "Classicast" is a scumbag  , but thats just my opinion .
---
Yes that is true but lets look at the classes:
---
Warrior: Has nothing
---
Rogue has sprint but nothing
---
Paladin: Free mount
---
Druid: travel/cat form
---
Warlock: Free mount
---
Mage: Spam blink 
---
Priest: Nothing
---
Shaman: Ghostwolf
---
Hunter: Cheetah.
---
2/9 of the classes don't need to worry about mount, 4/9 gets speed. So you are talking about literally 3 out of 9 classes here where mount is MUST HAVE!!!
---
Thought Cuergo’s Gold would be on the video
---
When the content is inefficient to begin with.. My point is if you adapt your leveling route/ideas you can better approach a packed launch server. If you’re sitting there for 30 minutes because you “have” to do every quest, then yes, you’ll be stuck in Valley of Trials for 7 hours. GLHF.
---
Thanks for the advice, think I'm at a huge disadvantage for PVP for choosing human? I just can't play a gnome or a dwarf, no offence to those who can.
---
What you can do is either try them out on a private server or, if you don't want to waste several days /played getting 9 classes to 20-30 ish, setup your own private server and just straight up make a level 20 character and quest around. 
---
It's actually really easy, I doubt I'm allowed to link it in here but google Brotalnia Repack and you should find it. It's not more complicated than double-clicking 3 executables and learning 4-5 GM commands.
---
I highly recommend you just skip the skinning then. The gold you gain from it is really not that great unless you plan on grinding high quality skins at lvl 60. If you have alchemy instead of skinning you'll level faster because the health pots save you corpse walks and downtime while the elixirs are really powerful.
---
People will go out of their way and do a leveling dungeon the third time with a PUG (slow xp) just to get that marginal gear upgrade, some even spend dozens of gold on the AH for BoE stuff. Alchemy elixirs basically give you that but guaranteed and cheap plus a plethora of other utility that noone else has access to while leveling, such as invisibility, movement speed buffs etc.
---
Yeah I kind of want 4k :'D But it's no problem, they look great even when scaled up a little bit on my ultra wide. Fantastic job, keep it up :)
---
Pro tip 2: if you don’t get the first Sarkoth tag...you can skip it...
---
What?  No one is going to know how their servers are going to turn out. If you show the ratio, you will have people not choosing servers with a dominant faction that they want to roll on. Or if people do choose an overpopulated faction, then that decision is on them, so they then know what they are getting in to. But seeing the %s at the start, will allow players to self balance the servers.
---
You are in a bit of a disadvantage but human racials makes you stronger in pve(sword weaponskill) so it's a decent tradeoff for what you are interested in.
---
Or you can just play orc ;)
---
My theory:
---
Blizzard has changed the client so it now keeps track of the pet and renders it based on the client's player coordinates.
---
In vanilla pet is just a mob like any other from the client's perspective. It receives information about it and renders it on screen. So there is a latency between the pets position in the server's memory and how the client renders it.
---
Later on they changed it to act similarly to the player character. In vanilla, like in other MMO's, the client does not render the player's position based on what the server tells him, it renders the players movemet based on input (keyboard pushes) and regularly syncs up with the server. 
---
(You can notice this with 2 clients with 2 PCs. Have 2 chars, spawm left-right with one, see it's screen the player running back and forth, and see the other player's screen the OG player doing the same much slower.)
---
I would guess now the pet is rendered similarly to the player. Rather than the server informing the client about the pet and the client rendering based on that info, the client renders the pet based on the clien't inputs and then syncs it with the server every X seconds, just like the player. This is a more complicated code, but it produces more reactive pets.
---
I would recommend 2 professions that are super gold generators. Maybe mining and (dis)enchanting. Back when I maimed warrior at 60 I recall needing a ton of money to switch back and forth between fury and arms
---
Sorry - wrong link haha. Thanks for noting that! =)
---
If you're buying a product, in this case an MMO, you should have a reasonable expectation that basic things like starting quests should function properly. You're over-extrapolating a simple issue for no reason. 
---
if this event wasn’t announced by now it’s not happening 
---
How many hours does it take to do pictures like those? Seems like it would take forever.
---
thank you - no 4K unfortunately, I paint them in pretty low res to be able to finish one in about a day, otherwise it would take me so much longer to detail out everything :)
---
I know, that's why I said some servers not most.
---
It kind of depends on the class. I think by the low to mid 20s you'll have a pretty good feel for the class, but it's still a bit incomplete until 30 when you start to receive your last core abilities. For example, getting Berserker Stance on a Warrior changes things quite a lot. So by the time you're at a place like STV in the low 30s you should have a really good idea if that class is something you would want to play at 60.
---
But more importantly I think is what you do while you're leveling. Instances may not be the most efficient way to level, but they're going to give you a lot more accurate simulation of what playing your class will be like in level 60 dungeons and raids. You might find that charging around and smacking things as a solo Warrior is fun, but if you hate tanking then life is going to be rough for you at 60.
---
Sounds like a bitter dev who is just randomly throwing everyone under the bus.
---
All of his complaints are vague and personal. 
---
I think it’s the Barrens chat site 
---
Ah yeah of course. I was just imagining progression when I read his comment. 
---
Can you read? You literally said the population is so massive that you're essentially playing cross realm constantly. Which implies that the large servers lose the sense of community. I then replied explaining how you could queue BGs and then find those same people out in the world to pvp against (thus still retaining the sense of community), WHICH CAN'T HAPPEN WITH XREALM BGS.
---
Not all are similar to the one you're thinking about.
---
about a day for one painting, but I have to keep them pretty low detail/res as you can see - still, I figure the 'mood and vibe' is more important for me than every tiny leaf, so it works out in the end :)
---
Isnt it twitchon or something like this soon?
---
Funny, I can't seem to find anything but acceptance threads and anti-minmax arguments. I'm all for playing casual or min-maxing, just don't tell people what *they* want to play. 
---
I also think there's a middle ground. I am disc/holy raid specced. I bring my mana pots and oils but I don't use flask every raid or even the food buffs/elixirs etc. I spend so little gold on my raids that I actually gain gold from raiding. 
---
Problem is that this just isn't enough in AQ and onwards. At that point the guild just has to go more hardcore and in one area specifically; attendance. What kills most guilds is having to repeatedly explain to new people how to do a trash pack, boss etc. It's really fucking annoying. 
---
I never saw that so i assume it would make items soulbound 
---
There are several 1.12 realms, most use patch progression as well.
---
Noice

You skip Ancestral Healing because mana is the most valuable resource to a Shaman. When you play well, you will not die until you run out of mana. But you run out of mana very quickly. The 2 points that you took out of Totemic Focus - 10% less mana cost on your totems - are reliable and far more valuable than the random chance at extra armor that you can never rely on. My build had 1 floater point in Improved Reincarnation. You can put that in Ancestral Healing if you would like. I prefer to be able to resurrect with 30% health and mana instead of 20%.
---
Likewise, I skip on the talents for Fire Nova because it has a massive mana cost for a relatively low amount of damage. I tried a spec with Call of Flame and Improved Fire Nova totems - it just wasn't great. I ended up never using them because they cost too much mana. It was 5 dead talent points.
---
Finally: On the private server that I was in, most Shamans were raiding as Elemental (or Enhance). They wore healing gear and they only ever healed in raids, but my guild - which cleared all content in one night - did not force them to respec full Resto just for raid night. Mana Tide is not that useful. 
---
Yeah, only idiots ... [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqFz\_Lytei8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IqFz_Lytei8)
---
if I worked in the situation he's describing, I'd probably throw everyone under the bus aswell.
---
Almost changed my mind.
---
Awesome ! You really transcribed the Undead zones atmosphere and feeling superbly. Caer Darrow is my big favourite here. I wonder what would happen if you painted the Ghostlands, Ice Crown, or Undead Zul'Drak's part. Not really Classic, but while we're on it ... Anyway it's truly awesome, and a great addition to the lore loving community who dwells for fan arts :)
---
I still don’t think you understand. Blizzard wants to cut down the number of tickets which is why they automate a lot of services like right click report. Loot trading stops ninjas claiming it was a miss click, this in turn drops the number of tickets down a bit. Blizzard is sooner more likely to scrap the whole idea than to give into your demands. Personally I rather like to play classic again because I haven’t played in fourteen years. If you use private servers a lot, you’ll probably have to keep using them because this is staying. 
---
This is basically akin to how Coke-Cola convinced the American public that it was the consumers responsibility for there products waste while switching away from the easily recyclable glass to once and throwaway plastic which isn’t very recyclable at all and un like glass is actually dangerous to the consumer above 77°F but it’s a great deal cheaper to ship. 
---
There are plenty, you can find most on these forums, people talk about them all the time :)
---
Nothing more disappointing than having your casual guild disband after months of raiding with them because they couldn’t clear content.
---
Not a bad idea.  I'm not too concerned with getting the extra $$ while leveling.  I'm rolling a shaman so I have my wolf and I have my plan to get an epic mount at 60. 
---
I do like the idea of leveling alch while I go because it will add some survivability/ease of leveling. 
---
And I don't have to waste a ton of time skinning! 
---
&gt;If there are any rose-tinted goggles for the old days, it's for TBC, the game that brought:
---
Jesus how hypocritical can you fucking be?
---
"Oh no vanilla was TRUE joy and has zero nostalgia, but TBC? Hah TBC SUCKED! You only like TBC for nostalgic reasons!"
---
get the twig out of your ass - I made a broad statement for those out there that are worried they need to rush to max and spec a certain way. I swear, with every post like this, there's always one screecher saying 'DoNt TeLl Me HoW tO pLaY' as if I have control over their life.
---
Depends how fast/slow you level.  If you’re enjoying it keep playing it, if it’s a bore then change.  If you level really slow but like the character, give it till like 30-35 
---
I've actually never min-maxed. I played as a fresh noob in 2005, did the grind up just soaking in the atmosphere. While I raided as Holy, that was mostly by choice. We progressed into Naxx, but it was with a mostly laid back big group of friends. Things got a little more intense into BC, but we took it easy through Lich King.
---
When I played Private Servers, it was with a mindset to relive that experience, smell the roses, stroll along the path to 60 and remember its wonders. It was a good time.
---
This time around, I want to crunch the numbers and do things with the burden of knowledge. I've done the first round, I've done the nostalgia. This door swings bith ways. Lets get efficient.
---
Hark! Dost thou hear the grunting 'kek' of evil orcs over yon distant ridge?
---
Aye, captain. Let us prepare our weapons so that we may smite the foul brutes.
---
I see their glowing red eyes, staring at us through the brush. There!
---
There it is again. "kek". Why do they hesitate?
---
Although that is true,(some) Pservers try to adhere to vanilla rules and get as close to it as possible in terms of design, nothing is perfect obviously but it's damn close, meanwhile in classic you have sharding, loot trading,etc. I'd say even all 3 are different,(some) pservers are closer to vanilla design by default.
---
You're misunderstanding the reasons behind sharding. Its for playabiliy and population control.
---
Dun Morogh isnt build for 15000 players, and the realmstructure isn't designed to have 80% of the population leave after a few weeks.
---
These are guaranteed problems, sharding might be the right option.
---
Unless you expect a new influx of tourism during the AQ event, there's no reason for concern.
---
Warlock is a pretty good choice. While leveling you have voidwalker you keep soulstone and healthstone along with hp pots and you are basically have 4 healthbars to allow dots to tick people down. Though it kinda requires you to have your stuff with you, warlock do suffer when corpsecamped because you can't summon pet and stuff.
---
Another good one is hunter. You are really strong in the world pvp, you can see people coming in advance, if you can't fight you have cheetah and can kite, and you don't need to use mana/cooldowns/health while fighting mobs. 
---
Uh. 
---
I’d say get to level 35 at least because you can max professions at that level.  So you can have a character you decided wasn’t for you actually help you gain long term gold with either mooncloth, arcanite bar transmutes or cured rugged hides. 
---
No stakes no skill, probably hunter or warrior I guess? Dumb question. 
---
I agree with what a lot of people are saying. By level 20 you have most of your core abilities and specs to try. Beyond that it doesn’t change too much - Id certainly try some questing, pvp and dungeons to make up your mind though.
---
Well, I'm asking you. Because the only change is having a stable lanch (good change) and loot trading. What else have changed?
---
See, I wanted to think that RP on retail was much better due to the options available (transmog etc) However, I found myself disliking it. I was in a group RP'ing, it was pretty darn fun, then....someone swooped in on some ridiculous flashy multicolored flying mount that was gigantic.....and it totally ruined the immersion. It was like something imported from a childs mobile game.
---
If you've ever worked on a large software project that's failed, you'll find that there's no shortage of peons, who had no idea of all of the moving gears and why they failed, complaining about how everything would have worked perfectly if only everyone had listened to **their** advice.
---
The failure rate for video game development is extremely high, and spending lots of money and time on the projects doesn't change that --it just makes the failure more noticeable.
---
Everlook in Winterspring for me.
---
I'm looking for an Oceanic based Guild, either faction is fine as I feel that finding the right group is more important. Intending to main either a Paladin or a Shaman with the intent to heal endgame content. I have a life outside of WoW but will want to make the most of my in game time. Looking for a good group that works together and is looking to raid without too much stuffing around but aren't going to treat the game like a second job. 
---
I intend to know my role and come prepared with consumables and understanding mechanics of the fights. Happy to play on PvP or PvE server because PvP is not something I strive for but don't mind joining a group for some world PvP or BGs, it'll be a fun distraction but not my primary focus. 
---
Let me know if you think I would be a good fit for your guild.
---
Yes man, my favorite too I think. I also loved getting there from leveling in Dun Morogh, seeing the snow melt away as you go down through the tunnels.
---
Yeah because you are literally telling people that they should think your way of playing the game is more fun. It's fine to tell people they don't \*have\* to play in a certain way, but don't tell them it's less fun. You don't know that.
---
ITT: people who are going to take 5 hours to clear MC
---
Just put your HS there, almost the same ;)
---
The irony is it took me 8-9 years of playing retail before i actually started reading quest text.
---
Very nice. Would have expected to see some Scarlet Crusaders too

&lt;Pride of The Alliance&gt; | US PvP | Alliance
---
**Introduction:**
---
Pride of The Alliance is a guild formed originally in Legion. We live up to our name, we have that deep faction Pride, and love World PvP. We defend our cities, respond to calls for help and of course, take the fight to Horde cities on the regular. Large, but involving guild, many people have made great friendships here.
---
**Who are we?**
---
We are the front line defense in our Capitals. We are the first strike against the Horde. Guilds want to be the first one in Molten Core? We want to be the first to take over Orgrimmar and slay the Warchief. We're a guild that loves World PvP/PvP. PVE? We raid/gear to kill horde. We play the game for the Warcraft. We're the Pride that lives in our Alliance.
---
**Gearing:**
---
We gear to kill Horde faster 😉 in all seriousness we do not plan to be a hardcore serious raiding guild, we plan to get Onyxia down weekly, and dip into Molten Core and other raids and "see what happens" and how difficult things are and adjust from there.
---
**What we look for:**
---
People who have a love for the game, a love for their faction, and want to join a guild that fights the good fight in Warcraft. We don't tolerate disrespect, we're here to enjoy the game and escape reality for a bit. We are looking for people to world pvp with us, and be that fighting force on our server.

i dont agree that the number of tickets is a major contributing factor to why they suggest keeping loot trading in classic.   
---
I believe it to be a matter of cutting down on game-master duties, of which trading items between players would be a significant burden (not just a take-&gt;give, but involves alot of verification that all parties are eligible and willing.)   
---
And that entire process could still be removed, by simply stating that GM's won't assist in loot trading.  
---
&gt; If you use private servers a lot, you’ll probably have to keep using them because this is staying. 
---
I disagree, they have shown alot of goodwill, in regards to both itemization, content phasing and other concerns the community has had, so i dont agree that this in any way is unchangeable.
---
Dude, this is just amazing. Now you are hyping me more for classic than ever.
---
Druid is pretty strong if you put the work in. 
---
what makes you think I havent played pservers since then?
---
Were you using a quest helper
---
You're all over this thread completely butthurt. It's supposed to be taken tongue-in-cheek. Nobody has a problem if you want to min-max. You do you.
---
Gdc
---
Are these actual oil paintings or made digitally?
---
In any case, amazing!
---
Great works. Could you do one for the Blackrock entrance? i loved that place so much with the chains and the Dragons
---
&gt; Yeah because you are literally telling people that they should think your way of playing the game is more fun
---
cause telling people not to rush and playing the game how THEY want to is really the issue, right? no. the issue here is, you come on reddit to argue over mundane issues.
---
learn to read, stop taking the world so seriously. you won't get any more attention from me now, I know you'd love it too much.
---
Poorly worded but a valid question. Suggesting warrior was the dumb part.
---
There is none but tons of threads proclaiming anyone who wants to play progress is a lesser human. 
---
I really enjoy the style.
---
Top shelf work here.  Love the consistent palette.
---
What size canvas are these on?
---
That first paragraph was what I was worried about. I played private servers religiously, but have forced myself not to for about a year now so I don't get burned out beforehand.
---
I'm losin' it man. I need it. I need my fix. Give me my fix, man.
---
Not with that attitude...
---
Try our LFG Monday stickied post.
---
Just don’t impede on others who might not want to play the same number crunching way. I know a lot of players like that look down on players that are only playing casual. 
---
and making new friends whilst you were doing it.
---
I can't wait man
---
Yep, this will be me.  I was never in the 1% really, though i used to push heroic (and then mythic when it came out) fairly hard, and was in pretty decent guilds.  
---
That frankly just isnt for me at this point in my life.  Between work commitments, having other shit to do in the summers, etc i wont be pushing terribly hard.
---
Im definitely looking forward to being able to 'smell the roses' (including the dead ones in the plaguelands) this time around while leveling.  Even my first character i powered through because i wanted to get to max level and experience the game that way. 
---
I actually did that a bit when BfA launched.  I still got to 120 fairly fast, but i read most of the quests, did professions, etc.  Actually had a lot of fun with it :)
---
1v1 no matter the cool downs warrior is a clear choice regardless of how fucking stupid OP is.  
---
warrior is weakest 1vs1 class
---
&gt;10
---
yea 10 million is complete madness. i would say they reach 3 million 1st 2 weeks to a month and then drop to around 500k stable population. From their the only way is up.
---
Considering bfa has about 1.7-3 million players tops, if classic servers actually do reach that, it would be considered a success by activation blizzard's book.
---
LOL
---
Asuming you are fighting a player with equal skill and gear there is no class who always has a chance. A good rogue will cc you to oblivion (I think untill patch 1.5 there were no diminishing returns so you weren't able to regain controll over your charakter). Hunter is good overall but starts to fall of as the game progresses. Warlock isn't bad either from level 40 onwards (you need the instant deathcoil to gain some distance and time.) Shaman can insta kill you with some windfurry progs but that is heavly luck dependend. Haven't realy played other races during classic so I wont talk about other classes. 
---
For your bonus question: I guess a good equiped warrior will benefit the most from a pocket healer.
---
YES!! That's what I have been saying in MMO-champ all this time! 
---
You wanna be a retri paladin? An enha shaman? A shadow priest?? You can play whatever you like! just join a casual guild with some friends (or make your own guild) and play as you like.
---
My guild is going to be open for all. This game is going to be about fun, not hardcore progression
---
Im not sure just how true that is.  People can definitely be recruiting now if theyre looking to get together a large group of players that they *want* to be friends with, even if its 'just' for dungeons, casual raiding, RP, etc.  
---
Finding a group of people you want to spend many hours per week (day) with isnt just important for serious raiders.
---
No sane adult wants to work a job, care for a family, and then log onto an MMORPG to be screamed at, or to be stressed out cause they need to do X thing for a guild.
---
A lot of guilds are going to be relaxed atmospheres, and I can't wait to enjoy the Classic community.
---
This is good advice.
---
I wouldn’t waste your time on this one, friend.
---
Demo is way better for solo leveling and PVP, but improved drain soul is a must...
---
Classic mages have a discord set up with some good spreadsheets.  It doesn't show item by item weighed against each other but it does show what is considered pre-BiS in each stage and BiS for raid gear as well.
---
[https://discord.gg/XuPFts](https://discord.gg/XuPFts)
---
Carbonite IIRC...so yeah.
---
The same thing that happens on full servers and the queue gets implemented? Except this time it doesn't hurt the lesser faction nearly as much as the overpopulated side.
---
Not from BWL onwards. Warrior is highly skill depandend and you will need engineering to stick to your target. 
---
I mean, have fun being in MC for a half dozen hours. 
---
if i am not mistaken
---
vanilla reached 8 million
---
tbc reached 11 million
---
wotlk reached 14 million
---
&gt; if you put the work in.
---
What do you mean ? As in farm gear ? Or learn how to play the class ? Or both ? 
---
After patch 1.11, I remember spamming my "shift+6" non-stop and having my heart just break apart...
---
Ah, ofc, what I meant was ofc that it affects spells only and not wands.
---
what are you using? you should be able to paint at whatever resolution you want, then upscale/export it without losing any quality.
---
&gt; Hunter is good overall but starts to fall of as the game progresses
---
Why is that ? Do they rely on killing their oppenents within a certain timeframe and after that they have a hard time winning . And due to more gear beeing available the Hps pools get larger ? If you have the time I would love a more detailed explanaition 
---
Druid would be an obvious choice. If you smell rouge-fart in the air, HoT up and pop into bear form, never let your hp be low. Druids don't really have big CDs they rely on(frenzied regen, barkskin, innervate, dash are these, and none of them make or break a fight, or have long CD)
---
Druids are adaptive, highly resilient, can kite, run away, heal.
---
I'm planning to show them in my next 5 (Eastern Plaguelands)
---
Aye, lock is a very strong pick.
---
Yeah and then send the gold to ur new main so u don’t have to worry about gold 1000iq
---
nothing kills it for me more than inviting some rando next to me, only to see player and npc pop in arround me because i was moved into a new shard.
---
&lt;Placeholder&gt; [EU] [Alliance] [PVP] (PVP/RP?)
---
**Raidstyle:** Moderate
---
**Objectives:**
---
* Maximum fun
---
* PVE Content at a solid pace
---
* Community that prides itself on good ettiquette 
---
* Helpful cooperative environment
---
**You are:** 
---
* Patient
---
* Sociable 
---
* A team player
---
**Intentions:**
---
* We intend to play Vanilla with maximum fun. This will be accomplished with a populated voice chat, nightly events and a positive attitude to players and progression. Events will consist of social questing, dungeon runs, world pvp, pre-made bgs, raids, quizzes, plugdj and more! 
---
* Players are encouraged to pursue their own specs whether that's min-maxing or trying out something completely different. We aim to strike the balance between getting things done and allowing player individuality. Solid experience of actual Vanilla at leadership level should enable us to accomplish this goal.
---
* We want to foster good etiquette and spread it across the faction. If you like the idea of dungeon groups that help beginners and help each other learn, world questing that involves cooperation rather than competition, and patience over pessimism then this guild is for you. 
---
**Recruiting:**
---
* Old players
---
* New players
---
* Casual players
---
* Semi-Hardcore players
---
* We're also open to leadership roles, so if you see yourself as a raid leader, event coordinator, class leader or officer then please don't hesitate to get involved! 
---
**Interested?**
---
Feel free to ask questions in the comments or come and join our Discord - https://discord.gg/X4dmVqr
---
This is a great fallback, but I hope it doesn't come to that.
---
Blizzard has one chance to do Classic right. 
---
If sharding fucks it up they've lost players forever.
---
The pserver scene will have better numbers but I'd prefer Blizzard doesn't fuck this up.
---
"But my leveling guide says to do all the quests at Nessingwary."
---
Pax East is next week, I doubt though that Blizzard will say something about classic there.
---
They are digital, but I like to paint them as much in oil-style and technique as possible (no layers or photo textures etc) to achieve that look. And it's also so much more fun :)
---
&gt; Just don’t impede on others who might not want to play the same number crunching way.
---
or alternatively, both hypothetical people can find a group of like minded people and join different guilds
---
they most certainly digital, unless OP has some incredible scanner. 
---
tfw you realize your a virgin minmaxer.
---
Side note, I saw a guy named Dwarfrogue. He was a night elf druid, it was way more hilarious than it should be. I might do something like that.
---
Agreed, this is seriously a bigger issue than sharding or loot trading. The community should join together to fix this.
---
Without Swirly ball, no rogue can have an authentic vanilla WoW experience.
---
Every project has a budget. If you split that budget you are left with less money for the devs, which results in less dev time (because nobody like to work for free).
---
It’s not just guild chat though. Trade chat, general chat, pug groups, forums, etc. 
---
 **&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
**Our future raid times:**
---
&lt;Hate&gt; is going to have 3-4 hours raiding sessions, for 3 times a week (2 weekdays + 1 weekend day), starting late afternoons / early evenings. More closer to release we will update this post with new info.
---
So, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at [https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK](https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK) or simply apply at [https://www.hate-guild.eu/](https://www.hate-guild.eu/)
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
*P.S. Here it is, for your viewing pleasure, our first Nefarian kill, 2006 Boulderfist - EU.*

---
Thank you! :) I paint on a 3K canvas generally, to avoid pixelation and bring out the brushwork as much as possible
---
Too hard for most young redditors 
---
Paladin bubble hearth 
---
This is no excuse not to keep it on the forefront of discussion.
---
Sharding *should* be kept nearly always in our minds because to many of us it is the single greatest threat to immersion fuck ups and Classic failing.
---
Doesn't AV give you rep?
---
I would've trusted 2010 or 2005 Blizzard with this.
---
2019 Blizzard "don't you guys have phones" random shutdown of HotS and fuckups of most of their other precious IP..... I don't trust them
---
35.
---
At this point your class will have all main abilities (many are left to the low mid thirties, so stopping at 20 isn’t a full picture.) and will be in the level range for scarlet monastery, a good indicator of a class’s play-style for group content. If you decide you don’t want the character, you can now make it a profession alt to either gear your main, make potions, or just to farm gold through alchemy/leatherworking/tailoring cooldowns. Additionally, since it is before 40, you won’t have spent gold on a mount yet so you’ll be able to transfer it off the character if you choose to abandon it.
---
Mainly how to play the class. Gear is as important as with other classes, but in especially in pvp druids have a very high skillceilling. 
---
Except it does have tbc rep rates.
---
Shamans are not exactly great levelers because they are mana dependand and melee so they suffer bigger downtimes than other classes. After 40ish it gets better since you can spec into elemental. They are a class that profit *alot* from having additional health and mana pots in their bags and they are one of the few classes that profit from pretty much any + stat elixir you can mass produce while leveling, regardless of your spec, since you will always be casting spells and doing melee damage wether you are enh or ele.
---
so just do dynamic respawn. why shard at all?
---
Yeah it's a bit misleading. It has nothing to do with "stability" and more that they're concerned with how many players will quit when they're unable to kill any mobs in the starting zones.
---
Nostalrius already gave us some insight on how this goes down. At launch, they received as many players as Blizzard will if they go with very high server population caps. If they go with lower caps, the situation only improves. 
---
Nostalrius didn't have dynamic spawns or anything to ease the flood of players. And yes, right at launch it was nearly impossible to kill anything, especially if you weren't a caster. But after 2 or 3 hours things started to ease up and you could begin to make progress.
---
Sure it sucks to not be able to start playing immediately, but solutions like dynamic spawns and sharding feel like total overkill for a fairly minor problem which quickly resolves itself. Yeah, there isn't enough copper nodes for everyone to keep their Mining up to date. Now you're presented with an interesting choice: do you just rush levels and let your Mining fall behind, or do you level slower to make sure your Mining keeps up with where you're hunting?
---
why would I assume you've been playing private servers?
---
It puts you a bit behind as craghack\_tv said but the diplomat racial will help you a lot on the bg faction reput grind 
---
Well, most of us arent 13 years old with no commitments anymore.  I for one am glad we likely wont have to deal with that because i only have a few hours per night (on a good night).
---
There are guilds who say they are casual but are not (for example 4 raids a week and only accepting BiS classes etc. but consider themselves "casual" because you are only required to make 1 raid a week) because they are stuck in the idea of what casual was, compared to what it is now. On the other hand there are guilds like my own which are being very casual. Only 2 nights, not requirements on how many you can make, and you can play w/e class/spec combo you want. Sure it'll take us longer to get through stuff but we are a casual guild, and classic is going nowhere.
---
There aren't many "casual" guilds like us recruiting right now. Most are more "semi-hardcore" but call themselves casual. I only made my guild with a few others who tried to join these "casual" guilds and found out how non-casual they are.
---
Agreed.
---
I'm also personally in the camp that dynamic respawn is a better approach than sharding
---
Dynamic respawn &gt; Sharding
---
I played on an rppvp server in vanilla and all through BC. The initial reason I did it was to dominate pvp assuming all the RPere were noobs. It wasn’t always true. 
---
Even though I came for easy pvp, I stayed for the community. Rp servers have a fantastic community - better than any other server I’ve ever played on. Steamweedle Cartel was my old server way back when. 
---
I rarely rped, but would if approached by an RPer. We had lots of people in the guild that actively RPed and we all encouraged them to do so. Made the game a blast for all of us. 
---
I'm using Photoshop - these are bitmap images anyway, so whenever you upscale them, you get some serious quality loss and no added detail - ofc PS tries to compensate for pixelation but it just ends up looking like crap (blurry and streched) if there's no actual additional detail to back up a higher res :)
---
You mean besides loot trading and sharding ? I'm not here to argue whether these changes are good or not but you can't deny they are HUGE deviations from original vanilla.
---
Besides that there are a few more,classic is being built on legion systems , so you can expect modern macros and addons to become a thing in classic.
---
Another thing that mentioned by many is that weather effects were removed from the game some time prior to legion and as such will not exist in classic due to it being run with legion as base, no mention has been said about adding them back.
---
Legion added darker nights back but due to the way the after glow/ lighting works in legion classic will not have nights as dark as vanilla, here's an example: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD2U9PplwaA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iD2U9PplwaA) .
---
There are a few more things I could mention but I don't wanna end up making a massive reply , just goggle the rest if you really want to know.
---
I've never seen so many people with an inferiority complex as the casual wow crowd. 
---
Ex: You queue BGs fight the horde, then come out and queue back up. Estimated queue time = 4mins. That's enough time to get to BRM and world pvp for extra honor. Guess who is normally there at BRM? Yep, other rankers on the horde side also looking to world pvp, who you literally just queued against in the previous few BGs.
---
This can't happen with xrealm bgs.
---
Also, xrealm bgs don't do anything to fix the server imbalance. The lesser faction will never be able to compete for world bosses. So why is it fair that the overpopulated faction gets to get lower queue times, while the lesser faction gets zero benefits, only negatives. It's like yalls arguments for xrealm bgs is the same argument idiots on retail used for sharding.
---
tbh, I'd check out FFXIV if you want to roleplay. The devs actually invest resources into roleplaying, whereas Blizzard never did.
---
Thank you! Hopefully will get to all those zones eventually :)
---
I never said Classic is going to have 10k pop, stop putting words in my mouth.
---
most of the vanilla fanbois you see on vanilla wow forums have
---
Try this sometime in Classic when you have time to muck around...
---
Place a race you are unfamiliar with and completely disable the mini-map while playing. You will be surprised at how different and more immersive the game feels.
---
I never refuted that. Of course they can... but I’m talking about probability here.. 
---
25-30
---
The old AV is what warfronts should have been like. Never ending war - it was a glorious time!
---
They could easily implement a queue system that only impacts the overpopulated faction. If it reaches a point, like 70/30 or 65/35, then a queue happens for the dominant side, meanwhile the underpopulated side can log in as they please. This continues until the numbers are closer to 55/45 or w/e.
---
so not wanting BoP 2 hour loot trading = "demanding change" ??
---
lol
---
&gt;Try to think before you post.
---
&gt; I'd say level 20 is a decent place to judge how a class will play
---
dunno cuz warrior is dogshit until about then
---
This really is a case of 'damned if they do, damned if they dont'.  
---
Either they say stuff now, and then if it has to change theyre fucked...or they stay relatively silent and get raged at.
---
These are amazing, would love to see your take on the Ellwynn areas too!
---
Stack up consumables, stack up stamina, go for engineering, go for pvp items, learn how to play against each class.
---
This way you have free choice over all classes.
---
The whole allure back in vanilla wow was that your character had an identity. I played an arms warrior. I could see a warriors name and know exactly what their spec is cause I had either pvped against them or played with them and remembered. 
---
My roommate back then played ret pally. If he posted in the forums he would get replies from horde players about how much damage he did. Not because of them looking him up - they knew. And the reason they knew is because switching specs was completely unsustainable. 
---
I am vastly more casual now than then. And I say make it as expensive as it ever was. 
---
So you say you're min-maxing your experience not to min-max?
---
Exactly, adding it in around phase 6 or 7 if it goes that far would be perfectly fine. But adding it in anytime before phase 6 will suck majorly.
---
These are incredible, top work!
---
I'd watch it, but I doubt South Park would revisit it. I cant think of them doing that for any of their other episodes.
---
ah my bad, I thought these were physical paintings not digital since you specified oil.
---
Still nice work though.
---
There's a bonus one of the inside of Blackrock Mountain, near to the bottom :)
---
Hi, /u/Enuqt
---
THIS. IS. BEAUTIFUL.
---
Even though I play PvE the danger is still high because for most classes pulling more than one mob at a time is a death sentence. 
---
That feel when you kill a warlock but know you are still going to die in 5 seconds 
---
I mean, while leveling it’s a good idea to practice your support role anyway, since you get invited to groups faster and they’re easy to heal even as SP.
---
&gt;It’s not just guild chat though. Trade chat, general chat, pug groups, forums, etc.
---
I think as long as you don't act like a dick, whether you're a casual or a hardcore player you'll be fine :)
---
I would like to see a time lapse video of that !
---
I'll be doing this too but for nostalgia reasons mainly as my first mage mainly used arcane missiles due to it looking and sounding so cool to me.
---
I planned to switch when I can start AoE grinding but I might try to hold off to 40 if I notice a big gold advantage.
---
Yeah, spriests are fine in Vanilla, but they only get really strong past 40 with the Shadowform talent.
---
Spriests are one, of not THE best 1v1 pvp class/spec in the game. They have good survivability, CC, dps. Only weakness is lack of mana.
---
In PvE you will likely be asked to heal if no other healers are present, but I had plenty of dungeon runs as a druid where we had sPriest dps and me healing or tanking. Heck, there are lot of pulls where you dont really need healer (especially with a beartank), just HoT up the tank, turn in shadowform and dps away (just watch your mana).
---
But what I'm saying is that apart from endgame (which I have limited knowledge about) sPriests are perfectly fine and ppl understand that it is a DPS spec and will let you DPS. But you will have to be vocal about it during 5man pt forming.
---
On the other hand a player with a healer class who refuses to heal when needed does not deserve to be on my friend list. You should use your class's abilities to the fullest if the party needs it. I play feral druid yet regularly heal when we can't get a healer. That's just how things are.
---
Hunter is very gear dependend. Beastmastery is pretty good for pvp, till you get better gear. Probelm with Beastmastery is, your pet doesn't scall with your gear so it's not realy an alternativ for a progressed server. Normaly you will play Marksmanship, Survival or a mix of both. Marksmanship has some ways to get out of a melee situation but not enough, especially not since most of the good pvp player discovered engineering. For world pvp I would suggest Survival. Traps and scatter shot from marksmann will give you the edge in some situations. Still in comparison to a rogue on the same skill and itemlevel you will lose most of the time. Survival is probably the best what a hunter got for 1vs1 but is still lacking the final touch. 
---
That's why I'm coming back.  To experience the living world again, and actually interact with players to accomplish goals.
---
Yea, I shouldn't be butthurt that, what's apparently a large part of the community is actively encouraging trolling people.
---
Raiding in vanilla is more about just showing up and investing time into the game, than it is being actually good at it. Of course being good doesn't hurt, but it's not really required.
---
I started on my first pserver in November last year.  Quit WoW after AQ in 2006 and mostly quit gaming entirely.
---
Got pretty hooked by the nostalgia, hit 60 over Christmas, pugged a few MC/ZG raids then looked for a raid guild.
---
The private server meta is entirely different to what I had known.  The biggest change is probably the raid prep of stacking every possible world buff pre-raid - Onyxia head, ZG heart, Dire Maul tribute buffs and Songflower.
---
The true hardcore guilds on the server stack invis pots and skip trash for speed clears, most claim to be semi-hardcore = world buffs, consumables and flasks for progression raids 
---
https://i.redd.it/p01fpmxlqbj21.png
---
I dont see anything.
---
Wildstar showed me that you can't start by focusing on hardcore raiders straight out of the gate.  People have to fall in love with your game first, and if your leveling game is as mediocre as Wildstar's was you aren't going to have that dedicated hardcore raid audience because they don't care enough about your game to put in the work you're demanding of them.  It's like taking somebody out for one pretty decent date and then demanding that they marry you.  It's a massive commitment that hasn't been earned.
---
Vanilla and TBC were able to focus on that hardcore audience because the playerbase was already enraptured by the world and for the time WoW's questing was actually revolutionary.  You didn't have to go through some big ass attunement chain to get into your first raid in vanilla either.  You had to do one dungeon run of BRD which you probably already wanted to do for other reasons, and that was it.
---
I think there's a middle ground to be found but it's all about having the roots down.
---
MC/BWL can be cleared with a guild that has a combination of semi-hardcore and casual raiders. If in the months you're running the earlier content you can establish a raid roster of say 60-80 players, it's likely that within that selection you'll have sufficient dedicated players to progress through AQ40.
---
Once progression has cleared the way casuals can be brought up to speed on the farm runs with a mix of players.
---
However establishing a raid-roster of that size is an extremely difficult feat. You need several active raid/group leaders to farm dungeons and setup a second raid team. You need enough active people to cover two raids team with 25-30 people, and you need stamina to keep people invested.
---
Really it comes down to patience. The biggest problem for Guilds is players that hop ship at the slightest sign of slow-down. Hitting a hurdle in raid progression is completely natural and not the end of the road, but a Guild can quickly die if key members decide to jump at an offer to become the #1 Guilds B-team player.
---
I saw this happen a lot particularly in TBC where top guilds would poach Warlocks for BT, with the poached player actually only getting 1/4 raids a week because they were only ever intended as a reserve, but the promise of loot/progress was too tempting.
---
It does add some immersion to the game, even if you don't actively participate. 
---
This is a great,great post. Just came here from browsing your map interpretations, and now got a big old load of nostalgia for starting out in WoW (even though I only started in 1.10)...
---
I don't think they will use an event to announce the release date to be honest. They will probably just use the classic forum and Twitter, that alone will spread it across the internet within seconds. Not to mention that we will help spread the word aswell.
---
Just wait a few months after launch and 5000 will become 3000 once the tourists leave.
---
Disagree. I'm looking to create a large active group so that at launch people always have folk they know to quest with, dungeon with and chill out with on comms.
---
If that makes me tryhard then oh well.
---
Let's just hope blizz figures out a way to balance servers without CRBGs. Like displaying % faction next to the server name, or adding a queue system to the overpopulated side.
---
This is why I love vanilla so much. Blizzard didnt cater to the mentality of rushing everyone into raiding, didnt cater to stream line things to try to make it easier for min maxers. Think of all of the changes throughout the years and how many of them were there to speed up the process to get people into raiding or geared up?
---
If it were a choice of getting some amazing raids or an awesome immersive open world content, I would choose the later. However, we have gotten the former in recent years. 
---
Not only that but the average PC just couldn't handle it. It wasn't uncommon for players to get &lt;5fps during MC bosses.
---
Awesome, last one looks like windmill is going crazy xD
---
this sounds more like it.
---
the current playerbase is less than that on retail I assume.
---
I don't expect that many people to come back for classic. It would be great though.
---
I'd say learning how to play is also part of min/maxing. learning which stats are good (and why), which spells are good, which mechanics the bosses use etc.
---
Yes learning the fight makes it easier, but content does get harder (e.g. C'thun).
---
example: killing rag in less than 3 minutes completely changes the fight because you don't have to deal with the sons. now if your tank has 0% hit and all ypur melee are dw with 0% hit on gear, that fight becomes a lot harder. and going into C'thun with the same shit gear will simply make the boss impossible to kill. but please prove me wrong :)
---
Happy to know that shadowform makes things better. I don’t mind healing but would prefer dps buuut would prefer to actually run the dungeon and heal rather than no dungeon and try to be dps. Ty for advice 
---
1. Macros and addons almost had no limit in vanilla, so we had great addons that did more stuff than you can do now with addons. Not as elaborated and nice looking ofc. So it's a change, but imagine WoW vanilla being a thing since TBC was released. We'd have addons that did everything for us anyway. So it's nothing that wouldn't have happened anyway.
---
2. Yes, there is a weather system. Look at Blizzcon.
---
3. Sorry  to futher crush your "changes", you can choose between Legion or Classic graphic style. So you can change to old shadow / lightning system which causes the game look like it used to do. There are plenty of comparison videos from the demo with Classic shadows and Legion shadows.
---
Stop being a zombie reading stuff that isn't true and follow the hate for no reason what so ever.
---
That’s true, group invites are very quick 
---
I lowkey love the clown suit life 😂😂😂 I remember being like “ I look like a damn mage fairy but watch this one shot POM Pyro” to all my friends outside Org but that was BC
---
As a priest you will more often than not be expected to heal dungeons and raids, regardless of spec.
---
IMO shadow priest is the best out of the “meme” specs. In super hardcore guilds they likely won’t have a place as they would just have a healer spec deep enough into shadow to keep up shadow weaving, but almost every guild will want at least one. Shadow priests are capable of doing decent damage, they just take up two debuff slots each in order to do so, making it very unlikely there will be more than 1 per 40 man raid.
---
There are several % damage modifiers for shadow damage and spell damage that shadow priests benefit from, most important of which would be curse of shadows meaning they don’t have to stack spell penetration on gear like elemental shamans do.
---
Their biggest problem is having enough mana in raids after BWL as the bosses generally take much longer to kill so you’ll likely spend a lot of time getting mana pots and demonic and still be unable to use the max ranks of your spells while doing mediocre damage compared to the big dps specs.
---
TLDR: they’re not useless but you’ll probably have a hard time finding a raid spot because there is usually only room for 1.
---
A lot of people are saying 30. In all reality, you wont love a class until 40. Get that last talent and feel it out. Then buy your mount or switch classes.
---
Shadow priest's unite! I want to do shadow for PvP and somehow get into a guild that will allow me to raid as shadow. #squadgoals
---
Horde pvp /NA/Server TBA 
---
We are a group of guys looking to raid classic hardcore when classic drops on blizzard app. We live to have fun. My idea of fun is getting to 60 really quick and getting re raid BiS and doing a raid. I know there are players who have the same idea. We are looking for those players. But if your casual then we would love for you to join as well. We love WoW. We are currently playing on a pserver. Link up with us and discuss your ambitions as a raider in classic wow. Message me for discord invite #druugrax/chuumm#8654
---
Even if they put a giant billboard above every boss, they will still get lots of tickets demanding that a gm attention. Even if they ignore all loot disputes it still requires a person to manually look through all the tickets, which can be saved by adding a feature that in honesty doesn’t affect anyone game because unlike current WoW the motto of classic is ‘Actions have Consequences’ alternatively don’t be a dick because people will find out. 
---
This here. There are going to be times I turn down a blue clad Balance Druid or Ret Paladin for my ZG raids, for example. It wont be met with a "learn to play scrub", and I mean no offense to the person. I will never be upset at somebody for playing what they love, but on the same note I am not obligated to bring them to my game.
---
The only way I was able to fix this issue was to spam "spacebar" and immediately hit the "s" key to have my horses non-stop rear-up and give an annoying blast of "NEYyYyY" over and over again.  
---
Your Question is a bit too broad. No idea where your focus lies but i'll give you the basic rundown:
---
Yes, people will keep on asking you to heal because spriest is no top-tier dps and it lies within your class' utility. If you don't want to heal that's fine, you just need to be ready to deal with long waits for dungeons and some judgemental players. Making Friends with a resto druid might be a good idea due to their lack of a ressurect spell.
---
You will never top the meters in any raid as a spriest. However you fill a decent support niche so im sure you'd be able to call a Guild home unless you want to raid in hardcore Progression. Spriests are monsters in PvP.
---
Would the route of healing raids and getting shadow priest gear,in order to pvp in the future cuz I prefer pvp 
---
Rethban Ore
---
Thank you for sharing this. 
---
Ferda
---
Its a use, not a proc rate.
---
You've convinced me.  Herb+Alch while leveling. 
---
Im looking forward to going back and just enjoying leveling as part of the game.
---
Now every second not spent at max level always feels wasted, i want to get in and raid as fast as possible.
---
I never felt like that in Vanilla. Simply leveling was part of the game and part of the fun and im looking forward to doing that in my spare time when Classic launches.
---
Are you painting analog as well? If so, I would be interested in acquiring one of your physical paintings. Hit me up via PN ;-)
---
I love these. As a forsaken main since vanilla these hit me hard in the feels. I want to frame them and hang them. 
---
Loot trading was simple. The rogue roles need on the cloth gloves with spellpower because he is not a native English speaker. You call him out. He gets mad and leaves the group. So now you 4 man the remaining bosses in LBRS. Even though the only reason you were here was for those damned gloves.
---
Naxx Enchant on 29 PvP Twinks were possible. This is my old one [https://worldofwarcraft.com/de-de/character/eu/zuluhed/yorom](https://worldofwarcraft.com/de-de/character/eu/zuluhed/yorom) (im missing the real wep though). I recall paying 5k gold for it.
---
Exactly. And that can't happen with xrealm bgs.
---
Same. Late May is usually last call for me (if I want any say in the matter)
---
Right i'm talking about the PS source file not the bitmap image
---
Warning!  Warning!  Intruder Alert!  Intruder Alert!
---
it depends a lot on how you define "minmaxing". I think a competitive mindset (i.e. being better than others) is quite prevalent in gaming culture (as it is part of human nature), and you will see the same things that happen on private servers develop on classic. Thinking about what a talent does and if it's worth taking X over Y is certainly an effort to get the most out of your character, no? and who wants to play a dps class that is at the bottom of every dps meter and looks really useless to the rest of the social group?
---
So I’m shit at pve dps wise but good pvp. Guess it’s a decent trade off but now the question is how do I get pvp gear? I get a healer gear then I rerun it as healer in order to get sp gear?
---
There are 58K subscribers on this subreddit. I highly doubt that even 25% of them are PS players.
---
I've never really played a priest and don't have a desire to do so currently, but man the more I think about rolling a priest in classic the better it sounds.
---
I was so sure I'd reroll the paladin I had and do that again but I kind of want to go in with fresh eyes in a new class that I'd never thought I'd play.
---
Plus I like healing and speccing shadow sounds pretty fun
---
this item is crazy. did uldaman this weekend with a lvl 42 druid. he just did 160 single target dps on bosses...
---
Thanks for the hint! I redid the whole BiS part, all the graphic stuff was a bit too messy I think.
---
If you watch the video I posted in the section you should be fine. I never farmed the spot in my vanilla days but will do some more research and info on it in the coming days.
---
I'm pretty much in this camp too but I think I can stand being a gnome and would prefer pvp racials, so I'll probably be rolling gnome personally. 
---
I agree. I think by level 30 you have a pretty good understanding of how the class plays out.
---
I love your art style. Hopefully someone at Blizzard recognizes your skill.
---
Theramore alliance side. Whole zone had a questing overhaul prior to BC, so it is super dense 
---
Adding on to this, if RP is the real draw for you, I think it might be hard to beat D&amp;D.  5e has done a lot to make the game more streamlined and newbie friendly compared to previous editions and games like Pathfinder.  Round up some friends, buy the starter kit, and go have an adventure!
---
Oh please can we stop with the casual feel good posts already ?
---
The nostalgic will savor every quest, the rushers will rush.  
---
Do what you want, but don't tell me how I should enjoy the game.
---
I am not an elitist, I respect every gamer, no matter what's their play-style as long as they let me be. 
---
The first character I leveled back in 2005, I visited every part of the world (found the dancing trolls village just by myself, I didn't even know it existed), I have read every quest (I didn't even know you could make them show instantly or you could find information on Thottbot), I was fishing so much that for my birthday my sister bought me a fishing artwork etc  
---
I then leveled about 20 other chars until the beginning of BC, so I know everything about the Vanilla leveling experience I need to know.
---
Now the only thing I can enjoy while leveling is efficiency. The things I want to do happen after leveling.
---
So why should I stop to smell the roses just because you don't want to be outpaced ?  
---
Classic isn't for fame-hungry guilds looking for recognition to fuel their vanity. Classic is more about the community and comradery.
---
Yeah, sometimes people let the nostalgia get to them a bit too hard.
---
"We were 800 people!" no, gramps, you were probably like 80 but I'm sure it felt epic all the same.
---
I'm not disagreeing with the principle and perhaps this guy is just Dunning Krugering BUT I tried Wildstar and potential absolutely *writhed* beneath a surface that felt bungled and incomplete. The Dreamworks characters, the UI, the linear and boring story, and the discordant setting are all game design/leadership issues. 
---
It's totally believable that many of the fundamental MMORPG elements that I saw in Wildstar could have been done better because they *very obviously should* have been done better. 
---
Hunter, Warlock, or Druid would be your best bet.
---
Afaik they release content in stages. It’s not a real patch progression.
---
What we know about classic so far will still be closer to Vanilla than that - so called - patch progression of private servers.
---
Burning Charms, Cresting Charms, and Thundering Charms.
---
Drop from elementals in the various circles of binding in Arathi Highlands.
---
8 of each are needed for warriors to complete their class quest for the Whirlwind Axe.  Thundering Charms are especially useful for horde, as the circle of binding for the Thunder eles is right outside of refuge point, so Alliance characters walking out get a free gank.  They're also way higher level than the level you get the quest, so lots of people will look to buy them instead of farm them.
---
We must be playing very different pservers then, my guild also full clears all content ( ND server) so that's everything from MC to AQ 40.
---
Another thing i'd like to note is that you use ancestral healing in both pve and pvp, although you can do without it in pvp if you really wish but you cannot raid without ancestral healing getting a crit on a tank significantly increases their survivability .
---
The same can be said about improved fire nova totem, those are pvp talents , fire nova totem is use a lot to burst melee classes and remove the slow wind up makes it incredibly potent, you usually don't have issues with casters as a shaman, so overall I'd say your build is tailored for an pve ele spec, in which case you might as well go full ele for that added elemental mastery, if you never plan on doing wpvp ( unlikely) then you can pull off your spec, since all you'll ever do is raids/bgs, but that's not very likely on a populated server.
---
Here's a clip I found on youtube showing how good reduced fire nova totem is vs melee :[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouM4uCQF3ik](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ouM4uCQF3ik).
---
I am redoing the whole BiS part and the info should be fine now, thanks to the community. Let me know if you find anything else not matching up.
---
Anyone else sick of these threads telling others how to have fun? 
---
They designed bosses with tire irons back in 2005? Man, the dev tools were so archaic back then.
---
Oh my word..... I'm lost for words at how amazing and beautiful these are - you've really captured the atmosphere of the areas!!! I wish I could have that kind of talent
---
What server are you going to be on? (So I can avoid it)
---
Blizzard has explicitly said "We're trying to make the game as close to as it was in 2004". Then people expect no changes, and they don't really want to change much either. 
---
So the old quests, dungeons, raids, pvp system, BGs, classes etc. probably will have no changes. 
---
Say you're 15 years old you are looking for a new game, will you try out Classic WOW? Maybe. Would you rather play a new game, such as Apex? 
---
My point is, how many players that have never played wow can we expect to actually try it out, stay and continue playing.
---
Loch Modan for me.
---
Easy. Druid.
---
You don't have to. You can start eating now.
---
As a hunter back when this came out, I was like "EXPLOSIVE ARROWS? WHAT?" 
---
You are a god among men!
---
Thank you for this post.
---
A lot of discussion on the sub are about which class is the best, which race is the best for this class? where can i get the best gear?
---
This is far from what, in my opinion, is the whole point of Vanilla. As you said: Just log in and do whatever with people you enjoy playing with, discover the world and have a good time.
---
I plan on finding a chill group of people and casually playing with them and drunk pvp/dungeons maybe raiding if we're good enough.
---
I think that’s the point. You mean BiS from what the Game offers. I mean BiS from a standpoint where i reduced the variety of available gear by a bunch of cloth parts.
---
BiS will always be BiS. And I created a custom BiS so to say.
---
what is the dr on stuns in vanilla? when i use kidney shot on someone, how long does it take till it gets max duration again?
---
I’ve played with friends before. It’s fun. As for ff that number I don’t know the lore of other games so I wouldn’t be able to make my character. The reason why wow was easy is because I played wc3. 
---
So that’s what you like :)
---
I think I enjoy it more because im terrible and it takes yeara longer to achieve what i do in a week currently. 
---
"Under the radar" only works if the person who wins the loot is actually someone who is a viable candidate to get the loot themselves. You are applying a level of naivete or ignorance to everyone that won't exist.
---
Who would win + trade item examples I've seen:
---
1. Player who could actually use item, but gives it away (hard to call this evil)
---
2. Player who is correct class but doesn't need item, so gives it to feed a friend (what this sub hates, but also in no way hidden if the trading player doesn't need it)
---
3. Player who is incorrect class to use item, but rolls to give it to friend (this has been cited in other threads and is the least "under the radar" yet)
---
4. Player who rolls need to barter for it after (again not at all "under the radar")
---
There will be some rare edge cases where loot trading could decrease your personal odds of getting that one item you want and is somehow hard to detect, but that is the exception and I trust the community to police things such as bartering. I solidly think this issue is blown ridiculously out of proportion in this sub.
---
It is known.
---
I would recommend re-speccing around the reset to your PvP spec, and raiding as Fury. For both PvP and PvE, Engineering is essential if you want to optimize things, so I'd definitely pick that up as well as Mining. 
---
Humans don't give you anything for PvP, but are the most optimal PvE race. Dwarves and Gnomes in particular are really strong PvP wise, with Escape Artist being absolutely incredible on a warrior as mobility is often your biggest obstacle to overcome in PvP.
---
Damn that look sweet ! I think you really nailed the atmosphere with the colors and the overall style of the paintings. Nice work :)
---
Yeah, you don't have much skills but lvl 20 is pretty much the point of understanding gameplay
---
Out of everything written there I only ever saw the move so you don't get debuff from Hakkar on private servers. It would also not be consistent either. 
---
Also the fire buff from mind control, but was never considered exploit anyway. Takes long time to get everyone in raid to get it and to get to boss and it goes away after you die. Was mostly in bad pick up groups for BWL (Vael).
---
When I visited Undercity for the first time, it took me more than 30 minutes to find an exit to the Tirisfal Glades. Since that time I hate this city :)
---
Even though I like watching vanilla guides for the nostalgia I'm still going to take things at a normal pace and enjoy the game. 
---
There is no need to rush things in Classic, for once quests and many other aspects take quiet a long time to complete anyway. You might aswell do it with nice people instead of rushing "elitists".
---
Overly complicated.
---
Use LC and /roll when people have an equal need.
---
The batching always confuses me a bit, it really seems like processing everything in larger intervals would lead to more lagspikes than doing everything "in real time".
---
You are right when it comes to added spells, procs and the game generally having to update much more than it had to back in vanilla.
---
The position data was mentioned when they talked about how complex boss encounters ala WoD+ were not possible with the old system and they updated it at some point (jumping over beams etc.).
---
There is just soooo much less happening in Classic compared to the later expansions.
---
Also, ever since Blizzard introduced sharding, there was no reason for them to focus on making large scale battles work anywhere aside from dedicated Battlegrounds, the smaller instances are just not configured to handle it.
---
There is no way blizzard is unable to change this with classic, they just don't need it for retail because there is no longer any demand for it.
---
When classic launches. Stay up until 3am, crack open a beer, turn up the zone music, and go grinding in Winterspring. It's a spiritual experience.

20: Enough to get a feel for the class, and if it's a class you like, you'll be able to tell by this point. Most people have enough of their core kit, and you've had the chance to do some dungeons and see how you like them in groups as well. *If I'm not having a good time by now, I probably don't like the class and will stop leveling it*
---
30: You're well into the character and out of the "new character" phase at this point. If you kept playing past 20, now is when I usually feel like I can decide whether or not it's a class I want to main and level all the way to 60. *If I'm not thinking "Alright yeah, I could main this class" by now, the character can be dumped*
---
35: Hard cutoff, I won't level past this if I don't want to max the character or they are a high level twink. Past this point, leveling becomes a lot slower, and you're high enough level that you can max your profs, making this still a solid stopping point. By 35, you should really have a good idea if you like the class's playstyle enough to main it. *At this point I decide whether this is my main, and if not, what I want to do with the character. They'll most likely be a high level twink or profession toon if they aren't my main*
---
I think you get enough of an *idea* about what a class does at end game at this point, if you've done a bit of 5 mans and you have any experience with end game raiding.
---
Yep this is one of the best 'farmable' ones.  if you're level 40+ and find yourself in Arathi, clear out the elemental camps if you're close by.  Easy money!
---
I'd say 25-30.  
---
By 20 you'll have most of the signature abilities of your class, and by 30 you'll have reached a talent or spell that can be a game changer. 
---
Just reading these responses you can tell who the laid back one is and who the hard core raider is. Geez.

 **&lt;Guide&gt; - EU PvP Server- Alliance**
---
**Language**
---
English
---
**Guild Type**
---
Hardcore PvE Guild, with PvP Events
---
**The Philosophy**
---
We're a guild consisting of three friends with experience from the private server hardcore community, and have participated in speedruns and realm firsts in various raids. However we haven't been active in that community for a while now and instead turned our attention towards planning our own guild when the official servers arrive.
---
We're planning to be a top-tier raiding guild, with the goal of realm firsts and fastest, throughout all of Classic content. We already have a lot of preparation done, and are currently on the state where we mainly need to recruit people.
---
**What we expect of you**
---
We have some fairly high demands for those of you who are interested in joining our guild, but deem this necessary as our expectations are high. However if you don't have any experience, don't let this scare you away, we feel confident that the leadership and class leaders will be able to help you out, as long as you have a mindset that’s willing to learn. However we do expect you to put the time and dedication in the game needed to participate in this level of gameplay, and are able to research stuff yourself, in order to improve your gameplay.  
---
We also expect you to participate in events, held by the Guild during the time we wait for a release. May this be on the (hopefully) upcoming Test Servers, or meetings of some sort in the guild. We expect that when you chose to apply for this guild, you will show dedication towards it, even prior to Classic release.
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule (GMT+1)**
---
Wednesdays 18-23
---
Thursdays 18-23
---
Mondays 18-23
---
During new content release we expect to dayraid
---
You can find more information over on our Discord, or by PM’ing me or another from the Leadership. We hope we caught your interest and that you're up for the challenge!

Undercity.
---
My first toon ever was an undead mage and I fell in love with the dank dungeon feel and the creepy music.
---
The solution to this, in my opinion, is the following:
---
If a faction imbalance gets to be over 60/40, then limit character creations on NEW accounts for the higher population.
---
The problem this creates is when friends want to play together. So to fix this, have the ability to be invited to join the higher population from the friend to join the server.  
---
Can people still find a random person to invite them? Yes.
---
But, this will weed out a large portion of people who would continue to create a massive imbalance. Especially if there are streamers on the server, all of their fanboys can't join up. 
---
&gt; Blizzard is playing a dangerous game, because they will boost their subscription counts for WoW through the roof, but once people taste Classic, all of this 'rose tinted' bullshit memeing will be dead for good and a substantial amount of people will prefer Classic over BFA once they try it and realize how much more of an adventure it is. 
---
I don't see how exactly this is a dangerous game. In all honesty, I believe that Blizzard (actually Activision-Blizzard) have plans in place for ANY outcome of Classic, and one of those plans is the outcome that Classic will prove to be more popular than BfA, not at launch (Classic launch will be the BIGGEST launch ever in WoW history) but after.
---
There is a VERY SERIOUS reason why Blizzard is refusing to say what their plans are down the road. They aren't talking about TBC, they aren't talking about seasons, they aren't talking about post-Naxx content in a lvl 60 permanent capped world, or Classic-like expansions.
---
ALL of the above scenarios are considered, but only ONE of them will actually take place, and that depends on the Classic popularity.
---
As for the rest of your post, I fully agree that avoiding going hardcore in Classic is a MUCH, MUCH better choice than going hardcore, for the vast majority of the player base.
---
so much this! I can't tell you how angry it makes me to see modern day mindsets seep into classic wow. Everyone is so concerned with being uber efficient, ruling the "meta", BIS/PREBIS nonsense, reserving multiple items in a PUG, etc! Do we so soon forget this was a GAME aimed to entertain players and immerse them in a wonderfully constructed persistant world? Enjoy the journey on the way to the destination and your destination will be ever the more joyful! relax, take it all in.
---
Sen'jin Village. beaches, tropical islands and close to the capital! 
---
&gt; which can be saved by adding a feature that in honesty doesn’t affect anyone game because unlike current WoW the motto of classic is ‘Actions have Consequences’  
---
I strongly disagree that adding this to the game, wont affect anyone.  
---
Actions have consequences, are strongly affected by what the majority finds "reasonable".   
---
&gt; don’t be a dick because people will find out   
---
If the large communities on the server start accepting that "low performance" or any other excuse, makes it okay to stack needrolls to favor a friend.  
---
Then anyone can abuse that, you will never be able to trust accusations of ninja'ing, it becomes a word vs word.  
---
Because it's not enough evidence that everyone was needing, now you need to know everything about the run, to understand wether the wronged party had made enough mistakes during the run to warrant the behavior.  
---
\^all of this headache is gone by not introducing loot trading in the first place.
---
I love this.
---
While I never hit 60 during vanilla, I spent most of my time leveling and rolling new characters. Even once I hit the level cap for the first time (level 70; TBC), I had a "What now?" moment and then rolled a new character.
---
The process of traveling across the vast world leveling and meeting folks was much more entertaining to me than the end game. That by itself should speak volumes for how good the leveling was. 
---
**So, tl;dr: You're absolutely right. Stoked for Classic.**
---
Yeah most hybrids lean for one role over the other, and will regularly get that role in 5man PUGs, even more so in guild runs. You can also form the party yourself and avoid the issue entirely.
---
Good, because I haven't played this game since I was 11 years old and never made it past level 40.  
---
Will it be impossible for me to find a guild as a new player who wants to play rogue?  I see a lot of people commenting that rogues aren't wanted and are last in the loot priority.
---
&gt;  I redid the whole BiS part, all the graphic stuff was a bit too messy I think.
---
phase 1-6 buttons show nothing btw
---
Logistically , Thunderbluff would be the best:
---
\- AH &amp; Bank are closest together of all factions
---
\- Smelting &amp; inn is just as close
---
Cow poo after all...
---
Druid is probably the highest skill cap PvP class, and is somewhat gear dependent. It requires really clever powershifting to counter what your opponents are doing, which requires really in-depth knowledge of PvP, moreso than most (all) other classes.
---
Very rewarding if you can pull it off, but very hard. They are also much much weaker if ganged up on, because their DPS is very low. However, they are also one of the best classes at escaping in the game. They have 30% move speed in their default shapeshift, with a root, a sleep (vs. other druids and pets), and tons of heals including instant-speed HoTs.
---
While a *good* 1v1, I would not recommend them. They aren't as smooth of a 1v1 leveling PvP'er as warlock or hunter IMO.
---
Well, the worst thing of UC may not even be location, but the layout. The fact you have to walk all that way/go via elevators from the zepp is incredibly annoying and completely unnecessary.
---
&gt;the virgin minmaxer
---
I feel personally attacked.  We'll see who gets the last laugh when I pwn you on the DPS meters on Van Cleef!
---
I really liked it, but my experience was: very fun PvP and loved the telegraph system, FPS was REALLY BAD and ultimately why I quit, instances were a little too hard IMO, and nobody had anything to do at max level.  If the FPS was equal to WoW I would have kept playing. 
---
They all seem to be saying if anything it might be necessary at the the end but they dont want it idk where you are getting this idea of them being a evil council trying to ruin the game but it seems to be based off your own fantasy and not reality. 
---
&gt;  The Dreamworks characters, the UI, the linear and boring story, and the discordant setting are all game design/leadership issues.
---
Creating a game is easy. Creating a fun game is very difficult because you have to guess what your playerbase when 99% of the time they don't even know what they want. Sometimes you have a really good studio with a pre-existing loyal fanbase, and you end up with the success of World of Warcraft. 
---
But that's, by far, the anomaly. What games like Warhammer, RIFT and Wildstar had to achieve was far more difficult because they had to build a playerbase from scratch *and* compete with an MMORPG that was already dominating the market.
---
Even if those games were excellent MMOs (like Rift), they were all doomed to failure due to market forces out of their control.
---
As a developer, when someone tells me a game element is "boring", I just ignore it because how do you fix that?
---
Might not be super fun setup, you will be needing the same loot at all times.
---
All the FF games are standalone. 
---
Sure, I only cited 2500 because thats about what Vanilla cap was claimed yo be. But again "more powerful servers" isnt the only argument at play here. 
---
Can you show me where any content creator has called themselves “important online-persona” or did you just make it up?
---
Bullshit!  Unless you're minmaxing every stat, including choosing the "correct" race, and living off Hot Pockets whole popping in a sock and following someone else's optimal leveling guide to hit 60 before the first week is over, you're not having any fun at all!

# &lt;Always East&gt;
---
**Semi-Hardcore | PvP | Server Region: NA, but all are welcome! | Faction: Alliance**
---
**ABOUT US:**
---
**"*****From that moment, we traveled together, East. Always... into the East.*****"** Our name is derived from a quote of Marius (Diablo II); we are always pushing forward, regardless of the opposition that looms over us.
---
Hello and thank you for reading this post! We are **&lt;Always East&gt;**; a group of like-minded members who are looking forward to the release of Classic WoW in the Summer 2019. Our members consist of players spanning throughout all expansions of WoW, with several having experience throughout Vanilla's MC, BWL, ZG, AQ20/40 and Naxxramas raids when they were current content. Reliving the glory days of Vanilla WoW by participating in the grand adventure set before us as PvE raiders and PvP enthusiasts sets our hearts ablaze. Needless to say, we are die-hard fans of Vanilla WoW.
---
We are currently looking to expand our roster with those who want to have an enjoyable and lively experience in the future release of Classic, all while being respectful to all those around us. Above all else, our members strive to live by the motto of Bill and Ted at all times: **"*****Be excellent to each other!!*****"** Here are some of the basics of **&lt;Always East&gt;**...
---
**WHAT IS OUR GOAL IN CLASSIC?**
---
\- Our main goal at the start of Classic will be to build up our characters, be it through questing, mob grinding, dungeons, whatever! At the same time, we want to focus on building up our trust in our members and identifying who can perform specific roles when the time comes for us to jump into our first raid.
---
\- After the leveling process has come to an end, we are looking to jump into the high-end dungeon scene and gear ourselves up for the Molten Core raid.
---
\- That's when we'll begin our journey into MC, BWL, etc. as they crop up. Being familiar with the fights isn't required, but we strive not to waste others' time with lengthy explanations or continuous raid wipes to the same mechanic. Please understand your role.
---
\- Overall, having a good time with good people! We want signing on to be a fun experience and not a stressful one!
---
**WHAT IS EXPECTED?**
---
\- As a PvE raider: Be knowledgeable of your class and have the desire to improve yourself - whether that be through the acquisition of gear, perfecting your rotation or increasing your attention to mechanics. Try to put the raid before yourself.
---
\- As a PvPer: Show up and do your best!
---
\- As a Social: Be kind and courteous in guild chat, make friends, and be excellent!
---
**WHAT IS THE RAID SCHEDULE?**
---
\- Current plan is to raid twice a week; Wednesday and Thursday (this may change depending on how Classic raids feel after launch.)
---
\- Raiding will **START** (meaning the first pull of the night - NOT when you need to sign in to be invited) no later than 8:15PM EST.
---
\- Raid will have a **10 MINUTE BREAK** around 10:00PM EST for raiders to get up, stretch, get a drink of water, use the restroom, etc.
---
\- Raid will **END** no later than 11:45PM EST.
---
\- It cannot be stressed enough: **"*****Don't waste our time, and we won't waste yours.*****"** Be READY to raid when the time comes.
---
**OTHER FAQ's:**
---
Q: **Do you accept social players that may not be able to raid?**
---
A: Very much so!  We aim to make this a family friendly guild, but at the same time progressing firmly in the PvE content of Classic.
---
Q: **What other plans do you have for Classic besides raiding?**  
---
A: Our members have already been discussing this.  Ideas include, but are not limited to: fishing contests, 1v1/2v2/ 5v5 duels, hide-n-seek in Ironforge, Quiz Time in guild chat, World PvP and taking over a horde town, screenshot contests, costume contests, guild farm groups, weekly lottery, rat races, treasure hunts, and more!  All with prizes that benefit the players as well as the guild.
---
Q: **How many members do you have?**
---
A: As of the time of writing this up, we currently have 46 Discord members.  Of those, 37 have identified what class and role they wish to play.
---
Q: **Are you using DKP or Loot Council?**
---
A: We are leaning towards DKP/EPGP.  The leadership has taken years of experience from leading prior guilds and poured everything that was effective into Always East. We will not be using Loot Council, other than the fact that Thunderfury will be going to the tank who shows up the most often for raiding (whoever has the highest attendance and the points to spend on it at that time.)
---
The overall goal of this guild is to have a place they can call their “second home,” away from the real life stresses we all face. A place where a group of like-minded individuals can hone in on a goal for a couple of hours a day and make huge progress. Please reach out via a direct message through the WoW forums, or message one of our officers up on Discord (**Parker#1471, Tharkun#4460 or Kegg#8900**) to chat more. We look forward to hearing from you! Orders stand: ***“Be Excellent!”***

**Reach out if you have questions!**

It’s a shame the community is super gatekeepery in XIV though. You’ll find it hard to get involved in RP communities without making sure you’re in one of two servers (Mateus or Balmung), and even then, literally all of RP takes place behind closed doors. 
---
One of the reasons why I am a little bit less optimistic about Classic WoW is that so many people know all the ins and outs of the game. There will be a lot of min-maxers, people following the likes of Joanna’s levelling guide and have infographic add-ons guiding them. But vanilla wow we were all a lot more clueless, and part of the fun was in discovering all these different possibilities in the game. 
---
Still, I am looking forward to it. 
---
Didnt they explicitly say at some point that it wont be used on end game content, because things like the AQ gates opening were such a major part of the atmosphere of WoW that they dont want to ruin that?
---
Where exactly are you pulling your information from ? I'm intrigued :)
---
The exp and rep rate on ND is accurate to vanilla standards , at least close enough since we don't really have access to vanilla data these days, I'd at least say that it's the slowest server for exp/rep compared to all other pservers.
---
But then again dragging me into an argument of your choosing in order to justify a point that isn't what the main topic is about isn't going to change the original question, even if pservers have slight exp differences, this doesn't weigh them higher than loot trading or sharding in terms of changes.
---
And who is to say classic will have the correct numbers either ? the people working on classic are people who worked on some pservers, not even blizzard has all the vanilla data else they wouldn't have screwed up health regens so much in the demo and had to be told off by players:)
---
Any updates on a release date?
---
For the record, the chest that “virgin minmaxer” is using is “robes of the exalted” from Baron Rivendale, few chest compare in +healing, but if the game starts with 1.12 items, there is a plate chest from highlord ommok that has decent +healing
---
=))
---
look at this 10k survey that was done on this sub
---
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1lXQJd9z7vLCZN1-MKl5Y8j3AQxuW0SiZnNKeGXgBuF0/edit#gid=0
---
2902 said 'no' that they didnt play on pservers before
---
7.1k said yes
---
so like 70% played on ps
---
Loot council is hard to maintain an appearance of being fair to 40 people. 
---
Personally, I'd say anywhere in the 20-30 range. If you're not enjoying it, by then, you'll probably want to roll something else.
---
Quality thread right here 
---
Truth be told, there’s not a ton of instances people run while leveling unless you have quests, but yeah I agree with everything you’re saying. Again, I think retail players going to Classic are in for a shock at how easily they can pull aggro off of a tank and run out of mana. I down rank heals at any instances starting at SM and spending less mana is good practice. I didn’t mention 5 sec rule - yes, healing in burst and taking breaks to allow regen is another thing retail players have to get their heads around. 
---
You need engineering, if you wanna play pvp at 60,specially as a warrior 
---
Having your own house was one of the best things in Ultima Online.
---
15 in 2006 :)
---
&gt; The only thing I could come up with is inflation. 
---
If that is ALL you can see...clearly you are not thinking too much, aren't you?
---
How about STOMPING the damn raid content, because you can respecc whenever you want, and instead having 10 healers, you need like 6, and the other 4 respecc DPS, and the 2 OT's also spec dps? All of a sudden, you got a boost of 6 extra DPS.
---
They will just go respecc back for the next boss.
---
As for inflation, you have NO IDEA how much the inflation would be with no respecc cost. The ENTIRE population of tanks and healers will suddenly be able to farm whenever they want in a DPS spec. That is a MASSIVE influx of gold in the economy. And that will lead to everyone getting richer, prices, even high, won't be enough to stop people using MUCH MORE consumables in raiding...again, leading to stomping raid.
---
The content will be roflstomped by pretty much anyone, and instead having 4-5 guilds per server as top guilds, we will have the majority of the guilds being TOP guilds. Game will be dead in no time.
---
Man, really, if you aren't enlightened yet, there is no hope for you.
---
Yeah, people take this shit way too seriously. Best in slot means very little if you’re not the most efficient player you can be and in addition to that; you don’t need to be the most efficient player you can be unless you are, like you said, in the top 1% of progressive players or guilds. Just relax and have fun. It’s a game that was made before the age of “achievement” gaming. It’s classic, it’s old school and that’s why everyone loved it.
---
Classic hype will be MASSIVE in the beginning. The first guilds to clear ragnaros and onyxia will have a lot of viewers on twitch and will be remembered by a lot of people. 
---
I guarantee you these guilds will powerlevel to 60 and try to clear content as fast as possible. 
---
end up playing SL warlock
---
Tbf, there will be such a thing as world first classic AQ. There *will*  be competition between servers. It's human.
---
That is unfortunate, but that's just the consequence of the games age and the time that we live in. Even though most people aren't a part of the top end guilds they'll play the game like they are, sometimes sacrificing their gaming experience along the way. As someone who has played this game off and on for 14 years I can say the best way to reexperience the game is with someone who has never experienced it themselves. If you can manage to do that, you'll have a blast. 
---
Neither of the weather/shading are the same, you can see it in the vid i linked above had you clicked it, you also seem to be debating whether these changes are good/bad which isn't what I'm asking, jumping to conclusions isn't gonna change my mind.
---
Saying something is different from something else and then arguing that it's better doesn't change the fact that it's different to begin with, you see that right?
---
Everyone here is desperately attacking my points with reasons as to why this and that is better but that's not what I'm asking at all, why is everyone intent on deflecting just to avoid the truth?
---
I second that guy’s opinion. Druid is where it’s at. Put in the work to understand the class a bit, get a good build (omen of clarity is amazing) and then you’re good to go. 
---
The interest will be massive, sure. But there won't be any recognition for beating the content. It was beaten over a decade ago literally. You'll get laughed at in-game if you actually believe this.
---
Well these are really cool and would make great posters or something
---
It's hard,   
---
40 is when you unlock your abilities.  
---
but 60 in pre-raid bis gear is where the spec starts feeling smooth.  
---
Atleast that's my experience with very gear dependant classes like warr/rogue.  
---
Not having atleast the soft caps for hit  
---
and a decent amount of crit.  
---
Makes the specs slow and unfun.
---
You are still missing the point.
---
Scenario 1: Dev team comes up with a potential change to the game, and implements it whether 0% of players want it, or 100% of players want it, or anything between.
---
Scenario 2: Dev team comes up with a potential change to the game, but they only implement it if 75% or more of players want it.
---
People in this thread are saying they would rather Scenario 1, because "people are dumb and voting is bad." But there is no possible way for Scenario 2 to result in a stupid change to the game which wouldn't already happen in Scenario 1. Scenario 2 can only possibly be safer, because it gives an extra chance for the community to say, "No, we want the game to stay as is."
---
Just saying "people dumb, voting bad" misses the point.
---
You fucked up, stop trying to dig yourself out of that hole. 
---
That I raided at the end of vanilla not launch day
---
I dont know, thats hard to say. A little after launch we had 1.5 mill subs, 6 mill at AQ release, and peak at 12 mill during Cata. Its clear that Vanilla through Wrath (and people probably didnt want to give up on Cata right away) were more popular. Its theorized that end of Wrath is when Activision started changing things.
---
So of course its all speculation, but older WoW (including Vanilla) seems like it was more popular than modern WoW (I know they dont release sub numbers now, which is an indication it's low). I think its reasonable to think Classic WoW will retain people, but of course we live in a different time, so we'll see.
---
There are artists. There are genious. You re in second category.
---
I miss being a noob.
---
Sounds like pretty standard fare for modern wow. Using invis pots/abilities to skip packs is something people do in retail wow M+ all the time.
---
Classic is going to get a lot of comparisons to Old School Runescape, which should be a good thing due to its success. 
---
There's a lot of casual OSRS players that stick around there, and I expect Classic to be the same. 
---
Honestly, back in the day when i still played, the groups I raided with all just used need rolling and sharding. Meaning if you needed a drop, you rolled. if no one needed, then it was sharded and rolled greed on the shard. We farmed raids enough for everyone to get their gear, so it wasn't a big deal. We hardly ever had pugs in the group, but in the event we did, we still let them roll. I never understood the point of DKP, other than being a self-serving (I'm more important than thou) attitude.
---
If by chance the pugs won something, they were more likely willing to fill empty slots if we needed them to, again. We actually poached quite a few good players from other guilds this way and ended up having a few different farm groups that we could switch members around if someone couldn't make it their normal raid.
---
iSeries in the UK on Easter Weekend. Blizzard is usually around in some fashion but never anything huge. 
---
Does Blizzard ever announce launch dates at conventions outside of BlizzCon?
---
I'm, telling you the macro/addon changes are nothing you can even bring up because that's a null point. Since you have no idea how elaborate the addons would be for vanilla today after 15 years. Since vanilla had less restrictions, we would have even more elaborate addons if Blizz kept vanilla servers, than the addons we'll see now which you're crying about.
---
The graphics will be THE SAME as classic, with the Classic Graphic option turned on. HOW IS THAT DIFFERENT?
---
Can you read  this time please?
---
I would say the barber shop needs to be pretty expensive.  Over time it will be beneficial because it will slow server inflation so someone isn't paying 50g for a stack of peaceblooms. 
---
We get those threads every day now what the fuck is their problem telling other people how to play a game.
---
12/13 
---
That would be a nice twist on classic: Revamp MC to Frozen Core aka FC and have everything tuned to cold damage :D
---
I still maintain that vanilla was the ideal balance between 'casual' and 'hardcore'. Many people just adventure/quest for months in their own little world and love it. Large raids mean that a casual can ease into raiding just fine by being a filler for a low tier guild that needs more bodies. On the other hand, if you want to be "the best" on your server, that requires a serious commitment. If you want Rank 14 that basically becomes your life. 
---
So no matter how you played, everyone felt satisfied.
---
Im going to play classic on the side, and I am goin to enjoy the shit out of it 
---
Wow. Just get outta here...

RemindMe! 5 months

You guys both have too much free time lok

 **&lt;TBD&gt; \[H\] US-PVP**
---
We are a Horde based guild (working on a name, we are holding a March Madness style vote in Discord eventually), specifically catering to those who want to raid casually, but just don't have the time anymore to commit tons of hours into the game. The bulk of our group is "9 to 5ers" who work, have families, or other commitments that prevent a more hardcore schedule.
---
We want to be an effective and efficient guild, clearing what we can, when we can. Make no mistake, we will experience all content of Vanilla, simply at a slower pace.
---
**Possible raid Schedule:**
---
2 days a week (likely weeknights, possibly 1 weeknight and Sunday). The window for raids times would between 8PM EST and 1AM EST. This does not mean we would raid during this entire time, only that we have the possibility if members are willing to stay awake and push until 1AM EST.
---
We will use some form of DKP or EP/GP. We will use NO loot council (outside of very specific items, such as Thunderfury for the main tank) as it lacks transparency and perceived fairness.
---
If a casual guild for you "9 to 5ers" sounds enticing, please PM me and I can send you the Discord link.
---
Thanks!

There are plenty of instant-level-60 private servers around, no need to make your own.

---
Blizzard is going to be 100% fine. Classic is absolutely not a make or break project for the company.
---
Awesome!
---
Feel free to play all classes and spec with alts.
---
OR shut the fuck up, pay up the 50g, and be done with it.
---
Nobody FORCES you to do anything.
---
Even though I've only leveled 2-3 classes past 10 I am well aware of how each class works based on other player's performance, guide's I've read and video's I've watched. You could do this too.
---
Thinking about this is why I'll probably (and regrettably giving Blizzard money) play classic. My best memories of WoW werent about rushing to max level to do the max content but just playing the game and enjoying the adventure
---
95% chance that you will be pushed to heal in one way or another on classic raid content (Especially horde side). 
---
Personally I would not recommend this spec if you plan to PvE endgame. PvP is absolutely different story though.
---
Neat. 
---
&gt; 50g respecs were a pain in the ass and added no depth to the game 
---
The PAIN IN THE ASS was the DEPTH of the game.
---
Compare rep and xp from classic wowhead. It doesn’t line up. 
---
Also the fact that blizzard has the of database and a working 1.12 client based off that database says that classic will have the correct numbers.
---
If I recall correctly, Legion was announced at a convention outside of Blizzcon. Maybe it wasn't the date, but the game as a whole? With the plummeting numbers of BfA I figure they'd leverage something sooner and more public.
---
Grab all and any not needed gear that drops or just buy straight up PvP gear. If you wanna focus on PvP you might as well abandon your PvE career altogether.
---
I have the memory of a fucking goldfish, so it really will be a whole new experience for me :)  
---
Well, that and i started in early to mid Wrath...
---
Im really looking forward to the pre-Cata world.  I kinda liked the Cata change at the time because it was something new/different, but looking back at some of the old zones...man i miss them.
---
Ugh, is it summer yet?
---
Discussion about vanilla is still better than this, but it has to be discussion that’s meaningful about something that’s not talked about a lot, like av 
---
Hello. I'm writing to you from the past. You have spent the past 5 months obsessing over content in a 15 year old game which has been beaten long ago. You have now come to the inevitable realization that all this time has been spent for nothing and that your life is ultimately meaningless.
---
That's why I have convinced your mother to up your allowance to $20 so you can finally start saving up for that 15sqm apartment.
---
Good luck, kiddo.
---
This is a pretty good idea.  I like it.  
---
Or if someone trades the item it calls them out in /yell chat and puts a hunters mark above their head. 
---
Ah yes, toxicity showing up right after it's said to "self select out." Stay classy, classic wow community.
---
Undercity was my hangout. Maybe it was just because that was the first city I encountered (rolled undead as my first toon), but also it is compact and easy to navigate, along with not overly crowded. The only time i really went to Org was when i would lockpick on top of the bank on my rogue, or enchant/tailor on my priest (both Undead).
---
Hi, 
---
We are currently looking at two days a week for raiding. The specific days are yet to be announced as we want to make at least one day a week work for most people. 
---
I've joined a preguild for alliance already ah.. why do I have to be a small gnome thing to be decent at PVP, lol.
---
Doesn't make sense to me.
---
No
---
You deserve a cookie for that!
---
You are basically describing the private server scene.
---
Players go to a fresh server, previous servers begin to die out because 90% of new players roll fresh rather then try and catch up on a server that has AQ on the horizon.  
---
&gt; my wand also does a **NEET** a mount of damage. 
---
Godspeed
---
You're all missing the point though. Classic will not be retail server. This means that the level of detail, animations, instancing, coding, and encounter design will be at a much smaller scale. The reason the retail servers can't handle such large gatherings of players for PvP is because the servers are designed for more PvE content now. Everything in the game now is amped up x1000 from what vanilla was. 
---
The classic servers will have much less animation, coding, encounter design, level of detail, and scripting for these world events. Therefore, no sharding will not be needed during world events. The servers will be able to handle it just like they used to.
---
https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=17&amp;t=1091
---
You're shit at Damage but still provide some desirable utilities as shadow like supporting the healers and increasing warlock damage. So some guilds might still bring you, for sure easier to raid as a healer though.
---
You don't necessarily need to raid for pvp. Dungeons offer a lot of great pvp gear too.
---
Except for people who don't tell you items are reserved and do fuck you and waste your time?
---
No one from Method is going to go for w1, maybe if it's right in between tiers.
---
More than likely, if anything Method will just get a separate team for Classic.
---
Sure, sure...Classic launch : 2 million players... 1.5 million of them are BfA drones/tourists... 800 realms required at launch (2,500 concurrent cap).
---
2 weeks after launch : 500,000 player remaining...on 800 realms. The total population cap per realm needed : 10,000 (Vanilla-like), Total realms needed for 500k players : 50.
---
Merge 800 realms into 50.
---
Kill Classic.
---
Guess you haven't think of that, aren't you, smart guy?
---
It isn't linear, which is why they struggle. They balance load between lots of (physical) servers, which increases latency but offers more responses. This is the basis for sharding. And it's good on paper. Especially since it's cheaper. Realistically, due to spiking/uneven traffic that MMOs provide, there's no way to properly balance load, so you have weaker hardware doing more work, when stronger hardware without load balancing would be able to breeze through it. This is the reason pservers can host 500v500 fights with 1-2s of latency or less, but Blizzard servers melt at 20.
---
Not on a mage. The fun starts at 21 (aoe grinding) :-)
---
with all the love to the pservers, there will never be a superior product, the worst thing about privat servers, is the corrupt environment and the risk of losing all your effort at any time.
---
Lmao all the people in here being assholes calling others toxic because they can't handle being disagreed with.

Druid have the arsenal to beat every class and do great come back in Wpvp when at disadvantage but every fight, even those where you engage, is a tryhard 
---
Instant/Instant for every Rogue i've leveled, or Crippling / Mind Numbing for certain situations. My thoughts are if you need to Gouge or Blind a mob to buy time to bandage or run away, I dont want the DoT from Deadly to interrupt that.
---
it is entirely possible they are holding on to the date to see if other games announce their releases so they can strategically release their game.
---
isn't ff14s new xpac coming out this summer too with no date yet? they may be waiting so as to compete with them or other games. 
---
Making a remind me request to prove how wrong you are is obsessing over content for 5 months? Interesting. Whatever you need to tell yourself to make yourself feel better about it I guess. 
---
We’re both on the same subreddit discussing the same topics. If one of us is “obsessing over 15 year old content” then that means both of us are. 
---
Wish someone had told me this before I compiled my own server and setup the database. Found out recently this guy does it monthly for people :P and it's also way more accurate than other alternatives.
---
Is there anyway to blow these up and make prints? I'd be happy to pay for some of your art and hang it on my barren walls (new homeowner with no decoration sense lol).
---
You know some of my favorite memories in Vanilla are?
---
Screwing around at BRM, BB or Ratchet trying to gank people without getting killed by guards.
---
You know how much actual skill or gear that required?
---
Zero.
---
We would always instigate some type of war to crop up if we kept at it long enough.  Did we spend all day grinding BiS gear lists? Hell no.
---
Was our gear even close to optimal? Fuck no. 
---
Did we have fun doing it when most pserver or vanilla try hards would consider that a massive waste of time? Hell yes we did.
---
I feel like Arcane is great early on because of the no pushback Arcane Missiles... but after about lvl 26, Frost far exceeds both Arcane and Fire in terms of AoE and single target. Also PoM is pretty useless aside from instant sheeps. That being said you should play how you like! I could totally see someone going 21/11/0 and having PoM Pyro at level 41 and blow up some people in PvP.
---
In familiar with the sewers, but this worm...
---
So if there are two patients in a hospital and one of them has a terminal disease, are they both guaranteed to die?
---
Hopefully you'll be smarter in 5 months.
---
I prefer to pvp, but in order to pvp I need to pve which makes things complex 
---
I just love questing around... world PvPing.. random shit...
---
Really? I had zero issues with the art, setting, story, or UI. The fundamentals were great. For me it was simply lacking content at max level that wasn't super hardcore, which is a pretty easy fix. More dungeons, raids, open world PvE areas. 
---
The only fundamental issue IMO was that telegraphs don't work well for PvP. 
---
That’s a great way of putting it. New WoW is very streamlined and very linear. Classic is much more dynamic. I keep mentioning the BiS thing because it’s a prime example of linear mentality seeping it’s way into classic dynamic. BiS literally was never a thing in classic and it’s not because we were too dumb to understand the concept. It’s because it didn’t matter. 
---
If you're horde, Troll and Undead are extremely stronk for Shadow.
---
If you plan on just raiding, maybe.  Depends how dedicated you are.
---
For literally anything else, its amazing. Solo, instances, pvp, grinding, etc.
---
I dislike horde for a couple of reasons even though I started out as undead sp, so I will most likely be rolling human 
---
I'd be scared of a wind storm
---
&gt;As a developer, when someone tells me a game element is "boring", I just ignore it because how do you fix that?
---
It's a question of taste. Any element of a game is subject to being satisfying, bland, or poor to the average person based on how good the instincts are of the creator responsible for it. Thus you must have people with intuitive understanding of what is "good". 
---
I was listening to Mark Kern on one of the Classic podcasts a few months ago and he clearly understood this. He said that he aggressively headhunted people from different companies to come work on their project based on the quality of their work. With tasteful people employed they could thus be given carte blanche over the element of the game they were assigned to. He and others who worked on the game were all also quick to point out that constructive criticism was welcomed and addressed. 
---
In the case of Wildstar this dev is not the only person who has pointed to leadership issues with its development. Carbine's Glassdoor has/had similar complaints of stifled creativity and wasteful and questionable shifts in direction away from things that were working.  
---
In vanilla I never had problems with hunters as a druid.
---
One of the few classes I remember always having an edge on. But I was feral resto spec so having 2 health bars and feral charge really kept them from ever being able to kite.
---
This post reminded me that we didn't have the phrase 'git gud' back in 2004. It was 'learn2play'.
---
How far our shitposting has come.
---
&gt; They had to add that crevice for you to accidentally fall into on occasion just to give this wonderful city a "downside". 
---
That was the best part of IF.  I would jump over that for hours while waiting for BG's to start or just fucking around.
---
You absolutely can raid without Ancestral Healing. Priests also have that talent and Priests are assigned to heal tanks as Horde. The Priest and Shaman talents do not stack.
---
As for Fire Nova in PvP: it costs too much mana for too little gain. You can make use of it in duels against certain classes (Warriors), but in any sort of group situation you are better off just not casting it and instead stretching your mana pool as long as possible. And I would argue that even in duels, you don't need the shorter activation time. 7% damage reduction against Mages is much more valuable in group PvP than 2 seconds off of Fire Nova.
---
I’m planning on having FUN not a second JOB thank you 
---
That sound familiar. Wasn't there something about the same poisons sharing a DR too or am I thinking of something else?
---
Not trying to start a fight, as I can see this has riled you up a bit. I was not advocating change, just trying to understand. Thank you for the insight. 
---
I would like to ask though, if you think gold is the only reason top guilds are top guilds, why even play?
---
Didn't they literally say (Ion?) that they would only use sharding for starter zones and/or for the first few weeks? Why are we all panicking? Did they say something else?
---
I'm aware. I'm just saying that if you're going to be subscribing for classic then you will be spending money. From the perspective of a retail player who is already subscribed then yeah it might feel like a free game to them.
---
yup, I upload most of my work to Inprnt too: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/
---
I'll be going Alch + Engi at 60.  Once I get all of the plans for Alchemy, I will barely use it for myself, it will mainly be a profession for my guild. 
---
Engineering is the best though. 
---
I tried doing this back in the day on my druid, but so much druid shit dropped in MC that it was either take it or shard it. Upgrades are upgrades. Of course, I was then tapped out on DKP come T2 and took me forever to complete my Stormrage set. I think I only ever had 2 pieces of T3, lol. 
---
You can, but expect to search for a while to find a guild ready to take a full on Shadow Priest for progression.
---
Also be prepared to do more work with consumables and in general guild contribution just to keep up with the other dps.
---
While leveling being able to heal the dungeons and not even requiring a different gear set is a big bonus.
---
Do you think a pvp oriented guild would be best?
---
Never heard of this before
---
I’d live in the Westfall lighthouse.  What’s not to love about a haunted lighthouse?  Plus tropical islands in STV are just a short swim away!
---
Spreists and locks in pvp have a much harder time as shadow. Their racials don't synergize nearly as much and having to deal with orcs resisting blackout and undead wotf will be annoying to say the least.
---
Then there are shamans constantly purging you and earth-shocking which will get old fast. Spriest is one of the few classes where its definitely easier in pvp to be on one faction over the other.
---
However, if you're absolutely confident on rolling Alliance the more power to you.  Enjoyment &gt; Min-maxing.
---
And usually no one but shaman and pallies want it too, even with just windfury in any spec the weapon is incredibly annoying for people to deal with, its great!
---
That "real community" of WPVP will suffer if you remove the only penalty for piling on one faction. Look at modern servers Cross realm BG's failed in what you are selling their achieve. We have WoW census sites that back that up as far as balance. It made the problem worse.
---
&gt;  Thus you must have people with intuitive understanding of what is "good".
---
listen to what you are saying. You've just created an impossible, unfalsifiable standard for making a game.
---
The problem with "boring" is that it is an utterly non-specific complaint. There are a million reasons why a player might think a game is boring, and many of those reasons don't have anything to do with the game.
---
Classic will NOT start with the 1.10 Dungeon-Items. 
---
Do you use an Ipad Pro to pain these digitally? What program if I may ask?
---
The hunter that can't use maces?
---
fixing the problem with skewed faction ratio and Q times.
---
fixing the problem with low PvP activity. 
---
fixing the problem with premades controlling the PvP scene of the entire realm.
---
fixing the problem with BG activity. single realms tend to focus heavily on WSG.
---
I have no doubt that PS players dominated this subreddit when it started. But do you honestly think that 70% of the next 40K players to join this subreddit come from private servers? 
---
No, they come from wow players who are hearing about the game through Blizz marketing.
---
On Uther we had a horde guild exploit AQ40. The entire guild got a 30-day ban from WoW. They took that shit seriously.
---
By and large, you should be very safe leveling. Nature's grasp and travel form can get you out of most situations
---
Nobody has even mentioned that Tauren are heavier and heavier things fall faster
---
Well, if you are going to switch your playstyle... I fully leveled a mage with usual fireball spam.
---
Engineering was way too gimmicky for me. Never used it
---
Yeah, how fucking dare people even imply they think differently
---
Can you guarantee that sharding won't be used post launch, if the community agrees to it during?
---
Warrior is the worst for this, 3 really important abilities locked out until level 40
---
The lock and warlock definitely will be competing over the really good +shadow items assuming the priest will be a spriest.
---
To the point of it may be beneficial to have say a heavier armored class like warrior or shaman in the mix to take up the non-cloth gear.
---
Warrior with sweeping, whirlwind and sweeping can do some nice aoe, while not being limited by mana.  And an ele shaman with CL and fire nova and provide a nice amount of burst damage while being a source of healing.
---
Can always use a remodel, it's probably gonna be possible and allowed in classic.
---
&lt;Name TBD&gt; [NA] [PvE Server] [Horde] 
---
There were no other guilds for this so I'm gonna make my own. Anyone looking to avoid the gankfest that is PvP servers, hit me up. 
---
I enjoy leveling many characters and Tanking dungeons. Back in Vanilla days I was in a top tier guild, but I have shit to do now. Just looking for some chill people to hang out with as we progress to 60 and run some 5-mans. 
---
Maybe if guild becomes large enough, we can go for Onyxia/MC, but that will be up to the guild and what everyone decides. 
---
Currently i'm playing on a pserver, so if you want to hang out before classic just let me know and we can chat on Discord or in game.
---
I'll just be an elitist role playing as a casual.
---
I am a filthy casual and I can't stand modern wow because its so watered down. Classic actually inspires me to grow and be better.  I don't care if I don't get to see the top content right away. I won't cry that I might never get to Naxx. 
---
What I enjoy is the journey, the attuements, the progress and the far away goals that I can aspire to, without them being made trivial/irrelevant each patch by stupid catchup mechanics.
---
It'd be somewhat easier, yes.
---
You get what you need from basic dungeon runs and PvP rank / BG rep items and you'll be set for quite a while.
---
There are also pug runs where the loot rules are more flexible or you could straight up farm a lot of gold and tag along a guild that sells items straight from raids. They are quite popular on Pservers, helps the guild to pay for consumables and helps randos get gear they might need without actually being a part of the guild and / or progression.

**Epoch of Thought \[H\]** | NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  Our leadership is experienced, skilled, and caring.  We've been around since the beginning and we're not quitting until we've farmed naxx enough to gear everyone :).  We look forward to developing a winning team of people you'd not only want to raid with, but would also like to meet in real life if the chance arose.
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a unique/proprietary point-guided loot council (attendance and contributions are measured and accounted for but there is no bidding and the system is designed to be transparent and efficient). focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  Toxicity and drama stirring have no place in our guild.
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Why We Will Survive and Thrive**:  We are experienced, dedicated, and prepared.  Our leadership team consists of mature, experienced, and professional leaders.  Our raid core consists of experienced, skilled, and most importantly, dedicated raiders.  We are busy doing all the prep work we need to run a highly organized, reasonably competitive guild.  We are inclusive, non-toxic, and value team building and a rewarding social environment over pyrrhic victories.  We were successful in actual vanilla and have only gotten smarter, wiser, and more organized with age.
---
Most importantly we desire complete decimation of classic content and will not stop until we get there.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; **specifically seeking: Fury/Prot &amp; Mages.** Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. This means that no core spots will be predetermined and certainly not before anyone's hit 60.
---
If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**What we offer**: Membership on an experienced, skilled and dedicated team ran by incredibly dedicated and passionate leadership with the time and flexibility to build and run an organized, efficient team.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message **(Discord: Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326)**.  You can also hit up either of my assistant GMs on **discord:  XvK#7740  &amp; AYD#5916**

At that point you have most if not all of your kit while not falling to "sunk cost fallacy" via time spent playing.
---
Man, this looks like a good justification for sharding at the beginning of the expansion! Ah wait, now I'm just a Blizzard apologist shill. Better to have #NoChanges and dead servers.

\[Malicious Intent\]\[NA\]\[PVP\]\[H\]
---
&lt;Malicious Intent&gt; is a Semi-Hardcore Horde raiding guild that will be competitively pushing all high end content in classic WoW with a focus on both clearing content and having fun doing it. We will initially be raiding **two days a week with a possible third night for progression weeks (never on the weekend)**. We use a loot council system with static members and one member rotated in per week to keep the council a fair and diverse place. &lt;Malicious Intent&gt; will be focusing on 40-man content. We will have PvP and PvE events; these include - but are not limited to - farming Devilsaur, raid consumables, gearing under-geared guildies and possibly even city raids. We are mostly working adults which may cause us to clear at a slower pace, but our guild is competitive and progression focused - so we will clear content. While we are a raiding guild we also welcome social players to build and take part in our community.
---
**Experience:**
---
* Leadership has experience into and through AQ40.
---
* We will gladly accept raiders both with and lacking prior experience. All we ask is that you put in equal effort in learning fights and coming prepared.
---
**Recruitment:**
---
* We are currently seeking **Rogues** and **Warriors** but are accepting all applicants.
---
* We do allow obscure specs, however the positions are ***highly competitive*** and they may receive lower loot priority than traditional specs.

Hopefully in 5 months you’ll know what straw man fallacy is and will not rely on it to “win” meaningless internet arguments. 
---
First part: reeeee
---
Second part: you right
---
Some temporary ailments are worth suffering to avoid the potential long term acceptance that sharding is an acceptable practice. 
---
Welp, it's dead now.
---
Camp Mojache in Feralas, with my old lady Greul.
---
What an odd form of gatekeeping
---
This is a late reply... but what’s the trick, please?
---
Iirc, Joanna would ask friends to pool money for how mount. It is absolutely the largest help you can easily provide yourself for faster leveling
---
It is an area that is often overlooked and the game really started to transition into the way it is today around Wrath.  This is part of the reason why I think a Wrath focused server will never be as popular as a Vanilla one.  I enjoy raiding, dont get me wrong, but when it became the sole focus everything suffered in response. In Vanilla and BC to an extent, you could still get meaningful progression without stepping foot into a raid. One could claim that is still true today, but gear is designed in such a way that it feels exactly the same no matter where you receive it. 
---
I think as long as player choice is restricted and streamlined, WoW is destined to continue to decline. 
---
I'm not really against sharding early. I think most people have an issue with when it is deactivated, where it is, and if blizzard is gonna use the same thing for say AQ launch.
---
Private servers has solved the issue pretty well.. It includes reduced view distance of npc/players and dynamic spawns to handle high pop, lag and playablity.
---
Lag: Low view distance means less server computation means less lag. Low server computation means the server can handle more players thus less queues.
---
Playablity? That's what dynamic spawns are for. 
---
Server stability? I mean you are just repeating issues at this point. That's similar to lag, and preserving a post-launch community is just about allowing high pop.
---
I can't guarantee anything...and neither can you.
---
But, this is not the point. The point is...is there any other OPTION to sharding, for launch?
---
Warrior for sure. Especially if you’re alliance and have a pocket paladin. Can’t ever be slowed.
---
Told no lies and in their very response they contradicted themselves and pushed for cross realm BG's.  **StaysafeTV says "how can you be for 1.12 talents and be against cross realm BG's, you are a moron". The only person there who talked about timeline is a Blizzard employee through MLG and he said that "it was a good thing".**
---
I don't have a problem with streamers, I have a problem with sociopaths like Asmongold who has underlings that are the only reason they are relevant. The only person in "Classicast" who had any following whatsoever before Asmongold pushed them is Esfand. I find it pretty interesting they all have the same opinion Asmongold did 6 months ago on his stream when old threads like I showed on both EU and US show people never even though cross realm BG's were a possibility due to Brack saying no cross realm and were completely against it.

---
"One of the tenets of Classic WoW is none of the cross-server realms and different \[server\] sharding options that we have available to us today. There’s a lot of desire on part of the community that this is something that they don’t want." 
---
Server craps out, people are stuck in pose instead of being able to attack, alliance eventually wins due to attrition with more players.
---
I believe I am qualified to appraise this video as authentic.
---
Most raids are going to want exactly 1 shadow priest, for shadow weaving. Even casual guilds would run into issues running several of them because they use multiple debuff slots each. 
---
So it's better than other hybrids, where you aren't wanted at all. But it's tricky to get into that 1 slot. 
---
For dungeons its always going to be faster to find groups as a healer, and you'll be under pressure to heal instead of DPS. But definitely doable. 
---
Of course, do what you want. I personally have "fun" by pushing myself past what I thought was possible. It's not even about "fun" for me anymore. I'm here for the accomplishment. I'm here for the satisfaction of being one of the very best.
---
I’m looking forward to playing a Druid not because it’s supposed to be the best but because I have played Druid since MoP when I started and even if it was the most painful choice I’d still level one. Classic goals are to hit 60 get a mount and do at least one raid. If I accomplish those things I’ll be happy. If I can get a full raid tier set then even better. See you in classic Azeroth!
---
Do you get to the Cloud District very often? *scoff* Of course you don't.
---
What is a remodel? 
---
LF a Dutch guild on EU servers, still not sure what class I'll be playing tho:)
---
I love taurens, but no a fan of dirt floors.
---
It's why Taurens have fleas.
---
True MVP would have been 1 or 2 rogues throwing distracts / saps out randomly so people get paranoid and less organized.
---
I think most people (from what I've seen) are fine with sharding in the starter zones as long as it is kept there for a short while and that it won't exist anywhere else. Which means as soon as you leave Valley of Trials for example, sharding won't be a thing.
---
But I hope you do realize that it will still be laggy and the starter zones completely filled up even with sharding. It's simply just a bit less laggy with sharding.
---
You're just a Blizzard apologist shill. /s
---
&gt; Playablity? That's what dynamic spawns are for.
---
Hooray, Mages can now level 47 times faster than anyone else.
---
&gt; That's what dynamic spawns are for. 
---
I am not even to comment on the stupidity of dynamic respwans, because it is well known to be a damn stupid idea.
---
But, my question was clear (apparently not for you). I asked for ONE SOLUTION that can solve ALL the issue. Dynamic respwans DO NOT solve the post-launch realm population. Or queues. Or lag.
---
Housing in UO is what ruined UO and the idea of non-instanced housing in MMOs, in general
---
I think we as a community need to start promoting that hard core is not being a dick. A lot of my friends from Vanilla were hard core and I was still learning the ropes for the longest time. They taught me a lot of ins/outs of the game. They also set an example of how to treat pugs. If you play with nicer players you get to see that the community isn't built around elitist pricks.  
---
This sub reddit has the opportunity to impact some of how the community reacts. Veterans and hard core players be the example that you would have wanted when you first played.
---
yup, I use an ipad hooked up to my desktop and connect the two screens with AstroPad - I use Photoshop for the painting itself, mostly cause I'm so used/comfortable with it from the past decade (tried other programs too but it's hard to beat so many years of being used to PS)
---
I worked with a simple Bamboo Wacom tablet until a year ago, but the disconnect between looking at the screen and painting on the desk was just too much for me (some people learn to draw like that in the first place, but I already learned how to draw with pen and paper so it's pretty hard and frustrating for me to be back at the eye-to-hand coordination level of a 4 year old haha)
---
I find a ton of excitement and joy fighting world pvp... Sometimes the odds are in my favor, sometimes not. Do I kill lower levels? Yes. Do I kill higher levels? Yes. I kill anyone I can when I can because for me it adds a lot to the game, especially on PvP servers. This is why Blizzard made pve servers for you softies 😜
---
That's like the Hotel California. You can check in, but you'll never leave..... alive.
---
Isn't detect traps back in retail?
---
indeed, and a shitload of them wish they could play vanilla. I started in tbc myself, and I wanna try it. 
---
cool
---
Bear stun, powershift into cat form, shred shred.
---
Tauren wartomp into roots + heals
---
Natures grasp into travel form
---
Ambush shred into bear form charge and root and rinse repeat.
---
Druids with power shifting had a lot of good burst options in vanilla.  But it required 3 forms of resource management, and was highly dependent on opportunity. 
---
Still not going back to my druid main in vanilla, rolling as my alt shaman this time.
---
Gear dont matter if you are being kited, unless you are rich and use a fap for every fight you will do poorly in 1v1.
---
Lets not talk about the levelling phase where warriors are just a free kill for most classes.
---
You and I are in the exact same boat. The suspense is killing me!!
---
In my opinion you're too concerned about quantifiable and measurable factors. Taste is more abstract than that. It's a bit abstract and philosophical and I've only ever known it when I've seen it. 
---
We got Vanilla WoW because Blizzard was careful to hire people with taste. Kern said something to that effect; that he sought out people whose work and style he thought was conducive to his project. Boring is not something you can avoid if you don't have people on the team who recognize good. At that point you'll have to rely on copying a successful project or on the sensibilities of  idiots in marketing research.
---
We got retail WoW because Blizzard stopped listening to those people and became more concerned with market research, as you say. 
---
Pvp is a whole different animal in 2019. Might as well be a different game compared to 2006
---
&gt; There will be a lot of min-maxers, people following the likes of Joanna’s levelling guide and have infographic add-ons guiding them. 
---
Don't worry, they'll be easy to spot and avoid. When you are level 45 you'll wander into Orgrimmar and see a bunch of 60s just sitting on their epic mounts.
---
we'll just have to wait and see. I think you severely underestimate just how popular early wow is
---
Yeah, I am still working on those. Finished the first 3 today, the others might take some time.
---
They added respec much, much later, in 2010. 
---
Why don't you try playing a Warlock, if you are only interested in playing as DPS?
---
This
---
No people panic because they don't believe what Ion / Blizzard is saying. Given the recent track history it isn't unjustified but the extent people are giving their crap on this subreddit is just outrageous.
---
Rogues are the number one damage dealers in classic. The reason people say they won’t be wanting rogues is because there’s going to be eight billion of them all over the place. 
---
Its not false at all. There's plenty of terrible players, chad will be just fine. 
---
Omg I have totally forgotten about that.
---
Holy fuck, bring swirly ball back. 
---
Dynamic spawns and actually buying good servers for the game.
---
Where do I sign?
---
Man, these are great :)
---
Thunder Bluff for me. Very nostalgic especially since I love the Tauren.   One of the best views though was coming up on the great lift in thousand needles for the first time. 
---
Servers are shit now. Yesterday was vol'dun assault and it was laging as fuck. That wasn't a game launch but sharding was active. They need to seriously beef up their servers. 
---
Yep. They are fine. Go for it.
---
queues
---
Yes, [Harmonious Gloves](https://classicdb.ch/?item=18527) from DM!
---
Ah, you're one of those people who are entitled to content. gotta get that lfr going 
---
I'd prefer that they set up clusters of servers with a shared naming pool and then merge them as needed. It's going to have to happen anyway further down the line as the population dwindles.
---
And a quest doesn't need to be completed in 5-10 minutes. Most won't be regardless of sharding or not. And sharding certainly doesn't solve the issue of "preserving a post-launch community" if that's what you're implying. You will literally be unable to see most of your community. 
---
&gt; Hooray, Mages can now level 47 times faster than anyone else.
---
Keyword being "dynamic".
---
They won't be able to because the spawns will be affected by the ammount of players in a certain area.
---
Mages won't be able to go to an empty map and find 10x the number of mobs there should be there
---
My racist Paladin: "The Night Elves are pagans and must be cast from the Alliance!"
---
Then my brother got the account banned for actual racism and I never role played again.
---
I was a relatively hardcore raider back in the day, up to &amp; including Cataclysm. I dabbled in Mists for a bit before calling it quits.
---
I didn't even know private Vanilla/BC servers even existed until I heard about Blizz releasing Vanilla.
---
But I don't have any plans to touch a private server - the temptation is strong, but my memories of Vanilla are so weak and faded, that I want to at least have the opportunity to properly immerse myself in the official game as much as possible. I'm hoping to recapture the nostalgia from my very first login in early 2005; I want to experience the wonder that came with the game back then.
---
And if I don't get that feeling all over again, that's ok too. I just want the *opportunity* to experience it
---
No, I live in dwarf town, next to the deeprun station. Always smelly, always noisy :(
---
&gt; Dynamic respwans DO NOT solve the post-launch realm population. Or queues. Or lag.
---
Neither does sharding.
---
Transmog is one of the most enjoyable parts of the game to me though. I kinda wish classic was going to have it. I await the flood of downvotes.
---
Where did you guys go wrong lmao
---
This is my new headcannon
---
The WoW team still has a lot of old Blizzard people on it, especially Classic. Any worries I had were alleviated with their blue post. Their hearts are obviously in the right place. The only problem I see now is that streamers are now trying to push for certain things that give them "content" 24/7 at the sacrifice of community, while manipulating an audience who has no idea what Vanilla community was even like.
---
I have more trust in the Classic team than I do with the people claiming or wanting to represent the Classic community. Blizzard is a business whose best business move is to provide as accurate an experience as they can. Vanilla is proven on private servers and for Blizzard. There is a big difference between 10,000 and 1 million though.
---
The biggest threat to Classic now is the playerbase that can be manipulated by people with agendas.
---
1. Modern technology will make lag trivial, other than spell effects or add-ons swapping huge amounts of information - if there's a problem with an add-on, then attribute it to poor add-on design, not to Blizzard. Blizzard should be able to tune spell effects so that 40+ players in combat will not cause serious lag
---
2. Login queues result from population caps. This is a normal part of life if you choose to roll on a high pop server. 
---
3. Dynamic respawns or quest items resetting (not like pserver, where some quest items only respawn after 15 minutes when there are a dozen people waiting around.) This also has to do with maintaining a healthy server population, not to few &amp; not to many.
---
4. I'm not sure what you are getting at, unless you are suggesting that many people will become annoyed and quit UNLESS sharding is present.
---
5. Add hardware to support the starter zones. This same hardware can be used to support world events like AQ. Blizzard in 2019 has endless $$$$ to support the infrastructure for their games - an extra server rack is likely a drop in the bucket for them, where in 2004 this would be more carefully planned out around their limited budget.
---
This is one of the best posts I have ever seen in a while
---
Doubtful. A massive queue would probably increase interest. 
---
I abused it all the time on retail and never got caught, I've played WoW for a decade. 
---
Mage has their full rotation at level 1 lol
---
I think of it as Diablo-lite. Your spec is part of your character, but you can change it occasionally if you fuck something up or want to try a new playstyle. 
---
The 50g fee is intentionally high, its clearly not intended for people to respec twice a week so they can be optimally specced for every situation. It's one of the things that keeps the RPG in MMORPG.
---
Epics were relatively easy to get.. it's just that early epics weren't as good as dire maul blues or mara rings and trinkets. 
---
Actually, sharding DOES.
---
1.2 FPS or we riot! /s
---
Iv'e said in the past the two biggest draws to classic for me is the simpler game play and the slower pace. I like how getting started in classic is so easy. Just picking up the basics of each class seem natural and smooth. While doing this classic also allows for deep mastery through the use of use items and, consumables.
---
The more basic game play allows for people to play. That you would never see today. Even non-gamers could get sucked into classic because of this. While I never did it amazing how many people you see with great memories of playing with parents.
---
I also like the slower pace because it allows you to take in the world. While socializing and having fun. Its not just a roller coaster of over the top nonsense.
---
Welcome &lt;Working Adults&gt; (Horde)!
---
Discord - [https://discord.gg/hTJ6SmZ](https://discord.gg/hTJ6SmZ)
---
Reddit - r/workingadultsguild
---
We  are a community of (soon-to-be) WoW Classic players that have real life  obligations but would like to play end-game content in a more relaxed  but structured fashion. Here is a brief overview of the requirements and  expectations of members.
---
First and foremost, have fun and be respectful.
---
We  prefer if you spec your class (after reaching 60) to help progress in  raids, but it's not a requirement. We may request it during very  challenging first time encounters (Like Nefarian or certain AQ  bosses)... but let's be real, that's like 1-2 years from now so we'll  cross that bridge when it comes. Play the game the way you enjoy it, but  be mindful of the raid... because we don't need 8 Boomkin every week,  someone has to heal... I'm looking at you too enhancement shaman.
---
Help out the guild, and the guild will help you out. The further we progress, the better the gear we ALL get.
---
**Leveling:**
---
I  anticipate we will all be leveling at different speeds based on  experience, class, and let's face it, TIME. Take the time you need and  don't feel forced to reach 60 to help raid. A handful of members will  probably rush quickly and reach 60 in a month, others may take several  more months.
---
Even though we all are  pressured for time and the grind to 60 drives you to just keep pushing, I  encourage each member to help a lower level player with a quest or  instance once per week. This isn't a requirement at all, just a nice  practice I think would make the guild stronger, more connected, and  progress more quickly.
---
**PvP:**
---
PvP  is not required as part of the guild, but we are open to planning  and/or scheduling cooperative group PvP or pre-made BGs when they are  released. There is great gear and rep rewards from PvP and we understand  that this is a big motivator for some members. PvP is encouraged and  supported, but not participating will not affect your guild/raid status.
---
**Raids:**
---
Raids will be held ***twice per week and capped at 4 hours*** per raid. We're still up for debate on raid days and times, but are planning for either Mon-Wed or Tue-Thurs from 6pm-10pm PST.
---
There is also a possibility of an ***occasional*** weekend raid to help progress on new content. These raids will be scheduled ahead of time and will not be mandatory (*Example:* Clearing the first few bosses of MC on a weekend to allow the guild more time during the week to do BWL).
---
Loot will be decided based on two factors: DKP; and in some rare cases, loot council.
---
***Loot Council will ONLY take place on guild first item drops***. This is to make sure that priority gear goes to the main tanks, main healers, and top dps to hasten progression. *Note:*  The council is also likely to award some guild first drops to committed  but under-geared players to help improve overall guild progression.
---
If  loot is awarded by loot council, somewhere between -20 to -250 DKP will  be deducted from the player who receives the piece, depending on  quality and rarity of the item. This can cause the player to enter  negative DKP).
---
In all other cases (99% of the time), ***loot will be bid on using earned DKP***.
---
Minimum bid must be twice the DKP awarded from the boss (see chart below). *Example:*  Bid for drops off Ragnaros start at 10 DKP, since 5 DKP will be earned  from the fight. There is no bid maximum. Unwanted items can be  disenchanted or awarded to new players for the minimum DKP value (note:  this can cause some new players to enter negative DKP).
---
NA player looking for semiHC raiding guild that has earlier raid times. Possibly ending raids at 10pm EST if not afternoon raids. I work early mornings so prefer afternoon but can go to that 10pm EST latest as I'm in PST zone. Can fill roles / faction and server dont matter much just want to have a raid lined up at launch instead of being forced to pug.  Preferably looking to play warlock, paladin, priest or shaman. Have some vanilla exp, most raiding exp. Came in TBC and Wotlk. 
---
Loch Modan too! My fav zone 
---
Hey bro, you dropped your mic.
---
So, you want queues.
---
Yeah i know lol
---
Personally though I really enjoy aoe farming/aoe grinding as a mage, and i dont really mind the one button rotation
---
&gt;Like it or not, SHARDING is not only preferable for launch but 100% NECESSARY, to ensure a healthy population AFTER the tourists leave, AVOID merges and deliver a FUCKING PLAYABLE GAME for launch !
---
It's also 100% necessary to ensure healthy marketing of the game.
---
Can you imagine the shitshow if Asmongold and other similar streamers logged in and got mega trolled for the entire launch?
---
It takes less than 5 people to utterly decimate the questing experience in the early zones and Sharding will help mitigate that.
---
Speculation. 
---
I can also speculate the opposite.
---
congrats, your server has been merged with Asmongold's. Have fun with his fans in /2
---
What quests ever took less that 5-10min in classic?  You must be talking about 5-10min in graveyard runs per quest. 
---
If I remember correctly, they have a page saying paladins have a healing aura. Which is why I rolled paladin. Only to find out that it had been removed from beta but not from the strategy guide. 
---
I'm personally really excited to play warlock. It's the only class I never took past level 25 or so. My reasoning is that I wont be able to play alts due to real life other than a rogue for fund world pvp (a gnome named Bilbostabbinz dont any of you fuckers take my name)
---
&gt; this isn't a 1v1 topic
---
Are you blind?
---
&gt; have chance **in a 1v1** (no matter the cooldowns i currently have and whatnot)
---
**&lt;Sanguine Hibiscus&gt; NA - Alliance - PvP**
---
Sanguine Hibiscus is a casual raiding guild organized by vanilla veterans with an emphasis on community and cooperation. For us, WoW is a platform for shared experiences and a shared sense of mastery. If you're someone who wants to experience Classic and have fun while doing it, we're the guild for you.
---
**How we play:**
---
While leveling, we will run dungeons, share group quests, and help each other get attunements. At 60, we will establish a raid and BG night each weekend (both optional). Our top priority as guild officers will be to groom and gear a consistent and comfy raiding team and make steady progress through the content. We want everyone to have fun! We don't want your time to feel like a chore.
---
**Raid loot and schedule:**
---
We are scheduling raids for Saturdays at 1:00pm EST currently and will probably add a raid time on Sunday afternoon when new content is released. This is subject to change. Although, we will likely keep the raid day to a weekend since many of us have significant others, families, and full time jobs. As far as loot distribution, we use a modified version of the "Suicide Kings" loot system with separate lists for tier gear, weapons, and other epic gear. For details, visit the “About the Guild” page on our website. 
---
Who should join:
---
We are recruiting all classes and all levels of experience. Are you completely new to Classic WoW or WoW in general? Cool! We are very open to teaching people this wonderful game. If you have friends or family who are playing, they are welcome to join. Our goal is to facilitate enjoyment in every aspect of the game.
---
Finally, whether or not you are interested in our guild, feel free to browse our Classic WoW reference spreadsheet (done by another officer of the guild), linked on our website. This guide includes pre-raid gearing lists, a world map, profession guides, raid comp, and more (constructive feedback is much appreciated).

Lol I’m not trying to argue I was just trying to make a suggestion, and “paying attention” is not a counter argument. It’s a game, people make mistakes, fixing a bad design choice that caused problems is apparently not a good idea in your eyes 
---
&gt;1.Lag ;
---
Don't cheap out on super small server infrastructure entirely dependent on needing to scale up additional virtual servers when there are more than 6 people on a continent.
---
&gt;2.Queues ;
---
If the queue is long enough in the first week, it may be a good sign to pick a new server, as most people won't even be past level 10.
---
&gt;3.Playability (completing a quest in 5-10 min, and not 2-3 hours) ;
---
There are alternative ways to level, and getting to 60 isn't the destination, unless you are min-maxing to get world first for some reason. And if there are 4 other people camping a quest objective, try grouping with them instead of fighting over the resource?  At most, there will be about (assuming vanilla server caps of 2.5k congruent) ~600 people online in the starting zone.  Find a social solution in game rather than implementing game breaking mechanics.
---
&gt;4.Healthy realm population post launch ;
---
People will be constantly coming and going.  Server merges for the most dead servers will be a solution down the road, same with player server migration services for exceptional situations.  I highly doubt that 85%+ of the server will just quit.  World of War**Crack** was given that name for a reason.
---
&gt;5.Server stability during launch ;
---
In Classic's defense, has Blizzard EVER had a stable server release? If your expectations are for it to be smooth with or without sharding you're only fooling yourself.  No matter way day 1 will be a cluster F.
---
&gt;6.Preserving a post-launch community .
---
See point 1.
---
Luckily spriest PVP gear (Especiallly r12-r13 set) is the best stat-wise designed PVP set of all classes, but I don't think that I need to elaborate about required effort.
---
Just like any spec falling into some part of the meme spectrum you have to work hard and be somewhat lucky to achieve your goals. Otherwise your progression ceiling will be last slot fills in MC pug and dungeons. It's not like you should not play the spec you like, it is about having realistic expectations and goals, all classes can shine in vanilla, but not specs.
---
These are really good!  The colors are really effective at presenting the tone of the environment.  Great job, keep it up!

I would live in Teldrassil....and then in my later years burn to death apparently.
---
i want to print those and make papercuts with them under my foreskin
---
Just wondering how is this attitude any different from today's game state?  
---
Yeah I don't have any points in resto atm and haven't really read any solid guides about this encounter, nor am I that knowledged about hunter mechanics. So it's likely my lack of skill. But I've read from others as well that spriest and lock really counter druids due to their heavy use of CC and dots and high survivability.
---
I don’t think anyone wants to impede on others play style. Hc players group together and casual players should group together. If someone isn’t like minded than you shouldn’t be putting yourself into a situation where you are in the same raid or group 
---
On a the two most recent vanilla pservers, mage aoe groups were able to abuse dynamic spawning by populating single areas forcing dynamic respawns to happen -- and were able to level to 60 in under 2 days play time by aoe farming instantly respawning mobs.
---
Dynamic spawns are a bandaid to fix a bigger issue that causes massive side effects.  That bigger issue is there are far more players than the game world was designed to ever have.
---
Me and my friend have been playing together for about a week now. I only played the demo, and he's literally never played wow before. Right now we're level 28/9, and we've never had more fun
---
We're so in love with this game from 2004. Vanilla wow is definitely not nostalgia, this game is tineless.
---
Locks and preists were strong against druids because of the dots and fear.  Fear was the one reliable form of CC against druids and druids having no active purge /  interrupt meant it was a dps race you were bound to lose, or get slapped with a silence when you did try to heal.
---
&gt; That's classic, there was no sharding there were a ton of people to contest
---
Vanilla had 100,000 players at peak on launch day across something like 90 servers. Or about 1,000 players per server at midafternoon / evening time. I doubt there were more than 30-40 players in tutorial zones at any given time throughout the day.
---
So what are the options for Classic which will **easily** get 10x the launch peak... 300-400 players running around Northshire Abbey (NOT like vanilla at all) or 900 servers that'll eventually die?
---
Yeah! I'm gonna RP. 
---
My character is ptsdJoe the Rogue with the motto "If it's red, it dead".
---
Arcane is the most balanced tree and good for mana conservation. Fire is super fun, lots of crit but you drink non-stop. Frost is all survival and fun kiting and still my favorite build. 10/0/41 is my favorite build personally.
---
They also drop elemental earth/fire/water too, which is always needed for enchanters
---
I’ve been in this guild for around 3 weeks now. If you’re uncertain, throw out an application and give it a shot. These people are honest and dedicated to create a guild where every single member feels welcome and appreciated. You won’t regret it! 
---
If you make your trade on melting faces, you will make it. 
---
Reminder: nobody has any obligation to include you in their group content if you choose to play in a vastly sub-optimal way.
---
I'm so damn excited to show my Wife pre-Cata Loch Modan. Dwarf Hunter was the very first character I ever made and moving from Dun Morogh, passing the massive Dwarven statues, and looking over the Loch was the first "damn this is beautiful" moment I had in the game.
---
I would frame the fuck out of every single one of these.
---
still have playes avoid boring fire? for you comment you play dk,monk or dh ahaha , youre alredy lost this fight since blizzard annunce classic ,soo just shut up ..
---
Preaching to the choir mate.
---
But yeah, homecoming :)
---
Since you won't really need gnomish death ray as you already have plenty of ranged "nukes", I'd say goblin for the rocket boots, goblin rocket helmet if you anticipate a long Xv1, and goblin sappers for that aoe stacking nuke.
---
warrior/rouge I'd suggest gnomish just for the death ray, even druids in bear form since its believed to be scaled off your base health.
---
Azshara, beautiful autumn leaves all year round!
---
Goblin for pve. The sapper charges themselves will pay for it.
---
Mate you can do it yourself, just download the repack, unzip and launch. It's what all the hardcore private server guilds do to practice AQ/Naxx before they are released. 
---
Classic going to be great. Alot of older players coming back. No need to rush. Making new friends in guilds or getting to grips with old friends from the past. 40 man raids eventually, up most of the night, less sleep. Farming, crafting dungeons, PVP and generally having a good time. Six pack of beer and energy drinks on standby lol.
---
I'm approaching these questions from the position of having played during the initial Nostalrius launch which had thousands of players on a single server with no form of dynamic spawning, sharding, etc.
---
If Nostalrius was able to handle it, I'm sure Blizzard will have no problem with their infrastructure and more modern networking. Lag only became an issue after launch on Nostalrius, when 10,000+ players were connected simultaneously. I doubt Blizzard will have server caps that high, and if they do then they're more technologically able to support that amount of players.
---
This doesn't have anything to do with sharding. This is a result of server caps and # of servers Blizzard will make available.
---
This is the main reason to implement sharding. And the truth is, things aren't that bad. Yes initially on Nostalrius there were no boars to kill in the Valley of Trials. So I took a break for about 2-3 hours. When I came back, things were still quite packed but I was able to make progress. It is not a doomsday situation like a lot of people think. You may have to slightly alter your normal quest route. Quests that allow you to group with people to complete become much easier, and quests that force players to compete with each other become more difficult. Nostalrius was my first time playing classic WoW and I was able to reach level 60 in about 8 days, even without sharding or dynamic spawns. Things clear up fast.
---
I'm not sure what this has to do with sharding.
---
I answered this in the lag section.
---
TL;DR Nostalrius already proved that sharding and dynamic spawns aren't at all necessary.
---
According to half the people ITT that's the epitome of fun! Not having half your raid be ret paladins is ELITISM
---
Instant 60 yeah, but if you want to know how the class feels during different phases of the leveling. 
---
Play nicely, kids
---
Note to self. Stand beside ship selling tickets.
---
Holy shit these are amazing. Would definitely put these on my wall!
---
&gt;It may not be your case, but hardcore pservers players love to tell people what they have to do.
---
Now, is this "you *have* to play this way" or "you won't be able to progress past BWL playing the way you're choosing to"?
---
One is elitism, one is good advice.
---
and chad is one of them.
---
-8 downvotes? lol lots of chads in here :D
---
Well, I hope you're right.
---
That boss is seriously the most annoying and frustrating boss in WoW history. 
---
Well most people probably want to play the game to have fun in a social setting, not get the live sucked out of them with checklists they have to complete every week.
---
Some level of "checklisting" is always good sure, like enchanting your gear for example but you shouldn't have to spend 4 hours preparing for a 2 hour raid.
---
Yeah and that hasn't changed at all unfortunately. 
---
Aren’t the orc and troll starting zone/quests the same!?
---
15 back in 04' back on launch day. Rocking my first PC that I had bought with my moneyz. 3.0Ghz Pentium 4 / 512 MB DDR RAM / 128MB GeForce Go FX 5200. Sadly, it was a lemon. HP's first "desktop replacement"... it would overheat every 3 months to the point the GPU would melt. Ended up playing mostly only dad's desktop 2.4 Pentium 4 / 512MB DDR/ and I popped in a 128MB Radeon 9200.
---
I was 30 when i played vanilla. Abit older now but x10 more wiser lol
---
I've never played any of "those" servers, I've never trusted them. so basically I haven't experienced Vanilla in over 12 years. So this Classic server will be pretty fresh for me. I mean when I started way back then.  I was a middle school student who was always busy with homework and sports, and had never played an online game before and had no idea what I was doing anyway. 
---
Raiding and PvP are great but they aren't the only things to do in Classic. I plan on making a character of each class and on both factions. I plan on doing a bunch of dungeon runs and gold, some PvP, and some profession and reputation grinding. Aside from that, I just cannot wait to explore Azeroth again and do all the quests I never did when Vanilla was new. 
---
What do you mean?!?!?!?!? Ironfoe and MC are vanilla dooood!!!!!!!
---
Very true, I remember tarred mill for hours on PvE.
---
&gt;The batching always confuses me a bit, it really seems like processing everything in larger intervals would lead to more lagspikes than doing everything "in real time".
---
It's only the server side calculations that are delayed, the abilities used are sent to the clients immediately. Processing the data in batches saves CPU time and bandwidth as there's less data to process overall. (Imagine for example calculating the total damage done to a player, you'd have to calculate all incoming damage, absorbs, etc done within the last 20ms to that unit, send it out to every nearby client, then repeat the process every ~20ms for new damage done. With batching you only do this calculation once every ~400ms.)
---
&gt;The position data was mentioned when they talked about how complex boss encounters ala WoD+ were not possible with the old system and they updated it at some point (jumping over beams etc.).
---
Ah that's right actually, forgot about that. Jumping actually never updated your position until you landed, so you had to walk out of AoE instead of jumping or you'd still get hit. Glad they changed that as I spam space all the time :P
---
Yeah but swifty is an idiot and is clueless, even back then.

At the tail-end (post AQ) of Vanilla, the toughest thing for most guilds wasn't just downing the bosses, it was finding dedicated players who would show up to raids with a willingness to learn the encounters and grind up raid consumes. And you couldn't just recruit someone straight out of Scholomance... or even MC for that matter. So downing the bosses became even more difficult, or nigh impossible with low geared or less people.
---
I remember a few times on our AQ40 raid there were 5-10 people too few, but on our BWL/MC farm night there was always like 45-50 people online... a couple times the raid leader got upset since we were having a tough time progressing. One time instead of doing MC/BWL, once everyone logged on and was in the raid group - we took our full-to-bursting farm raid group and went down to AQ40 instead. At least one person instantly logged out.
---
But all that said, having geared folks isn't a single perfect ingredient for the soup, we had many geared-out folks apply but were turned away since but they had furnished themselves with such a rotten reputation that we could smell their odor a mile away. A few would apply as if it was a given they would be accepted, because of their gear, but it wasn't even a decision because they had long cast themselves as a pariah. Some would be invited without even applying because we could tell they were good players and would be sticking around.
---
ENJOY THE HORSE SIZED SPIDERS
---
Yes, another option would be no sharding.
---
Amazing work mate, you truly are talented!
---
&gt;Really it comes down to patience. 
---
And it's a hell of a lot easier to be patient when you're not actually trying and don't actually care.
---
This post and a lot of the other "anti-min-max" posts just reek of entitlement. Maybe it isn't other people's job in life to carry you through content so that you can "play how you like".
---
Never played warlock, might give it a try but priest has always been my favorite idk why
---
Its very easy, just /dance and press 1,2,3,5
---
Probably true, I don't remember most of the stats. I **do** remember that literally every piece of gear had Spirit on it for a long time. And how horribly optimized most stats were.
---
The point, which obviously went over your head, is that a lot of people dont give a shit about raiding at all..... Theres an entire RPG to play but elitists fool new players into thinking raiding is the only meaningful content in this game all the time. It happens in every expac and has only gotten worse. But if youd rather have a raid of 38 people instead of accept a ret pally or two for MC then lol
---
They look so good, thank you for sharing!
---
As a fellow feral from vanilla, a well played hunter was really hard to deal with.  Scare beast is the reason, if the hunter knows to use that against a druid in forms, you're forced to either eat a fear or shift out to break the cast, at which point they viper sting and scatter shot to get a couple ticks off.  You can try rolling abolish but as a feral your mana is not unlimited, and shifting in and out to break slows/avoid scare beast you have to be careful.
---
&gt;A lot of guilds are going to be relaxed atmospheres
---
and a lot of guilds won't get past BWL and disband because of it. Enjoy your casual leveling guild, buddy. I'm sure it'll be super fun two years after release.
---
Depends on what kind of crowd you are playing with.
---
Average player - yes, of course you can play a shadow priest. They're perfectly fine.
---
Average raider - shadow priests can hold their own in raids, but you'll need to play more attention to gear and spec because you're walking uphill more than other classes
---
Average min-maxer - of course not and you should be ashamed for asking. If you have a heal spell, then you will be healing. End of story.
---
t. never stepped into AQ
---
Sapper charges don't require goblin.
---
No Omen of Clarity for me. I've tried it, only managed to proc it once like in 10 minutes, felt like a waste. Could be my unluck or the pserver I'm playing on.
---
Instead I went full feral with some furor on resto tree. This means I've grabbed both armor and threat talents as well as the cat dps ones (for better solo dps). Which means I'm pretty good in 5-man and 1-man PVE, not so much in PvP (but thats okay until I get to 60 and reasonably geared up)
---
The first 5 minutes of the video got me sort of pissy, thinking 'yeah whatever, back on MY mage in vanilla, I already had it figured out'. I used to be in a pretty progressive raidguild called 'Original' back then, we cleared C'thun and most of Naxx. 
---
Then it dawned on me. I used to play using WASD for movement with my right hand on the NUMPAD where I had all my spells bound. I pvp'd like this too... It wasn't before Thaddius and Heigan in Naxx I started using the mouse to control movement. Jesus..
---
You do this in every thread. Act like because someone says one thing, they have implied/said all this other shit.  Noone is going to take you seriously because your arguments are so ridiculous. 
---
would min maxers not even consider the strength of sp in pvp?
---
True.
---
&gt;Just relax and have fun.
---
yea man, wiping 400 times in BWL because you have 10 ret paladins is wicked cool fun dude :)
---
I remember stance dancing through TBC. I never tanked raids in vanilla, but what really helped me was making different macros for the different stances I had to use. Just don't forget to sunder. :D
---
COW. POO.
---
Don’t forget shamans.
---
ENJOY THE TSUNAMI
---
That's all good man, raiding isn't for everybody.

I think there is a discord channel too but dont know the name.

---
Are you fucking serious? 
---
The content in question is EXPLICITLY DESIGNED for just starting players. 
---
How the hell is that even remotely comparable to end-game content like raiding? 
---
If by most classes you mean one class (warriors) then yes.
---
IMAGINE THE SMELL
---
Yeah... skipping content that's developed to be played is still a piss poor solution. 
---
This by chance wouldn't be the exploit of glitching through the floor in Skeram's area to end up right at C'thun would it?
---
I picked the game up somewhat seriously (even tho after some raiding I picked up RP instead) in MoP. Never played on a private server for more than 17 minutes.
---
I am very hyped for Classic (along with WC3R, long live that game), but my main problem is that I want to play a ench shaman, which I have been told is a no go when raiding even casually by my friends..eh, I shall find a way, it's not like I want to join a sweatcore guild anyways.
---
MadSeason is the best!
---
Worldwide types of things won’t matter, but if you think each server won’t have infamous top guilds you are wrong. If anything classic is more fame hungry it’s just more server specific. 
---
Shaman's arent so bad, they don't have that much mobility so at worst case scenario I can just run away. Their sock slow can be dispelled by changing form. It is more like a stalemate for me, kinda like druid vs druid.
---
These are absolutely stunning! They remind me of MTG Special Edition Lands, so much depth and detail. Great work. 
---
OR you know you can find solutions that actually make the content reasonably playable. 
---
And what about people who like to immerse themselves in the story? Many of the starting zone quests lay the foundation of the story arc for the first zone, like the Burning Blade.
---
Then take the boat. You ask for guides, well any guide will make you go cross continents, not sure why that is a problem. The boat takes like one minute.
---
100%!!!  
---
His peaceful and friendly tone puts him into the Mr. Rogers/Bob Ross category.  
---
Between the hot purge, ranged interrupt, grounding totem and ghost wolf they’ve given me trouble in the open world. I’m more of a PvE player so I could just be bad, but it seems like they have a very anti-Druid kit.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/engineering-spells/goblin-engineer to use them, no, to make them, yes.
---
So do you want to start at 1.1 talents? Should we put all the bugs back in too and fix them slowly each patch? Will that be "no changes" enough for you?   
---
Just because someone likes 1.12 talents or cross realm BGs doesn't mean they want Naxx in at server launch. If you can't see the difference, you are indeed a moron.
---
Low level, Shadow Priests don't feel very special. After level 40 you becomes significantly stronger. I always enjoy having one in my groups / raids and they were one of the best PVP classes in vanilla. 
---
&gt;The point, which obviously went over your head, is that a lot of people dont give a shit about raiding at all
---
Then yea, man. If you don't care about raiding then of course you can spend 400 hours roleplaying as a level 16 survival hunter in westfall.
---
&gt; But if youd rather have a raid of 38 people instead of accept a ret pally or two for MC then lol 
---
Trust me, they'll all have gone holy by then, or they'll be stuck in guilds that can't get past Ony.
---
Totems arent so bad, just have rank1 moonfire and tab-target it. He wasted a GCD, you waste it, except you lose less mana. But yeah, they can be difficult, but not as much as locks and priests imo.
---
Thanks for the tip!
---
Black lung central
---
Hardcore guilds will require you to do specific things, with consumables, reps, maybe even professions to min/max.
---
Also, with vanilla raiding, you're NEVER done raiding MC, even when progressing in NAXX, as there are alt runs and binding runs for off tanks and rogues. Your best bet to minimize play time requirements would be to join a "family" guild that will progress, but not super competitively, so you can choose to or not to bring tons of consumes
---
They actually announce stuff at gamescom aswell.
---
I remember SC2 LotV cinematic release Trailer with date and I think WoW Legion was announced at gamescom aswell.
---
Other than that, I dont remember anything big getting revelead at another Event.
---
In General though, the big Events where companies announce/reveal stuff is usually gamescom, PAX east, E3, Twitchcon and ... dunno I miss something big here, not sure what though
---
I just remembreed that my entire guild rp-hated Trolls. We called them the Beast Race. One time a new recuit asked for a summons when we were inside a raid and the Warlock Raid Lead laughed at them and told them to walk to the raid because even the Twisting Nether doesn't want to help such a poor and twisted beast race move across Azeroth. Sometimes my Mage would get a message from someone for a portal and I'd meet them and claim my portals didn't work for beast races, or would charge double for the 'trouble'.. yeah.. 
---
Pretty good yeah. One thing that is kinda interesting about vanilla is that you really have to play a class for 60 levels and beyond to understand it. I play a ton of warlock and paladin and I've yet to see any video that accurately describe the experience of playing those classes. So for me, Kargoz, Tips, Show even Preach seem like blundering buffoons knowing nothing about the classes they talk about. 
---
"You have to farm tons of soulshards."
---
No, you don't have to do that. While nobody mentions that warlocks have huge threat problems in raids, especially on Horde side. 
---
Can vouch for this. Hunter falls off very fast and hard with end game content. In that respect a Warlock is superior. 
---
It's completely irrelevant what it takes to make them, the important thing is that you can use them and still be able to use the gnomish requiring stuff.
---
Basically. Know when a fear will come (telegraphed mostly wirh groundshaking), switch to zerker stance, press zerker rage, switch back. It’s pretty easy once you get the hang of it. 
---
Good thought, they also have WC3:R in stock for later this year, wouldnt prolly be so wise to release both Close to each other.
---
If you can’t play it casually you’re going to end up sacrificing some of the things you do currently. I don’t see a way around it. 
---
It was still a wonderful read, who cares if it was an exploit by definition. It is good content.
---
Stop trying to start a pity party with your end game op class. Everyone has to worry at least a little with more than one mob except hunters and locks.
---
No the important thing is you can make a load of money off of them while people are leveling their engineering twice or buying gnomish equipment that isn't bop. Sapper charges get a lot of use early.
---
When you limit your point to fame being server-specific, you admit self-defeat.
---
Let me tell you about this really popular man in a village somewhere in Africa. He famous af brah.
---
A someone who hasn't played since WoD (came back with a gifted sub and was mostly unimpressed) I had no intention of ever resubbing until Classic was announced I know plenty of people who feel the same way. Day 1 launch is going to be packed - the nostalgia players will try it for a bit and probably get burnt out, the try-hards and private server players will stay and the population will normalize with time. Sharding for launch seems fine with me as long as its contained to launch and early game areas. 
---
Level gnomish, make all the unique things, drop engineering and go goblin to make all the bombs and sappers. You can still use the gnomish trinkets, since they're BoP but you already have them, they just require engineering.
---
Anybody against sharding, primarily for the first few weeks and in pre-30 zones, is a complete fucking idiot. The idea that not having to spend 6 hours to complete a single quest is going to somehow "invalidate the classic experience" is full-blown, pants-on-head retarded.
---
If you play alliance you will hardly have to do it sins fearward will protect you from fear 
---
Nope, they both start in Durotar, but not that n Valley of Trials. 
---
The trolls start on the Darkspear island. 
---
Sucks when leveling, but fighting in Blackrock Mountain and at black lotus notes is great.
---
Hooray, someone showed up at the entrance of the cave I'm trying to quest in and now 12 mobs the same level as me have spawned directly on my face and I'm dead instantly
---
Or, level engineering once, get Gnomish and just buy the bombs you can't make.
---
There is also a big chance that unless they’re desperate, a priest will dip when they see a spriest after joining a 5-man dungeon group. None of the responsibility with all of the need roll on the healer’s hard-earned gear. 
---
If youre the MT, its basically that.
---
If you happen to be OT (no matter Overall or temporary for a Boss Phase), its usually wise to Switch weapons to double annihilator or nightfall and go offensive stance spamming harmstring.
---
If its just about the stance dancing for fear immunity, just bind Berserker stance into macro together with Berserker rage and then manually go back (I think it should actually be possible to put the defensive stance Switch into the macro aswell as it takes a GCD and couldnt be done at the first press)
---
That would be wasted tbh.
---
Stance dancing for Berserker rage (just speaking about bosses where its clear when fear is coming) isnt hard at all and allowing the fearward on healers or other important members of the raid, is way more usefull.
---
Queues are much better than sharding, that's for damn sure. However, if sharding is going to be used then it should put you into a shard from your own server, not how it works on retail where you're sharded with different servers. And while you're sharded within your own server, then you can still talk to EVERYONE on your server through chat. And of course, this sharding doesn't need to be in game past the first week in the starting zones.
---
[Yeah man it's gonna be a rager](https://youtu.be/0EWbonj7f18)
---
my pvt server semi hardcore raid guild is looking for a shadow priest.
---
I used to think joining a group was permanent when I first started playing. I thought people were crazy to make such a commitment when they invited me to a group before lvl 20. Took me till deadmines to learn the truth.
---
Can we get an F in the chat for swirly ball
---
In general, rare items (green quality or better) vendor for more than the raw mats. White quality items vendor for exactly the same as the raw leather + the cost of the additional items (fine thread, etc). 
---
Green &amp; blue items below 205 skill usually have mats that are hard enough to find that make them impractical to craft in large quantities. You're mostly making the white items up to that point. 205 skill is when you get Nightscape Headband, a green item that only costs leather + thread. That one vendors for quite a bit more than the raw leather.
---
Can you pm me the server and the faction? 
---
&gt; Hopefully they're interested enough about Classic to make their own guild and give a shot at some raiding
---
Why?  There's no possible way to innovate or bring anything new to the table - the game has been mapped out almost entirely.
---
They would be behind private server guilds in terms of experience and knowledge.
---
I agree.  It’s hard to min/max vanilla.  And Vanilla is hard in general.  I can’t wait.
---
Quit lifting irl, start lifting in game.
---
Probably the best advice you can give. Find a guild of good people who are happy to have you around regardless of your schedule. They do exist!
---
when cataclysm hit, my guild hung out in gallywix’s pool for a while 
---
There are really 3 options to early population control:
---
1. Extra realms: they could create about 10x the expected long term realms to handle the extra load, but that brings up the "ghost town syndrome" that leads to a debate of merging or closing realms to even out population.
---
2. Suck it up and deal with overpopulation: some people want this, but blizzard is very likely not to go this way because people will try it, say it's stupid and quit, even though they might actually love classic
---
3. Sharding early zones: virtually identical to option 1,  but without the merging debate.
---
Thousands of us are going to be in the same situation, and we will make/find guilds for our level of work/play balance. There's a good chunk of time between now and when you're actually going to hit level 60, so there is PLENTY of time to figure things out. Just remember that you're playing this game for fun, and you're gonna be fine!
---
&gt;4.Healthy realm population post launch
---
This is the one everybody ignores, which is annoying because it's the main reason sharding is being considered and nobody seems to understand that. Lag, ques and overcrowding are very very minor issues compared to the massive drop in players shortly after launch as a result of the tourists leaving.
---
How many times do you see arguments like "just use ques" or "tolerate the lag and overcrowding" neither of which do anything to prevent long term underpopulation resulting from the inevitable mass exodus of tourists.
---
How often do you see people bringing up the possibility of sharding during the AQ event or large scale world pvp battles, neither of which are comparable situations to launch since they both occur after realm populations have settled into equilibrium and don't necessitate overcapping server population to absorb the subsequent player drop.
---
All of these counter arguments betray the fact that the people arguing against sharding don't even understand the problem that blizzard are trying to solve. I'm by no means pro-sharding, but I do think it's important that the anti-sharding crowd actually understand the problem that sharding is intended to fix so that they can actually offer effective alternatives.
---
even in early 2000s i was never clicking any spells and always had binds, like what..
---
Will there be dedicated RP servers for classic? Cause if so I'd love to try!
---
Alliance Warlock doesn’t have go against Paladins, so it’s better in BGs, but worse in world. Also, you can just coil on the WotF and still stomp. The whole Alliance Warlock is so much worse than UD/Orc thing is a meme.

Org surprisingly getting very little love in the comments!  City design was good, but the amount of people always hanging around just felt like home

Back in the day a friend of mine used to lift during loading screens and flight times. His biceps were massive.
---
All in all though, it's possible to have a blast on this game even if you're not shooting for the 1% elite. You can still out-skill players and kick ass competitively to an extent. And personally, *don gravelly hippie voice* the journey is the destination, man 
---
How can someone saying they intend to join a nice casual guild that respects their out of game commitments trigger you so much?!
---
Found the toxic kind of person OP is talking about I guess
---
So basically from what I am reading you only have to do it as a tank when a fear is coming. That’s not that difficult. Thanks for the help. I may tank after all! 
---
I disagree entirely. 
---
AV was the one mechanism in the game for guaranteed, long-lasting PvP mayhem. It was a blast. A lot of people loved it, hence the "glorification".
---
If you want to maximize honor per hour just go hit up WSG, or AB on the bonus weekends. Not everything needs to be streamlined for maximum efficiency.
---
Priest is really fun, I love leveling up as Shadow where your healing in dungeons is mostly healing with VE and Renew while Wanding and still dealing a pretty substantial amount of the overall damage. I remember one RFK where I was 2nd on dmg and the sole healer.
---
They're one of the most fleshed-out and well-needed classes in Vanilla. Not only are they the only healing class with a "hard CC" of Shackle which is super handy in all the Undead dungeons, they also have a mini-emergeny Shield while also having a HoT and an AoE Fear. And you tend to take Fortitude for granted until you join a group with no Priest, and realize how much it can help in those dire moments. Paladin are no slouch, but I have only made one Paladin over the years (to 56), while I've made numerous Priests. Something about the 5sr is real satisfying as a mini-game, and there is an oddly gratifying feeling about winding up a huge Gheal kissed by a Renew on the tank. Oh and Benediction.
---
Back then some specs were considered to be lower than others, but after years of theory it has been proven that they have a role in a raid group to support other classes. Eg, shadow priests boost the dps of locks, enha shamans boost the dps of rogues and warriors  etc. 
---
I do not really want to compare vanilla with retail, because retail has moved very far away from its roots. Nowadays, with classes homogenization, all dps classes look the same,  all tanks look the same etc. Back then, each class and each spec had something different to offer

# The Argent Vanguard

**DnD style, Argent Dawn-themed Roleplay**

* **Region:** EU

* **Faction:** Alliance
---
* **Play Times:** Varied.

# Introduction; In-Universe
---
The   Vanguard, commonly known as the ‘Argent Spear’ was originally  created   in order to allow the Dawn to strike at foes in the farthest  corners  of  the plaguelands of Lordaeron.
---
Over  the  years as they gradually discovered the agents of both the  Burning   Legion and the Scourge have spread to the civilized regions of  the   world, the Dawn started deploying them as an expeditionary force.
---
Nowadays they are known to operate all across Azeroth. Anywhere evil rears its ugly head, they will be there to meet it.
---
# Introduction; Out of Character
---
The   Argent Vanguard aims to be the premier roleplaying destination  for  all  your Argent Dawn themed roleplaying needs on Classic WoW.
---
We will offer:
---
* Weekly events &amp; multi-part campaigns.
---
* A commendation system for tracking player achievements.
---
* A defined path of progression, with multiple platoons &amp; roles to fill.
---
* Our own, home-brew RPG system for events.
---
* Discord server.
---
Our   Roleplay will be grounded in canonical lore, with our events  taking   place during the Vanilla timeline. This does not mean however  that   concepts expanded upon and introduced in later expansions can’t be    introduced into our stories, within reason.
---
We   wish to emphasize persistence through our Roleplay, so we will  often   spend long periods of time away from major Roleplaying hubs, even    outside of guilds events.
---
We also wish to manage &amp; maintain a PvE &amp; PvP wing of the guild to fully exploit the content offered by the game.
---
With the Vanguard there will be no downtime, always having something to do.
---
People are unable to separate the idea of min-maxing from sweaty no-life 80+ hours/week playing.
---
You can play 30 minutes per day and still min-max.  You can read quest text and enjoy the leveling experience while still min-maxing.  You can RP a character while still mechanically min-maxing.
---
What it boils down to is this -- there are certain talent points and pieces of gear that are objectively better than other choices.  Some players choose to skip those because they find something else a lot cooler and more flavorful.  Other players choose not to, because they are objectively mechanically better at the game.  But just because someone chooses the latter doesn't mean they are necessarily going to rush to the endgame and turn it into Spreadsheet Cruncher Deluxe.  I'm capable of both picking a mechanically optimized talent spec and gear set while still going slow and enjoying the game and playing with friends.
---
The hate for min-maxers is conflated with people who suck the joy out of the game by turning it into a job.  Min-maxing in a vacuum is fine, but as soon as it becomes the sort of min-maxer who doesn't consider leveling "the real game" and ridicules others for not knowing their Pre-Raid BiS by heart, they start to draw the hate.
---
That's okay When I first started playing classic wow my first class was a hunter. It took me till level 18 to figure out you could use your pet to tank mobs. Boy let me tell you I felt like Prometheus stealing fire from the gods. I was so pleased with my new game breaking innovation on hunter game play. That I actually went to the forums to proclaim to the world just how powerful the hunter pet could be. I wish I could be that bad again lol.
---
I was 9 when I booted up vanilla the first time. I used to played WC3 with my dad until he was hospitalized. My mom bought classic for my brother and I after that to take our mind off his cancer. We would swing by the hospital and tell my dad all about our adventures, and he thought it was hilarious that my brother was a Night Elf and I was a Tauren when we were supposed to be on the same team. He eventually passed away and vanilla got me through those tough days. My brother and I work full time now, but I'm hoping I can convince him to get back on with me for old time sake. 
---
my man! for horde I like TB and UC the same
---
Hi, parties still exist in retail and the content is way harder and more rewarding.
---
I started playing about a year before MOP and I’m super excited to play classic WoW. I’ve tons about it from my bf and am looking forward to the challenge. 
---
Interesting I just watched video on YouTube about some of the differences between classic Wow and private servers. From what I’ve gathered some people are going to be in for a nasty shock. Personally I’m totally looking forward to it!! d^_^b
---
Human Protection Paladin.
---
im totally not going to make ironic posts about the future in character. "
---
Pff time travel? Never gonna happen, that would just be silly"
---
It's not hard at all. There is just lots of grinding in every aspect of the game. Raid and dungeon mechanics are super basic in vanilla. If they disabled all add-ons in raids, then the content would actually become challenging.
---
I often play a tank and form groups. If you are a priest and we don't have a healer yet, I will ask you to heal. I might still take you as DPS if we have an open slot for one, but I'll give you shit if we have trouble finding heals.
---
Damn, I got that inverted. I figured you'd change hair to pink as a tank to make you stand out more to the raid!
---
Yes! I’ve a friend who hasn’t played the game for years who’s dying to play it when it comes out. It will be like playing it for the first time. 
---
Your last paragraph is on point. Many people get berated for wanting to play “meme” specs and whatnot. Just let others play the game.
---
If y’all are referring to that Virgin and Chad meme, it was just funny
---
Good wands are most important until 40+
---
These are superb! as someone who loves all the Undead zones, these are *soooo* great.
---
Caer Darrow is my fave - would love to see one of The Sepulcher
---
I still remember my first selfmade 8 place bag.... I was so proud of myself. 😊 I guess this time Wow will be way more of a Zen thing than an MMO. Talking to people in my guild about life while killing 8 wolves, being happy when one of them drops my first shoulder pats. Going into a dungeon with people that stop at every corner to tell their old war stories, taking our time to laugh at mistakes and someone not fining the dungeon entrance after a wipe,  not rushing through, doing all overly strategic discussions about how to take the adds out first and the lore behind everything.
---
What time commitment? Classic doesn't require you to play the game a lot, play it at your own pace. Enjoy the leveling experience Classic unlike retail is not all about endgame. I would even argue that the leveling experience is more fulfilling than endgame.
---
If it's as true of an experience as the original. I haven't played classic since before bc and haven't played wow since wod. The main thing that gets me so excited is looking at how successful original RuneScape is after it's re-release. It's even more popular than it's modern counterpart and it warms my old man heart to no end. I don't have as much nostalgia for OSRS but it's as true to the original as ever. My only fear is finding enough time to enjoy myself and justify a $15 a month sub fee to play it.
---
if you care about endgame then 60, many classes play fundamentally different there
---
like drood/priest will heal in raids instead of feral/shadow, mage/locks will just spam bolts instead of aoe/cc/dots etc
---
if you want a glimpse at leveling then 20-25 should be enough, warrior changes a bit more with whirlwind and lv40 talent and shaman prolly too with windfury
---
You can say that again, but the sheep won't listen.
---
calling these oil paintings is a misleading title
---
Dude in vanilla I remember the first time I took the wrong path in redridge and ended up in duskwood. I started to explore as I was only lvl 12 or so and legit got scared running into the zone.  Saw skull level skeletons and JETTED IT.  Man I miss those moments.
---
While I agree with the general premise of your reply, your definition of minmaxing must be different than the general definition of it.
---
\&gt;  You can read quest text and enjoy the leveling experience while still min-maxing.
---
This is just not correct. Reading quest text is very inefficient. Not minmaxing.
---
I have come to terms with the fact I won’t be a hardcore raider. I have limited playtime as well and that’s why I plan on leveling a hunter. It requires the least amount of time commitment and will allow me to see most of the game. I know I won’t be top dps but it’s really the only way for me to be close to everyone else hitting 60 and starting to raid. 
---
Once I have a max level hunter I plan on farming gold and funneling it into an alt that I haven’t chosen yet. 
---
the guild who edited gamefiles to remove a wall there, which made that possible got perma bans afaik
---
There's this strange idea going around that pressing button a instead of button b is a lot more work and therefore people who press button a are no-life losers who turn the game into a job.
---
When I OT, I basically stay in seeker stance and keep battle shout up, and keep my rage at around 50. That way when someone pulls an add, I can intercept and switch to defensive stance on the way in and taunt it before anyone is killed. 
---
I think its to ensure players invest in their spec and learn to play it instead of just running whatever is most optimal. I wouldn't be opposed to having cheaper re-specs, and dual-spec is something a lot of players are probably gonna miss, but I also understand that vanilla had this mechanic as a consequence of re-specing. Tedious, but has its reasons. 
---
Some of those are pretty subjective, what you call homogenization I would call better balance, and screwing pve players was a welcome change after getting stomped by aq + geared players in my piddly rank 10 gear.
---
I don't think it would destroy the population for either considering you can find plenty of private servers for just about any expac right now. 
---
Also using the nostalgia argument is the same shit retail said about classic, I think it was a bad argument then and just as bad of one now.
---
Pretty much the same as My experience. I still dread that cowboy caravan pre dungeon thing. But the leveling, and core gameplay was very good! Just a shame with the horrible fps issues... 
---
Stance dancing is only 100% necessary for PvP. Only Horde tanks need to stance dance fear. 
---
The hate isn't usually for people who "personally" min-max, the hate is more directed towards those who demand that others minmax. And in a social coop scenario like dungeons and raiding, that shows up a lot, where some some minmaxers will lash out at other players for not using common, well-established builds, even if they're still pulling their weight in the group.
---
 **&lt;The** **Tail** **End&gt; \[A\] \[US\] \[PvE\]**
---
A guild for fun leveling, and then raiding when we hit 60. We'll work to get each other pre-raid BiS those final few levels and in the weeks before starting MC. Raids are the last two days before rest, thus the name. :) Discord is already up and waiting for Classic release. I raided through AQ40 in vanilla, and plan to clear Naxx at some point. Not a super-hardcore guild, but not totally casual either. Effort is expected, but without dedicating your life to WoW.
---
**Raid: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST**
---
pls PM me, or join Discord at [https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a](https://discord.gg/KC9Au5a)
---
Most people dont hate min-maxers.  What they hate is the way min-maxers speak about the game/other players.  So often its black or white, and even if youre not intentionally looking down on people that play more casually, the posts often come off that way.  
---
The other problem is that the 'top tier' of players have always had a bad reputation for being elitist jerks (the name was picked for a reason).  Its maybe not intentional, but reading through posts often feels to a newer/more casual player like youre talking down to them, and thats a really frustrating thing to deal with.  
---
I say all of this as a person that has played more seriously in the past, has done plenty of theorycrafting/simming on live, etc.  I think back to a lot of the comments my guild and i made towards casuals in the past and it makes me cringe.  Even the more 'innocent' things ("how can people struggle on this, literally just dont stand in the fire!") come across as being quite douchey now.
---
I can't find it but I remember this being a big deal back in the day.  Maybe you are making a joke/old school reference some are not getting.  I recall Blizzard stating it's when a mob is spawned.  This includes chests and lock-boxes. but that ultimately it didn't matter since player could never "scan" or determine there loot before hand.
---
I looked into it when i did 2k mob grind to get a black ooze pet back in vanilla.  They dropped from lock-boxes that oozes would drop in Felwood.  I remember it was a like a 1% drop rate inside a 12% drop rate.  I got it after over 2k oozes.  
---
I kinda just wanted to know if it was worth running up this hill to an ooze that might have spawned with it; or if it was just dice rolling every time and to just kill the most I could as fast as I could.  In the end, like blizzard said, it didn't really matter.
---
Battle stance for charge/thunderclap. Zerker for fear break.
---
yeah, a lot of that is going to change come classic. vanilla actually didn’t have a ton of world buffs and flasks and potions to stack. for example, turning in a head for the dragonslayer buff had a 2 hour cooldown, so unless you coordinated with the top guilds to start raid times at the same time, you were probably not going to have it. black lotus will be significantly rarer in classic as well, since it probably won’t have a high respawn rate like in p servers (should be 2 hours rather than a few minutes), reducing the stock of flasks to nearly nothing. 
---
so yeah, there won’t be a whole lot of worry about world buffs and flasks except for the tippy-top guilds. 
---
You can play the way you want in my raid, when you start paying my subscription.
---
&gt; The point, which obviously went over your head, is that a lot of people dont give a shit about raiding at all.....
---
Seeing all the posts asking if playing meme spec will get them into raids says otherwise
---
Agree as well. At 30 you have a pretty good grip of your character and if you don't like it then, you're not gonna like it later.
---
It would be "possible" however changes like these are massive, long term projects, and would require major code changes to many systems in the game. It comes down to more of a "Does it make sense economically to do this?" rather than "Is this possible to do?" And I don't think Blizz wants to funnel that much cash into Classic. 
---
I wonder why noone mentioned shadow priests yet, the king of 1v1 (besides warlock).
---
Going beyond your server is for people who want to stream or make videos, but on individual servers it’s good for everything from joining guilds to getting free enchants
---
Uh the world in BfA is not challenging. Only time you need to group is for world bosses, even the rare elites are easy to solo. 
---
stealing a buff from a trashmob in a dungeon to use it in a raid in vanilla wasnt considered an exploit but a clever use of mechanics, and was much later nerfed
---
stealing a buff from a source in the same raid in wotlk was considerd an exploit and punished
---
Honestly, between evasion, blind, vanish and sprint, you only die if you want to as a rogue.
---
Yea, imagine demanding others act like team players when they're teaming up with others, the audacity.
---
Yep, that's exactly what they did.
---
... I miss that quest Satyr in Darkshore that was eating my Warrior ass no matter what trick I used to beat him solo. 
---
I was only a normal raider in retail vanilla, but over the last couple years I helped to run a successful raiding guild on a vanilla pserver and one of the responsibilities I took on was organizing and tracking the loot system.  I also participated as a member of the loot council in a guild after that one.  Having participated in both systems I can say there are benefits and drawbacks to both, and I think this would remain true regardless of which variation you decide to go with.
---
The DKP system we that was implemented in the first guild was a variation of what's known as the shroud loot system (SLS).  Under this system items are grouped into categories and assigned a set point price.  There was also a priority list established with the intent to help influence items going both to people who deserved the items without totally ignoring overall benefit to the raid (Neltharion's Tear going to a shadowpriest over a mage or warlock, for example).  In essence I suppose it could even be called a soft council.  
---
Points were awarded for time spent in raid, and we allocated additional points for people being on time, and amount of consumable items used (up to a maximum amount).  We also had a system of awarding a maximum number of points per week as a result of any contributions to the guild bank.
---
When an item would drop, it would go through 3 phases: buy, bid, and offspec.  
---
* During buy phase a player can say buy to spend half their points to win the item outright, if multiple buys then highest total points wins.  
---
* During bid, all bidders would /roll, and winning bidder pays the set item price.  
---
* During OS, anyone can roll to win the item for a minimal point cost, high roll wins.
---
I can give more detail on it if anyone is actually interested, but basically it seemed to work pretty well (ret paladins, shadow priests, and hunters still kind of get shafted).  It did require a lot of effort to track everything and make sure the points were updated on a regular basis.
---
My experience with loot council was much shorter in duration, but it led me to the conclusion that in order for that system to really work properly, a point tracking system should probably be used in tandem with the decisions of the council.  At very least an item ledger should be kept so you don't have people relying mostly on memory of who got what when.
---
True! But what would be the difference of a server like ND and classic servers? ND supports a crapton of people and runs (relatively) smoothly.
---
Mages always seemed like the best designed class in Vanilla to me. 
---
&gt; even if they're still pulling their weight in the group.
---
Noone in their right mind will lash out at someone pulling their weight.
---
If I remember correctly, this is what they did.
---
You minmaxed the hell out if that sentence.
---
In BFA, a single player puts out more spell effects, AoE, and random-ass procs, then an entire raid did in vanilla.
---
Oh, and the game no longer runs at 2.5 tic.
---
The servers didn't get worse, the load placed on them increased ~20x.
---
Hey I am for sure interested. Im wondering what your attendance expectations are though. I am a grad student and my only concern is if I have an exam on a fri or mon I wouldn't be able to get past of the guilt of raiding the night before instead of studying. I would definitely be able to communicate days I wouldn't be able to show up ahead of time. As a side note I will be playing resto shaman.
---
&gt; This post and a lot of the other "anti-min-max" posts just reek of entitlement. Maybe it isn't other people's job in life to carry you through content so that you can "play how you like" and see all the content at the same time.
---
Then don’t join those guild. If you want to finish all the content in a few weeks or burn out trying then go for it. Just because you personally lack the patience and capacity to work with a mixed skill base doesn’t mean we all do.
---
There are plenty of us that completed progression content at a fast pace in it’s original iteration that are happy to take a more laid back approach. I don’t think it makes people entitled if they choose to share their experience to open doors for people rather than pursue their own goals over all else.
---
What is that supposed to mean?
---
Druids best days were probably TBC.  They had talents to make them defense capped, early by days resiliance worked in PvE so a druid tank had huge advantages.  Later in TBC they did the most dmg of tanks as well.  It also made boomkin, cat form a bit more viable.  Most of all resto was no longer a support healer who's main purpose was to buff, cast some heals and battle res people.  TBC was when resto druid was brought in line with what we know it as today.
---
Hard is a relative term I know, I should of said “harder than Live”. 
---
Level to 20. Duel other classes along the way. Make sure you do a VC run as the "final boss". Should give you a really good idea as to if you are going to enjoy playing that class by the time you reach your end game of killing VC.
---
Why waste time say lot word when few word do trick?
---
I think the solution to most of your comment is just finding clever ways to add class buffs. For instance tying high talents in the balance tree to more mana return, or reductions in mana cost for  offensive spells. The trade-off being choosing talents in resto vs balance. Or combine said talents with a reduction in healing done, limiting best of both worlds hybrid design. The answer to balancing is typically creativity and design, I'm sure there are more elegant solutions then mine.
---
As for globaling someone, this is not arena pvp. POM Pyro exists, many classes "can" global others with the right gear and combination of procs. Unless you want resilience this just is old pvp. You take the death, and realize the three-minute mage is now a free kill, the oomkin is wearing all cloth, that ret-pally just came all over his screen and passed out, whatever... go win the map objective. 
---
Skewed faction ratio should not be an problem, most new servers tend to be pretty evenly split. Locking new characters for a specific faction would fix any skew.
---
On a normal averaged sized realm, people will always be pvping. There might be lulls at 3am on a Wednesday forcing you to improvise. Go to a capitol, kill some duelers, stir some shit, create your own BG on that random night while waiting for a queue. Watch how intense that BG is when you see those other names that you’ve been griefing all night.
---
Premades, that’s the name of the game. Yea it sucks joining that wsg where you recognize those names and think to yourself ‘oh shit’ but that was part of the classic experience. It’s even more satisfying when your team of randoms pull through for the W. Wanting xrbgs to avoid losing to better, more organized players is a piss poor excuse.
---
And wsg is focused for premades, not your average player. Wins can be quick, or there can be gridlock games that last hours. From my experience AB was the go to BG with the shortest queues. 
---
Xrbgs tarnish server integrity. The instant gratification of playing with people you’ll never see again ruined the community. Sometimes will you simply not be able to PvP? Will there be times where you can’t raid? The piece of gear you want won’t drop? Will a shithead hunter continue to gank you while fishing in Feralas? Deal with it. 
---
If only more people were consistently in their right mind, half the world's problems would disappear overnight.
---
Forums bring bickering, and lately there's a lot more tribalism sentiment running amok in the world. Folks enjoy to virtue signal and defend imaginary tribal ideals against percieved villians who are not at the gates - they're not even pestering anyone.
---
&gt; he problem is that when the game starts to become more taxing, like you suggested, those computers reach their limits, and your only option really is to toss it in the trash and get a better one. (Which Blizz sort of did, they sold the servers to people at an auction as mementos.)
---
The other problem is that when something - anywhere in the world - went tits up, the entire fucking continent would crash.
---
&gt;Now, is this "you *have* to play this way" or "you won't be able to progress past BWL playing the way you're choosing to"?  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;One is elitism, one is good advice
---
Nope. The second one is also elitism. The reason is that there are several people on this sub that have experiences as clearing bosses even in Naxx with everything but optimal specs, and also close to no one using consumes. I myself went up to mid AQ40, We were 2 ret, there was a few ferals, at least 1 moonkin, 2H specced warrior(s). We stopped progressing because of TBC.
---
So again, no, saying things like "you won't be able to progress past BWL playing the way you're choosing to play" is no only a lie, but also pushes players to play something they didn't want to play initially.
---
So as everytime, my advice is : Do your stuff, play with people like you, but stop spreading those ways of thinking and try to moralize with stuff such as "you are being an ass to the rest of the raid by not playing optimal". Let players do what they want. Everyone can find a group of players that suits them.
---
The hardest in endgame PvE in Vanilla was to have 40 people available and with as few absent people as possible, and that did not do stupid things such as overaggro or explose with the bomb near other raid members.
---
I'm going to be that guy.
---
Mis-use
---
Glad someone agrees. Seems like the concept of other people enjoying min/maxing is incomprehensible.
---
As if people need to validate their casual playstyle with these constant "It's ok to be a casual", "DAE GOING TO READ QUEST TEXT???" and "I'm going to play a 17/17/17 hunter and tank Naxx, and if you think it's sub-optimal you are Hitler" threads.
---
I keep seeing posts and comments like "don't let other people tell you how to play the game!", while simultaneously saying "don't min/max, it's not fun!".
---
It doesn't bother me in the slightest how other people are going to play, so why does my playstyle bother them?
---
&gt; your definition of minmaxing must be different than the general definition of it.
---
The general definition of it, as far as I am aware, is optimizing your talent spec and equipment choices.  Rushing to the endgame is not necessarily an aspect of it, although the group of people who rush and the group of people who min-max very largely overlap.
---
warlock didnt changed too much as well, just tuned the numbers up
---
Yeah it’ll be cringe seeing people celebrating a realm first for vanilla content, on Nost when I was in the rag server first the screams were fucking cringe. The content is 15 years old, bosses do relatively nothing, and there’s 40 people there. People should just try to enjoy the social aspect of vanilla; that’s the peak of it. 
---
Not to mention the pvp is irrelevant in vanilla, they should add arena and give it tbc drs so there can be “some” competitiveness. Bgs have always been meaningless for a measure of mechanical skill. 
---
The problem is WOW isn't an individual game. Most of us don't want classic wow to be a culture of min maxing. We want to group with people and raid without being yelled at for not having bis gear and a raid optimized talent spec. 
---
Shamans never got their actual class rework until the the TBC pre-patch.
---
But I guess I can live with having 1 second reduced cast time on lightning spells over the 0.5s we got instead.
---
I am not, just a RvB fan.
---
The comment below got it right. They edited the game config files to remove trash mobs and go straight to c'thun. In doing so they claimed server first.
---
Phenomenal
---
Is end game pvp a way to get geared without having to raid 4 nights a week or is the time requirement similar?
---
We just hate how they project it on everyone else.  A simple “sorry no ferals” turns into “pick a new spec and get good. No carries/meme specs in my group”. 
---
I can't even pat my head and rub my tummy at the same time. I would probably be less effective at parrying if I was dual wielding.
---
Basically private servers are still running the old "one computer" version of the code. Which means somewhere they've got one very powerful server out there that handles everything. 
---
When Blizzard switched to sharding, they pretty much made the decision to never return to that method. They made all those expensive, massive changes. 
---
For example, if a WoW Legion or BFA private server existed, it would have shards. Theres no version of Legion that can operate on that "one computer" system (without big changes), and Blizz decided to use Legion as a base for Classic. 
---
Yep that's it. Thanks! 
---
Very true! 
---
Dang, you are so right!  This is deep!  Next time my wife is mad at me I'm just gonna be like *"yo gurl, how about instead you try* ***not*** *being mad?"*  It's foolproof.
---
Wish I could see it with fresh eyes :(
---
They hate us cause they anus.
---
Amazing! 
---
You hit the nail on the head with the last point. I’ve played as a min-maxer and been a RL of a guild of that nature and everything was contained within the guild environment.
---
I think the lines have been massively crossed over Vanilla as some (certainly not all) vocal people have made a point to shit on anything that isn’t min-maxing and telling people what they can and can’t play in Vanilla. 
---
People should play games how they like, with the people that they like to play with. End of discussion.
---
I think it’d be nice if Mods started to have an active presence on threads that could berate other peoples play style. It doesn’t make for a nice community.
---
I would just /sit and wait until my mana regen'd instead of drinking water until about level 33 on my shaman. Sweet nectar was a big breakthrough.
---
The best route is to join a good guild and be flexible with what you do. 
---
Mythic + and raids...
---
Your raid, your rules. Strangely enough though, I didn't usually see this behaviour from the raid leaders - it tended to come from random pug dudes who would rather blame someone's build than people not following the leader's instructions.
---
Perhaps, but competing in something that has long ago been won is not a real accomplishment. You want world first AQ you need to go back in time, classic is functionally vanilla. Now racing for server first 60's, or even server first raid clears makes some sense but the overall race is over already.

Straw man argument when they are already doing progressive pqatches, considering itemization changes and possibly 2 pvp sets per their last blue post. In the end you are spinning 5 months out of 2 years as "something". Less than 1/4. It's like me saying that the movie Top Gun is a musical because Goose sings a song on the piano and Maverick sings karaoke at a bar.

Not to mention that if you have 2,500 active players at launch time, four weeks later, once all the tourists leave, you'll have 250, maybe 500 people left.
---
There's a word for that. That word is called "Dead server."
---
&gt; This is just not correct. Reading quest text is very inefficient. Not minmaxing.
---
Does reading quest text have any impact on stats? Then it's completely irrelevant for minmax. You can read every line of text in the game, and still minmax.
---
&gt; This is the reason pservers can host 500v500 fights with 1-2s of latency or less
---
Lol, no, they can't. Please link a video of a 500v500 fight with 1-2s of latency.
---
There’s a difference between being a team player and shitting on someone for not being perfect at their class/role. Some people don’t seem to draw that line and have no tolerance for errors of any sort.
---
Maybe fine in a guild run if that’s what your guild is about. Not fine in a pickup group.
---
There's more nuance to it than this though.
---
If it was *impossible* to clear content without optimized specs, then I assure you, the culture around shaming meme-spec would be wholly different.  But it's not impossible.  Far from it, actually, especially so when leveling.
---
It's fair for any given person to play whatever spec they choose, and it's fair for you to choose not to group with them for playing a subpar spec.  But I assure you, having an Arcane Mage instead of a Frost Mage isn't going to compromise the integrity of your BRD run.
---
If you just assume that everyone is an asshole, then you will run into a lot of assholes
---
No one cares if you min/max, you're confusing the point. People just don't like the people who claim anyone not min/max'ing is actively being bad and ruining the experience for everyone around them. There are a few extreme folks who demand that every player be in the absolute min/max or else they're awful people. If that doesn't describe you then you're not the one being complained about, so I wouldn't worry about it.
---
More like Asmongold's minsinformed playerbase is now being use to harass players by streamers whose career he made, who weren't relevant at all with the exception of Esfand. In addition they are all acting out of selfish bias because they play late and want easy content. They omit many things from their statements that cross realm BG's are needed. Example. The old PVP system is based on a curve. People who could get the blue pvp gear pretty easily now have to compete with a much higher curve due to the amount of honor being farmed going up substantially.  These people are not acting out of our best interest at all and I would love to know why multiple people all quit their jobs at the same time with no assurances of anything, while miraculously being spotlighted and hosted by Asmongold at the same time. What agreements were made? Why would Asmon choose two streamers (staysafe and tips) who had no audience compared to many other streamers from vanilla. Tip's Out didn't even play or know anything about vanilla. 
---
Sorry buddy, these people don't speak for me and now they are outright harassing the classic playerbase to make Classic their own personal playground.
---
The time required and the politics involved in getting Grand Marshal/High Warlord is far more higher than a 4 night raiding schedule, though the gearing is less luck based. Even factoring in bad luck, you'll certainly gear faster raiding end game than trying to grind rank 14.
---
Oh yes, it's so fulfilling for the only challenge to be in the tiniest 1% of the entirety of the content, rather than there being challenge from literally level 1 the moment you log into the game.
---
Awesome game, really. I sincerely hope people with your mindset stay in retail.
---
Please make more of these for different zones.

I agree.  But I think the community will do a hell of a good job self-segregating, in that regard.  There's no need to spit at each other when both groups are just trying to do their own thing.
---
This is amazing! Thank you!
---
It's simple everyone can play how they want and everyone can choose who they want to play with. Look for like minded people to play with and everything works out. Will there be assholes no matter what play style they choose ? Absolutely 100 % yes. I've run into casual players who are completely selfish dick heads and I've run into min max hardcore players who are.  
---
This isn't a min max vs casual issue This is an asshole vs decent person issue.
---
It's about not being an asshole trying to get carried.
---
I'll take the undergeared newbie who actually tries to do well over the overgeared skilled player who thinks he can slack because he's "too good for this shit".
---
When you're playing with strangers you should always do your best, if you want to ret in your guild runs, i couldn't give a shit, as long as you spec holy for pugging.
---
&gt; If y’all are referring to that Virgin and Chad meme, it was just funny
---
Yeah it was a good one.  Though I would have made the Virgin min-maxer a Dwarf Priest.
---
Side-note, I'll be rolling Horde and I don't think Orc will be my preferred choice for any of the 8 classes.  I feel like some kind of heretic.
---
You will definitely give up all those things when Classic is out.
---
*dual
---
What conspiracy are you even referring to..? All he's saying is that to some people its better not ever having sharding in the game rather than risking that the sharding that could potentially end up staying long term.
---
I think it's largely due to the catch 22 created in retail with gear score and achievements. You need X gearscore to attend Y raid. You can't get X gearscore without attending Y raid etc etc. People feel there is no place for it in Vanilla because for the most part, when we all playing it as teenagers we had no fucking clue what we were doing. The community was generally more accepting of noobs as a result since people cared more about making friends than they did completing a raid quickly. 
---
There's nothing overly wrong with min-maxing but the general idea is that adopting that approach turns the game less into an RPG and more a massively multiplayer stat grind.
---
Eating and drinking at the same time.   Who’d a thunk it? 
---
So, hypothetically, if I were to say go afk for 30 seconds every few minutes, that's perfectly fine because it's not gonna prevent the group from finishing?
---
A new fantastic point of view.
---
This.  The fact is that 99% of people min-max without even realizing it.  The core loop of an RPG is to get better gear to take on greater foes, and so obviously you're going to always try to add gear that improves your ability to do so.  Sure, you may not be sitting on the toilet theorycrafting and calculating percentages, etc - but when you're in game, you're gonna go "Oh hey, yeah, that's an upgrade".
---
Hah! Great story, brutally honest! It's simply amazing watching these old videos with awkward movement and clicking and realizing that guys like this "Elendril" were some the game's best players. I remember he had his Chromaggus Xbow very quickly so he was somewhere near the top in BWL and I'm not sure if he played during Naxx—as this is the only video I have of him—but his guild, Lost Anarchy, is listed as having took the world 14th KT kill when 99.9% of players couldn't ever even kill him at all!  
---
So many people only remember the end of Vanilla and ignore the years spent learning throughout.
---
Totally agree. Some people don’t share this viewpoint though unfortunately 
---
Fire ward and fire pots my dude. 
---
Not everyone, it's just that arseholes are the most vocal of minorities.
---
Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t realize Mythic + and raids were parts of the world, not instanced content 
---
Those are all over the place in that zone.  It's cool until you run into the bush and there's nothing there.
---
This! If you’re going to make a judgment call at 30, stick out the next 5 levels and get the ability to max professions. Or at least be prepared to come back later and hit those 5 levels. 
---
No, that would just make you a bad and inconsiderate player.  Even if the time you cost us worked out to be the same time lost due to lesser DPS from a poorly-specced player, I'd at least expect that player to be present and try their best.
---
For as much as this sub puts the idea of fun social interaction and community up on a pedestal, some of you guys sure seem to take an annoyingly robotic approach to expectations of other players.  This is why people don't like min-maxers.  If it matters that much to you, don't group with sub-par specs.  It's that simple.
---
I'd advocate for using crippling on my offhand. Nothing worse than a social mob running away and bringing his friends.
---
Thematically, Thunder Bluff was always super cool to me, but it's not a very functional city.  
---
Functionality-wise, Ironforge all the way - laid out perfect, it's impossible to get lost.
---
ok
---
Thank you for your contribution to the debate!
---
Yes, it does.
---
If you read quest text you're sacrificing time, that time could be spent getting xp and/or gear.
---
Thats not available in Phase 1
---
Warrior and it is not really close. Mage might be second.
---
Seeing [GOLDSHIRE IS UNDER ATTACK] pop up in the chat and trying to rally all the other level 4's in Northshire to go sort shit out
---
DKP is barely a step above round robin.
---
&gt; I'd at least expect that player to be present and try their best.
---
But if he's intentionally speccing wrong or picking the wrong race, then he's not trying his best.
---
Hey there! I like to think we're pretty reasonable, we will not require 100% raid attendance so missing a raid every so often is acceptable. You already mentioned you'd communicate this to us when applicable which is all we'd ever ask.     
---
We've still got plenty of time between now and release but please join the discord and get a feel for us as we continue to grow. If things change down the road or if the guild falls out of scope with how YOU want to play -no hard feelings. At the end of the day this is a game we play to have fun.
---
Having the same thoughts and fears. But idk I will play the game casually wherever it takes me. If I wont be able to raid whatever I will play it as much as I can. Real life is a bitch haha
---
Yeah.  To use myself as an example -- I was an extremely dedicated min-maxer all throughout my TBC and WotLK raiding career.  At one point in Wrath I even dropped the $15 to race change from Undead to BElf rogue, because Arcane Torrent granted energy and was thus an extra DPS cooldown I could use.  Literally no corners cut.
---
I also played with a subpar guild.  We struggled on every single fight and never even cleared the final bosses of the 25 man raids.  Raid nights were wipefests, and I had to rely on our core 10-man heroic group for good gear.  I was able to hold myself to a strict min-max standard while still just enjoying the game with the players I considered my friends and would have fun talking to.  It's not hard to min-max without being an elitist jerk about it, but few seem to understand that.
---
Yes
---
You said loot trading. There is one meaning and one definition commonly associated and accepted. That meaning comes from the WOTLK era and forward, hell I bet 95% of WoW players never heard the term loot trading until WOTLK. Loot trading WAS NOT GM’s restoring loot to you all the time. You’re saying that just because YOU somehow draw a comparison between the two. They are two completely different things and if you “always needing loot fixed” back then by GMs, you were the problem.
---
I’m calling every Tauren big game from now on 
---
Unless you retain your combo points... I don't see how beneficial that actually is for "Maximum" DPS.
---
They won't stand a chance, though. People have been poopsocking pservers for long enough that they kill Ragnaros 10 days after a server opens, with worse gear than Classic will offer (assuming gear stays at 1.12 stats, but limited to patch for availability).
---
As if noone could want cross realm BG's for any reason other than being an asmongold fanboy. Maybe some people just want lower queue times.
---
Your own bias is shown clearly here, you don't want Cross Realm BG's because it makes it harder for you to get your PVP gear.  I think you assume everyone is trying to manipulate the system to serve their interests because that is exactly what you are trying to do.
---
Yeah, my old guild had a solid number of healers so my buddy usually got to run as shadow. We just threw him in a group with warlocks so they could lifetap to their hearts content. 
---
But he could be trying his best within the confines of his chosen spec.  If you can't see the difference between a sub-par spec trying to play that sub-par spec as well as they can, versus an optimized player who just AFKs randomly, I'm afraid I can't help you.
---
That's simply not true. DKP rewards players who participate. You earn DKP. Maybe if you are assuming everyone performs and attends equally... then yes, it would be like you described. But people aren't equal.
---
It is not a “glorification” of AV in the sense that it is exaggerating the pros of the BG. Also, having experienced them myself in vanilla, they were not the worst thing. IMO Gnomergan is arguably the worst thing, lol. But that’s just me. 
---
I think all the hype is the ability to go take part of something in WoW that has been lost over time- mainly a very large scale and multi-faceted BG. Those who hated long AV times were free to leave the BG and did so. Those who want AV to be for instant gratification and honor grinding should look somewhere else to get their fix, IMO. 
---
DKP rewards attendance. That is all.
---
Holy fuck this is amazing, good job!
---
&gt; and ridicules others for not knowing their Pre-Raid BiS by heart, they start to draw the hate
---
This is it. Nothing wrong with min-maxing, just don't say others are wrong for not doing it. They are only wrong if thier intent is to min-max
---
A shame you're horde otherwise I'd try and recruit you and your attitude for Classic! ;)
---
Min-maxing doesn't get hate, the people that think you are garbage or lesser if you don't min-max are the problem. It's the same way on retail.
---
Haha, yes that's absolutely right.  It's an age old question with a meaningless answer but it's fun to ask.  Blizzard may have confessed to something over the past decade that I wouldn't be privy to so I ask anyway.  :)
---
Thanks for your answer and piece of history.
---
Nothing. If they knew wat they saying is stupid then they would be trolls not handicap

**Who are we and who are we looking for?**
---
-	We are an international group of various backgrounds. We have veterans who have done everything, but also greenhorns that play WoW for the first time. 
---
-	We are looking to create a mature gaming community where everyone is valued and people support each other.
---
-	While it wasn't common back in the day, we are open to hybrids and off-specs if people are willing to make them work.
---
-	Our goal is to clear all the content (again)
---
-	As a group we try to keep an open mind and are willing to work with all people that share our values. 
---
**Guild Structure**
---
-	We have an experienced core of players with private servers and the original vanilla experience (PvE and PvP)
---
-	Certain positions, schedules, activities will be decided by consensus. Checks and Balances are to be placed on all officers. 
---
-	Reasoning for all important decisions are to be made public internally and are open for debate. 
---
**Raid information**
---
-	Monday and Tuesday: 19:00 - 23:00 (+-30min, GMT +1)
---
-	Loot distribution system will be voted on by the majority before launch (leaning towards Loot Council)
---
-	While full optimization regarding buffs, potion etc. is not required, but people who put in the effort and support others will be rewarded accordingly
---
**About you**
---
-	No matter if you are a single person or represent a group, we are always glad to hear from you. 
---
-	Do you want to push damage meters and optimize but don't have the time like you did 15 years ago? Then you’d find yourself right at home.
---
-	Do you just want to go through the content at your own pace and just want to have a nice community to play with? Then we‘d definitely suit you.
---
-	Do you just want to play something that you didn't have the opportunity back then while not being treated as a second class citizen? Again, then this project is you’re looking for.
---
For any questions, information or feedback, don't hesitate to message me on reddit or discord. (tom#8446)
---
&gt;People should just try to enjoy the social aspect of vanilla; that’s the peak of it.
---
For *you*.
---
Just like in vanilla, I'm guessing most guilds will do what makes sense based on how competitive they are.
---
Most competative (going for world/server races): Master loot. Gives best distribution of loot, based on dps boosts for their primary raiders.
---
Competitive (progressive guilds, but not quite server race guilds): DKP, gives rewards based on how committed the raiders are.
---
Semi casual to casual: DKP or need over greed.
---
It will be neat being able to tell what a player is wearing by looking at them.
---
DKP is objectively better than LC for lower end guilds, for both officers and members.  
---
People who don't have much knowledge tend to be loot hungry if they get in the loot council, and members of the guild are not always capable to understand certain LC decisions as well. And you can solve these problems with transparent DKP loot system.
---
Best of luck in your raiding, friend, and if I see you I will try to kill you &lt;3
---
...usually we only have this sort of thing in Goldshire.
---
Hi, /u/roaringsnakexd
---
There was a quest in ashenvale that required an engineering crafted level 19 boom-stick.
---
You could always just spend the short amount of time in raid where no one is paying attention by wearing the good gear for your roll and wear what you want outside of it when farming/pvping like everyone else does. Like the tier gear for paladin is just fine out in the world and bgs where the stats and armor values are suited for it.
---
- you have no idea what it's actually like to play a class until 10    
---
- at 20 you really get a feel for how this class is going to play, if you're not feeling it in the early 20s this may be the time to consider another class    
---
- by 30 you should know if you're in or out, even if you don't have all your abilities and talents, you should have a feel for the class and an idea of which abilities and talents you're looking forward to
---
That's why classes like mages can't dual wield. Those who can are actually supposed to be trained in it.
---
Have you met blade flurry? I used it to great effect while levelling, made pulling 2 mobs easy.
---
We used to do this on Feenix, but I'm not sure whether this strategy still works on modern pserver projects. Nowadays, an Ony cloak is required to be invited to any raid that plans on killing Nef. It will be interesting to see whether this becomes a thing in classic again.
---
STV Big Game Hunter just got a whole new meaning for me.  &gt;:)
---
Was this on US-Aggramar?
---
I played during vanilla and TBC in DKP guilds and it was the fucking worst. People bidding on items just to raise the price so the one who wanted it would spend more on it. I will never play in a DKP guild, so it's communist (really?) loot council for me until the end of time.
---
lol, nice
---
Last time i checked attendance is part of participation. Besides, Guild can set the rules for their DKP however they wish. Doesn't have to be straight up be there get dkp.
---
&gt; meanwhile the underpopulated side can log in as they please. This continues until the numbers are closer to 55/45 or w/e. during peak.
---
... and then, so that players are actually able to play the game even if their toons are currently the “wrong” faction, those folks in queue can be temporarily sent to play on a server where the faction balance is reversed!
---
That way you're not implementing artificial barriers to playing the game and everyone can log in.
---
Great! We literally just reinvented Warmode in BfA.
---
EP/GP is supreme though.  :)
---
Yeah i know, that was the point of my comment :p i downloaded it last night to play around a bit
---
I think my guild will use EPGP. Not 100% sure yet, but I had very good experience with this system earlier. It also rewards people doing an effort for the greater good, which I like.
---
For those interested: https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/EPGP
---
For what it's worth, a brief anecdote from my vanilla experience:
---
I raided with the same Horde guild all of vanilla as a healing priest main. I joined the guild just as the server started killing Lucifron. There was a shadow priest officer already in the guild. The guy made it clear he was more interested in PvP but because dungeons were such a massive part of the game and the main avenue for loot, he grouped and raided. If more healers were needed he would be in healing gear and healing. Otherwise, he was DPS. As the game progressed and content got on farm status (and through class changes via patches) he was almost always DPS.  Our loot system was pure DKP with almost no restrictions. So dude could spend his points however he wanted. And our guild did just fine and always number 2 or 3 on server first kills and later in ZG we had some number 1s. And the shadow priest was there with us for all of it...just sometimes healing.
---
The point is it's often more important to be knowledgeable, present and consistent than to have a bleeding edge min/max setup...especially when managing 40 raid slots.
---
It's a huge waste and incredibly inefficient.
---
&gt; If I recall it correct there was an Streamer event where they tried to battle 40vs40. It was not possible to play anymore and it crashed.
---
Modern systems can handle what they're setup to handle. Funny how magically Alterac Valley can handle 40 vs 40 no problem eh?
---
&gt; but this is a thing about money. And we all know who's behind Blizzard holding the reins if we talk about money.
---
The thing about money is that you need a playerbase to give you that money and if Blizzard butchers Vanilla with sharding they aren't going to have a playerbase to get money from.
---
People are more worried because the internet likes to fear monger and "big bad $$$ grubbing companies like activision = bad!" despite everything Blizzard has been echoing and demonstrating about understanding what Vanilla is and delivering on that.
---
Blizzard has been pretty clear that they know that Classic means classic and seeing some of the painstaking efforts they've gone to to recreate that *should* have reassured everyone that they know what they're doing.
---
I think both have benefits.  For instance, I don't think any guild will give Thunderfury to anyone other than the main tank, despite DKP.  That is in many ways a form of loot counsel.
---
Loot counsel has potential benefits around optimizing progression.  With loot being a valuable asset, items like rejuv gem and shard of the scale will be in demand more than they drop.  Would you want such a rare item going to a player with a sketchy attendance?
---
Likewise, loot counsels are terribly prone to nepotism.  With the game well established, relationships between people on a loot counsel could span a decade.  How do you tell someone with perfect attendance and amazing game play that they might not get a BiS trinket over a person making the decision?  
---
I think an objective, open system like DKP prevents people from feeling exploited.  I feel people putting in the time can point to why they deserve something.  Even if a person walks away with a great item, it can be justified after they have put in raids and wipes to earn the DKP to get to the top of the heap.
---
An immediate counter to this argument is that the DKP system does not factor in the hours of prep time in consumables, attaining buffs and reputation that really make a player stand out.  I would wager, though, that those doing this extra work would invariably end up doing well in a DKP system. 
---
Both systems are flawed.  For my money, I would err on an open system that is objective instead of subjective.  I think DKP is a good fit  that is well supported on the back end for those trying to maintain points.  I think problems, such as DKP inflation, can be addressed so new players feel they have a fair stake in the raid.
---
Every game has those who detest min/maxing. 
---
People who don't like to min/max don't like to be out performed by those who do, so they claim min/maxers ruin the game for them, because they feel like they need to, but don't want to.
---
In a small game like d&amp;d, I see that argument as valid, there should at least be a conversation with the group as to the idea of power gaming, but in an mmo, you really have to concede that some people will want to do everything they possibly can, even if its wildly over complicating the process for very little returns.
---
AM loses dmg when hit...
---
Teldrassil for me, just clear out starbreeze village and I'm good
---
That is the best part. You do realize that you can also do it to others? And then call them shitface on teamspeak etc. Good times.
---
Anyone have an archived site of the Shaman class forums when they told us to wait for a full class rework for like over a year?
---
I can't read at work, so I'm not sure if they mentioned Songflower - from what I understand it was possible in vanilla for the entire raid to get buffed from 1 spawn, similar to pservers today. (I don't have confirmation of this either way.)
---
EPGP is a system the guilds I participated in used up until personal loot. Seems to feel more fair in guilds with subs or more casual players. I also like that guilds can set a EP cap per week so players don’t feel compelled to spend hours trying to buff their EP
---
It’s pretty similar to DKP but it’s a little more dynamic 
---
I'm a min maxer at endgame but the leveling part of it doesn't appeal too me. Even then I dont see why people hate it. Some people like to try hard and others go slow. It's a game your allowed to play however you want!
---
Teldrassil here, anywhere except that fucking den haha. Clear out Starbreeze village and I'm cool with that
---
There are some real hero’s in this thread, lol. It was fun to charge into a real raid sized melee and pick off who you could in the chaos before being brought down yourself. It was killing for killing sake. So long as you kept moving the line closer and closer to the enemy base you were alright. 
---
i took me like 6 days to get through the world in vanilla, mythic + and raiding is way more content than just leveling was in vanilla...
---
I'm surprised I haven't seen anybody else using a DKP system with sealed bids yet.
---
Granted, I'm only a semi-casual raider, but we used that system on a private server a couple of years ago and it seemed to work well to me.
---
I played like this on private servers from 2015-2017ish and it was the most relaxing game experience I've ever had. I leveled a few character super casually while I played other games and I don't know how to explain it but I was always excited to log on and just hang out, even if it was gonna be a few hours of nothing exciting. I never played pre-BC retail so it was totally new to me, and I didn't play enough to ever burn out, so I'm beyond pumped to just hop into a real server and CHILL. Game makes me so happy just to be online and inside of.
---
Well you *can* raid-log, but it will take a lot of initial time investment to reach that point. You can pace that out a bit. I mean if your guild raids 2-3 times a week then outside of that farming consumes doesn't take all that long. My experience on pservers reflected my time playing nonstop like I did back in retail - once you reach a certain gear threshhold you tend to roll an alt or log off unless you're into PvP or helping other folks gear up. And yea, with an experienced raid guild you thrash content pretty quickly so eventually you begin to make gold from raids rather than lose it.
---
Story structure of the actual zones doesn´t have any influence on RP. In fact, Retail is much more RP-friendly (outside of phasing issue in certain places like Sentinel Hill) because you can get to the zones faster (so instead of travelling for 30 minutes to even start RP, you can hop right in), they have low level enemies (which makes for far easier RP because they don´t bother you, not to mention that at level 60, you can basically be in all of Kalimdor and Eastern Kingdoms) and you have more areas to RP in.
---
And return of RPG mechanics doesn´t encourage actual RP. Maybe it encourages this weird "I quest and see it as my story" thing that isn´t what RPers consider RP. In fact, Vanilla is more unfriendly for RP due to lack of transmog, barbershop or flying mounts.
---
Same goes for people going out into old world zones. RPers already go there on Retail, I made events in Duskwood, Gilneas and Wetlands for my guild and it didn´t matter that we were 120 and were able to fly there OOC.
---
Talking about OOC, RPers distinguish between being in character and out of character and you can be damn sure that your paladin member of Scarlet Crusade won´t be running around Burning Steppes to get to Molten Core with 39 Alliance members. The player controlling him will, but he will then fly back to EPL, get out of friendly areas and RP with his mates that they are fanatics who despise all non-humans and also humans from the Alliance.
---
Our guild is doing a mix of the two, reserving Loot Council for Legendaries and other Best in Slot weapons.

---
What are sealed bids? My guilds had bids in whispers, but it didn't really matter since it was you against everyone else, so it didn't really matter *who* you fucked over, as long as you fucked someone.
---
People here see min-maxing as a "non-fun" option. I get some fun out of playing my character to his fullest potential. Without going full tryhard it's still a good idea to make intelligent decisions about gearing.
---
 I'm a very competitive person (min/max type) and as much as I love WoW I'm not sure I could play it "casually".  
---
My advice then is to pass it up. The game can become a massive timesink, even more so if you have a natural instinct to be "better." The game is always presenting "just 1 more thing" that will occupy your attention very strongly.
---
The game shouldn't be balanced around mentally ill private server players who pvp 18 hours a day to rank. You are taking an unhealthy system based on a curve and making it worse and ruining the game for millions of players to appease thousands. Many won't even be able to get the blue pvp set anymore. Vanilla WoW kept the mentally ill in check by not having BG's popping all day and night. That will no longer happen and they will be allowed to ruin the game for others.
---
&gt;and if I see you I will try to kill you

As is tradition :P 
---
I'll try and remember to DM you when server names are announced and see what we can arrange.
---
I like how he also clarifies one is "patched" 
---
&gt;Or are you just looking to be carried?
---
Because of comments like this.
---
Min-maxing to be at a competitive level is perfectly fine and a valid way to play the game. The issue is the toxicity that min-maxers tend to bring (to all games not just Classic) that if you're not in the absolute best gear or in the top picked IcyVeins build then you must be a garbage player.
---
Someone taking 3 months to level, getting lost in the world, etc. is having a much more authentic vanilla experience, and probably enjoying the game more than the guild downing Rags on week 2.
---
&gt; Have separate queues for each faction. When one faction is considerably bigger than the other, they must queue.
---
... and then, so that players are actually able to play the game even if their stable of toons are currently the “wrong” faction, those folks in queue can be temporarily sent to play on a server where the faction imbalance is reversed!
---
Seriously. The mindset behind this meme is the same as the hyper-elitists that say you shouldn't enjoy the game casually, even if it's a "joke". Just highroading because you play the game less, but still acting like everyone else is playing wrong and everyone who is in a remotely hardcore guild is by-default an elitist sweaty virgin.
---
Lmao people don’t realize the difference between a sound argument and an asshole.

I think most LoS exploits will be nonfunctional as well

Why would I, though? I don't find joy in fucking someone over, and doing it is an overall detriment to the team anyway. I don't understand this mentality.

And in that hypothetical situation I'm trying my best when I'm actually there.
---
The point is, you're making a decision that is detrimental to the group as a whole solely for your own "benefit", that's extremely selfish
---
I just found about EPGP a few days ago. My guild is considering running it too. The only problem is the lack of addons for this loot system. They all seem to be disappearing but I hope it makes a return for classic. 
---
&gt; The guild leaders were a couple.
---
Oh god....
---
I don't know how much it's looked down upon. I think people are just trying to encourage others to just have fun with the game. Not to pick their class purely on what has the best DPS. The original game didn't have things like Raider.IO scores, item levels, and DPS meters. The elitism always existed, but those things fed into the elitism of the game causing it to spread like cancer. 
---
I usually interpret people telling each other not to worry so much about min/maxing as them saying just have fun with the game.
---
This is kinda what I intend to do. I'm going to get my character to a certain point and log in only when I want to PvP, raid, or farm consumables. One character will be enough for me so I can focus on RL.
---
BGs are anything but "Small skirmishes" unfortunately. 
---
Got the flag? 
---
Expect you'll need to do more than blow your mana "powershifting" to get yourself through that; unless the entire team is dead.
---
You can do more total "DPS" by just casting Starfire repeatedly, than blowing your mana shifting 2-4 times in quick succession. 
---
Does a quiver or ammo pouch increase your wand attack speed as a mage/priest/warlock?
---
Theres a wide margin between "worry a little more" and "death sentence". Also I've only levelled a warrior to 60 once, and don't intend to do so ever again. The only other class that needs to worry a little bit is rogue, but they have several escape mechanics built in.
---
Yeah, I think anyone experienced with MMOs only needed that line to know how bad the story was about to get.
---
I used to wipe on a single boss for months in retail. Sure, some people are burning because of that, but generally it works and does not disband guilds. Do you think that classic casual players will be so impatient as to disband after few hundred wipes?
---
See, that's the thing though, it isn't an individual game, you're playing with other players, so when you're actively seeking to perform worse than you could, it's not just you it's harming, it's other players.
---
I mean, there are literally people on this subreddit who will imply that anyone who tries remotely hard is having less fun than them. I'm not saying it's more than a very small minority of idiots, but I have definitely read posts in this vein and it's disheartening as someone who has played both hyperdrive 12 hrs a day for months, and as a few-hours-per-week casual.
---
you will absolutely have to sacrifice something
---
Never hit 60 on any private servers as I really didn't feel it was worth it because private servers are risky. I can't wait to max a mage on official classic 
---
You can't expect to raidlog in Classic. The consumables need to come from somewhere, and I don't expect your guild to bankroll you.
---
My suggestion is to play a hunter or mage. Hunters can solo DM:N tribute runs for apparently up to 120g/hour (I imagine it'll be less on Classic as opposed to pservers due to a more casual audience (assuming, here), but should still be the top method outside of sitting at the AH).
---
Mage can do DM:E plant runs for a damn near guarantee at 60g in 30 minutes once you get good at it. That's assuming a 5 dungeon lockout. This gives you some time in between runs if you want to combine it with studying. Since it's relatively short, you can probably squeeze in 1 run right after getting home and one later in the day, for 120g/day. Also a very alt-friendly farm. Park your mage there and switch characters when the lockout is free again.
---
As I mentioned briefly, you could try your hand at the AH. I've no experience doing AH business on Classic, but I don't imagine it'll be too difficult if you're familiar with what's in demand and when it'll be in demand.
---
&gt; you'reth
---

---
If having decent queue times means making PvP gear inaccessible to the majority of players, then perhaps the PvP system should be revised in general. However, you haven't really proven that this will happen. You are just claiming that it will. 
---
&gt; you're making a decision that is detrimental to the group as a whole solely for your own "benefit", that's extremely selfish
---
Assuming the rest of the group cares, then sure.  But also in this hypothetical situation, we are playing the game with people who care more about playing with friendly players than playing with elitist min-maxers.
---
I plan on playing and having fun leveling, and I'll gladly accept Enh Shamans and SPriests and weirdly specced DPS into my dungeon runs.  I'd expect you to play and have fun playing with optimized players and pushing whatever content as far as you'd like to push it.  You have fun getting ahold of your good gear, and I'll have fun leveling to 60 and farming gold.  Given how the community is very likely to segregate itself, I can see no reason why either of us should care what the other is doing.
---
The only loot that needs counseling is maybe the Corrupted Ashbringer.
---
the open world content in retail is a joke. just faceroll solo til max level.  classic/vanilla without dungeon finder built in and quests that are nigh impossible to solo force players to interact in the world in a way that doesn't exist in the modern game.
---
You are all over this post lying about loot-trading being a thing back then. Just because YOU used the GMs as your own personal loot bot doesn’t mean the term “Loot trading” can be assigned to the action. Show me a screenshot from Vanilla were two people are trading a BoP via trade window. I’ll wait.
---
In the most basic terms yes. It’s “dragon kill points” so you have to kill bosses to get points. However, the system evolved to award points for doing various other raid prep activities which are usually decided by the officers/raid leader/GM 
---
Min/maxer says we only take Dwarf and Human Priests, no Night Elves.
---
But Sir you have enough Dwarves and won't take me because I don't have the Human 5% spirit?
---
Yes, you picked a worthless race.
---
Oh, ok then.
---
Animosity is soooo expected.
---
Even on RP servers, you don´t RP all the time. It´s just a misconception, probably brought on by people who don´t actually RP, but do this "I am questing and grinding in the world and it´s my story because I am an adventurer and when I meet another guy, we talk".
---
Actual RP is about creating your character who is part of that world and can be completely different from character you have in game (this is in fact encouraged). You can be level 60 and yet have a character who is apprentice mage who almost got killed by a kobold last week.
---
Which is why we distinguish between IC (in character) and OOC (out of character). When you are playing the game, you are OOC and when you put on your RP gear (in case of Retail RP transmog) and get to RP your character, you are IC.
---
You could have sapped the other mob
---
The best system I ever played in was EPGP with Loot Council oversight.  Basically it was just EPGP like 99% of the time, but Class Leads reserved the right to step in, in the event that some piece of gear was a massively significant upgrade or something.  Like in TBC, it was always EPGP, but it was pretty unanimously agreed upon (amongst all guildies, not just leaders) that should the Warglaives ever drop, they belonged to the most dedicated, senior, and top-performing Rogue.  Stuff like that.
---
Just a simple question 
---
Why do people have such strong feelings against Transmog?
---
I would never argue for it to be in classic. Vanilla didn’t have it so it shouldn’t be in classic. 
---
I’m just curious why the classic community *hates* it so strongly. 
---
Don't let other people tell you what type of gameplay you enjoy in a game that offers such an insane variety of playstyles and rewards for all levels of commitment. Both are completely valid, this subreddit just has more of the "Immersion" type players (and there are more of these players overall) so this is a popular opinion. Play the game how you wanna play it, it's ballin' both ways and this is just a boomer meme lol
---
In the end, the people from Classicast are coming out on this thread clearly stating they don't want cross realm BG's anyways. How does this play into your grand Asmongold manipulation conspiracy theory?
---
What kind of idiotic train of thought led you this lmao. Why would I tell you to *not* min/max if I wanted to get carried? Wouldn't I want you to be significantly better than myself?
---
Nobody cares if you min/max, and I think you have a *severe* misunderstanding of the attitude in this sub. We don't think people should tell others how to play. I don't give a fuck and a half if you min/max. I *do* give a fuck if you tell others that's the only proper way to be playing this game. If you want to min/max, if you want to RP in your starting whites, if you want to only wear gear that looks the coolest, I really don't give a shit what you do and I don't want you to give a shit what I do. Obviously I wouldn't take someone significantly undergeared into my group, but I also wouldn't tell them they're playing the game wrong, I just wouldn't take them into my raid or dungeon. 
---
I don't want you to stop min/maxxing. I want you to stop telling others that they should be. 
---
iirc the big 10k census had data on this
---
basically the alliance prefers PVE and RP
---
Yes, you are just looking to be carried.
---
*real conversation had on this reddit last week*
---
Open world content is a small part of the overall game. It takes like 10 days to level the first time, whereas instanced content last much much longer and is much more challenging and fun than anything in vanilla.
---
This is the quintessential vanilla wow player reply. Bravo
---
What about RP-PVP?

There are many things in Goldshire.

Truth. You will fully submit, or you will stay away. Thinking that there is an inbetween is a delusion.

Yes you might say the population isnt "stable", which is really what I think Blizz's point is.
---
Fantastic.  WPL always felt like the "true" plaguelands to me.  You had run-down human buildings, the eerie Darrowmere lake with Scholomance (favorite 5-man), and an overall feeling that this place used to be a normal, green forest until the Scourge arrived.  I think you captured that perfectly.

Compared to WPL, EPL was a bit over-the-top for me with purple everything and giant mushrooms everywhere.

and i will always remember the christmas decoration for the first time...
---
Aah, yes it's really cool.

&gt; I would recommend re-speccing around the reset to your PvP spec, and raiding as Fury. 
---
well that sucks.. 2-3hours a week to farm just for respec gold
---
Would love to join your guild but I’m only lvl 22. I am on the grind to lvl 60 though! My name on the server is souei
---
...uhm what? No. Can't believe people are actually advocating for sharding or warmode. Unreal.
---
There has to be a negative for a dominant faction on a server that is like 70/30. Without it, then the lesser faction gets boned uber hard. And there's no way of knowing until your server is in full swing a month down the road. The fairest way to handle it is with a queue system, which would help BOTH sides.
---
Things can be selfish even if others don't care.
---
&gt; Given how the community is very likely to segregate itself, I can see no reason why either of us should care what the other is doing.
---
The problem is that the community aren't getting segregated, at 60 we're all pugging with each other and now you're giving people the impression that playing arcane mage is acceptable and all of a sudden the mage in a group with is arcane or the priest in a group with is nelf.
---
&gt; Except if you plan to join a top raiding guild, which I would highly don't recommend because those kind of guilds are most of the time toxic, you'll be fine raiding as arms and nobody will bash your for it as long as you're not a complete noob.
---
the alternative with the casual guilds is taking 4 hours or even 2 raid days  to clear mc

I was raid leader and was blessed enough to get a legendary bow drop at the end of Sunwell Plateau.  We only had one Hunter in the raid so loot system got through out the window. Haha

You can get lvl40 in 3 days played.
---
Depends on your goals. If endgame is your goals, then you won’t find out until 60.
---
&gt; The fairest way to handle it is with a queue system, which would help BOTH sides.
---
The queue system actively blocks your customers from playing the game. That's asinine and not a full solution.
---
The full solution would be that as long as your realm is imbalanced, you get sent to play on a realm, temporarily, where the imbalance is reversed, so that all realms are eventually balanced in real time.
---
I still have my horde one, the guide is long gone. That shit was out of date the day the game came out.

I won't have respect for world firsts in classic, lol. Classic is nothing like a real world first. It's more like speedrunning WoW, as these people will just be following guides made by others. Totally different.

Method deserve their fame and recognition for y'know being good at the game. Dudes spend days, literally days on a single boss to down it. Care I mention how much time and prep goes into preparing for a WF run? I doubt they'll go to classic. It would mean skipping a tier and being behind next tier.

You could get Ebonics stuck in the doorway between Broodlord and the dragon trash room and he wouldn’t cast his spells. We got our first kill on him like this before he was tauntable.

Before Firemaw was tauntable we used death rotations to get out of combat to clear threat. Since flame buffet would drop tanks threat substantially over time, dps and healers would rotate being kill intentionally by him and be rezzed, clearing threat.

Everyone forgets that Ion was responding to a question from the audience about low-pop realms in the long run.
---
The audience member is smart. He understands that without CRZ—without sharding—making enough realms at launch to handle the influx of tourists and trial players would result in every realm being severely depopulated six months after launch.
---
Sharding starter-zones at launch gives you the power to create just enough realms for a healthy, long term population that stays truer to the original Vanilla population cap without the problem of tourists in 2019. 
---
Remember, we're not launching in 2004. Everyone and their grandmother is going to try out Classic, especially once the streamers start hyping up which realms they're going to be choosing.
---
**Which is exactly what Ion said:**
---
&gt; “We recognize that launching WoW Classic, unlike launching a traditional game that's brand new—where you can assume that everyone who is jumping in there at launch day has the intent to at least explore playing it long term—we expect that early on there's gonna be some people who are there, die hard, dedicated, racing to defeat Ragnaros, but there will be others who will just want to check it out casually, they want to see what the fuss is about, what they missed.
---
&gt; And our concern is that thing exactly as you suggest, what's that's gonna look like, what's that gonna do to server communities as server populations dwindle over time. That is where we are looking at using sharding in a very limited way...
---
&gt; ... We think we can use sharding there, in a limited, time-limited way to solve the initial launch day load problems **while making sure that in the long run, as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population and a signle world for everyone to live in.”**
---
Woah what's this about undead in the sunlight and feeding them? Sounds like vampires in the elder scrolls series.

I'm a 29yo EU-(rp-)PvP brit bro with enough vanilla experience. I'm looking for a guild of focused peeps who want to progress steadily and enjoy all vanilla has to offer with a real community emphasis.

Not interested in loosey goosey guilds who accommodate noobs in order to give them a place to fit in OR guilds who are so focused on progression that they're willing to go through undue stress to attain it. I want to be with high skill level players who don't lose their shit when things go wrong.

Will play mage on either faction and am happy to raid 2 or 3 nights a week. If I sound like a good fit for your guild hit me up with a pm.
---
In retail, some specs are a a bit overtuned/undertuned, but for the most part have very similar output. In vanilla, some specs have glaring issues that cause people to think of them as a joke. 
---
Elitists are going to be elitist no matter where you go
---
dual me bitch
---
&gt; It's pretty obvious it's the second reason.
---
&gt; Their modern servers can't handle loads of players in one place:
---
Please stop spreading misinformation.
---
The misconception most players have is that sharding is about long term server load. *It isn't.* It's about avoiding low population realms after launch. [The evidence is right here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-GobXQTf6w)
---
Sharding is a server technology implemented so that you're not forced to create too many realms at launch, or break starting-zone mechanics (spawn rates, graphics-throttling, etc.) like private servers do in order to ensure a smooth, stable launch.
---
Well, whats wrong with creating enough realms at launch for everyone who wants to try out Classic? The more the merrier, right?
---
Because we all know from experience (and private server trends) that even within six months, realm populations will plummet when all the tourists leave. This will result in lower than ideal populations across the board. 
---
This is especially impactful in Vanilla because you're far more “locked-in” to a realm than in retail. It's simply too much time investment to restart on another realm.
---
At that point, the only long term solution is majorly destructive realm-mergers. A lot of folks don't remember, but last time they merged realms in retail the playerbase nearly revolted. And to ensure that never happened again, CRZ was invented.
---
That's why sharding starter-zones at launch gives you the power to create just enough realms for a healthy, long term population that stays truer to the original Vanilla population cap without the problem of tourists in 2019. Remember, we're not launching in 2004. Everyone and their grandmother is going to try out Classic, especially once the streamers start hyping up which realms they're going to be choosing.
---
One final note: Sharding starter-zones will impact maybe an hour—an hour and a half, tops—of your total /played Classic experience. Permanent server merges? Hours-long queues at peak times. Ironically, the least damaging, least anti-community of these solutions is sharding starter-zones only for the first hour of leveling your first character. 
---
I think it bears repeating: Unless you never leave your starting-zone for the first couple of weeks, sharding at launch will only be noticeable for the **first** hour of leveling your **first** character. That's it. That's what this is all about. 
---
I'm just happy to look like an actual adventurer rather than some machine from Megatron. 
---
It looks from the header that you are on a PvE server, but as I understand it you are just focusing the guild towards PvE and will roll a PvP server. Might want to change that.
---
Does turning up stats make it hard though or just unfortunate till you grind out more gear? That’s essentially how a lot of people on retail feel about the “challenge” in classic. Instead of mechanical difficulty in things such as raids and mythic+, vanilla just turns stats up and gear checks you the entire ride to 60. 
---
Now I want to play back in vanilla for the more rpg and social aspect I just don’t really agree on “difficulty”. In my opinion, if the mechanics aren’t hard and the only hard part is that this mob has 30 atk instead 15, that’s artificial difficulty and not true difficulty. 
---
Truer words have never been spoken...
---
Raidlog clogs 😂
---
If you are willing to heal the majority of groups you join, yes. 
---
I think that attitude is the problem.  No one is actively trying to perform worse than they could.  They're simply not actively trying to play through the game in the extremely narrow way that's been defined as "best" by the min/max people.  The fact that many of those min/max people have an elitist jerk attitude makes it even less appealing to do so.
---
From my experience that is hypocritical. You'll get just as much hate as a raid leader from politely turning down a suboptimal spec that you don't feel confident bringing into your raid as if you called it a "meme spec" and made fun of the guy. More often than not you'll get called names for being "a toxic elitist" even if you were as polite as can be when you refused that person a spot in your raid squad.
---
And that is true for any MMO these days sadly. People love to play the victim card and make a fuss about it, jumping on reddit to whine about filthy min-maxers and the evil meta narrowing class diversity, yada yada... But nobody was rude to them in the first place, just an honest raid leader trying to make sure his squad is succesful by bringing as many optimal specs as possible because he feels responsible for the time investment of 39 people. Can you blame the guy for being respectful and considerate of 39 people, by refusing 1 or 2 lesser specs?
---
And for goodness' sake nobody gives me that "vanilla raids are easy, you can bring 20 suboptimal specs", yeah it's definitely easy for very good players but it still packs some challenges for new or average players and it's only fair to put the odds in your favour with stronger performing specs. Besides, it's his raid so it's his rules.
---
Sharding isnt necessarily about server load and resources (at least not in Vanilla), its about zone population balance. I dont know how often I have to say this. The important fix that sharding will provide in Classic is NOT resource based, but experience based. Once we are out of the initial launch the problems sharding solve wont exist, and thus it wont be necessary. Youre also talking about balancing loads between physical servers...lolwut. VMs (on the same node) or more like containers (also running on the same PHYSICAL machine) would make more sense in Classic. If the goal is to have one physical server per realm, then you need to shard players, on that same physical server, in the starting zones so the total number is managable. Please stop talking about CPU/disk/etc resources, it's really not relevant to the problems being addressed.
---
Yes, pservers handle 5000 people, Ive been on them. Blizzard can clearly source the hardware for that. There are only so many Mottled Boars spawned per minute, hundreds of people in a starting zone means you WILL NOT quest in any kind of timely manner. I have dealt with 15-20 other people rolling at the same time as me, it's not enjoyable. Do you really want SIX HUNDRED PLAYERS also trying to kill those boars? 
---
Personally i'm going for a welfare state! But joking aside, after some contemplation i've decided to simply just let everyone roll for their items fairly, a mainspec before off-spec kinda thing. All remaining bits and bots will be DE'd and all mats and recipes go to the head-crafters of the guild to make gear and pots at the guild's expense towards the other members to aid in progression without a complex  system where we got to mess around with numbers. Aint nobody got time for that!

Your "solution" is completely against what vanilla wow was. Literally no one wants to be sharded to another server. That would actually be the worst solution to this problem imaginable. The queue system is a real and active deterrent which actively works to balance the servers and give some playability while maintaining all social/community aspects.
---
This is a tough one for sure. The AV Zerg was garbage and I hated it. But how do you balance AV with the honor grind in mind? Or do you just leave the big battle sprawl for casuals or those done with their honor grind?
---
I can tell you from experience as Horde how utterly bullshit the final bridge push was. It was just too easy for Alliance to hold that choke point compared to the Horde base.
---
I found playing Warriors a lot of fun though in the low levels.  
---
Compare to, say, Paladin. I think I deleted 2 of them at Level 17ish in Vanilla. Brr.
---
Warriors and paladins look very similar before 60, but certain races can't be paladins anyway
---
You need to learn the art of not giving a fuck.
---
Mixmax all you like, but don't pretend you're cool for doing it. Nobody cares, stop acting tough.
---
It's just the hate for the few who are aggressive or well, absolute jerks about it shoving away the fun and turning the game into an annoying job with a pesky boss-like guy. 
---
Unconstructive criticism, hate on anyone who is less prone to min-maxing than them or *encouraging* them to play *well* (i.e. pushing these average joes to the preferred optimal spec minmaxers want or one is convenient for them to work with, often with *learn the class* motives) potentially killing their enjoyment, some jerking about drops...
---
It has to be said, tho, these are a limited scope of the whole min-maxers group, but are the most noisy and the actual ones destroying others' fun.
---
From a guy who's suffered min-maxing jerks enough (pushing me hard towards healing roles for guild convenience) despite min-maxing to an extent (namely sticking to an enjoyable playstyle/spec and min-max talents and gear for it , in my case either tbc/wotlk feral cat and/or bear -enjoyed both- or ele/enh shaman were my go-to)
---
And now you're putting more weight on my shoulders, because of the way YOU like to play the game, you're right, not selfish at all.
---
&gt; The queue system is a real and active deterrent which actively works to balance the servers and give some playability while maintaining all social/community aspects.
---
*Give* playability? Lol, you're literally preventing people from logging in and playing their characters.
---
Your solution is going to just push people away from dedicating themselves to WoW full-time.
---
There'll be many top guilds comprised of people like you. That want to relive Vanilla, but have grown up, gotten responsibilities and other priorities in life that don't allow them to nolife. Those guilds will still progress in a timely fashion and clear everything from start to finish, just not at the pace of the top 10 nolife guilds. Those guilds will require you to nolife for a few weeks or so until the tier is on farm, and then raidlog from thereon until the next tier.
---
Auto found instances and raids. Doesn't sound like a world to me. 
---
Yeah, that probably worked on a pserver that is theorycrafted to hell but classic will play very different because of the amount of guess work pserver rely on.
---
It's gonna be a hard lesson.
---
That's not reserving, that's ninjaing.
---
&gt;I can't speak for shamans
---
Leveled a sham to 39 in a Pserver a few months ago so take this with a grain of salt. 
---
BiS for this level bracket is a maul IIRC, due to how swing speed interacts with Windfury (slower the better and the maul is .2 sec slower), however, there is a HUGE amount of satisfaction from getting the Wirlwind effect and Windfury proccing off each other making the Ravager superior imo. Spin to win my friends 
---
Exactly. This is my personal feelings about it:
---
It's terribly boring to raid MC with a casual guild for 2h. People fuck up because they suck, aren't focused, talks over each other in VoIp, raid attendance isn't always on top, doesn't understand their class or gear. Overall less organized and simply casuals.
---
But it's also not too fun (I got burned/bored out) to have a schedule for a video game and always having to be prepared and ready at X times same day of the week for even a few months per raid. The higher the level the more required of you. When the casual guild fails over and over, the more hardcore guild is already finished and is working on improvements (pvp, farm etc).
---
The very best solution IMO is a combination, I call it the Veteran. Experienced players that know what to get and how. They put in hours when they really need to but overall less playtime and still manage to get somewhere, because they know their stuff and plan ahead. 
---
??? you're literally just projecting your feelings onto me i don't think i'm cool for playing a 15 year old childrens' mmo ??? what the fuck LOL
---
please address what i wrote instead of whatever feelings popped into your head that aren't true about me, thanks 
---
How is the end result much different from DKP?
---
It being a Dwarf Priest really would have driven it home. 
---
White, and not normalized. Someone correct me if I'm mistaken. Yes they generate rage. 
---
Its not fucking someone over. Its a self regulating phenomenon.
---
This ia pretty exaggerated buddy, but I'll take the bait. 
---
That's less than 1% of guilds, and if youre not min/maxing your character dont try to join those guilds.  Its not animosity.  Its taking the absolute optimum set up.  Racial choice was not significant in any guilds I was in and I've raided in multiple top end guilds(I know, no one believes that ever).  Even if its two identically geared and knowledgeable people, it would come down to skill before it would come down to race.
---
Spriest if a true 1 on 1.
---
If survival is your goal Druid or Paladin. Both can easily run from anything.
---
His reply looks pretty specific to a comment regarding guild banks.
---
While your work is good, please don't call them oil paintings.
---
The context of an "oil" painting is very, very different from a digital painting (for one thing, the time commitment and finality of your decisions), same as how digital black and white drawings are not "ink drawings" despite how during Inktober everyone and their dog tries to do that.
---
I wouldn't boil it down to a specific level, but instead I'd suggest trying to run at least SM Library with the character. It's the first "real" dungeon that requires coordinated group play and allows you experience the class mechanics (or at least the part you have access to) in their fullest.
---
Minmaxing is like pizza. 
---
You can order it with double cheese (pick dwarf priest) and everyone is going to like it, or you can get a pineapple topping on it (nelf priest), a something most likely only you are going to like.
---
Nobody really cares what you choose if you order it just for yourself (solo play), but if you do it for a group of friends (raids)... 
---
Well, they would better love pineapples.
---
I think that this will really depend on the guild. I think starting out, with no prior knowledge to how a guild operates and how trustworthy they are, I would opt for a DKP based guild. I think that the primary difference between the two systems from a "global" perspective is the ideology towards raid progression vs personal progression. In my mind, assuming that the LC is fair, the LC system focuses more on the overall progression of the guild, whereas the DKP system is more of an "every man for himself" philosophy. If I could find a good guild that had trustworthy members and a solid LC, I would definitely join it and count myself lucky.
---
Care to elaborate on the difference between trying to perform worse and trying to not perform the best?
---
So, you think it's more fair to allow everyone to roll for items? It's possible then for someone who showed up for their first raid, to win EVERY item that drops that night for his class.. while the guy who has raided with you every night for months gets nothing?
---
Bro, it's not just about the overpopulated faction. You have to realize there is another faction that you don't play on that is at a HUGE disadvantage. It's not preventing people from logging, it's a QUEUE system. You WILL get in the game. Have you ever waited in line at a gamestop, or walmart, or a burger hut? The system would serve as a faction balancing mechanism, without ruining the experience.
---
So to keep the server identity and community, you literally can't have sharding or w/e it is you're suggesting. It literally just doesn't work with vanilla. It seems you haven't played classic, but a LARGE portion as to why people loved it was the sense of community.
---
Can yo explain how does sharding solves post-launch realm population?
---
We don't know yet. It does on private servers, and there are countless people that will parrot that it's just a private server thing. But I've yet to see any source from retail vanilla, let alone the specific 1.12.1 patch that classic servers will emulate, that confirms or denies it.
---
Because min maxers look down on people just trying to enjoy a video game as "just wanting to be carried". I get if you like turning the game into more of a job but dont drag others into it with you.
---
I have to agree- to an extent, it is perfectly fine to play the class, spec, and playstyle that YOU want to play. If you want to be a ret pally or enhance shaman, that's 100% okay. 
---
But you have to recognize that it is ALSO OKAY for raids to refuse to bring you along to content that is challenging for their group. If I'm leading a raid, I want to bring 39 other players who are *primarily committed to completing content*, not primarily committed to playing their favorite meme spec. Respeccing is a standard expense of end-game raiding, just the same as consumables and repair costs. Personally I hope my guild gives hand of Rag to a pally or shaman. There are rewards from raiding that primarily benefit non-raid roles/specs. That's one of the things about Vanilla I loved. But that doesn't mean the pally/shaman that gets hand of rag is showing up to raids as dps. 
---
As a player, you play the class, not the spec. It is inconsiderate to show up to a group or a raid without the spec and gear that the group needs to complete content. 
---
'pro' =/= screaming at you.
---
I was so bad that I did this on a mage for a bit (just before 20 I think)
---
And how did they populate said areas?
---
Rampant sex parties in goldshire in. That's as far as I got.... Uhm I mean... That's what I heard any way. 
---
And also the fact that Classic is 15 year old content with zero challenge.
---
It *is* up to you to curate your own gaming experience, though.  No one is going to do it for you.  Take some responsibility.
---
You mean Thunderbrew's Boot Flask?
---
It's the difference between purposefully striking out in baseball vs. not training 6 days a week and injecting steroids.  As long as someone pulls their weight and adds to the group's goals more than they take away from them, they're doing fine.  Not everyone needs to be a roided up freak who hits 80 home runs.
---
So?
---
Pretty sure you dying once or twice is better than sharding
---
Open World is a very small portion of the game. 90% of my time in vanilla was in instanced raids grinding honor or gear.
---
I gueas i just dont see it.
---
Lol, exactly this. 
---
"Why do people look down at. . ." - said while looking down at them. . .
---
on my priest night elf if i was in a dungeon and needed mana i would shadowmeld. I can't remember how many times that the tank would pull when i was oom so while drinking they all die and i res them. they slowed down after that.
---
Very well done.  Really captured the atmosphere.  Brought me back to leveling in 2004-2005.  Thanks.
---
I'm looking for a North American Casual PvE Horde guild that will have early evening raids, ENDING no later than 10 PM EST. I plan on maining a druid, healing spec for Vanilla. I'm 35 years old and I know my internal bed time, hoping to find a fun community with similar play times. 
---
&gt; It literally just doesn't work with vanilla. It seems you haven't played classic, but a LARGE portion as to why people loved it was the sense of community.
---
I played Classic and I remember when everyone cheered at the announcement that cross-realm BGs were finally being added.
---
&gt; It's not preventing people from logging, it's a QUEUE system. You WILL get in the game.
---
I didn't realize how little of a life you had that you can just wait hours, days, to play the game you're subscribed to. Listen, not everyone lives in your NEET bubble. If I'm paying for a subscription I expect to play my characters I've invested time in **when I want to play them.** Preventing me from playing the game for hours is not a solution that's gonna fly in reality in 2019.
---
Haha love the office.
---
How dare you enjoy being excellent!
---
Hypothetically if I was playing a Hunter come classic (I won't be) I would be clever to join a DKP guild to lowball my tier pieces (since they're protected from other classes) the leaf would have to go to me eventually since it's 50% drop chance each week, and sinew drops all the time too. BOOM, lots of extra points. Chrom's crossbow would cost me some points, yeah, but the rest I could save for Ashkandi because those billions of DPS warriors in the guild will all be in bidding wars with each other over points. How could they save enough to stop me from taking Ashkandi? They couldn't.
---
DKP guilds reward certain classes and hurt others.
---
I won't be joining one in Classic.
---
&gt; From a guy who's suffered min-maxing jerks enough (pushing me hard towards healing roles for guild convenience) [...] tbc/wotlk feral cat and/or bear -enjoyed both- or ele/enh shaman
---
That doesn't sound like "min-maxing jerks" to me, just a guild leader trying his best to manage a big roster and suggesting a less stacked role for you to raid without competing every night for a melee/DPS slot. 
---
I myself often raided as a healer during nights where too many tanks or melee DPS showed up for raid, that's just part of working with your guild and being compliant, finding arrangements for everyone's best interest.
---
I don't think any person that calls himself a min-maxer would turn down a feral or an enh shaman during TBC or LK era as they were very strong specs and part of every meta raid group back then.
---
I can't wait to be the cloth intellect and spirit warrior who learns weapon skills fast as lightning with unbeatable health regeneration gg
---
&gt; It's the difference between purposefully striking out in baseball vs. not training 6 days a week and injecting steroids.
---
No, that's very different, because min/maxing doesn't take any effort at all.
---
&gt; As long as someone pulls their weight and adds to the group's goals more than they take away from them,
---
So if i go afk for 30 seconds every couple minutes, that's perfectly acceptable?
---
I'm really afraid that I'll be left out of the game because I wanna play a ret paladin. I'm not interested in healing, I'm not interested in a warrior class. I just wanna DPS as a ret paladin.
---
I've read a lot on it, and I know it'll take dedication and time but it's doable. I'm just worried about people outright not wanting me on their raid/guild/group simply because my choice of class/spec.
---
Personally I would not mind compromising on 1,2,3 &amp; 5 to avoid sharding
---
These are amazing and creepy. They really bring it to (un)life
---
im unsure what i plan to play on for now. I don't think rp though at least to start.
---
God, just this picture makes me so fucking happy and stoked for classic.
---
I never knew that, I always played alliance. Sucks we didn’t get something like that for SM 
---
dude the lime green is because they are so dangerous and sinister that's like avoiding the Amazon Rainforest because you think the blue frogs are just silly design think about it 🤔
---
Would love these without the logos. I like the ambience more than knowing it is classic
---
It won’t be as much of a time investment as it was on retail. A good guild can clear all relevant current content for each patch in 1-2  nights, and after that you just need to spend some time making gold.
---
\+1 for level to 20 and run a dungeon or two... Going to 30 is a big time investment just to see whether you like something or not. If you're going that far, he's already one of your characters. 
---
What kind of gear would be considered the baseline for knocking out something like Rag? I know that expecting everyone in pre-raid BIS is a bit of an exaggeration on the part of the community, but I have no idea how low the bar can realistically be set.
---
It's not minmaxing itself that gets people angry, it's the attitude of the people who push it. They come off as arrogant, full of themselves, and ACTIVELY put down and insult people who don't conform to what they do. It's the "high and mighty" way people who do it act that makes people confrontational.
---
That's not min-maxing though. Min-maxing is when you always go the extra mile to ensure you have the best possible enchants/gear/consumables available every raid. On top of that you know everything about your class and the raid you're running. If there is an item with +1 agility you have to farm for 30 hours to get it, you do it.
---

not a real story on my part but i heard it from a friend.
---
Or maybe they're lime green because they've been feeding off your emotions of sourness towards them 
---
But the *karma*...
---
&gt; I played Classic and I remember when everyone cheered at the announcement that cross-realm BGs were finally being added.
---
Not true. My server, NA PVP, only had negatives come from crbgs. Increased queue times and loss of community. No one cared about fighting random no namers.
---
&gt; I didn't realize how little of a life you had that you can just wait hours, days, to play the game you're subscribed to. Listen, not everyone lives in your NEET bubble. If I'm paying for a subscription I expect to play my characters I've invested time in whenever I want to play them.
---
So you're all for destroying the essence of vanilla with sharding? Even on the huge servers that implemented a queue system like I'm talking about, the max amount of time spend in a queue was 20mins or less. Thinking I'm the one in living in a bubble, when in reality you're asking for sharding so YOU get to benefit, hurting the experience for EVERYONE else. Queues existed in vanilla btw, except they applied to everyone, and not just the imbalanced faction.
---
Maybe vanilla isn't for you? Retail has features that might appeal more to you, according to what you're telling us here.
---
As a druid I wouldn't be too worried about missing mount at 40. With travel form, I read somewhere that unless your travel time is longer than 21 seconds, it's faster to travel form than mount up. So Mob to mob or quest to quest really isn't much slower at all. The only time it till hit you is running through zones, but I honestly wouldn't worry about it, you should have more than enough money by late 40s if you are conservative with your gold.
---
Don't buy from ah, loot everything and vendor it, save good boe's for later when people can afford to buy them. You will be fine.
---
We are an absolutely not competitive guild but we'll be going with Loot Council.
---
Why? Because that's the best for new and not hardcore people actually. We'll be learning the game (some of us, at least) and part of learning is to know why an item is best fit for a particular character. Also those who are not super hardcore don't know what items they really want so they are in not a good position to decide what to spend their points on in a point system.
---
You tryna get carried? Min-Max or Bust bois
---
Advanced Target Dummy for Centaur quests in Desolace (Magram). 
---
Tanking the first dungeons with a 2handed weapon as Warrior.  I suppose it's not the worst thing but I certainly took a lot more damage than when tanks would use a sword and board.
---
So, the people don't really know whats best for them? Only the dear leaders can decide?
---
&gt;i don't think i'm cool for playing a 15 year old childrens' mmo ???
---
Ha ha! Look at this guy trying hard in a childrens game, what a gu.
---
&gt; Then yea, man. If you don't care about raiding then of course you can spend 400 hours roleplaying as a level 16 survival hunter in westfall.
---
This is the shit people are talking about here. This is elitism. Becuase apparently everyone who isnt playing vanilla for raid progression is a level 16 huntard with 400 hours played. Stop taking things to extremes to try and prove a point. Nobody is trying to have a raid with half ret paladins. but people wont take any ret palys for MC when you can clear MC with like 30 people or less. The reality is that most of the playerbase is casual and elitist losers that sit and troll threads and chat channels talking about playing casual..... you fuck off
---
&gt; Not true. My server, NA PVP, only had negatives come from crbgs. Increased queue times and loss of community. No one cared about fighting random no namers.
---
Yeah, not gonna believe your anecdote over literally pages and pages of old arstecnica forum posts that you can still read, praising the long-begged for Crossrealm BG feature in 1.12.
---
I invite you to peruse those forum posts to get a real gauge on how the community responded.
---
Lol
---
The guild I was in for all of vanilla had a dedicated guild bank account that also ran some sort of chat bot to track DKP and bidding. The bids were public. There was very little reservation of loot except for the occasional tank item for progression. I recall little if any drama regarding the gearing of tanks. Items had a minimum price and then it was just an open auction whomever bid the most DKP. Boss kills were worth like 5 for farm and 10 for progression. I remember we adjusted the kill values and material contribution values overtime  as needed sort of like the federal reserve and interest rates. It was all transparent and posted on the guild website.
---
I think the only real drama was about alts, and I was at the center of it. I played more than almost anyone in the guild and by the end of vanilla had 3 raiding 60s...my main being a healing priest. If I remember correctly, at first the DKP pool was by person at the keyboard. So there was some grumbling when I started gearing my hunter or rogue against mains in the guild. The solution we quickly came to was that DKP is earned per toon. So if my rogue had earned enough DKP to win a bid against someone, the rogue had earned it by participation and therefore it was justified.
---
There was still some minor grumbling because my alts were DPS toons and my main was a healer, but I didn't do it on progression kills so my opinion was 'fuck em I earned this'. 
---
You can always hope to be the Nightfall (?) debuff applier. Though hunter spamming wingclip does it better. It's a 2h axe, that has a proc to increase magic damage taken, 15% for 5 seconds or something like that. 
---
I remember a guild during vanilla that had few spots for "non viable specs in MC, ret pala, feral druid, arms warrior etc. It's just gonna depend on the guild you find
---
People like you aren't then ones stirring the pot on the name of min/max, and I understand you can't blanket statement everyone.  Doesn't stop me from running into those types of players on this sub regularly though.
---
t. undead.
---
Unless you have close IRL friends to play with, I recommend enjoying classic wow via the odd Twitch stream. That way there's no time commitment, it's flexible, and you get to enjoy all of the best bits of the game.
---
This is what I'm doing right now as I have found myself in the same position i.e. I actually have a life now and don't want to give that up. I've come to accept that vanilla is all or nothing when it comes to time investment, and I'm okay with that because I don't want to ruin my personal progress and become one-dimensional and fat and single again no matter how much I really really really want to play this game.
---
True sharding fixes 2 issues at once, and dynamic respawn and reduced drawdistance reduces one each, but combined they do fix both..
---
I'm no professional, but I think "manually editting game files" leans more toward "hack" than "exploit"
---
??? I'm simply asking him about his opinion 
---
Kr0n0s yes. Because their servers suck and has never done dynamic spawns before.
---
N0rthdale had no such issues.
---
plus you haven't wasted money on a mount yet and if its a hunter you find you dislike hey bank alt with aspect of the pack, if i remember you get that in your 20s.
---
yes, the author of the Travelogue was kind enough to update the entries with my art as illustrations to the story, and I am deeply honoured by that.
---
Don't think of yourself as prot warrior, or arms warrior, or fury warrior. Think of yourself as warrior. 
---
You will favor certain stance in different situations, and want to stay fluid like water. Look up and pick/make good macros. Get good bindings on your stance and equip macros, 
---
Yup! You can sort them by condition too. I grabbed a set (guide, dungeon guide, and atlas) for ~$80 in 'like-new' condition or whatever it's called.
---
Two weapon fighting styles aren't always going to have better ability at parrying - mainly because the guy swinging that two-hander is gonna be better off breaking through you.
---
Also if its realistic - a shield works just as well for punching someone's lights out.
---
What's funny is that, I must've seen at least 20+ hours of ret paladin vanilla streams and a lot of them were outdpsing warriors and being 3-4th on the meters. I don't understand this stigma. I wasn't around back then. Started playing on WOTLK when no one questioned if retri deserved a place in endgame raiding.
---
it's the hybrids that were shit
---
Oh sorry, I do apologise! Your art in that case is truly wonderful!
---
There are no "troll area". Trolls and Orcs start at the same starting zone, and the "troll area" is the next quest hub for levels 5-10
---
No they don't. That was my point. Quite a few of our members are new to Vanilla or at least Vanilla raiding.
---
And Loot Council doesn't have to be a super secretive small cabal where the "peons" don't have any overview or say. :D We'll strive for transparency and access for anyone who desires. But the main point is that we'll talk about who gets what and don't just let people basically roll "need" (without points or not).
---
You are either mistaken or lying my friend.
---
Light leather sells for 15c a piece, so 1000 light leather would sell for 1.5g.
---
Spamming autoattack button on my pally during beta. Didn't realize what autoattack meant. Also we didn't have a real attack.
---
No they don't. This is Cataclysm and later stuff, when they also added the gnome starting area.
---
We're talking about vanilla wow here
---
I don't need to. I actually played on a high pop pvp server. No one wanted it, lol. I'm sure some backwater servers, and probably pve servers were ecstatic though.
---
It was amazing queuing up and fighting people on your server, then fighting them in the world. You knew who was who and which guilds to avoid.
---
Then crbgs happened, and it all went away. Queue times increased, and the rivalries ended. The beginning of the end of server community.
---
I kind of like that idea. You try to feed your battle cat berries. So it attacks a random gnome on the road for food lol.
---
They do. This guy has no clue
---
Pls do durotar!
---
Because if you wanted to look cool, you had to *earn* it.
---
Get a new robe that's a solid upgrade, but it's bright pink and makes you look like a clown?  Well then, my friend, sounds like you have a decision to make.
---
Both of your arguments are just so wrong, I'm kicking myself for taking the time to respond to them.  Luckly for you I'm in the airport waiting for a flight and have nothing better to do.
---
"Min/maxing doesn't take any effort at all" is an elitest, ignorant thing to say.  Of fucking course it does.  You need to look at guides online, review drop tables to get pre-raid bis, etc.  Furthermore, not everyone wants to play their class with the optimal spec.  So what if I want to be a ret paladin, or an elemental shammy, or a shadow priest.
---
Second, your "go afk for 30 seconds" is about the stupidest, low effort straw man argument I've ever heard.  Of course you can't play like a retard.  If you're rocking a balance druid and playing it to the best if your ability, and working your ass off not to the bottom of the DPS meters, not standing in the fire, and not an ASSHOLE, than bravo!  You're a pretty cool dude that can raid with my guild anytime.
---
Fuck sakes dude, you're the reason why min/maxers get a bad name
---
I am laughing so hard I can barely breath. You sound like me. 
---
This is the best advice. Having two of those professions leveled up will (based on recent pserver economies) net a player an average of 10g per day for minimal effort.
---
&gt;Because Classic will be forever frozen with these final changes in Patch 1.12 
---
Dunno I wouldnt really bet on it
---
who knows what will happen a few years  later
---
You are very talented, love them all! 
---
Some of you find it misleading that I call these 'oil-paintings' - I'm sorry if I mislead any of you. I cannot edit the title of this post but I will def not be calling them 'oil' in the future, just to avoid confusion.
---
So you have no issue with an officer Ret paladin getting a Band of Accuria over a rogue then?
---
forums, reddit, there will be places to post that the community goes.
---
Well,there was already a feral offtank in the guild, a friend of the GM. Tbc was quite being the one for hybrids:one of feral/oomkin/ret/spriest per raid is fine, more gets tricky. And guess who got sacrificed. It was more a guild matter. But that's the reason I pointed out *convenience*. Feral slot was taken in most guilds and got little chance of proving myself. Just unlucky I presume but certainly it did push me away of playing a hybrid again.

And actually  some servers I had some WotLK experience in, people did shaft ferals since druid healers were a dime a dozen and getting trusted enough was hard enough as a feral and its tricky rotation (compared to easymodes like fury) or bear difficulties vs the noobproof pally or DK. Simply too hard to get a name after getting the blame most of the time.
---
All in all was a matter of trust. And min-maxing draws it away from certain classes/specs regardless of the player.   
---
&gt; Then crbgs happened, and it all went away. Queue times increased
---
Dude, I don't know why I keep responding to someone so deluded, but you're trolling. Queue times did not increase when Crossrealm BGs were introduced and the fact that you think so just convinces me you didn't actually play Vanilla, at least patch 1.12+
---
Aspect of the pack is level 40 but aspect of the Cheetah is level 20. Pack is like cheetah (+30% run speed) except works as an aura so that party members can use it as well.

Have to battle stance for mocking blow, too - I believe.  So if you get a resisted taunt, you have to be quick on the stance dance -&gt; Mocking blow combo

Sounds like the kind of guild me and my brother are looking for. We both live in Michigan so EST time zone. Played the beta through BC and currently messing around a little on a pserver. We're both a little older (&gt;50) so just looking to have some fun and not worry about getting camped when I'm fishing in the STV tourney. in game name is Frankburnz. Take care.
---
Fun? Ok. Now lets find the most efficient way to have fun... Wait...

This tells so much about the psyche of alliance v horde players.  Very interesting

noobs gtfo
---
There's also going to be a lottttt of people where that nostalgia is going to wear off real quick and the ugly truth that a lot (definitely not all) of the changes the expansions brought were for the better
---
Could use someone familiar with the PvP ranking/gearing system to help me out.
---
As a player, my sheer hours of play time would make me appear to be somewhat serious.  However, I have no interest in committing any nights to scheduled raids.  Maybe I'll pug some MC/Ony runs someday, but that's neither here nor there.  If I'm able to play, say, 20-30 hours per week, and it's a mix of 5/10 mans, farming, and PvP, what's the highest PvP rank I'm liable to get without exclusively focusing on PvP?  If I approach it casually, but just happen to play a lot.  And what rank does the gear really become worthwhile?
---
Yeah, shadow form for priest at 40 is pretty defining. A lot of things get better as you level or have higher end gear for your level so something you might not like might smooth out (like missing a ton as a melee class, or having to individually buff people).
---
Oh you mean dynamic leveling
---
Heh, also grad student here, I’d love to join up if possible. I’m thinking I want to really get into healing this time. Like the other commenter though school will come first, but usually Thursday and Sunday nights actually works really well (most classes are Tuesday Thursday, though there’s some exceptions). 
---
which is a big team when you need 40 people to show up
---
No I do not. I plan on playing a rogue. I promise to everyone else in my raid. I won't act like an entitled little piss ant about how I deserve all the loot for being the best.
---
Ew who invites human priests?
---
Depressing, but true.
---
&gt; *@Blizzard, HERE'S why 5 days of sharding post-launch is too long...*
---
The world record for 1-60 in vanilla was 116 hours. I highly doubt youll be 60 in 10 days.
---
Are you EU or NA and if NA then what timezone?
---
EPGP allows the guild leader to reward to non-raid merits.  It also allows new players to compete more quickly with long standing members.  There's a lot of extra little benefits that make people happier but ultimately the end result is the same, people get loot and lose points.
---
You can change your gamefiles so gnomes look like something else, like a human or orc.
---
I can only say from my own experience during vanilla. I haven't been watching streams/parses from private servers. When I played, I really can't remember any of the guilds I was in (ranging from MC/BWL to AQ40/naxx) having a retri paladin in raids. Maybe there were in MC/BWL for lols when we could speed run them both in a raid night, but definitely not during progress.
---
What you have to understand, is that retri wasn't a "proper" dps in the eyes of majority of the raiding guilds. Guilds lacked healers. Paladins could heal, and since there were always a rogue/warrior doing a lot better DPS than a paladin unless it was pre raid gear with poor items vs. a T2 ashkandi paladin, they would always heal. Except that one guild, I didn't know any guilds that used a retridin in their raids.
---
A well run guild should be able to get shit done raiding only 2 nights a week, regardless of whether they are hardcore or casual. Most of MC is a joke, BWL is a tad tougher but once you get past Vael it's all about executing the mechanics correctly, and any guild that can knockout the first boss in AQ40, will be able to kill some at least some bosses in Naxx almost immediately as Skeram is probably the 3rd hardest boss in AQ40 in terms of mechanics. 
---
If I were you I'd play a DPS, and if you can master your rotation, you should easily be able to top the charts with little commitment. Playing tank or even healer is going to be more time consuming as you likely need to help run 20mans with your guild every week because you play a more vital role. 
---
Honestly the moment i saw the original trailer my life was over
---
My favorite system is and always will be GDKP. Buy the items you want split the gold in the raid.
---
Preach!

And for people who care about endgame, that part is the game. What is your point?

If you can't tell, you'll know soon enough when you're charged and hit with Mortal Strike. ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
I have had great experiences with both systems, so I'm not too concerned
---
Consistency is much more valuable, I'd fearward the tank. One less healer isn't gonna change anything. 
---
Just level slow and then decide when you hit 60.
---
Friends and "doing things" is cool and all, but cmon man WoW Classic!!

Add me on discord, Crimsoneagle#3839
---
First time I played and went into the bank, people were "lined up" behind the banker. So..... I got in line. After a minute my coworker who got me into the game was like "uh, you know you don't have to wait in line for the banker? Just go talk to him."
---
I was like "Oh" &lt;sheepishly&gt; . LOL
---
They let these twitch thots get away with anything these days...
---
&gt; f fucking course it does.
---
You're right, when I'm sitting there at character creation and select a rogue, hitting the human button is so much harder than hitting the nelf button, or when I select a priest hitting dwarf is so much harder than hitting human or dwarf.
---
&gt; If you're rocking a balance druid and playing it to the best if your ability, and working your ass off not to be at the bottom of the DPS meters,
---
If you were working hard and playing to the best of your ability you'd be resto, not balance.
---
&gt; [...] and not being an ASSHOLE, then bravo! You're a pretty cool dude that can raid with my guild anytime.
---
See, that's impossible because playing a balance druid automatically makes you an asshole.
---
If you're oozing free time, then my recommendation would be to level a druid to 60. The value of a druid as a gatherer is pretty big so you'll get plenty of value out of that class no matter what. Secondly, and most importantly, you'll be able to learn what game play style most appeals to you because you can do mimic what every class does outside of fury/arms warrior and hunter, and that's mostly because of their weapon usage.  
---
Once you figure out your playstyle, whether it be a little stealthy ninjaboi or a carpet bombing magic dps, you can start feeling out other classes that better fit your style in a more specialized way.  
---
Now if you aren't flush with free time, and are a responsible adult who pays bills on time and showers from time to time, then I would suggest hitting up youtube and this here subreddit and get an idea from others what classes look like at all stages. a 20 minute youtube vid is much faster than leveling to 20 just to ditch the character. You can also check ability lists (i think classic wowhead has ability lists now) to see what cool shit you may unlock at higher levels. 1-30 will give you a decent idea about what life will be like long term, but a 31 point talent will give you a great idea, but that's still a pretty big time investment.  
---
All of this is part of what makes classic cool though. Being so time committed to a character that you love that character and you're gonna make this shit work no matter what shenanigans you're gonna have to pull. Life's a garden. Dig it. Make it work for you.  
---
meant playtime or 240 hours.
---
even if it was double that 500 hours it would be nothing compared to the amount I played at the endgame of either Vanilla or Retail. Open world is for casual players, and that is why I don't understand why casual players don't enjoy retail. I'm guessing it's because they don't have the skill to compete with the better players and there is content they will never experience because of it. Whereas most people could get into an MC or ZG pug and Naxx was out for such a little amount of time and BC was coming it turned a lot fo people off of the farming required.
---
There have been massive improvements to quality of life (hunters not having to carry around ammo) that I will miss but those also helped immerse you.  I miss crafting my poisons, I miss collecting ingredients for spells (slowfall), I miss having to travel through the world to go places. Booty Bay felt far away from SW because it was.  I couldn’t port everywhere.  I didn’t have 3 hearthstones.  The big cities were more than 1 zone away.  Leveling in the Plaguelands felt so distant.  It’ll suck running to dungeons again but that made you experience the world.
---
That's a really good point.
---
I get what you’re saying but the biggest problem with dkp in my opinion is that it doesn’t differentiate amongst classes. A ret paladin with 100 dkp is just as entitled to Accuria as a rogue with 100 dkp. Unless there is a system in place which prohibits certain classes from using dkp in certain items. 
---
I had no idea the talent tree existed until I got into a deadmines group at level 20ish and was asked by another warrior if I was leveling arms or fury. I felt real dumb but was gleeful when I saw all the talents I could spend points on
---
It shouldn't be up to me to tell people they shouldn't be assholes though, but yea, what do you think I'm doing here?
---
and the short life
---
You actually have no idea what you're talking about. Your experience or w/e you've read about is not how it was on an actual NA PvP realm, at all.
---
How someone can be so far from the base to suggest sharding servers and wanting to add crbgs, is just mind boggling to me (Even Tips/Esfand/Staysafe are against the addition of crbgs). Most of the PvPers/Rankers quit after the crbgs were added on my server, because it took away the community. No one liked queuing into random players from random servers. It kind of died until 2.0 and TBC.
---
The only possible way I could see the addition of crbgs, would be during phase 6 or even later than that for classic. Any earlier and the game will be ruined to a point that is very much not like vanilla.
---
That's how DKP works. 
---
Imagine the outcry if ret officer would loot council accuria to himself VS. ret officer wins it transparently with DKP. The more preferable option is clear here.
---
Not answering your question exactly, but in case you don't know, Rogues in retail can actually get a spell from a tome called "Detection" that gives you the swirly ball! It does nothing but give you the swirly ball (and reveal a couple secrets)
---
That's an extreme case, if it happens it happens. In the end it is the most fair thing to create an equal opportunity environment.
---
If such a situation or likewise situation occurs, it is up to the players to behave like adults and not get upset over not receiving a certain item. The odds that they receive every item is just as likely.
---
The philosophy for my guild is that people come first. I do not want to run a loot council where people could find reason to doubt the leadership, or a points system that could work in other people's favour more than others. (plus i dont want to spend time on anything so complex, the system i am going to run is convenient for my philosophy anyway)
---
Right I guess that's what I remember, probably now that every raid is dissected it's even more of a difference. I wonder if there are certain pieces still worth grinding honor for over raids
---
Rank 10 at highest if you devote most of those hours to PvPing every BG weekend. That will get you the full set of rare quality PvP gear that is generally well itemized for PvP (depends on class and spec) enough to be roughly equivalent to gear you can get before BWL.
---
Higher ranks require dramatically more time investment, and Rank 11 only allows you to buy an epic mount. It would be impossible to reach R12+ unless you premade PvP for all of your 20-30 hours per week and even that's a stretch.
---
&gt; How someone can be so far from the base to suggest sharding servers and wanting to add crbgs
---
I'm pointing out how your solution is broken and the only way to fix it is ironically the same system that Warmode introduced.
---
I'm pointing out the logical conclusion to your half-baked idea.
---
&gt; It kind of died until 2.0 and TBC.
---
This is how I know you didn't play Vanilla. You don't even know that 1.12 patch lasted two months before 2.0 dropped.
---
WTF! Outed, mate. Damn, you had me convinced you actually knew what you were talking about for a second there, lol.
---
Loot Council is for masochists that enjoy their guilds being run by friendship circles of hell masquerading as impartial and fair leadership.
---
We are NA (PST)
---
(Un)Holy shit 
---
Look man, I feel like we misunderstand eachother.
---
I'm happy for Blizzard to make balance changes to classic. I think Ret paladins doing literally 1/8th an equally geared/competent rogue/warrior's dps is stupid. I see no problem with Blizzard changing it so that ret does literally double the dps it does in 1.12.
---
But you can't expect people to pick you up for raids when you choose to play in a way that is so horribly sub-optimal that it requires other people to choose between picking up your slack or failing.
---
&gt; We just want to have fun too.
---
nothing with that. But what if your fun, is at the expense of others' fun?
---
&gt;We're not assholes for how we play the game.
---
That's a matter of opinion. and opinions mean dick. don't sweat that shit.
---
&gt;we also enjoy goofing off ganking lowbies in a starting zone just to start up some PvP, 
---
and when you say start up some pvp. you mean have the person you were ganking log onto their high level character and travel to stop you from preventing people from leveling up.
---
&gt;My point is, we're the same people.
---
meh...are we though? If I have a 40 hour a week job, a wife, and kids. Why do a minmaxer get a monopoly on ass kicking because they simply have more time to devote to squeezing out another 100 points DPS/HPS? This ostracizes the casual amount of time player and speeds up the killing a game. Wildstar is perfect example.
---
 devs respond to this by making content harder. Min maxers say 'get gud lulz'. people that can only devote a few hours a day to playing, much less research and experimentation are left behind in content that gets nerfed months later after it was release to appease the people that eat up content in a matter of days.
---
there is an impact if enough minmaxers gather. think about. superstar minmaxer guild can beat the top raid boss in 15 minutes because of their DPS number from their setups. they complain that the game is too easy. powercreep becomes an issue. and powercreep is exactly blizzard is re-releasing WoW classic. because of min max raid leaders and min max guilds being the vocal majority.
---
You can do both. It will just take you a long time to level to max. Heck, I never made it to max in vanilla yet I enjoyed it thoroughly and its one of my best childhood memories. It doesn't matter than you min/max, find a guild of like minded adults with similar situations, trust me there will be PLENTY in Classic WoW as i fell more than half the population will be 30-50 with actual lives.
---
It’s interesting how a few words can completely take you back, no? EPGP was the system my guild used through WotLK and Cataclysm and I remember it fondly.
---
Or, you know, thousands of times on the way to 60.

you can get rank 10/11 if you consistently play without having to poopsock it.
---
gear depends entirely on the class. some classes dont really care about ranking, some classes rank 14 is bis
---
There is a reason 99% of the warrior content on the internet right now on private servers and back in vanilla was from people with insane gear and bags full of consumables i.e monkeynewz/maydie/laintime , because that's what you need to have in order to compete with other classes 1v1. A casual player is going to have a really rough time as a warrior 
---
The people you run into on the sub aren't the same people you'll run into in-game. This sub is such a small sample size of the community at-large that it's barely representative of the group as a whole. That being said, people that *do* bother to go on /r/classicwow and *do* bother to post instead of just lurk are much more likely to have strong opinions one way or the other.
---
My opinion?
---
This whole debate is just hyperbolic. 1% players will play with 1% players in 1% guilds and the 99% of people not min-maxing and playing Classic like a job either a) won't encounter them or b) won't want to be in a group with them in the first place.
---
It's like me, a casual, on-again-off-again WoW player complaining that Method won't take me on world first runs because I didn't put in the same amount of work. 
---
Why would I expect that to happen?
---
Some folks *are* going to min-max and go for server first runs, but *most people aren't going to see end-game content at all*, much less worry about server first content clears. 
---
You missed the "response" stream where Staysafe said if you are for 1.12 but against cross realm BG's you are a moron. Said with a straight face while he advocated for phases, AQ event etc.  Classicast doesn't debate. They attack, use personal insults, and then want to claim they speak for the vanilla community. Rich Campbell is also a Blizzard employee through MLG acting completely unprofessionally in that stream from a company that punishes toxic "esport contestants" yet allows their announcers to act worse.
---
* I bought grey items from armour and weapon vendors in Silverpine Forrest. When I got my first green item I spent ages trying to find out why my warlock couldn't wear mail armour.
---
* I asked how I could mail my items to the auction house to people catching the Zepplins outside Undercity. They told me to email someone called 'Auctioneer' and put down what I wanted for the item in the text.
---
* I thought all classes could have pets, I asked a friend how I could get an Imp to follow me round (I rolled a warrior first) I then rolled a warlock. I then rolled a hunter when I couldn't wear the mail that dropped(see first answer)
---
* When I learnt new spells I thought that was it, done.  Sometime around level 20 I realised I had been using mostly Rank 1 spells and attacks.
---
* I asked my first group when an item that dropped in a dungeon, how much it would cost me to have it if I said I needed it, I thought it was a bidding system.
---
So change something else based on a change? Oh but don't forget that this is all "no changes". Keep piling up that BS Classicast and fanboys.
---
talented
---
If we're going to use the most extreme cases of abuse as an argument:
---
Roll system: Hunter rolls for Ashkandi and wins. Argues it's a Hunter weapon.
---
Loot Counsel: Loot Counsel decides Ashkandi should go to Tiffanyrawrz (The guild masters girlfriend) because, well, reasons.
---
At least in your example, the Hunter was there for every raid to earn the DKP and contributed.
---
Then that’s where modern gamers disagree. We don’t believe in time req and stat checks being true difficulty anymore. Its artificial difficulty that has little to do with player input and more to do with numbers on items. 
---
If you actually quoted instead of doing your own words and passing them off as quotes, you probably would have noticed I actually didn’t talk about mechanically difficulty in vanilla raids. I say vanilla doesn’t have mechanical difficulty followed by the phrase “such as” which in American English notifies the reader the following items are examples not the actual subject of the sentence.
---
actualy most of the hard core players are nice ppl. for some reason this sub thinks that hardcore = jerk.
---
on the other hand, if you want to play this game super casual then thats fine. you do you. but you are not entitled to join my party. if i want only X as my group mates and you are Y then im not gonna inv you. that doesn mean that im a jerk. you like to play as casual and i like to play as hc. if you are not happy that i dont inv you to my grp then make your own grp
---
Do: Realize that playing some ways is harder and less effective than others. 
---
Do: Find ways to squeeze more potential out of your chosen playstyle, whatever it may be.
---
Don't: Get upset when a group that has a greater proven efficiency threshold in mind and elects not to invite you.
---
Don't: Sling insults at the above players, calling them elitist tryhard virgins for playing the way *they* choose to play.
---
I totally agtee.
---
Warlock /thread
---
Hands down, no contest. Nothing compares to SL and the only one close is Shadow Priest, which again, is not even close in terms of overall 1v1 capabilities. 
---
2vx Geared warrior with paladin pocket heals
---
I see what you're getting at, except, people look at logs.
---
If you merely show up, sit there, and do nothing: you're likely not going to be getting ANY points for attendance in the future. Because you will not receive an invite. Same goes for very poor performance, consistently wiping raids, etc.
---
I you want to bg pvp serious, support priest &gt; spriest. They are one of the most needed and sought after positions in premade pvps. Double so on horde side. Its so funny when those big and dangerous warriors becomes your little bitch.   
---
T1 is a really good starting set for priest pvp, in short, stack stamina and have fun. You will have very hard time getting sp gear from raids, because you compete with warlocks and mages for the same gear. 
---
I remember opening the game to find it had an update, and reading every bit of the patch note whilst the game downloaded hardly knowing anything about what was being patched.
---
"So-Called"!?
---
🔨☀️
---
Yeah I agree tbh. I wouldnt want to carry people in a raiding guild who choose to be bad but I still think pubs should be more willing to take people on
---
Your lack of reading comprehensive is telling. So let me spell it out for you. 1.12 arrived with crbgs. Our server had a mini death due to no one caring to queue up anymore since you primarily fought randos from other servers. Until 2.0 came, then people started to kind of care again in prep for tbc.
---
How was that difficult to understand? Jfc.
---
It's actually hilarious you're this delusional. Want me to upload a screenshot of my account creation?
---
People don't mean they are anti-min/maxing necessarily.
---
But they are against people trying to govern what other players are doing or the way they play. Or flaming people for not knowing certain things. That's all. It's far less a big deal than OP or anyone else thinks. 
---
Nah man, hybrids were THE shit. 
---
Hopefully, DPS warriors aren't using 2h weapons
---
I just hope shaman wind fury can proc wind fury again. That being patched out was sad. 
---
But it probably helps
---
&gt;there are several people on this sub that have experiences as clearing bosses even in Naxx with everything but optimal specs, and also close to no one using consumes.
---
These people are being carried by 30+ people in BIS gear. It is not at all exemplary of what Classic will be like for the first 2-3 years. 
---
&gt; I myself went up to mid AQ40, We were 2 ret, there was a few ferals, at least 1 moonkin, 2H specced warrior(s). We stopped progressing because of TBC. 
---
So 2H specced warriors actually do the best dps depending on gear, particularly on Horde side, so out of 40 people you had 6 sub-optimal people, and this was in an environment that had a relatively high level of mix-maxing. I would argue that your anecdotal example here is definitely not going to be your average casual player's experience.
---
&gt; Do your stuff, play with people like you 
---
I completely agree with this. I have friends that I know will literally never get to 60 in classic. They're too busy, too casual, and way too jaded for it. They're in their 30s and there's no way they'll ever make it that far in the grind.
---
&gt; Everyone can find a group of players that suits them. 
---
Shit man, I keep agreeing with you. I totally think that survival hunters and boomkins should find like-minded people to run MC with.
---
&gt; The hardest in endgame PvE in Vanilla was to have 40 people available and with as few absent people as possible, and that did not do stupid things such as overaggro or explose with the bomb near other raid members. 
---
Here's where we disagree. It wasn't getting 40 people together that was hard; it was hard getting 40 people together in a group that didn't have 5-10 sub-optimal, uncaring morons that ruined it for everyone else. 
---
Frankly, I think Classic will prove me right. I think Blizzard should have taken a solid look at class/spec balance and just added flat % damage, healing, or tanking where necessary. Gamers are different now than they were 15 years ago, and a lot of people with rose tinted goggles are in for a rude awakening when they realize how far we've come in determining what play-styles are profitable and what ones aren't. 
---
Play stupid games, win stupid prizes. You can't be selfish raid leader and expect it to work out perfectly.
---
Wow just looked at the guide myself, it's so detailed, thanks for highlighting. :) 
---
&gt;14 y
---
Nice to see those 8 year old raiders coming back for classic wow.
---
Yes, a thousand times yes.
---
I really dont think the whole hypocrisy argument is doing you amy favors. Pretending that having no AQ opening event is an equivalent change to having cross realm BGs is silly. Noone thinks that. If you do, you are in fact a moron. 
---
Stick to the argument at hand instead of trying to paint classicast as hypocrites. You think Cross Realm BGs are bad fpr the ranking system. If that is your argument, hold to it and expand on it instead of attacking classicast. That is the argument blizzard will listen to, not "Staysafe is corrupt asmongold pet manipulating the community".
---
Or picking the wrong race? Man can’t wait to pug with people like you blaming me for an “inefficient” decision I might have made months ago. At least this gives OP a good idea of why some people dislike elitist min maxers. 
---
I'm also looking for similar time slot. Replying for us early raiders :)
---
Because it can create a terrible game culture. When people refuse to group with bad specs, or insist that they should get gear because it's BiS according to some excel sheet, that shit is not fun.
---
And i love how people think that not min/maxing means you're bad or casual. 
---
A lot of us hate that some people turn the game into an excel sheet. Not that they do it for themselves, but because they create this standard of gear or builds that others need to be able to live up to.
---
You can say it doesn't hurt anyone else, but it's this kind of bullshit that lead to things like gear score.
---
I have been buying VHS and DVD copies of South Park at thrift stores. Love that show. Grew up watching it.

---
Great post, I agree 100%!
---
I PvPed for ~2 years with no cross-server BGs and knowing who everyone on my team and the enemies was so nice. Seeing these same people out in the world was so damn cool.
---
The day cross-server bgs released, I played BGs again, and all that magic was lost. It was immediately noticable and bgs were so different.
---
No cross-server ANYTHING in Vanilla! Vanilla is about the COMMUNITY, cross-server bgs KILL the community!
---
But it is Neat.
---
Why thank you!
---
&gt;Or are you just looking to be carried?  
---
Vanilla Raiding isn't near hard enough that you'd need to min/max to be successful. 
---
&gt; I must've seen at least 20+ hours of ret paladin vanilla streams and a lot of them were outdpsing warriors and being 3-4th on the meters
---
The only times I've seen that happen was when Esfand was popping every consume in the book while also being fed BiS gear on priority instead of the other warriors. Ret pallies aren't anywhere an actual good DPS class in terms of damage. The only times they'll look good is if they're outgearing everyone else or popping 10x consumeables just to look good on the meters.
---
Sounds like a pretty toxic environment :(
---
Those are your quotes. Our opening lines are literally the same. Yea, I cut out words out, but they felt like fluff. If you want the full context, well you and everyone else can see the comment history.
---
But again, the whole game isnt raids, and its not even all PvE. As for "time requirements"...sorry let me quote you right, "time req"...RPGs have never been about blazing through things. Its about the journey. Sorry that you M+ babies dont have an attention span
---
&gt; in American English
---
Sick pedestal bro
---
I agree with warlocks unless you intend playing an alliance lock. A significant number of players will be Undead and you'll lose a lot because of their racial
---
Rogue are always good in wpvp because you have the ability to choose when you want to fight and that's really all a rogue needs to win. So for example, if I was a rogue, I would have problems fighting you, if you were a soul link lock or a shadow priest. I'll wait till you've pulled/killed enough mobs and are in a weakened state. Death runs are obnoxiously long in vanilla so I'll get I should get a good window of time to do whatever quest I was there for and leave. Plus if there's a lot of enemy players, you can kill stuff on the other side of the area and avoid them. 
---
TL;DR. Just another #NoChanger complaining about XRBGs. 
---
Let me guess: you didn't play on a low pop or unbalanced server and never had to suffer abysmal BG queue times?
---
The Wolfshead Helm does stack with Furor. The Wowhead comments specifically state that it did in classic.
---
That said, I totally agree that it's not a great helm at max level. It's only worth anything if you're in cat and you're able to use all of your mana power shifting. If you have to use some mana to go into bear form, or offheal, or battle rez, or do anything other than stay in cat and DPS - then it's worth significantly less than any other helm with stats. I'd rather have keep some mana in reserves so that I have the ability to do those things if necessary.
---
i disagree here, i don’t think cross realm bg’s are gonna do any harm. it’s different than dungeons and raids where you move as a team to the entrance. instead you’re just going to any major city and queueing up.
---
&gt;Then don’t join those guild. 
---
Don't worry, I won't.
---
&gt; If you want to finish all the content in a few weeks or burn out trying then go for it.  
---
It'll take me at least a month to hit 60 on my first character, so I expect my first character might be maxed out BIS around six months after release... I think I'll have plenty of content tbh.
---
&gt; There are plenty of us that completed progression content at a fast pace in it’s original iteration that are happy to take a more laid back approach. 
---
I'm really happy for you tbh. I hope you accept all those boomkin, ret, shadow priest and affliction warlock applications so that they don't spam my guild application inbox quite so much.
---
&gt; I don’t think it makes people entitled if they choose to share their experience to open doors for people rather than pursue their own goals over all else. 
---
I didn't argue that choosing to do that was entitled. I argued that it was demanding that other people do such which made you entitled.
---
&gt;rage injection totem
---
Lol that's a new one for me.  I like it.
---
I don't hate min-maxers, I just think it's hilarious that people care enough to go to such lengths to get every last point of damage out of a rotation that likely consists of 1 button in a boss fight that likely has 1 mechanic.
---
Ah, I remember I would go into the inn and do        
---
/sleep on the beds then log out. I also remember dying in that Stonetalon path because of spiders and there were like 2 graveyards in the entire zone. You had to walk to your corpse for 5-10 minutes.
---
So you think the ideal PvP system is single server forever, and that is more "no changes" than having Cross Realm BG from the start. Understandable. 
---
I never said that changing the PvP system would be "no changes". If you want to have a civilized argument, stop pretending people are claiming things like "no changes" or that "we should have Naxx in at launch". It just makes you appear too weak to give real arguments. 
---
Im fine with changes if they are healthy for the game. Id rather people be able to actually play BGs and get into queues in a reasonable time. The whole vanilla PvP honor system is honestly terrible and if they changed it entirely I wouldnt necessarily be upset. 
---
It's the inevitable post that /u/catastrophicprophet will make in a year that triggers me. 
---
&gt;WHY WON'T ANYONE ACCEPT MY BOOMKIN TO RAID AQ? FUCKING ELITIST SHITS.
---
You claim that rankers won't constantly camp players at flight paths and other hot spots because they will collude with one another to avoid having to PvP as much. Yet you also claim that if cross realm BGs are implemented and popping all day then rankers will play them during working hours making it impossible for people with jobs/lives to compete for rank. Choose one.
---
R10 if you spend a good chunk of your weekly hours. R11 if you spend  nearly every hour PVPing.
---
The full blue set can be decent but it entirely depends on the class and sometimes the spec as well. You gain pieces at ranks 6/8/10.
---
You're reading this sub, you're well aware what the proper races for each class is, if you choose to ignore that then it's pretty evident you have a shitty attitude towards being a team player.
---
Someone's done it.

---
You're missing the 2 main strengths of druid for escaping: inmunity to polymorph (good against mages, they won't be resetting the fight unless they iceblock) and the fact shapeshifting removes roots and slows so few cc work well against them considering having enough mana to shift.
---
I agree with you. Preach! 
---
Warrior, Mage and Rogue
---
Warrior was the only 100% Viable tank had a great DPS spec in the form of Fury and Arms as a PVP Spec.
---
Mages would raid both Frost and Fire depending on the progressed content. Though most points were spent in Arcane to unlock Arcane power. Again there's at least 3 viable pvp specs.
---
Lastly Rogues had 3 viable PvE dps specs in Combat Swords, Daggers and Sealfate Daggers when your gear reached the correct level. I'm now even sure how many pvp specs they have.
---
Every other class had some form of dead spec or preformed so poorly they weren't considered Viable.
---
(Though some came in handy for leveling, But died off at cap)
---
This is it for me. The feeling of community is totally gone with cross realm bg. You need that relief of seeing your realms best flag carrier in WSG. You need that FEAR of seeing your loosing faction’s best pvper. 
---
So no to CRBG.
---
In all seriousness I buy video game Art and I'd love to buy one of these, perhaps more than one.
---
Hit me up on Twitter @WiZecraX
---
In a good LC guild you know who is in the running for an item before it drops. You'd know that the GM is planning to give it to his girlfriend. If you want to leave because of this, then do so and join a guild where the LC is not blatantly dishonest. Then again the GF could be a great hunter with 4+ months straight perfect attendance and the jealous warrior joined last month. Who knows? Your example was very sparse.
---
If it is assumed that the hunter definitely did not deserve Ashkandi, the guild will likely lose a lot of players and have a bad rap for being a bad LC, but in the example I gave this is a GOOD DKP system, not a bad one.
---
On a /roll system it would likely be on ML because that's what people do now even in pugs and the hunter would be told that he is the wrong class to roll on this item. Doesn't really apply, just know beforehand who is or isn't allowed to roll on an item.
---
The main problem I was trying to illustrate with DKP is not that hunters are not allowed to have Ashkandi, (It's a great PvP weapon for them after all) but that DKP can be gamed to bypass the order in which a player would receive something. Maybe there would be an agreement that the hunter would receive the 4th or 5th Ashkandi that drops, but with the ability to hoard dkp the hunter can effectively bypass seniority unless a warrior is not rolling on anything so as to hoard his own points.
---
But that doesn't seem right that this poor warrior is falling further and further down the dps meters on his gear just because he is trapped in the cycle of saving for his BRE/Ash/Edge/etc.
---
The same could happen to the hunter if all the hunters are passing on loot and trying to shard their tier gear in a psycho competition to save for their crossbow.
---
Imagine the beautiful view every morning. And all the markets are right outside your house. Oh to be a human as part of the Horde faction. And eventually Forsaken.
---
with the 6 phases of content release, even getting to 60 in 4 months doesnt really matter.  at max level all you gottta do is get pre raid bis and logon to raid.  the irony is hardcore guilds spend less time because theyll clear the raid quicker with less deaths etc.  then when raids are done for the week just casually logon to pvp or whateverr
---
As someone who will probably play a Ret Paladin, i respect your decision sir.
---
* charges at you with engi helm and hits you with Judgement of the Crusader *
---
Why meditate when this is more productive and ten times more effective? :D
---
Exactly. It was the vanilla hub because it just made logistical sense.
---
I was wondering when this would rear it’s gloruous head!
---
CAT IS FOR FITE!
---
I am very excited to go RP now. :D
---
Horde rolls 2H fury dps (not possible on Alliance) as well as many warriors want 2H's for PvP.
---
R10 gear (aka the blue pvp set) can be obtained pretty casually, but it's pretty meh and might even be bad if we get progressive itemization and the two different iterations of that set.
---
The good PVP gear (R12/13 epic gear and the R14 weapons) is way more time investment than raiding. Easily 40+ hours a week, and you need to play 12+ hours a day for R14.
---
People don't raid 4 nights a week anymore, at least not until AQ40 if they're still clearing MC+BWL+ZG+Ony on top of AQ40. Most guilds usually raid 2 nights a week, with the 20-men/ony on offnights.
---
You're not very bright. I can tell.
---
Eh, I think if anything, pubs need to be more strict because they lack the tighter strategies that guilds can pull off. A guild can support 5+ sup-optimal specs in their roster, but a pug? ehhhh...
---
&gt; then a multi-billion-dollar game dev should have no problem running servers with only 4-5k online.
---
Too bad that Blizzard behaves like a small indie dev.
---
The Pumpkin Pie must be great.
---
Try the crispy bat wing. ;D
---
I had a brief conversation with one of the better content creators recently on a pserver and suggested a topic like this for a video "Gatekeeping and how to cultivate a positive experience in Vanilla"
---
=P
---
I plan to have two characters/servers one for me play and one for twitch or youtube video playing. I figure starting from scratch like that and such will make it more fun for me. I might do horde over alliance for the streaming/recording since i know less on that side vanilla
---
I can't agree more, the simplicity was amazing, leather armour was discernible from mail and plate, and weapons (minus some exceptions) weren't of Monster Hunter proportions. 
---
Makes sense to me though as it is supposed to be hidden underground. 
---
At least they're always laughing! :D
---
&gt; Hi, parties still exist in retail and the content is way harder and more rewarding.
---
1% of the game is more challenging. The other 99% can be played completely solo with only your face rolling over the keyboard.. 
---
I suppose skinning is a supplement to greens on the AH.
---
I too love farms.
---
The food is probably great in TB. Although I'm sure if you're looking for good meat, Orgrimmar is the place to be. :D
---
All those crab legs! :D
---
they would want the priest to serve as pocket healer as they push to get R14 for their warrior
---
What the fuck really?!
---
On a pvp server you are the predator or the pray. I foresee alot of whining from mice who thought they were lions in the future (lions hunt in packs btw). Just make an informed decision because there will be zero sympathy for you if you whine about being ganked on a pvp server.
---
That guy Tittmaster who took a detour to gank you after you escorted that f-ing turtle almost all the way across the Tanaris desert is not ”harassing” you. He’s is however getting his jollies at your expense and if you have a problem with that then deal with him.
---
I wish Tittmaster all the best on his wacky future adventures. I might even have a giggle watching his pvp video from the safety of my carebear pve server. But yeah, I’ll way over there...
---
Lakeshire - Probably a very boring pick but it looks cozy. Although its probably one of the more hostile zones with orcs and gnolls being 2 feet up the ridge.
---
Auchinduon
---
I agree. 
---
So much said here on /r/classicwow and over on /r/wow is just hyperbolic nonsense. There's no evidence one way or the other, so everyone is just ranting about their feelings on the matters at hand. 
---
You really should get good at or find macros for battle&gt;mocking blow, berserk&gt;intercept and berserk&gt;berserk rage. 
---
Your mocking blow is like a taunt button for all the times your taunt button fails you or has too much cd left. 
---
Intercept to get to a loose mob, or as a slower second interrupt that doesn't share the bash-pummel cd. 
---
Darnassus is where you go when you feel like going on an agonizingly long journey to someplace you dont really care for.
---
That's how raiding WAS in vanilla. I'm sure that mentality won't be the same going into it now. 
---
On my hunter in Redridge dueling a buddy of mine I managed to move the auto-shot ability off my bar because I thought clicking it faster would make me shoot faster so it slid off my bar during the clicking frenzy.
---
Next duel I could not shoot him so I just meleed. My buddy said " why tf are you melee-ing?"  I said " I can't find my shoot button" he says "well move the shoot icon back onto your bars". Somehow i moved the bow that I had equiped onto my bar instead of the ability. So for the next couple days I was only melee-ing until I finally figured where my mistake was.
---
Thanks man! I deleted my post so as not to distract from the conversation.
---
Honestly, you should be doing ot most of the time as you get more rage with Berserker rage active. You also stance dance to use Intercept, Mocking Blow and other abilities not avilable in def stance.
---
&gt; Until 2.0 prepatch came, then people started to kind of care again in prep for tbc.
---
That'd be even scarier that you're so wrong about why people stopped playing during 1.12 because 2.0 was literally just around the corner, but you are convinced it has to do with XRBGs. But hey, keep pushing that agenda.
---
For stuns, there’s 3 DR categories:
---
*Controlled stuns (Cheap Shot, Concussion Blow, Charge)
---
* Non-controlled stuns (Mace stuns, Blackouf from spriests)
---
* Kidney Shot
---
AFAIK DR window is 15s after the effect ends.
---
XRBGs are part of why I stopped paying WoW to begin with. The best part of BGs was constantly seeing the same people on the other team.
---
As long as you use keybinds stance dancing is a very easy natural thing, like changing druid forms, switching hunter auras, shaman totem or whatever. I think all the hate it gets is just from people who click which makes doing a few actions in a row stressful when you also have to worry about movement/targeting etc.
---
uhh why?  
---
Man you’re so right, WoW would be so much more fun if before character creation everyone had to look up the best class / race / profession combinations, then make sure they followed a preset talent tree, and only went after specific BiS gear; all so they could satisfy people like you in pug 5 mans+! If you’ve been having fun playing an obscure class combo ladies and gentlemen, reroll and repent your sins! 
---
You're beyond insane if you don't think the Nighthold DK set is fucking great.
---
And they were why I kept playing.
---
Gotcha. This may not be evident when the term “DKP” is thrown around but in my experience there has always been mechanisms for DKP to be awarded outside of killing bosses. Mainly being on time (early) for raids, guild consumes, and progression (time spent wiping on new content)
---
With proper powershifting (and the mana to back it up) wolfshead rules. 
---
It still did during whole tbc for kitties.
---
Coo. I've been trying out most classes to get a feel for the game once again. I'm often on Patsi, Howlerone or Helldiver
---
Uhh MC&amp;BWL were really simple in vanilla too tho lol 
---
The only people who will struggle with these raids are people who bring rets and boomkins 
---
If that’s your thing then cool but I’d rather get outta MC ASAP, respec, and go PVP then sit around wiping on Vael over and over because the tank is out DPSing multiple DPS 
---
You playing on pservers currently?
---
Because psychotic mutterings are usually a sign that counseling is necessary. The other gear isn't sentient, and so probably doesn't need counseling. 
---
30-40 is my point as well. 
---
You get some of your class defining skills here that makes ALL the difference imo.
---
For me it was shaman. I was deadass bored of it by 29 but when I hit around 32 or 34 and got chain lightning I fell in love, and I think windfury around this level too!
---
Then keep playing retail. What the fuck are you even arguing here?
---
Back in vanilla I did have the fortune of being on the faction with queue times, but I've since played on one private server. This one had 25-50 minute queues, yet it was also the first time I actually enjoyed BG's since cross-realm BG's were introduced. I really did not mind the queue times if it meant playing with and against people that I had an actual connection with.
---
I acknowledge that there are servers that were even worse off than 50 minute queues though, but I would strongly recommend for solutions to problematic servers to be done on a case-per-case basis. For example, a realm with 3k horde and 1k alliance can just be paired with a realm with 1k horde and 3k alliance. In such a pairing scenario, you would actually be able to become acquainted with the players of other servers, as the size of the "battlegroup" is still limited. Back when cross-realm BG's were originally introduced, the majority of battlegroups were around 12 to 15 servers. That was simply far too much for any community to form at all.
---
Cross-realm battlegroups should be done carefully and as limited as possible, not the jackhammer approach that was used back in retail. I'm sure that to Blizzard the jackhammer is preferable. The larger the group, the more likely it is to remain balanced. But such an approach simply leaves no room for the community.
---
But actually it probably won't make that big of a difference one way or another.
---
Why 21? Don't new spells/abilities come at even levels?
---
AoE grinding without dynamic respawn is going to be rough though.
---
This ain’t it chief 
---
The bonus is if you go to 35 you will be able to slap some crafting professions on them and make bank selling transmutes or cooldowns
---
&gt; Open world is for casual players, and that is why I don't understand why casual players don't enjoy retail.
---
Because retail is a shitty ARPG disguised as an MMO. The story is absolute horrible dogshit, and getting invested in the world is nearly impossible.
---
99% of the game is mythic + and raiding... leveling and open world is just a small portion of the game that is done in vanilla and retail within a month.
---
Or I don’t want to stress about such a minute detail that will not end up mattering whatsoever in 40 man raids? Or that I don’t mind people having control over aspects of their character in an MMO, that once again, wont end up mattering much? Next are you going to tell me I should have made my orc bald and beardless so he’s more aerodynamic?
---
Why not have blizz remove all race combinations and talent trees YOU deem inefficient, I’m sure everyone on this sub whose annoyed at current retail pruning would be fine with that.
---
As a night elf im conflicted between rogue and shadow priest, does anyone have any insight that might help me choose?
---
Loch Modan 
---
It clearly wasn’t fluff because you are STILL misquoting my argument even after the correction and English lesson. No where did I say or imply the game is all raiding. I said instead of mechanical difficulty they used stat checking and listed current raiding and mythic+ as examples of mechanical difficulty that classic listed. No where does that say the game is all raiding.
---
 No, it’s not about raiding. Name ONE piece of content in vanilla that is **mechanically** challenging instead of a stat check? Especially compared to retail? It’s not raiding. It’s not dungeons. It’s not PvP. It’s not leveling. It’s not anything. There is not a single piece of content that is mechanically intensive in vanilla. 
---
Then you introduce YET ANOTHER strawman fallacy implying I am arguing you should be able to blaze through everything. No, that’s not at all what I said or implied. I said, that time shouldn’t be where your difficulty is. Time is a side of effect of true difficulty not the cause of it. If something takes a long time, it needs to be because it’s difficult. Not difficult because it takes a long time.
---
Then there’s the implication that I do M+. What do you know, wrong again. It’s almost like when your entire argument is full of logical errors, jumped conclusions, and no solid foundation, it’s blatantly false. Gg.

&lt;Nostalgia&gt; | Server: NA-PvP | Faction: Alliance
---
Introduction:
---
We are a casual raiding guild built from a core of WoW veterans. Many of our members have been playing since the beginning, and we can't wait to relive the best era of WoW. Our leadership has previously led other guilds to great successes, and have raided at an extremely high level in retail. As adults, we no longer have the spare time we once had, so this guild is being built for the average gaming adult that cannot commit to a hardcore schedule. However, while competing with the best guilds in the world is unlikely, we are still extremely skilled gamers that want to clear content at a reasonable rate and be as efficient with our time as possible. If you're an adult, have a limited schedule, and are good a video games, then this is the guild for you.
---
Expectations:
---
We expect that all members put in the work that is necessary in learning their classes, and understanding all raid encounters prior to entering the raid. While we are not a hardcore guild, we still expect every member of the raid to preform well above average and come to all raids with the appropriate enchants, consumables, etc.. We are a close knit diverse guild with members spanning all across North America and we expect that new members only add to our already friendly community. All members must be respectful to others and work towards helping the guild rather then hurting it. No member is better then another. We are a team, and any bullshit will be handled with a gkick.
---
Looking For:
---
We are currently looking for players of any class that are willing to put in the necessary time to perform at a level our guild expects. We care less about how long it is going to take for you to level to 60 or how much experience you have in the classic raids, and more about your dedication to being the best that you can be. In terms of particular classes, our preference would certainly be to recruit the most optimal class/spec for the role; however, we are much more concerned with the player behind the class and will take the less wanted specs into consideration, yes even ret. It's important to note that this is a fresh guild that is also looking to add to our officer core. We are looking for experienced leadership members that can bring unique ideas and help our guild towards the goal of clearing Naxx.
---
Looting Policies:
---
We will be using a fair and transparent loot council system for all 40man raids. A set number of individuals from within the guild leadership team will take on the role of the council. The council will distribute the loot based on the following factors:
---
1. Role Priorities
---
2. Main Item Role
---
3. Upgrade Size
---
4. Future Needs
---
5. Member Contribution
---
Raid Schedule:
---
Friday - 6:00pm to 9:00pm PST
---
Sunday - 5:00pm to 7:00pm PST
---
We are still in the process of setting raid times; however, we have committed to Friday as our main raid, and Sunday as a spare day during progression. It's very likely that we will select evening hours for each raid day.
---
If you are interested in joining the guild, please use the following link to join our discord channel. Upon joining, please speak with myself through PM's to become a Member of the guild. All Members of the guild will be given a ginvite shortly after the guild is officially created, and hopeful raiders will be promoted to Raider upon reaching level 60 and all necessary raid atonements are met.

Cross realm battlegrounds are a good thing and Blizzard were right to add them. The problem they were designed to solve will need solving again in Classic, since it's a recreation of the old game. I don't want to spend my evening doing nothing for 40 minutes while waiting for a queue to pop. This is not fun. I don't want to face the same premade every time and lose over and over, cause that's the only team queuing on the other faction. This is not fun. I don't want to be forced to abandon my character and re-roll on a high population realm, cause there are no battlegrounds happening on mine. This is not fun. Cross realm battlegrounds are a vanilla feature, and if they are basing things on 1.12, then they should be in the game.
---
What forums allow naming and shaming?
---
&gt; These people are being carried by 30+ people in BIS gear on private servers. It is not at all exemplary of what Classic will be like for the first 2-3 years. 
---
I'm talking about people relating their Vanilla experience. You know, the game that first was there, before private servers?
---
&gt; Frankly, I think Classic will prove me right.  
---
Frankly, I don't think so. But let's talk about that again in 1.5 years !
---
imagine getting that talent...yikes
---
People who rank will just win trade or have multiple people playing their account of both.
---
thisa deserves gold.
---
With sealed bids you only get to put in 1 bid, in private, and it just gets given to whoever bid the highest. So anything you bid, you run the risk of winning the item and getting your own DKP deducted
---
It will, and it terrifies me that comments like these are thrown out without any thoughts behind them what so ever. We get one shot at Classic, every decision should be reflected on.
---
Mythic+ isn't content, it's the same dungeons you've already done fed back to you ad nauseum to fill the void of not actually having anything to do outside of raidlogging or ~~Apexis dailies~~ world quests
---
&gt;I'm talking about people relating their Vanilla experience. You know, the game that first was there, before private servers?
---
Their memories from 12+ years ago, where most players didn't run damage meters or know anything about dps discrepancies?
---
&gt; Frankly, I don't think so. But let's talk about that again in 1.5 years ! 
---
Sounds good. I'll be halfway through Naxx and ret pallies/boomkins will be stuck on Ony or (much more likely) switched to healing.
---
Depending on the class, the gloves and boots of pvp sets give bonuses that might be worth your while that you can't get elsewhere, but their efficacy is really subject to what class/spec you play. BWL weapons will outclass r14 weapons as well.
---
ahaha
---
2 ranks of improved blizzard = things are kitable. Im not sure if its doable at 20, with all green gear etc and no blue gear but i couldnt do it.
---
Oh here we go with this fucking garbage again. Something isn't all perfect lets make a fucking china wall of text on reddit saying "x will RUIN classic".
---
I love the idea of not having CRBGs when they launch.  I think it would be worthwhile to launch BGs as server-only and let them chill for a couple months.  If the community embraces it, then great!  But if queues are too long and most people hate it, then maybe reintroducing the CRBG system would be warranted.
---
It's a fine line to walk between people's desire for a pure experience versus people's expectations of reasonable queue times, and CRBGs were originally implemented for a reason.  Given that took place in Vanilla, I think it's fair game for them to turn back up if the same reason rears it's head.
---
People hate on people who are good. Welcome to life.
---
You're so full of shit we should send you to Africa to fertilize the entire continent.
---
There is no content in this game that is inaccessible to players who don't min-max. Knowing the dungeons and raids and how to fulfil your role is *way* more important than stats fiddling. Even knowing the dungeons isn't really necessary if you know what to do in general and listen to the party leader.
---
You are not harming anyone by not min-maxing. Wipes are not about dps/hps being 1% too low. There's a reason why after slaying a boss for the first time the next week it usually works *much, much* better, and it's not due to the marginal increase in gear over one week.
---
It's not my plan to suck.    So I'll min max.
---
I'm probably gonna roll 3 characters though.   2 alts after I've established my main.
---
I'm gonna play a feral druid alt.     But I'm also gonna do everything in my power to make it the best feral druid it can be.   Theres no point in not looking to upgrade my character.   Who doesnt want to upgrade stuff?     
---
I'll always play on a pvp server, and I'll always go alliance. Good racials are nice, but it feels even better when you absolutely dunk someone who has that kind of edge over you.
---
Depends on the class, but 30-40 generally.  Some classes get defining abilities at 40 like enhance shammys with stormstrike and warriors with mortal strike or bloodthirst.
---
Leveling as Feral is supposedly one of the more convenient leveling experiences, closely tailing Warlocks and Hunters for conventional leveling speed.
---
At 60, you'll probably be welcomed to tank 5 mans, and perhaps off-tank 10s, but as I understand it will have a harder time finding your way into a raid as Feral DPS amongst more serious, progression-oriented guilds.  That said, I kind of get the feeling this time around that people will be more welcoming of subpar specs.  Just don't expect whatever guild that takes you to be bleeding edge and pushing the latest tier of content as fast as the other guys.
---
&gt; and powercreep is exactly why blizzard is re-releasing WoW classic
---
No? They're re-releasing WoW Classic because a majority of players hate their new systems and over-casualisation of everything, most notably LFG and LFR tools that killed community interactions.
---
And guess for what part of the community those systems were created in the first place? Casual players with a 40 hour a week job, a wife and kids who whinned relentlessly for years that they couldn't commit to a raiding schedule. So eventually Blizzard dumbed down raids for these people to experience everything without investing into the game, just because they paid.
---
Which in theory, sounds amazing.
---
In practice, it's a disaster waiting to happen.
---
And it will ALWAYS happen. 
---
If you dont know what class to play, this is what i did: go to a instant level 60 privat server and just try ever class :)
---
You can min-max a lot of things. If you have a lot of free time, /played time might not be a sensible metric.
---
Even if you play in the most relaxed manner and without any guides or plan, breaking out Excel to see which weapon with which spec offers more DPS is definitely min-maxing.
---
Like I didn't farm fucking dungeons to get rep for Naxx or gear for alt specs/new characters the guild needed...
---
Vanilla was not different, if anything retail's endgame has way more to do. All I know is I would much rather farm mythic+ than farming for mats, farming mats is not challenging at all.
---
I'm not 100% sure, but on the freshest Nostalrius-core server launch I believe it was at least partially in greens, if not mostly in greens.
---
I hope a lot of mages level arcane so I can outlevel the ones in my faction and kill the ones in the enemy faction.
---
He didnt specify world content. 
---
If you are planning on raiding as a priest you will have to be a healer more than likely until end game. Rogues are strong DPS but will get out damaged later in the game by mages and warriors.
---
As for PvP, there is almost nothing harder to beat than a geared and skilled shadow priest. Rogues are very strong too but have a higher skill cap due to the combo points, positioning etc.
---
Might have just made it harder for you to choose, sorry!
---
Ah talents, that makes sense. 
---
Imo feral is the best of the meme specs in terms raid viable, they make good OT's and are BIS for vael ;)
---
All attacks that deal damage generate rage.
---
Hence, yes, WF attacks (as long as they hit) will generate rage.
---
And since it's a boost to attack speed, they will generate rage faster.
---
Which also means more rage.
---
No they shouldn’t.
---
100% agree man, vanilla is all gamer dream!
---
Yup had a mage before my shaman and opted not to learn conjure food/water to save some copper. Didnt level past 14 thank god.
---
To be fair the mana ticks 1-10 are high so we are deceived a bit and carry that mentality farther than we should.
---
There won't be anyone to make the sappers for you to buy if you bitch at all of them out of goblin engineering lol
---
Every point you made is sooo wrong lol.
---
“Let’s all play the game like me, because that’s the only possible way to have fun.” That’s all I read from reading your comments.
---
Like wtf?? If I want to play a Gnome rogue I’m going to do it.  If I want to play a feral Druid I’m going to do it.  There is nothing wrong with that and I’ll find a ton of people who are fine with that too.  The OP is asking why people are hating on Min-maxers.....take a look in the mirror, because it’s people like you that are giving them a terrible rep.
---
Exception: aggressive mobs. Shit gets scary fast when those defias pillagers respawn the moment they die :(
---
Supposedly, the fastest Warrior levelers went as fury and abused a bug with a /sit emote and the Blood Craze talent to guarantee being crit and minimize downtime.  I have heard mixed reports on whether that worked or was a pserver only thing, though.
---
For my money, I plan on leveling as Arms for a handful of reasons.  Arms is better for PvP, and Tactical Mastery + Anger Management make rage while leveling and tanking dungeons a lot more sustainable.  Plus I just prefer the playstyle and fat Overpower crits.
---
All in all, either will work for you, especially if leveling with a Mage friend.  Though if you go Fury, I would still stick with a 2-hander, as there is a lack of +hit gear while leveling.
---
Prof-wise, if you want to go Engy at 60 I think Mining/Skinning are the right call.
---
this meme is tearing me apart lol
---
If your loot council gives it to the paladin your guild wont make it passed razergore
---
So you're saying I should roll tauren to avoid lag? +15 herbalism it is, boys!
---
Private servers have done most of this I think. It will be interesting to see if the "discovered" specs stay popular in classic. Like fury warriors seem to have come to the forefront far more than they ever did in vanilla. I can only recall a handful of really top notch fury warriors in vanilla but in private servers they're top end dps and take up 25% of some raids.
---
Realistically, no.  Boring answer, I know, but people have been theorycrafting the hell out of this game for 15 years.  If better ways existed, I think we would know.
---
&gt; That'd be even scarier that you're so wrong about why people stopped playing during 1.12 because 2.0 was literally just around the corner, but you are convinced it has to do with XRBGs.
---
??? I'm honestly at a loss of words. I have no idea what you're trying to get at or convey at this point lol. Jfc you're dense. I guess we're done here since you refuse to use a minute amount of brainpower to have a discussion or to comprehend what we are attempting to discuss. 
---
So let's just do this. You can continue to think sharding and crbgs are the way to fix server balance issues for vanilla wow, lmao, and I'll continue to think sharding should never be in vanilla wow and crbgs shouldn't be added until at the earliest phase 6. Asking for crbgs before phase 6 or later, is like advocating for Naxx to be out at launch, fwiw.
---
What is 1%? How do you estimate it? Are you using number from wowprogress?
---
I dont hate them, just dislike the mentality. BIS guides are great but other than that I just like to scoot around semi aimlessly enjoying the ride.
---
You can still have fun and not be a dipshit. If your girl does wiping 400 times in black wing  I think that’s a guild problem
---
"Taste my judgement of the...!"
---
*Rocket Boots Explode*
---
WF is one of the reasons dps warriors scaled to the moon.
---
Used SK in vanilla - wrath and plan to use it in classic. Find it far less cumbersome than DKP.
---
actually playing the game &gt; queue simulator 
---
Ah, you must have missed the memo. In this subreddit you absolutely have to call out people having fun in a different way than yours (remember, min-maxing is **WRONG**) and it's absolutely okay to be selfish because nobody can tell you how to play in a cooperative game.
---
If they kick you for being a drag they certainly were unemployed sweaty virgins and you should immediately report your bad experience here in the subreddit for support. Only by being very vocal about this issue can we ensure people stop playing the game **WRONG** and only play the way **I want**.
---
&gt; It's like a rage injection totem
---
Are you telling me Shaman was always  the drug dealer class?
---
No. That's just what you interpret into it. You don't know if someone uploads something out of ill intent or benevolence. I find it a bit weird that you're bad mouthing people for uploading spreadsheets and whatnot that take quite a while to create (counting in the effort to calculate everything).
---
I highly doubt that these people do it out of malicious intent. When I wrote guides for LoL and For Honor back in the days, I didn't do it because I wanted to educate some plebs, I just did it because I thought people would be interested in it.
---
What's actually toxic is that people are trying to demonize the "other side" because they're apparently trying to destroy a game. They're not. Nor are they necessarily doing it to look down on others.
---
There are toxic ones on each side for sure, though. I guarantee you, for every toxic elitist min-maxer you get one "Atleast-I-have-a-life" and/or "Wow you're wasting your time trying to be good at a game lawl" guy.
---
It's hypocritical to tell people to let players play how they want, but also tell people to not min-max because apparently its breaking the game.
---
The same kind of dilemma you see in RTS games. You have the players who will tell you you're lame for "rushing" and attacking before minute 40, and then the kind of players who learn build orders because they want to get better at the game because losing isn't really that fun for them.
---
For dps feral is a weak spec in both 5mans and pvp. You have no aoe or and poor CC for 5 mans and you'll burn through mana fast if you're powershifting. The good thing is that 5 mans are easy enough it doesn't matter too much.   
---
PvP on the other hand if you're mindset is feral dps you're in for a really bad time. Feral is mainly a kiter/healer in pvp. You can very slowly wear people down with maul and moonfire, but you're never going to be dps'ing people down in cat unless you completely outgear them.
---
Yea, for sure, a problem like the guild accepting dozens of ret pallies.
---
I’m not expert on the honor grind from vanilla, even though I did PvP a lot at the time. Didn’t most groups who farmed honor focus mostly on AB and WG because they were faster to win, and therefor you would gain more honor from winning a match than simply wracking up kills? I believe this was the reason anyways. 
---
Perhaps the answer is the encourage those grinding honor to go the the other BGs by offering up double honor weekends like they used to for AB and WG, but avoid them for AV, thus potentially decreasing the number of people looking to solely honor grind from going to AV while allowing those people less likely to Zerg to continue to enjoy it for what is was in the beginning. I no it’s not an ideal option, but just a thought.
---
I played Alliance back in the day so I never experienced the bridge issue. The only answer I can think of reasonably are either reduce the damage of the archers, or perhaps widening the bridge itself....
---
In the end it doesn’t really matter, cause you Horde punks aren’t gonna get past us anyways! ;-)
---
May not be the guild for you
---
This is a really great post. I agree 100% with everything you said. Just this month I tried vanilla wow for the first time (on a private server) since i played vanilla wow waaay back from 2004-2006. I am having a BLAST, and every moment i'm logged out of that private vanilla server, i keep thinking about what i'm going to do when i finally get a chance to log back in. It is so fucking fun!
---
Other than this situation, only auto-attacks generate rage.
---
&gt; 99% of the game is mythic + and raiding
---
Of all the content in the game? No, it's about 1% of the entirely of the game. 
---
Because min maxers tend to think if you don't have that .05% dmg increase, it's like not even having preraid bis.  
---
Tends to just be their elitist personalities that turn people off.
---
Never met a min maxer who played on average 30mins a day. That sounds made up. Every minmaxer i've ever seen raided, or wanted to raid, and played quite a bit.
---
Reading quest text and min-maxing are opposing ideas. Min-maxing when levelling = don't read quest text. That's like saying you can play an un-optimal spec and min-max - not really.
---
The issue is when you're doing a dungeon or whatever and everyone wants to skip the optional bosses, or they don't wanna do the escort quest or whatever. Fair points, but over time it just creates a bad culture that's not very fun.
---
Personally I'll play classic for the social aspect - meeting people and having fun with them in pvp and pve.
---
I do wonder though what kind of effect streamers and content creators will have on the game this time around. 
---
Most of them aren't casuals, and I'm not sure they'd have an audience if they were. 
---
And since they talk a lot about minmaxing and optimizing... I wonder what kind of effect it would have on their audience. Will people think that that's the only "right" way to play the game ?
---
I min-max and I look down on those who don’t. 
---
That doesn’t mean I think people should play more hours, it means you should know what your best stat weight is and select it when you have a socket opportunity.
---
It doesn’t mean I don’t think people should play weaker specs, it just means that they should still make every effort to play them well.
---
It’s about respect for other people’s time. If I join a group in a raid or dungeon, I expect the other people on the team to be trying to succeed. If we fail, it should be because one of the people just doesn’t give a shit.
---
Nothing worse than the 4 percent raid boss wipe and then you look at logs to see no DPS used a pot. Playing casual and playing stupid isn’t the same thing.
---
&gt; they should add arena and give it tbc drs so there can be “some” competitiveness
---
no thanks there are enough competitive games around
---
At least you don't have the memory of a murloc.
---
DR resets after between 15 and 20 seconds because the server did the check for DR once every five seconds.
---
The only way is if private servers were massively wrong on a mechanic or two, but I’m worried of the opposite, of private servers being generous to a few specs (like Druid or Paladin) and them actually being worse than we think now.
---
Odds are we won't run into this issue of not getting queues, since there probably won't be a ton of servers to split the population like there was in retail vanilla.
---
Using your arguments logic, Naxx is also a vanilla feature, so it should be in the game at launch too.
---
I'm all for the addition of crbgs WAY later down the line post phase 6, but not before. It kills the vanilla experience and it kills the community, most importantly.
---
Ok thats what i was thinking of. having a bank alt with cheetah would be good.
---
The margin for error in a pug is often smaller, so you may as well go in prepared.
---
*YOOOOOOOOOO!!!!* It's your **5th Cakeday** swe93! ^(hug)
---
Same! Need more of these
---
I'm not playing in a guild with loot council. I want the vanilla experience, therefor whatever community I join will be using DKP! 
---
reddit easily would and there are forums beyond just the wow official one.
---
I like having to carry ammo and feeding my pet. Preparing before you go on an adventure makes the adventure even more immersive.
---
I love when casuals complain about a known grind lol
---
I agree that small battlegroups would be workable; especially given the fact that there won't be near as many active players. 
---
You're used to running with 20 people, max. And being able to do LFR/Normal/Heroic/Mythic. Good luck getting at least 20 new-to-you raiders to trust you enough to run loot council for their one clear of the week. 
---
I ranked to 13 and didn't win trade. I also didn't have other people playing my account. I also had a life outside of WoW in the form of obtaining a MSc and working 35hours. Believe it or not, I also had time to do other things like watch movies and play sports. My last week of ranking required a bit over 1mil honor, fwiw.
---
I also think some aspects resistances will be far worse than the expectations of private server theory crafting. But that's a vastly different topic, but related.
---
Eh, I think we just disagree on the definition then.  Min-maxing, to mean, applies exclusively to talent points and gear -- things that have definitive, mathematical answers.  "Rushing" isn't the same as min-maxing.  You could certainly apply a "mix-max" mindset to other concepts, but at a certain point it becomes so vague as to lose all it's meaning... what if I want to "min-max my fun" by leveling with a 0/0/0 spec and punching things to death?  Am I a min-maxer?
---
It makes the most sense when it applies to things that can have discrete equations applied to them.  And while you can certainly optimize leveling speed, it's not a solved equation.
---
Actually yea, if you're *demanding* someone play a certain way, that it just wrong.
---
Like sure if you're in the guild &lt;try hard minmaxers&gt; then you can invite whoever you want, but if you're grouping with strangers or people outside your guild (aka 90% of the game) then demanding they do things a certain way is arrogant.
---
Acting like a teamplayer includes accepting how others want to play.
---
This is a big one I don't see a lot of discussion about. The hate being based on jealousy or envy. You see this manifested a lot in TCGs in the form of people complaining about netdeckers, or people winning "only because they have money for the good cards".
---
A lot of it comes down to things like players being passed up on a raid spot for someone who is more of a min-maxer, and those passed up players taking it way too personally.
---
As someone who never played BGs on private servers and did so in vanilla: Cross-Realm BGs saved BGs, and the people who loudly complained back then have a similar mindset and narrow perspective as the people who do so today.
---
Prior to XBGs, I was almost unable to play any BGs. I would sometimes wait full evenings for BGs to start. Of course I could do other things in that time, but not other fun things. Can't leave a dungeon group hanging to play some AB, can I?
---
There was of course WSG, which had queues of &lt;30 minutes, but was utterly dominated by few groups. These people like to reminisce about "knowing their enemies and rivals" and blame that no longer happening on XBGs. They are partly right. With long wait times, few casual players played and with that, curbstomping became a problem, which in turn lead to fewer people playing. WSG before 1.12 was just a quick guaranteed 3 minute loss against some high-ranked group, why even bother?
---
Now, I can understand that argument about the PVP rank system sucking. However, eliminating XBGs to make it suck less is not a solution. That's like getting shot in the foot and then shooting the other foot on purpose to hobble along more evenly.
---
“That's why I'm coming back.  To experience the **living world** again, and actually interact with players to accomplish goals.”
---
Currently no, been a little over a year since I have. Been trying to just wait till release so I'm full go into it. Been prepping by reading and watching guides and info on YouTube to stay engaged until release
---
I feel like this subreddit is going to war about this at some point.
---
I made the comparison in another thread already but man this is so reminiscent of the two kinds of players in RTS games:  
---
The guy who just plays casually and doesn't really care about floating resources and just wants big battles and cool cities   
---
vs  
---
The guy who learns build orders and how to be efficient with your economy.  
---
First group will call out the second for being "tryhard" the moment they see aggression before minute 40, and the second group will be like "?? I'm just playing the game."
---
The fix is surprisingly easy. Let others play how they want. You don't have to interact with the min-maxers if you think it's unfun. 
---
In an RTS: Look for a lobby that suits your needs.  
---
In WoW  : Look for a guild (and friends) that suits your playstyle.
---
It's actually that simple.
---
&gt;Imagine the outcry if ret officer would loot council accuria to himself VS. ret officer wins it transparently with DKP. The more preferable option is clear here.
---
If they have the dkp, no. Loot councils do not work for 40 players with one clear a week unless it's a cutting edge guild. Guess what? There's no cutting edge content in vanilla :) 
---
&gt;Using your arguments logic, Naxx is also a vanilla feature, so it should be in the game at launch too.
---
Where is this talking point coming from? Every opponent of XRBGs uses this regardless of the argument they are refuting. Battlegrounds aren't even coming at launch. 
---
Sit proccing only works on private servers, it was patched out by blizzard in vanilla, although I can't remember which patch.
---
Worst case is they are +/- 20% off actual DPS numbers globally.
---
In which case, that still lends hybrid classes like the paladin still being grossly behind other DPS like Warriors, locks and mages.
---
Resistances on bosses and mobs may play into say a hunters favor by doing phyiscal damage, being slightly better in a 1:1 comparison, but not so much better. Just better than they are comparatively in private servers.
---
&gt; I PvPed for ~2 years with no cross-server BGs and knowing who everyone on my team and the enemies was so nice. Seeing these same people out in the world was so damn cool.
---
Did you consider that knowing everyone means that extremely few people played?
---
I guarantee you that back in 2004-2006, I did raid content with literally every spec. That purple buffet table was once the Mage 31 point Arcane talent, right? We had one of those in MC. That healing well that used to be the 31 point discipline priest talent? I’ve used one of those. I main tanked ZG arms spec. Just because it’s less optimal doesn’t mean it can’t work. We don’t need to down MC bosses in 20 seconds, because the fun comes from the people not the mechanics. 
---
I mean what else do we call people who read levelling guides and have their entire route planned out? I thought that is a quite clear case of min/maxing.
---
I don't know, i feel like min/maxing the levelling part of the game is extremely common, and is a big part of the issue that some of us have with this way of playing.
---
I have no problem with people who don't min-max and play the game casually, but you are incorrect in saying you can play the game 30 minutes a day and still min-max. Vanilla @ 30 minutes per day is not min-max...that's super casual. 
---
Please don't confuse wearing a few pre-bis items and using a couple consumes as min-maxing because it isn't. You can also put a ton of time into the game (40+ hours a week) and have fun with others. 40+ hours doesn't automatically make someone a sweaty-neckbearded-jerk. Sweaty and neckbearded maybe, but you can play a lot and still not be a jerk.
---
If you don't want 1.12 then perhaps you should go play on a private server instead of trying to force your changes on everyone else 
---
How would a queue system do? Like alter the queue system they already have, but if a faction starts to outbalance the other by like 65/35, then throw the dominant faction into a small queue while the lesser faction gets to bypass it, until it sorta re-balances toward 50/50.
---
Well ok sure, but there isnt all that much world content in vanilla if you ignore raids, dungeons and pvp
---
A blizzard casting aoe mage is a low effort aoe mage :/
---
Fair enough, I think what I'll be doing for now is just compile a list of interested people. Then once the server list is released, I'll shoot out messages to everyone and we can decide if we wanna guild up on the same server. 
---
Those that are on pservers currently I may play with a bit, but we likely won't all be the same levels. 
---
This may sound strange, but I believe minus hardcore raiding (5%? Of the game...) that vanilla is a more casual friendly game than retail.
---
You can go at your own pace, and not be so worried about catching up to the pack like the rat race that is retail.
---
Most of the game is out in the world at your own pace.
---
As for group time commitments, I personally park my toons when they NEED to run something and play another toon/game if I don’t have the time right now.
---
I've always played pvp servers, pve bores me to death. I just find it funny when people say they always attack the enemy faction when in the actual game suddenly people only attack when they know they can win. I mean it's perfectly logical, only a complete idiot would attack someone 7 levels higher than them or try and fight 3 enemies at once so of course no one does that (except sometimes for lolz).  
---
I just always see these comments by h4rdc0re pvp'ers but then suddenly when they're in STV at lvl 32 all they care about is getting 2 more troll mojo and aren't so interested in attacking the lvl 38 horde.
---
That's insane, I spend way more time in mythic + and raids than open world.
---
Even in Vanilla I was farming honor, or in dungeons. The only time I was in the open world was for some PVP or farming gold. Guess what? That's what is going on in retail now with War Mode and farming.
---
Way more to do, like Mythic+ which is just dungeons plus affixes, and.... raids? You're not even trying to make a point, you're just being defensive over retail for the sake of it. There obviously isn't "way more to do" in retail's endgame if you can't think of anything beyond dungeons and raids.
---
Once you get to level 110 and you are instantly in "endgame," where you either farm dungeons you've already done or run one of four versions of the single relevant raid from that patch. Obviously the other raids are worthless cause you get better gear from catch-up quests, as is tradition at this point. And that's it, yes? No 'just for fun' reputations like vanilla or BC, no class quests, no attunements. How is that "way more?"
---
All of this shit has been hotly debated in every channel of retail Wow discussion for months, you know these things.
---
Perhaps you should read up what Blizzard themselves have said. They use 1.12 as a base, that doesn’t mean changing stuff to earlier versions can’t occur. X realm BGs was a part of vanilla for a VERY small period of time.
---
Think you're responding to the wrong guy, bud.  I agree!
---
So find some other like minded people who don't care about the spreadsheets and play with them?
---
I miss the noobs on the Christmas free trial 
---
5 months isn't a short time.
---
If a hunter wants a sword for AP for PvE and a warrior wants a sword for PvP, people invested in PvE aren't going to get upset for the warrior having to wait for the next drop.
---
Feral PvP is good, your DPS is low because you kinda want to sacrifice your bis DPS gear for a bit of int. If you play like a rogue or a warrior you will lose. You need to shift, use your mobility, use everything you have available to you. Open in cat, Tank them in bear, be ready to stun/root to heal, Starfire/faerie etc. This all costs alot of mana. The skill ceiling for druid PvP is really high.
---
For pve, you can tank anything up to 40mans no problem, for feral cat just power shift as much as your mana will allow. Carrying a healing set is always nice.
---
Druids are the best hybrids, if you want to be a good player, be prepared to cover any role. Leveling up you can tank very well, healing is ok, DPS is fine. 
---
If you are seriously into pve and want to progress, you're going to want to find a spec that your guild needs, if you are tanking alot, then you need a build that goes well into feral tanking while still being able to powershift for when you kitty DPS.
---
If you want to pull your weight as a kitty, you need to power shift and do it efficiently, farm some crowd Pummelers from gnomer and get the level 40 crafted helm.
---
The list is strictly for PvE and for "viable" speccs. If you'd like me to add a PvE ret BiS list, I wouldn't mind - it would be entirely up to you to hook me up with proper research and items though! ;-)
---
Weird to me that nobody mentions playing as a rogue while I am sure 99% of us have memories of getting cut to bits by rogues.   With that said, don’t play rogue.  There are too many of us...er, I mean, of THEM already.  
---
Because you guys say, definitively, "... crbgs were in vanilla!!... and if they are basing things on 1.12, then it should be in the game!!"
---
Yes. Crbgs were in the game. But not until 1.12, the patch after Naxx. So if we do get crbgs, then it needs to come AFTER phase 6, not before. If it comes beforehand, then it will ruin the vanilla experience, and won't be true to vanilla in the first place.
---
So saying crbgs should be in classic from the start, would be like saying naxx should be in the game from the start. It's the same idea, just two different pieces of content.
---
I leveled a Druid in vanilla and I honestly think it’s the single most fun class to level. The class feels FAR more fleshed out than any other class save perhaps warlock. That doesn’t mean that it’s balanced, it’s not, the hybrid tax is real. But you get your own zone dedicated to your class even! That’s amazing (moonglade). Plus the class quests. And honestly, aquatic form is AWESOME. 
---
Not only that, but you feel like a god in WSG once you’ve got feline swiftness. If you develop a bit of a reputation there, it becomes not uncommon for people to /salute you and refer to you as “sir”. (I’m serious, that’s actually my experience in the 29 and 39 bracket in vanilla. This was pre-Cross Realm BGs so your results may vary.)
---
It’s honestly taking all my willpower to not roll Druid again, it’s so fun, but I fell in love with healing and so am going priest this time.  
---
I'm hope they release a list of bannable offences, cuz honestly idk what is and isn't allowed.
---
&gt;If I have a 40 hour a week job, a wife, and kids
---
Same here, that's exactly why I'll join (or create if I cant find) a GamerDadsAndMoms type guild so we don't see the min-maxers and can all take our time, play any spec we want, and understand if someone needs to drop urgently for family stuff. If we don't beat some raids for a long time (or even dont raid) that's fine by me.
---
I'll still play Retail too, more than Classic, simply because it caters to us casuals/altoholics better.
---
As a classic veteran, I can assure you that not only do you not have to no-life the game to progress, but it was never necessary even back then.  It will be even easier today.  Many of us older fans who played back then have full time jobs and families to feed now, and we're probably underrepresented in this subreddit.
---
I think the impression that you get by reading stuff on this subreddit is too biased toward hardcore because of the hype and some of us thinking "If I knew then what I know now, I could've got High Warlord, cleared Naxx, etc before that era was gone for good".  Back then had a smaller window of time to do those things.
---
There is no indication that the era of this game will ever be "gone for good".  It's likely they will launch fresh servers as well, if the launch comes at a bad time for you to keep up with the phase timeline to do content when it is the most challenging and relevant.  Don't feel pressured to neglect your responsibilities.
---
The 30 minute thing was perhaps too extreme of an example.  But the point I was trying to make is that you can min-max your gear choices and talent spec without being a hardcore raider.
---
I don't care what people upload or do themselves. I specifically made the point that I don't like when people bring it up in game.
---
"This sword is BiS for me and not for the paladin, so I should get it". That's what i hate. Or the "we shouldn't do this quest it's not optimal". Or how people refuse to play with people with "bad" specs or gear.
---
And yea, I think almost every RTS player dislikes cheesing for example. A perfectly legimate strategy, but not fun to play against.
---
&gt; You are not harming anyone by not min-maxing.
---
You're harming literally everyone you group with, so that's simply objectively wrong.
---
You can clear mc, BWL and ony in 2 nights, but then ZG gets released and you’re doing that twice a week to farm rep for the enchants. Then AQ is released and you have to split time between learning the fights/trash in AQ versus bindings runs and BWL which has a number of bis gear, while still doing ZG. 
---
Even if it was a 2 night clear, you probably would still need 1 more night to farm consumables.
---
This is my experience playing on a private server  
---
Arena in the sense of queueing up for a pvp arena didn't exist until TBC. There are a couple of arenas in vanilla tho. Stranglethorn Vale has a gurubashi arena that spawns a loot chest every 4 hours I THINK (can't remember specifically) Which gives a trinket which starts a quest for an upgraded version of that trinket. There was also the Dire Maul arena where rare mobs spawned. Both of these arenas were free for all pvp areas.
---
Where you spend your time has no relevance on my statement. 
---
&gt;Srcane explosion + Mana shield works smoother for farming than blizzard etc.
---
doggy doggy what now?
---
&gt; take a look in the mirror, because it’s people like you that are giving them a terrible rep.
---
So, what you're saying is people hate minmaxers because they're not okay with others being narcisistic assholes?
---
or the guild for BWL
---
Any serious guild will be using loot council.
---
Theoretically hardcore guilds will spend less time playing because they down raids quicker, in practice that never happens. You'll have to spend more time acquiring consumables and world buffs to keep up, doing other easier raids to acquire BiS gear, race to 60 to get a spot in the top guilds, run tons of dungeons to get pre-raid BiS, etc. 
---
If you actually want to play with a limited time investment, you'll need to approach the game less competitively. If you care too much you'll spend more time than you intended. 
---
It's indirectly already begun with the LFG Monday threads: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2glcl/looking_for_group_monday_march_18_2019/
---
&gt; Or I don’t want to stress about such a minute detail that will not end up mattering whatsoever in 40 man raids?
---
Well, you say that it doesn't matter, but that's objectively not true, but lets go with it... why does it matter what race or talents you play?
---
What the hell do you believe the endgame of vanilla was? It was rep-grind(which did take longer than retail), dungeon farming for gear(same as retail except way more interesting dungeons and harder.), pvp which was literally just a grind and time investment in vanilla(in retail it's about skill), and raids which in vanilla were much easier.
---
Look I love both vanilla and retail, I'm not here asking for changes or anything, I just don't understand the hate for retail.
---
I would say warriors and priests. I think both accomplished what the devs had in mind for them to do. DPS had s omg way to go as none of them had thought out rotations in Vanilla.
---
Why are you so toxic?
---
I believe the UP TO qualifier you're referring to was used because spells had their own spell damage coefficient. So if your firebolt had a 100% coefficient, and you had +10 to spell damage from gear, then you would do +10 extra spell damage. The up to comes in when you have a coefficient less than 100%. so if you have a piece giving you up to 10 spell damge, and a coefficient of 50%, you would do 5 extra spell damage, hence the UP TO.
---
Can you explain that to me
---
&gt; but if you're grouping with strangers or people outside your guild (aka 90% of the game) then demanding they accept you're slacking is arrogant and narcissistic.
---
ftfy.
---
How?
---
Again: there is no content in this game that you can beat with min-maxing but not without. I literally *never* wiped on, say, Baron Rivendare because we lacked 1% DPS or even 10% HPS. That's not a thing. I wiped because people didn't know the door shuts, pulled early, aggroed early, or because the healer didn't know what the five second rule is.
---
When you know the mechanics, you can beat most non-raid content in greens.
---
So, how is a 1% or even a 5% decrease in DPS harming the group? Do all players need to read guides and build spreadsheets so we avoid a single drinking pause over an hour of dungeon running?
---
excellent
---
Could I be that alt?   I need a gold funneler 
---
Wanting people to be considerate towards each other is toxic?
---
Like what?
---
Are you actually claiming you've never killed a boss faster because people did more damage?
---
You're absolutely right. It's so easy to surround yourself with like-minded people in an MMO and only ever play with your friends and guild. I don't understand where this "hate the min-maxers" trend comes from tbh.
---
A PvE Ret BiS list would be great! Honestly, I don't know where to begin. I always thought shadowpanther.net was inspirational, and this list is reminding me of that website. But I don't have the data to back up best in slot items for PvP/PvE or theorycrafting.
---
if you find a want like that at a level close to 60, you've just secured your epic mount funding lol.
---
Agree with this 100%. I recently got into private server play, and in like 2 weeks, I got into a guild, I started doing guild runs. I was one of 3 prot warriors, so I was constantly getting shame if I wanted to log off because they needed more tanks. I became a guild officer, and suddenly I was playing 30-40 hours a week when we started raiding. For raiding guilds we were relatively casual, one night a week for UBRS runs, and two nights a week for MC, but I had to farm rep, professions. I tried to run AV, but for horde, that server was auto-lose. I farmed up +def crafted cloaks for all three of our tanks. I farmed up coin to buy Stonegrip Gauntlets, Julie’s Dagger, and Stockade Pauldrons. Point is, if you want to keep up in raids in that type of environment, you have to put in the hours. I’ve given myself two sessions a week, 4 hours per session. That’s my limit. 
---
I would argue it will contribute to the sense of community in vanilla that most people want in a negative way, and I think a potential increase in queue time is worth the trade off.
---
Salvation impacted almost all DPS classes in Vanilla while WF only affects melees. Salvation was a great boost to Caster DPS as well as Warriors, since they had to worry a lot less about threat acquisition.
---
Alliance humans get access to the +weapon skill for swords and maces which helps them gear fury easier than the orc +axes. Blessing of salvation lets them completely unload without fear of pulling, then the might and kings buffs make them even bigger dick. The difference is minimal, but the other benefit is that you don't need to have the pally in the group like you would a shaman. 
---
I think the biggest issue there is going to be faction sizes and the potential inability to get games going due to the size of AV. Also, even IF the battle master had a 1.12 version or a 1.6 version, there is no guarantee that people wouldn’t Zerg in one or not the other. 
---
Suicide kings
---
Yes they do, that’s why tank group is 2-3 tanks, a shaman with windfury, and a Warlock with imp. 
---
I truly hope that GDKP runs become popular in Classic. My server on retail back in the ICC days did GDKP runs lot and many were very successful. I even killed the Lich King in one.
---
GDKP are great for pugs. However they likely won't be around for a while. The main benefit of them is the overgeared people help carry the raid and make some gold, the people being carried are generally the ones spending gold to get pieces, with some people in the middle, not too under or overgeared. So until there is a decent population of overgeared people I don't see GDKPs being used much. Perhaps once people are fully BWL+ geared
---
I know you agree, that’s why I responded to you!
---
Bro nobody is gonna be making demands as a warlock in group content anyways. You DPS are a dime a dozen.
---
I'm a tank, and if someone starts complaining about someone else slacking in the group i'll kindly tell them to be quiet or find another group.
---
Druids got significantly better in BC, in just about every aspect possible. 
---
Much of the caster gear that drops in PvE is better than the PvP stuff.
---
I enjoyed those as well but did font it tedious.  Feeding my pet was fun, trying to get the right food to make them happy and keeping a stock of it.  The ammo just took up so much space in my already limited bags.
---
It stacks, and was used even into BC by ferals. The stats you gain are no where near the DPS potential to having 20 extra energy every few seconds. Same goes for crowd Pummelers, hundreds of extra AP from epics are still nothing compared to constant +50% attack speed. 
---
In 2.01, Vanilla got the pre-TBC patch, which gave Warriors Titan’s Grip, I was particularly fond of that one. :P
---
So, slacking is okay, but complaining about it is not?
---
On my first Night elf, wanted to get to Elwynn forest. But ended up in badlands getting one-shot by all the NPCs. All I knew is that I had to go South.
---
2.01 was the reason I rolled up a fresh shaman for TBC. 
---
&gt;because they will collude with one another to avoid having to PvP as much.
---
A. Collusion would be the high ranks trading kills for honor, which they don't do in your proposed situation.
---
B. There are few shared areas for ganking near battlemasters, which is why you see rankers not really gank eachother.
---
C. You gain less and less honor for killing the same player in a 24 hour window- 10% less each time until the 11th kill grands no honor.
---
Yes, of course. But it's going to be pretty difficult to gear yourself as a heal (which you're probably gonna be doing in PvE) and DPS, with roughly 10 other DPS casters main needing on those pieces.
---
As another private vet I agree with everything being said here.  Dont feel you have to power to 60 as fast as possible, this game is huge and awesome and there is 5 years of content here even if you only play a couple of classes.  If you are new to vanilla it really is worth enjoying the exploration and discovery, even if you have watched 100's of hours of videos you still havent seen 5% of azeroth.
---
I don’t love loot council, but I don’t want to go through the administration hassle of DKP. I think I’d sooner be in favor of /roll.
---
The biggest problem with Loot Council is the politics. To do it right, I think you need to have a rock solid logic and stick with it. As soon as you start deviating and making exceptions, the feeling of unfairness creeps in.
---
Im kinda glad i never played classic on retail and nost only for 2 weeks before it shut down
---
Berating people for not choosing the most optimum build, declaring that people who aren't playing to be the absolute most efficient, etc is not "wanting people to be considerate."  Its like the entire concept of playing a video game for fun is lost on you.
---
Of course not. A (huge) 5% increase in DPS turns a 90 seconds boss encounter into a 86 seconds encounter.
---
Even if add all these stray seconds up over a whole dungeon, that's a miniscule amount of time. Literally every other aspect of play is more important, from pulling to positioning to game sense to playing your class correctly. One time dotting the sheep on accident will destroy everything gained by min-maxing. Stats just don't matter enough in this game.
---
Not just that, there are not a lot of meaningful choices within the trees.  They come in pretty much 3 flavors: good, good for another tree, and bad, with maybe another variable in there for “this is for PvP”.  
---
New specs don’t arise so much as there is a question of whether some item with a unique effect gets dug out of a low level dungeon and someone figures out a good way to use it in some totally not intended way.  
---
god you would be fucking trash at fighting games
---
LF NA/PvP/Horde raiding guild with weekend raiding times (Fri-Monday). I'm busy Tuesday-Thursday and work 9-5, so I'm looking for a guild that will be raiding any time on weekends where my schedule is a lot more open.
---
I'm an experienced raider from BC, Cata, and MoP, with some more casual raiding from Warlords and Legion, and private server experience. I'm fine filling my class, but hunter/druid/warlock preferred. I plan on hitting 60 within the first month, if that affects raid progression.
---
If someone is afk that's a different issue. If someone is doing bad dps, has a bad rotation or whatever, then yea, complaining about it is not gonna help.
---
I value group morale over anything, and i'd much rather play with incompetent players over rude players. I've cleared every dungeon 100 times before anyways, i'm just here to have fun.
---
The consensus seems to be that sharding (at early levels) will allow more players to play on the same server at the same time, this is important.
---
ex:
---
Groups 1, 2, and 3 are playing on server A and can all progress because they're separated onto shards A1, A2, and A3. When group 3 gets bored of/overwhelmed by Classic and quits, groups 1 and 2 are still on server A together to play together.
---
ex2:
---
Groups 1, 2, and 3 all play on server A without sharding. Progressing early-game is slow and painful, deterring groups 2 and 3 from continuing on Classic. Group 1 progresses slowly before the others quit and plays alone with a lower population once they're gone. 
---
ex3: 
---
Groups 1, 2, and 3 are playing on servers A, B, and C. Their divided populations makes progression typical, like in ex1. However, when group 3 quits from boredom/being overwhelmed, server C becomes a "dead server" and any players remaining there have a bad experience with a low-population server.
---
***
---
Please keep in mind that the answer to "progressing is too hard" should not be "then don't play". 
---
We have the tools at our disposal to make this community great and to help it thrive - pushing people away because some individuals want a "no-changes" environment in which we all have to deal with massive waves of level 1 players competing for mob tags isn't the best thing for the community as a whole.
---
Neckbeard is strong in this one.
---
Thanks that looks great, does taking axe specialization rule out using a sword or mace? considering the human racial?
---
I assume you'd take one if it was a large upgrade, but still favor an axe given the choice.
---
Generally because min-maxing is completely unless for success in Vanilla and min-maxers have a reputation (deserved or not) for trying to tell everyone else how to play.
---
I was literally involved in a thread last week in which someone was arguing that someone not playing an optimized spec is intentionally trolling other players. His words, not mine.
---
Most hardcore guilds don't wipe on a boss for months :) 
---
Usually instance gets cleared the same day it gets released. 
---
Does Might and Kings really make up for the 20% damage increase of WF?  Salvation can be countered with more tank DPS (Bears/dual wield/Fury points/etc.) while Horde side I’d assume.
---
Level 42 and quit is strong in this one.
---
I honestly wonder how necessary world buffs are going to be for PVE.
---
Back in the day, each raid really only needed maybe 15 players you'd consider "good" and 25 players who wouldn't be that much of an active detriment to the group. Ask any vanilla wow player what happened to the raids where only a few of the better players sat out and were replaced for one night. It was usually startling how much worse you did.
---
And when I say "good players" I really mean just people who were actively researching the ways to increase their DPS by a small ammount, be it via skill usage, stopcasting macros and the like. Keyboard turning and clicking weren't considered THAT uncommon (and as such, you could probably find a few guys who could "get away with it" which is exactly what I'm saying).
---
I think it'll be much much easier to field 40 of those good guys with all the information out there, and the encounters and mechanics therein being as well documented as they are.
---
And if that happens it makes me wonder how much better the world buffs will be. All they did was increase damage, which I'd imagine everyone in classic would naturally be able to do via the multitude of tools available to them. Sure they'll help obviously, but will they make a non-kill into a kill or will they make a "comfortably 20 seconds ahead of enrage" kill into a "laughably 80 seconds ahead of enrage" kill? Because if so, just pull without those buffs: the extra experience from that one pull is going to be way more valuable than the extra DPS you'd get from it.
---
&gt; Berating people for not choosing the most optimum build, declaring that people who aren't playing to be the absolute most efficient, etc is not "wanting people to be considerate." 
---
Uhm, yes it is, not doing your best is incredibly inconsiderate to the people you're grouping with
---
&gt; Its like the entire concept of playing a video game for fun is lost on you.
---
Because grouping with people who aren't performing is so fun and intentionally making the lives of other people worse is so much fun?
---
Sure why not
---
Its a game
---
My mate came over when wow first released and we spent the weekend playing it on my dads work pc (as the family/gaming one didn’t have enough ram or something). 
---
I made a troll rogue and found the ‘secret path’ in the hills that the shaman go on for their earth totem quest. Seeing ‘secret oath’ pop up on the screen made me think I was going to get mad loot or something at the end, so I was confused there was nothing. I managed to walk jump up and over the hill, again thinking it was a secret path, and fell down to the ocean near ratchet. A ?? Level makura crab thing came over and 1 shot me. I died instantly after rezzing a bunch of times and didn’t know about spirit rezzing so did the only logical thing and deleted the character. 
---
But retail is shit =(
---
It sure is, so idk why the entitlement is so strong.
---
Full feral is not good in competitive PvP. You can own noobs in the open world but against equally geared/skilled opponents you'll lose. The spec you should play if you like feral but still want to kick ass is 0/30/21. It's a feral hybrid spec, also known as resto-bear. You can raid as a healer with this too, just switch gear. Check out "nerf druids by Azgaz" on youtube.  
---
Then it'll be a great experience to play Vanilla without people like you :) Since you won't be able to get past the launcher ;)
---
Paladins are by far the best hps efficient healers
---
&gt;Suck it up and deal with overpopulation:
---
I just don't understand the reasoning behind this argument. We have the tech to solve the problem (massive overpopulation of lvl 1-10 zones at launch). I can't get my head around the need for people to play with hundreds of people in the same zone at the same time killing kobolds outside Northshire Abbey. There's nothing immersive about 300 people killing the kobolds you need for your quest. 
---
Nobody is arguing to keep sharding past this point, so I just don't get why that keeps being brought up.
---
Yeah exactly.
---
You need to learn to get a feeling of accomplishment from real life not video games. 
---
Ret Pally ftw 
---
Same here, having a girlfriend, great work &amp; good friends! And i don’t want to loss it all to Classic, i know that i wont be hardcore because of responsabilties but i’m fine with it :) 
---
Because of this i maybe going to concentrate more to pvp. So i don’t need to be online for certain hours for raiding.
---
I was thinking to level a warrior (was a lvl60 warrior tank in Vanilla 2006) but i know it takes a looooong time to level &amp; gear. 
---
So maybe i’ll level a mage now, easy &amp; fast leveling and good for gold farming :) 
---
Time flies when you’re having fun ! 
---
There you go, you can respec :)
---
Damn, pretty sure my last guild fell apart exactly because we were not using this. 
---
It kinda sounds like you just don't wanna play the game...
---
&gt; other aspect of play is more important,
---
You're not wrong, but nothing is preventing you from playing well and minmaxing at the same time, just because something is more important doesn't mean you should ignore everything else.
---
might and kings is pretty good and having way less threat is a big bonus for going ham. Melee dps is still top dps on ally for most parts.
---
Nobody cares if you personally min-max your playtime. The problem people have is if you try and force others to do so according to your personal model (or even according to a mathematically proven model) as well. 
---
In a game with choice, nobody wants to be forced to pick X even if it is "better" than Y. 
---
viable? sure why not, people experiment with different things all the time. But optimal? No. All the optimal specs for both PvE and PvP have already been discovered. 
---
1 extra attack once in a while with a lot more AP, or every attack you do with some more AP.
---
Yes, it evens out!
---
2 RP-PvP guilds and they're both only EU? Come on my fellow Americans! We can do better than that!
---
Any NA RP-PvP guilds forming? Particularly Alliance, but I am open to Horse as well. 
---
Okay, so before I keep responding, I just want to say I have never actually leveled a Warrior in Vanilla.  I've just read a lot about it and done a bunch of research, so your mileage may vary here...
---
That said, the reason for Axe spec is because of it's interplay with Crit and Deep Wounds.  Because of Deep Wounds, more crits is going to be a bit better for damage than the Stun or Extra Attack procs on other Weapons Specs.  Further, if you're willing to run dungeons a few times while leveling, there are lots of axes you can get along the way to make use of it.
---
I think you are probably right regarding upgrades.  Unless it's a significant upgrade, I would pass up other weapons to keep my Axe for the 5% crit.
---
Agree entirely on UC. I hear in alpha it ws supposedly above ground, in the ruins of Lordaeron.
---
They will probably rebuild it like that in the next expansion. A shame retail is how it is, however, with no talent trees or class identity.
---
We are close to being ready for Classic and people have no problem with Loot Council.
---
Obviously everyone and every guild is different. You must find like minded people.
---
&gt;You will literally be unable to see most of your community.
---
I think everyone is looking at this differently. 
---
Blizzard wants to shard the *starting zones* because they will be jam-packed with players. 
---
The overpopulation of starting zones *at launch* and the preservation of *post-launch* community are at different points in the timeline. 
---
I guarantee that even with sharding at launch, you'll still see dozens of people going after your Northshire wolves or cactus-apples. 
---
Min-maxing takes a considerable amount of time, unless you just take other people's often incorrect opinions at face value. See reddit and its unwarranted obsession over dwarf priests.
---
Plus, the process of min-maxing is just too similar to work.
---
Because this game is an MMORPG, keyword RPG, and for me at least, it rubs me completely the wrong way that the entire power fantasy for a class, paladin, is completely unviable in the content that provides the best gear in the game. 
---
And then to have so called "elitists" simultaneously tell me that I won't be able to raid with that ret spec, and also say that any kind of balance to bring it up to par with what the devs originally intended (Yes, they intended it to not be completely unviable.) is off the table just makes me dislike this section of players.
---
But for real, when you think of paladin you think of a warrior wielding holy power, not some flimsy cloth wearing healer, but "elitists" force that role upon the class.
---
They do not mention that you used to be able to put a DI on Razergore, thus completely nerfing the crap out of the encounter. 
---
How so? I’ve been a Pally since retail Vanilla.  Excited for classic. 
---
Like i said it’s a video game. 
---
Not true at all, as evidenced by the OP.
---
Imagine the general Warlock/Hunter player on a PvE realm coming out at 60 jacked as shit but with pecs smaller than a slice of toast because they never died.
---
You were supposed to line of sight the breath if you did not have the cloak anyhow.
---
We also have a channel dedicated to guild recruiting/LFGuild [on the r/classicwow Discord](https://discord.gg/classicwow).
---
Wondering if you'd paint and frame one for money? Id live to have a massive painting of Orgrimmar
---
I’m just saying, who cares if I want to play a race that isn’t the best for that class.  Or if I want to spend my time playing a feral Druid or spriest...who cares.  There is nothing wrong with that and I will find people to play with that are ok with that.  Don’t call me lazy or selfish for playing the game the way I want.  I’ve had more fun in guilds that accept people that aren’t just playing cookie cutter min-max builds.  Were those guilds top tier, no, but we still had a blast progressing through content. 
---
There’s nothing wrong with wanting to Min-max either.  You’ll find like minded people to group with and you’ll have a blast playing too.
---
But all of your comments are attacking people that want to play a different way then you. If you don’t like it, don’t group with them.  Don’t call me lazy or selfish for wanting to play a gnome rogue lol 
---
You knew all the rankers, and ex rankers, on a certain humongous private server. As well as guilds to look out for in world, and even particular players. You still knew which groups were good or not, and whether or not your WSG was going to be a tough one or an easy one. You still get to know everyone that matters, some how, even if there are 14k people online.
---
10/10 would join again! ;)
---
I was 12 when i started playing, during the beta, and it took me 20 levels before i realized i could buy new skills lol. 
---
It definitely is a video game.
---
I hope you can find things to keep your attention once you've hit 60, since raiding very likely won't be a possibility.
---
lol ebonics... ebonroc yo.
---
Haven't they stated that it'd only be used for low level zones at launch?
---
If there's a *different* official statement, I haven't seen it. There's a *ton* of speculation with nothing backing it though.
---
I'm sad about this only because the troll village between moonglade and darkshore was one of my favourite farming spots.
---
Lmao, damn iPhone!
---
You are literally highlighting the issue with "elitists" you say someones choice of optimization makes them "objectively mechanically better" at the game, when this is not necessarily true. Firstly, if anything this shows a higher game knowledge, not a higher level of in game mechanics, secondly it doesn't even necessarily show a higher level game knowledge as someone might play unoptimal talents or with unoptimal gear as a choice, fully aware that it isn't as optimal, but also aware that the game is an mmoRPG, and it isn't just about optimization.
---
how is it a disaster? New people get items no one else wants dirt cheap.  People who have been raiding for months spend a lot on their drake fang talismans. You literally can't fuck someone over. and the DKP distribution solves itself. 
---
&gt; Die when leveling
---
*Enters STV on a PvP server*
---
[Yup](https://www.wowhead.com/npc=3617/lordaeron-citizen)
---
The only thing i haven’t done is Naxx completely and thats cause realms don’t last that long.

I really am not sure what your point is or why exactly you are jumping too so many conclusions.

These also don't have any solution for *long queues, lag, and overcrowding*.
---
This community will literally whine about these exact issues the moment they pop up in classic.
---
\[Regarding those Posts and to the people who downvote this Post now\]
---
If adults can not comprehend the fact that people like different things, than this sub is past the point of no return.
---
Some people want to play casually, some Roleplay, some PvP, some min-max. 
---
All these posts of pretending you have found the "better" way of playing the game, makes everyone seem like high-school kids all over again. 
---
The thought of this Community thinking they are mature and better than the retail Community, is laughable at this point.
---
Top 10 ways on getting a 6 pack 3 weeks in.
---
&gt; If someone is afk that's a different issue.
---
Why? Both are people actively making the decision that they don't need to contribute as much as they could to the group.
---
&gt; complaining about it is not gonna help.
---
You're absolutely right, but that's far away from encouraging people to burdening others since burdening others (apparently from the people responding to me) makes the game more fun.
---
He's referring to the idea that sharding will be continued after launch and outside of low-level areas. 
---
*Even though there is a Blizzard statement to the contrary.*
---
It’s overdesigned.
---
7/11 is faster...
---
You're making presumptions based on your experiences which won't be applicable to classic servers whatsoever.
---
People really underestimate the amount of people that will be playing Classic that have literally zero intention of being competitive but feel entitled to raid. You might not be that type of person, but literally 99% of ret pallies will be. 
---
&gt; Dynamic spawns
---
Aren't on the table, are they?
---
I like to think the content will be easier since it's already been done, allowing people to play whatever the hell they want.
---
No loot sharing.  None.  Not automated.  Not from GMs.  None.  Why is this so hard?  Because a ML might make a mistake?  Pay attention and farm it again next week.
---
Queue system wouldn't work on PVE servers and PVE servers are simply beyond saving and shouldn't ruin PVP on PVP servers. People are always going to be mostly Alliance on PVE Servers due to blessing of salvation, closeness to tier 1/2 and gold farms there before DM, lore/ease of leveling until around 30. A faction queue could help on PVP servers since they are already usually close on pop, but since they are usually close on pop do they really need a queue? Vanilla isn't TBC where people all go on one faction because ret paladins are only good on one side, arena racials outside human rogue are all better on one side. 
---
Oh look a guy with TV in his name who wants easy streaming "content".
---
Im looking forward to meet different people that are going to play. Still talk and play with a bunch of the people i played wow with years ago.
---
Of course we'll see dozens of people. The problem is we won't see the same people, and it won't be an indication of what the community on the server actually is. 
---
Blizz has left a lot of leeway for themselves with the wording re:sharding. How long is "at launch"? What is considered "starting zones"? Whether it's just Elwynn or Westfall too is a big difference. What about Duskwood? There are too many unanswered questions for people to make assumptions about the extent of sharding we'll have.
---
We'd never stop doing bicycle crunches....
---
Haha
---
Real people aren’t like you. I will raid literally like i always do. This is a 14 year old game lmao with 40 man raids if you SHOW UP you get a spot the game is not hard. Have you played Vanilla? 
---
Fear mongering at it’s best. 
---
It's the vocal minority that destroys it for every min-maxer; As in, the vocal minority of min-maxers who put everyone else down.
---
This thread has a few invidiuums which perfectly demonstrate why absolute noone likes them - Because they are assholes, plain and simple. The problem is, those few people are posting EVERYWHERE. There is no single min-max thread without them and them spouting their narcissist crap.
---
Blizzard wants to spend dev time doing loot trading, hence the representatives of the company saying they want to implement it.
---
Well said. Cant add anything to this.
---
I guess the main issue is how many servers blizz will launch with along with if you think vanilla will keep players engaged.
---
Personally, i think the latter is true. I have no idea on the former, however. Nobody does. I’d say 10 servers would be enough, but they might get greedy and go with 20-30 so people don’t quit because of queues.
---
Even if servers drop in population, there was a solution with this before sharding: server transfers. Have the alliance transfer to a server with less alliance and the horde vice-versa. Or both factions to a less populated server.
---
I started playing in vanilla on Warsong; before the end we were transferes to Neptulon. It wasn’t even because of player numbers. Warsong was just a hub of russians which made it very annoying for non-russian players (“lfm dm rus”).
---
That transfer had less of a negative impact on me than sharding.
---
orcs are great, love that stun resist.
---
Tauren too, war stomp is so underrated.
---
This sounds great! Better then that WoW treadmill guy... lol. 
---
P.S. Always hated Deadmines being called "vancleef". It's DM. For Dire Maul, just say DM (whatever wing you are doing) and you're good. 
---
Now you can, but the OP's statement was still correct. 
---
Good point. Maybe all of the people wanting crbgs in at the start are from pve servers? If/When we get crbgs, it would be dope if it only affected the pve servers, and didn't mess with the pvp servers.
---
I hope crbgs aren't added until after phase 6, if they even do get added. I also hope blizz figures out a method to avoid sharding/crbgs altogether.
---
Yes, or tanking on the horde side would be a nightmare. lol
---
And it's white. 
---
Chasing those stupid trees around the arena while they wave their arms around spamming hots smh
---
If we're coming from the same source here (Blizz saying that they want to use sharding for the low-level areas at launch), what's the actual downside to that?
---
All I can see are the benefits that it brings to the table. Servers crashing, people not being able to progress (which leads to other issues) and queues don't seem to have any upsides to them.
---
World of Warcraft's launch was not ideal, but Classic has a chance to be an improvement on that. Why avoid that just to have 600 people on your screen at the same time? (assuming that anyone's client-side program can handle that load)
---
The world always felt full and alive in vanilla what do you mean? Constant raids on southshore/tartan mill, crossroads, goldshire, seeing the same people on Tuesday that you saw on a Saturday. It wasn’t all about omg need rng gods to titanforge my armor for BiS and only go outside to do WQ for emissary 
---
All the rankers knew each other with the old system and you were kicked out of the premades if you played past the agreed upon time and had a much harder road spending more time. 
---
All of this really doesn't matter though. What really matters is how it effects 99 percent of the community and not 1 percent. The curve will go up with queues popping 24/7 and be a worse experience for the majority of players.
---
&gt;  Don’t call me lazy or selfish for wanting to play a gnome rogue lol
---
"Don't call me selfish because i value myself over others lol"
---
&gt;  I’ve had more fun in guilds that accept people that aren’t just playing cookie cutter min-max builds.
---
And that's great for you, I hope everyone can find a guild like that, my problem is with people assuming it's okay when they're pugging.
---
That's completely contrary to my experience in both vanilla and private servers.
---
There definitely are guilds where showing up will get you a spot. These are also guilds that will have terrible leadership, struggle with Ony for over 6 months, and will have constant roster changes. They'll raid every fortnight, or once a week, at most. 
---
People love to say that vanilla raiding is easy, but I find that overwhelmingly those people are either looking back over a decade and remembering their raiding as a teenager, or looking at private servers which are by default a higher quality of player than your average person playing retail classic. 
---
So basically this would turn me into a pseudo-lance armstrong (the bicyclist)
---
I have thought about it. All of OP's arguments are either based on massive assumptions or don't make sense in the first place.
---
I was also playing when battle groups were first introduced to Vanilla and none of the doomsday scenarios people predicted back then occurred either.
---
All of those people have to hit 60 and dedicate to the same raid schedule. It's not as easy as it seems.. you will definitely have a lot of new faces, if you expect to or not. I wish you guys the best of luck. 
---
They were improving drastically with each new quality server, in terms of being finished, accurate, populated, reliable, long lasting, and non-corrupted. Compared to a bastardized version of the game, even current private servers would be preferable, much less where they'll be in a few years.
---
It's a combination of everything I wrote. The weapon skill helps immensely, especially with dual wielding. Kings and might increase damage, and no salv is not countered with more dps. Threat was a genuine issue for certain classes before tanks are extremely geared. That means warriors not using their rage or even sometimes having to stop auto on a boss. Salv makes your dps able to go all out during progression which more than makes up for it. I think horde might have slightly faster farm run times with windfury, but it's negligible and requires a heavy melee raid.
---
Also, as Askyl pointed out, might is a constant. Windfury is a proc. It evens out because proc rates are normalized. Windfury allows more burst, but that means nothing on a raid boss.
---
I will never raid with Retardins or Boomkins and nobody can force me to.
---
And I will use Excelsheets and shit &amp; love it. 
---
Stop imposing your idea of fun on other people.
---
I'm leveling a warrior, I'm going to get hit hard with the die while leveling. Also the hunter loot would probably kill me.
---
Its because of the "(no matter the cooldowns i currently have and whatnot)" ... rogues are surprisingly bad without certain key cooldowns (vanish comes to mind).
---
I also played during the implementation, and the sense of community was affected in a negative way. I can see the population argument, but what if we got enough servers, and increase in population on each server, that queue times won’t be an issue? Would you be opposed to starting with no x realm, and see how it plays out?
---
&gt; *Enters STV on a PvP server* 
---
As a warrior, I'm gonna get so jacked 
---
&gt; which contradicts Esfand trying to insinuate cross realm BG's was in more than 5 months of 2 years of content
---
When did he say this?
---
Just out of curiosity ... I always see "geared warrior" thrown around when talking about similar topics like this . What exactly does this mean ? Tier 1 level ? Tier 3 ? vanilla bis ? I never really know where "geared warrior" actually starts. Do you have any input on that maybe ?
---
To maximize your damage, understand the limitations of your mage friend. He'll have a lot of downtime getting mana back so you can play pretty aggressively and get fairly badly damaged since you can eat while he drinks. 
---
If you're interested in doing aoe pulls, as a mage main, I'd say most of the time, you'd just mess it all up and get in the way. In that case, staying near him while he's casting to pick up any mobs that escape and preventing them from interrupting his aoe would work ok. 
---
If you dive a bit deep into tank spec, that could work the best since you can hold mobs with taunt (and actually survive) while he AOEs them down. Pretty efficient. 
---
Just remember that the majority of the damage will come from the mage while leveling. Best you can do is support. 
---
Gorgeous, you considered doing prints? 
---
Definitely. I expect some churn. But I don't think LC will be the most important part. ;) And thanks!
---
So what will you do? Will you pass it yourself or go all-in?
---
So wouldn't it be better to take talents that give more melee crit, attack speed, 2H capability, etc?
---
I am doing something like this. Only it's that I have been fat my entire adult life. I am 6'3 and currently 260 pounds. I haven't played video games in years and decided if I was going to play classic wow. I should look like my warrior. So I was 290 When I started and in the last 5 months I have lost 30 pounds. Much more importantly though. I did that While packing on a ton of muscle. Hoping to be 225 and closing in on a 6 pack when the game drops. 
---
Nice! Well I am very interested then.
---
This. I love that set, especially with the blue mage tower tint. It is imo the best DK set ever made.
---
The Barrens, enter a newb, leave with a 6 pack from perpetual sit ups
---
Guys, moonglade, obviously. I feel like I'm taking crazy pills here. Moonglade is for sure where it's at. 
---
lmao I hope this is true.
---
&gt;  In PvP, it's basically a flat 10% damage reduction against Mages - which you need because your mail armor does nothing to protect against them.
---
Not to mention the 10% reduction against hunter serpent sting and fire traps, fire warlock spells, and rogue poisons (and balance druids?).  Great talent all-around for PvP and PvE 
---
I've recently tried out an...."undocumented sever." And I have to say, aside from the hard core min/maxers there are a LOT of people playig, AND making good progress just playing what ever they want. 
---
In my humble (and so far limited) experince, people are just having fun with the adventure! Last Saturday, I was in a group for deadmines, and it was 5 ret palladins. It was so much fun! And someone would die every now and then but no wipes. So don't get overly concerned with the hardcore min/max of the game. Just have fun! I feel like this time around, people will be open to trying a lot more new stuff.
---
Well, you're acting like an asshole and actually *are* the ignorant one. The change that you're probably thinking of happened in 4.2, but it didn't affect BoP items. It just made it so that if you roll need on a BoE item, it will become soulbound.
---
Couple hundred push ups won’t stop all the Doritos and Mountain Dew that will be consumed though
---
I like the build you linked especially for plugging the dps/off-heal role in 5-man and 10-man dungeons.  Question: do magma/firenova totems scale with spell power?
---
Do you even have fun in the game anymore or is it just a chore or a job to you at this point?
---
Oh dude!!
---
Okay, this has my vote. That's a great call!!
---
No doritos and Mountain Dew for me. However, Stuffed crust pizza from pizza hut.... day in and day out. 
---
I have never played classic, I'm 23 now and started as a kid in late tbc. Playing some retail, but mostly wotlk in private servers. I am hyped to play classic, but afraid it might be too time consuming. 
---
I don't have much free time, work, girlfriend, etc.
---
I reckon I won't be able to play as much as I'd like. 
---
How big are raids? Do I spend 3-4 hours in them? I don't have that kind of time anymore and guilds usually punish you for not having time. 
---
Not really. You deal more magic damage than physical damage. If you really want a 2H weapon while leveling as Elemental (you don't while questing, but you might if you DPS in a dungeon) then you just wear a staff. Pre-60 staves have equal DPS to maces and axes of the same item level. Just ask anyone who has leveled a Warrior.
---
I have a lot of fun, yes.
---
Maybe others are the ones not enjoying the game if their enjoyment is conditioned on making the experience worse for other players.
---
Keep up the good work. It’s definitely worth it
---
I have never seen this mentality from someone that was unfortunate enough to wind up on one of the underpopulated or unbalanced servers.
---
I hope this is accompanied by a revival of the level 60 elite Tauren Shaman (his WoW themed death metal band)
---
No, I would be good with the "wait and see how it goes" solution to most of major Classic issues. You're right, if the servers are setup properly from launch with healthy populations then it isn't really necessary (ironically one of the key's to getting servers off on the right foot may be sharding on launch, one of the other more contentious Classic issues).
---
I'd say warroir and mage, like most others. But also want to give a shout out to the hunter, it was full of RP aspects like ammo and feeding your pet. It was a fast solo leveller that started strong but fell off in later content which I beleive was the intent. In terms of polish I think the hunter was well done with few gaps or holes in the class.
---
But you just said you aren't a caster and you down mobs with melee + some shocks and totems.  I'm not stuck on the 2h weapon, but talents like Thundering Strikes, Flurry, Imp. Ghost Wolf, and Elemental Weapons seem more beneficial to me than the elemental talents
---
Sweet! Love to have ya aboard.

Join up on discord and chill friend

&gt;Queue system wouldn't work on PVE servers and PVE servers are simply beyond saving and shouldn't ruin PVP on PVP servers. 
---
This is your brain on elitism
---
The screenshot is from a later expansion
---
Priest is by far one of the most complete classes from beginning to end. Not that it didnt have its issues with some talents being awful (lightwell) or shadow pve being mostly support buff based. Still it became probably one of the most complete classes overall.
---
As for doom, Druids and pally in TBC were huge upgrades. Shammies on the other hand seem to be in this space where blizzard doesnt know what to do with them every expansion. Perma doomed status.
---
This entire argument is based on the idea that waiting is something that is inherently wrong. Waiting for something CAN build anticipation and makes that thing mean more (this doesn't apply to all things obviously). Most of the terrible decisions made by blizzard to "make the game better" were focused on reducing or eliminating wait times. The result is a game that feels pointless since very little matters anymore. 
---
Battlegrounds were more epic because of the wait times. When you got in you were excited, pumped up! The match meant so much more and you worked hard to win since you didn't want to wait for another game. Bring back 40 minute wait times! Crank the volume and relax on the couch and when you heard the trumpets, run back in and saddle up!
---
LOL that’s my point, it’s not selfish to play a gnome rogue.  Gtfo of here with that crap. 
---
Like I said earlier, I’ll be playing with like minded people that don’t see playing a gnome rogue as selfish. I’ll be sure to steer clear of anyone like you, I can guarantee that.
---
And it is fine when pugging.  If you don’t like it, leave.  Better yet, make your own pug and then you don’t have to invite my gnome rogue because I’m selfish ROFL.  It’s a video game bud, I’ll have fun my way, you have fun your way.  
---
Your actually being selfish for not seeing this and thinking everyone needs to play like you.

My very first character was a human mage and I immediately walked out of the starting area. I tried to kill the lvl 5 wolves outside of goldshire for 30 minutes until someone rescued me and directed me back to the starting area.
---
On my second character when I got to the first town in Teldrassil I would hide in the bushes from the treant protectors that patrolled on the road. They shook the ground as they walked and seemed scary. 
---
My server called the Deadmines VC, for VanCleef.
---
Yer, I gotta say I agree. Even on live, I'll choose less progression and no dickhead shouting in raid to a guild that is further progressed. I'm 30, I don't need some brat shouting in my ear the whole night because someone doesn't learn mechanics as quickly as someone else. It isn't conducive to an encouraging guild progression environment anyway. I've raided in top oceanic guilds and some of them were excellent and others were just shouty terribleness . When I came back for bfa, I've chosed a nice group of people over progression for this reason. When classic drops, I'll do the same. I don't pay a sub and login and dedicate time and resources to the guild to listen to someone be angry for 4 hours a night.
---
I meant to imply that a mathematically superior spec is objectively mechanically better, not the player.
---
&gt;  there are certain talent points and pieces of gear that are objectively better than other choices.  Some players choose to skip those [...] Other players choose not to, because they are objectively mechanically better at the game.
---
"They" there refers to the talent and gear options, but I can see how it's worded kinda poorly.
---
if sharding only exists in say The Valley of Trials, what is preventing that massive problem from propagating into durotar as a whole?
---
Yikes lol. I'm a small time streamer and I will play a PVP server and I am against cross realm. I just don't like how this retarded subreddit has an issue with 1 thing and then suddenly we get mandatory china wall of text about how it will RUIN the game blowing the whole thing out of proportion 
---
When guild banks started a group of five of us made guilds for each other alt so our bank alts had guild banks and basically endless storage. That is game breaking imo. It happened the day we got guild banks, so it wasn’t like it took to long for people to abuse it. 
---
Who said there will even be battlegroups? That restriction has been removed in modern WoW with their cloud. So you have the strawman.
---
I secretly love leveling as fire. 2 and 3 shotting everything. Drinking/EVO and repeating. Its bizarre how fast it is. I expected it to be so much slower than Frost, but as long as the server is full and aoe isnt an option for frost, leveling by questing with fire is not bad at all.
---
Dungeons though.... whew.... Drink drink drink drink drink
---
Along the same lines. My first character was a NE Rogue (I chose NE for my rogue, because I thought Shadowmeld was great for a rogue, not realizing a rogue had stealth already)... anyways...  
---
I did that Satyr quest just outside the start area and then you get the follow up about how helping the Satyr is wrong and I needed to fix the situation or I would be kicked out of the alliance. I actually thought that I would be removed from the faction in the game.  
---
Oh, the noob that I was. :(
---
it's beautiful, you captured the atmosphere really well. You're a great artist
---
This man’s trying to kill people. Anyone who has been in the Barrens knows that Chuck Norris jokes come in clumps of 10-20. 
---
You proposed a problem that already had a solution in vanilla WoW. 
---
&gt;That restriction has been removed in modern WoW with their cloud. 
---
It can be emulated.
---
Get to 20, research the few skills you don't already have and ask yourself, "If I added those to this, how much would I enjoy this?" If you like it a lot already, you've already found your main, no need to even research.
---
Thats exactly what youre doing.
---
Who is actually worried that they need to rush to max and spec a certain way?
---
The second they labeled it no changes. StaysafeTV also insinuated that you can't be against crbg if you for 1.12 talents or you are a moron, which according to him means naxx should now be in at release. Then these frauds who never even ranked in vanilla and who use private server population and international playerbase to insinuate that behavior will happen on a 3000 pop vanilla server say "strawman" when their entire manipulative platform is based on it
---
I can totally imagine it. You wake up in the morning, help to build up the camp, take some scouting around it with your mates. In the middle of the day you take a brake and chill in the water, and when the sun goes down you light up a fire, eat and celebrate with your friends. 
---
I thought I was going to level and stay a balance druid all the way to 60 and into raiding....
---
Rerolled at level 17 to a Mage and never looked back.
---
Is it easy to get gear as a shadow priest? And do you think I will have issues as a night elf and not a dwarf?
---
Metal, sure I guess.... Death Metal? Nah. Power Metal at best.
---
Tweeting at comedy central might get them to do a re-run on the week of release. 
---
I sincerely hope you and I choose different servers on launch.
---
The last "exploit" about Loatheb was done after 2.0 changes for shadow priest.
---
heh, those types of casual crowd responses always make me giggle. The min-max crowd doesn't give 2 shits about the casual crowd, they just don't want to raid with them.
---
You weren't around for original vanilla launch, were you.
---
Oh ok, sorry I get it now. The thing is, I tryhard at games that I play, min max so to speak, but for me the class fantasy of Ret Paladin is so appealing, that I almost want to play it. I won't be playing it because I don't want to get completely locked out of end game raiding, but still, I would equally tryhard if I played ret or not, but unfortunately rets top end is just not good enough.
---
And also will the normal priest tier sets work for a shadow priest?
---
Do you know any good guide to level up an Tauren Warrior/ Horde warrior ?

You won't be missed.

AV is better honor than WSG or AB even on bonus weekend, which is the real problem with it. If people want to bang their head against the wall for 3 hours while half the group is AFK/fishing/getting herbs that is up to them. But because of the difference in honor gain, when AV comes out almost nobody does AB/WSG anymore because it is inefficient to do anything but zerg to the boss in AV without interacting with a single person.

What's the "of course" ptsd supposed to be referencing?

It was also a really hard city to raid, back in the days when height was an obstacle.

Which is why it's hilarious to see all these #nochanges clowns trying to argue that having hundreds of players competing for the same six quests in the starting zones is more "blizzlike" than accurate visible population levels managed by a sharding system completely obfuscated to everyone except for a few people coordinating outside the game to meet up without first forming a group.
---
&gt; but as soon as it becomes the sort of min-maxer who doesn't consider leveling "the real game" and ridicules others for not knowing their Pre-Raid BiS by heart, they start to draw the hate.
---
What you're describing is an asshat, not specifically a min-maxer. every group has asshats in it, min-maxers, meme specc players and casual players alike. Just like you have players that ridicule others for not knowing pre-raids lists you have casuals ridiculing min-maxers for optimizing their characters or rushing to max level.
---
Most min-maxers don't give a shit how others play the game or what they find fun, they just won't raid with you if you aren't like-minded just like most casual players don't care about players that rush to 60 to raid asap.
---
Asshats should draw hate, not min-maxers, not casual players but asshats...
---
This is hilarious.
---
There's nothing wrong with ANY way you choose to play and telling others they're playing the wrong way is a problem. It goes both ways

Warlocks were pretty well balanced in vanilla, their was a higher skill cap though. This made bad warlocks really bad and really well played warlocks seem godly.
---
&gt;Because Classic will be forever frozen with these final changes in Patch 1.12

That is by no measure a guarantee. It will not be long before the player base is screaming for hybrid fixes and the servers will be 90% "pure classes".

I'm making an assumption here because we don't have much information, but I think that "low-level areas" would be the entire 1-10 starter zones; ie: Durotar, as a whole - Elywynn Forest, as a whole. Not just the Valley of Trials and Northshire.
---
But again, we don't have enough information to make solid arguments for or against this because we don't know where the ceiling for this feature will be.

It's just that though, you never know who you're talking to on the internet. Are they a 10 year old? A try hard nerd? Married? Parent? Autism is a bit more prevalent than you'd think. Just varies.
---
Also, my favorite Wailing Caverns group was like 3 priests and 2 mages. Hectic &amp; long engagements (mostly due to running mobs), but we never wiped. Ezpz
---
So are you like, for hire?
---
You beat me to it, I came here to say this.
---
DM = Dire Maul
---
VC = Deadmines
---
WF totem also increases rage generation by about 20% plus a bit more when those wf attacks crit.   WF is a 20% proc chance but also has that 3 second cooldown so who knows.  Still though.  Lots more rage -&gt; spam more abilities
---
&gt; LOL that’s my point, it’s not selfish to play a gnome rogue. Gtfo of here with that crap.
---
How is it not selfish to make other players' experiences worse for no benefit at all, just because you want to?
---
&gt; It’s a video game bud, I’ll have fun my way, you have fun your way.
---
It is, but why do you choose to play one about cooperating to achieve goals if you don't want to cooperate?
---
I’m going to make a corrupted blood elf barber who cuts hair with the spork of doom and no one can stop me.
---
So this entire subreddit is complaining about the .001% of players that use optimal consumables every single raid encounter?
---
Man I've cleared naxx and I know we only used consumables on fights that we thought it would make a difference in.
---
I made a guild post below that might be what you are looking for. Are you currently playing on pservers or just looking to find a group before Classic goes live. 
---
Yeah, I meant herb nodes. I see now that I made a poor choice of words, thanks for clarifying!
---
To some extent...
---
The vast majority will DKP or /roll with a limit of 1 piece per raid for most items.
---
Only rare/vital items will be loot counciled to tanks/crafters.
---
Yup, that is the truth!
---
&gt;There's nothing wrong with ANY way you choose to play and telling others they're playing the wrong way is a problem
---
Absolutely, including if you're a raid leader and choose not to bring specs that are sub-optimal to your progression raids.
---
I just want to level to max-level in whatever pace I can handle, then faff about with proffessions and grind for sets one tier at a time.
---
I mean, I will probably PuG forever looking for an MC group accepting a priest in full devout, but fuck me if I won't be stylin' while doing it.

---
Here ya go. It's a little over 2 minutes long, but worth a listen. Ion tackles multiple points brought up on this sub every few minutes.
---
Based on what? We don't have the restriction on bgroups now, so why is it different in classic? Also there was never  a solution because it broke population balance even more on the servers. People weren't punished for all rolling on one faction. TBC saw worse population balance, WOTLK saw worse and it's a problem that never stopped. Server balance population is a JOKE in modern wow due in big part to CRBG's. There is no punishment and all rewards. BG's don't even matter though in modern WoW. It's a completely different game. All that matters is Arenas, and Mythics.
---
No kidding, is she really about to start doing ASMR tapping on that Big Gulp jug with her tits out like that?
---
I mean to be fair you guys made it about as far as anyone on this forum would say you would, BWL isn't that hard nor is the first half of AQ40... 
---
If you are interested in playing on a PvE server, hit me up. I'm currently on a pserver right now testing things out. 
---
You might need to reframe how you think about the game. Personally, I don't feel that Classic WoW is "competitive", it's about the journey - not the destination. And besides, can we really say there are "world firsts" for content that has been known for a decade? What's the rush?
---
Ah well that's pretty cool. 
---
I really miss the idea of rares and epics being *rare* and *epic*. I appreciate the challenge that going into content like that "under-geared" can pose rather than over-gearing most content with the RNG^2 loot system that we've got in retail today.
---
I mean sure, but first, can you explain why intentionally playing poorly is fun?
---
Neither would Looking for dungeon either right? Might as well put it in.
---
It goes both ways, you have some casual players telling people that rushing or min/maxing is the wrong way to play.
---
And yes, if you're in a competitive raid environment if you're not min-maxing as well you're in the wrong group. In dungeons the vast majority of min-maxers aren't going to care if you're in an optimal spec, they'll care if you are fucking up in the dungeon though.
---
"Wah! I want my content done and I want it done *now!* And I want to ruin what could have been a memorable once-in-a-lifetime event because I don't have the patience to wait a few days longer to hit level 60!"
---
Loot council was done in vanilla, often in combination with DKP.
---
Much of the tank gear and rare items would be loot counciled out, with DKP still subtracted.
---
It's refreshing to see someone admit that rather than just go "I'M GOING TO PLAY RET AND IF YOU DON'T LET ME INTO YOUR RAID YOU'RE ELITIST", which I've been seeing all day.
---
DM means Dire Maul to 100% of horde players, and &gt; 50% of alliance players. I don't know why anyone is even arguing over it...
---
This is the source I'm working from. It's worth the watch - only 2:22 - and covers many of the points brought up here over and over.
---
I'm not sure where people are extrapolating the whole slippery-slope-sharding-everywhere argument from.
---
So are you saying 20 percent = 100 pecent or more than 80? Classicast/Asmongold Logic in full effect here.
---
Normally guilds would put main spec over off spec, with Paladins being healers.
---
Yeah, I'm the same way.  Whatever I'm playing, I'm going to look up the most optimal way of doing things.  I'm fine with my groupmates doing whatever they want, though.
---
&gt;Most min-maxers don't give a shit how others play the game or what they find fun, they just won't raid with you if you aren't like-minded just like most casual players don't care about players that rush to 60 to raid asap.
---
I honestly think this is the problem that most people have. They feel entitled to being brought along to raids, but don't want to do anything to optimize their gear or spec... so they call people "elitist".
---
The idea that CRBG's destroy community are border line silly. Community is going out and doing world pvp and becoming a fixture in the world that is your realm. BG's are the opposite of community. If you are going to claim to be all about community. Get rid of BG's all together. 
---
I either want no BG's and no garbage honor system. Or I want X-realm BG's. Having the garbage honor system with no X-realm BG's. Seems like an awful idea to me. Gonna be so much que manipulation it will be outlandish.
---
Definitely!
---
Powershifting gives you 80 energy each time, 20 from helm, 40 from furor, 20 from energy tick, shredding more is a better DPS output than sitting waiting for natural energy tick with a bit extra ap/crit. Ferals fall off in long fights I agree like in naxx due to mana starvation and equipping an ap helm would be better, but most ferals won't even see naxx I imagine. 
---
Using all caps doesn't make it true. I get that there are places where convenience kills part of the game (eg dungeon finder, cross server anything). I do not buy that argument for respec costs in relation to the rest of the game. If you're playing casually enough that a gold sink like that adds depth you can easily play with one spec and ignore it (ie I didn't really respec frequently until at least BWL) and if you're at the point where the cost comes into play it's just frustrating and calling that "depth" is silly imo.
---
It's a mechanic that punishes players who can't farm or PvP with their raiding spec and punishes trying to participate in PvP and PvE content.
---
That said I'm still not arguing for a change because I can buy the case that Blizzard should deliver a good copy before we show the trust to allow changes.
---
&gt;We want to group with people and raid without being yelled at for not having bis gear and a raid optimized talent spec.
---
Well, that's just too fucking bad. Make your own raid groups and have fun wiping in MC.
---
OK what about the cat aspect for pvp and dps? and what is vael?
---
Your all-or-nothing approach isn't working here.
---
From what I understand of your opinion here, we should be going into launch with launch conditions - no patches included that fixed issues that vanilla had. 
---
Is that right?
---
You mean a PVE server? They should have rolled PVP then. This is also not 2004. People now KNOW how bad horde is compared to alliance at PVE. Crbg's won't fix a darn thing there for PVE servers. If you want to pvp simply don't play them or roll horde on a PVE server and have no guilds and 2 on 10 warsong gulch. Have fun with that.
---
&gt;They're simply not actively trying to play through the game in the extremely narrow way that's been defined as "best" by the min/max people.
---
and I'm simply not actively going to invite you to my raids so that you can simply passively wipe us over and over again with your meme spec bullshit.
---
Long time raider and current Mythic raider looking for Classic home
---
NA / Normal Server / Alliance
---
Open to raiding after 8:00 p.m. CST on week nights or Sundays (one or two nights per week)
---
As an avid multiboxer, I’ll be leveling a team consisting of the following: Bear, Warrior DPS, Mage, Lock, and Holy Paladin.  Obviously, I would choose one as a raiding main (excluding Lock).  I currently am leaning towards Mage.
---
I do not have private server experience, but I’ve been playing since release.  In Vanilla, I started raiding as a Paladin but quickly swapped to Warlock due to my desire to DPS and meet guild needs.
---
Since then, I have generally stayed up to date as a raider with some minor breaks from the game.  I’ve touched every role in the game.  My true love is tanking, but I don’t have the free time now to be on every night, as an MT in Classic should.  As such, I currently DPS as a Warrior with a Hunter alt on Live (6/9M).
---
Moreover, if multiboxing works as well on Classic as it has previously, I should be able to help people farm pre-raid BiS in short order.  It’s still yet to be seen if I can pull off some of the more sensitive movement fights in five-mans.
---
I have always desired to push myself to the hardest content I can, and Classic is no different.  I want to relive the Golden Age of raiding.  
---
If your group is a great group of friends that has a strong raiding history together, please fire me a PM.  Unfortunately, my Live group wants to stick to Live :(
---
Bonus member:  I met my wife in Molten Core.  She was the Warlock class officer.  She doesn’t play as much anymore, but she is much funnier and entertaining to play with than me with my dad jokes.  She’ll be coming too—just likely not as a raider.  Getting to sometimes do a leveling dungeon or goofball five-man with her is—I promise—more than enough reason to put up with me during raids.
---
New engine and API ya. I'd guess that the modern Wow player would know more about macros than the vanilla players using their old macros.
---
I'm waiting to see, but not worried as I am starting with Shaman and, aside from a couple quality of life macros, I can live without many early on.
---
I am interested in finding out if Blizzard will heavily tweak the API to allow Classic macro function overall even if a new format. It's important for some classes more than others.
---
Interesting, so cat form PvP is a combo of dps attacking, healing, and occassional tanking...hmm that does sound pretty fun though like having that variety - and still allowing me to go NE my fav race.
---
I don't understand the action for getting asked about mankriks wife. It says to plank until resurrected, but getting asked a question about mankriks wife should not cause you to die.
---
This is true, but it's no different than 10 other healers needing your PvE gear. 
---
Though, you don't need to pray to RNGesus for PvP gear. That's the real benefit. XD
---
col thanks for the info!
---
very cool! leveling druid would be fun!
---
Negative. I ranked as a druid. The only time I had to focus was during WSG holidays. And typically during WSG weeks, we would cap in 4 days (no real competition from our faction), then just have to log on every so often and make sure no one was trying to bust a bracket.
---
The rest of the time was spent in AB defending, which is REALLY easy a druid.
---
We were done queuing most weeks in 4 days, about 6 hours a day. Sometimes we'd have to queue more or less.
---
My last week ranking was rough, due to the amount of honor needed, but I managed due to luckily being around the holidays. I would have 100% stopped at 12, otherwise.
---
I can show you my degree and druid if you want proof?
---
yup :) pm me if you have something in mind!
---
Not because i'm doing it to be kind to my raid, but because I can't be arsed to sift through shit casual guilds. If I had it my way, i'd buff ret to do 70 percent of the damage a warrior does, alas I don't have it my way.
---
BG's popping all day would keep people from engaging in that wpvp. Think McFly, think.
---
Yeah I have become so comfortable with my macros that I will feel helpless without them. Hoping they make some sort of announcement prior to release. A lot of unanswered questions.
---
You just better hope someone comes around to gank you
---
Literally the closest I've been to working out consisently. Thank you
---
&gt;If you're rocking a balance druid and playing it to the best if your ability, and working your ass off not to be at the bottom of the DPS meters, not standing in the fire, and not being an ASSHOLE, then bravo!  You're a pretty cool dude that can raid with my guild anytime.
---
Shit man, you need to invite me. I'm an Agi-only cloth-wearing boomkin but I play 100% totally at full mental capacity all the time. I'll happily take some of the guild's loot to boost my dps!!!!!!
---
Classic will use the new macro system, so just copying the old ones for 1.12 will not work. They will need to be rewritten.
---
The Mage changes in patch 1.5.0 really made the class for me.
---
I'm not going to be raiding, but we used Zero-sum with forced buys (for stuff that either was "small" upgrades and/or for items that wasn't class-centric)
---
It worked pretty well.
---
Good on you. Still a shame in my eyes, that ret paladin, what I believe was meant to be the actual paladin class fantasy is completely sub par. 
---
Cat dps is basically just a bad rogue, the reason your taken is because you give 3 percent crit to the other melee so they can continue to out dps you
---
Feral in BG's... well if your good your gonna be the flag runner for WSG and people will love you, tbh ferals are annoying to duel against, 
---
2 good rules of thumb for feral and all meme specs is that:
---
1. Your gonna have to work extra hard since most your damage is enabled by consumes
---
2. Your gonna have a lot of fun in pvp
---
Druid is fun for open world stuff and pvp but you'll be stuck healing in groups.
---
No it would keep the people who pvp for 18 hours a day straight chasing that dumb ass honor gear. Non-stop in the world shutting down zones. World pvp is amazing. When it forms organically its fantastic. When you motivate large sections of every servers best pvp'er's to just sit in the world and farm people. You haven't created a community. You've created a game that encourages harassment.
---
shoot! I see what you mean, darn I will be PvPing a lot and wouldn't want to pick a gimp spec.
---
What do you think about enhancement shaman for PvP?
---
You represented 20 percent of something as it in totality which makes you a complete joke. 5 months out of 2 years being "no changes"? is the biggest lie and misrepresentation we have had since Classic WoW was announced and it has all come from the same clique of streamers. At this point I hope they put in CRBG's so they all get turned on and their career is over. It will 100 percent happen, because as I showed in my OP, the VAST majority of people don't want this crap and accepted it would never happen due to Brack's statements. Pull a switcheroo and add it and have fun losing hundred million through the years to appease a fanbase of edgelord teens who want to be like Asmongold and ninja banks and screw people over. Catering to sociopaths is always a good thing. Oh wait, Overwatch is now failing due to a horrible community.
---
Yes the earlier, easier raids are going to be doable with sub-par specs but the deeper into raiding you get and the more competitive your group is the less wiggle room there is for bad specs. That's a problem that generally takes care of itself though because players who run those off specs won't be accepted into a competitive guilds so this problem people keep complaining about is really a non-issue.
---
I wouldn't call 2%+ crit a wee bit, in Vanilla.
---
And without the natural shift talent you can only shift twice without waiting for your entire MP pool to regen. (Assuming the DB is correct in it requiring 55%). Then you are back to just playing Cat normally.
---
These are so cringe.
---
&gt;“Let’s all play the game like me, because that’s the only possible way to have fun.”
---
All I'm reading from your comments is
---
&gt;It doesn't matter that I do 1/10th this other guy's dps, I have every right to raid in your guild and roll for loot, and if you don't accept me you're an E L I T I S T
---
So, I think we'll have to agree to disagree. Enjoy raid groups filled with ret pallies and boomkins raiding MC for the first 4 years of classic before you inevitably become a hypocrite "elitist".
---
&gt;You mean a PVE server? 
---
Nope.
---
Any more strawmen?
---
Deadmines was called DM before Dire Maul existed.
---
Dire Maul people stole it ...THEY STOLE IT !
---
After doing much theory crafting BRE and even Ubtaimed Blade could easily be better than Ashkandi in PvE as 2h fury. All depends on proc chances and how armour penetration and boss armour is set up.
---
Ashkandi is a PvP/Prestige weapon for warriors, so serious guilds should have it as OS for Fury and Prot alike.
---
lol hypothetically? I don't know about you but in my psuedo-casual raiding guild in Vanilla we had people constantly afk throughout the entire raid.
---
Also vael is the second boss in BWL, with proper gameplay, i have seen outrageous amounts of threat generated by bear tanks since they have a higher tos then a warrior when vael gives them unlimited rage 
---
How is playing a gnome rogue hurting other players experiences?  Seriously explain this to me.  Outside of the guilds pushing for world firsts, how will playing a gnome rogue make anyone’s experiences unenjoyable? I honestly can’t tell if your even serious anymore.  
---
I’m choosing to cooperate with like minded people,  not people who think I’m ruining their fun for playing a gnome rogue.  Did you ever think different people have different goals? What do you not get about that?  Like holy shit this is actually hilarious that your calling me selfish and ruining everyone’s fun for wanting to play a gnome rogue.  
---
&gt;we still had a blast progressing through content.
---
Doubt
---
It's great to hear gamers living life like that! It's great to play with healthy people, even if we don't get to see ya as often. There's plenty of room for ya in classic, but it's good to manage expectations going in. 
---
ahh darn if feral is weak in PvP then I dont think i should waste time on it, shoot.
---
How is enhancement for pvp?
---
You obviously never played real Vanilla WoW. People don't play 24/7 because it's not international like private servers. The pop was 3000 a server not 15,000. The rankers all knew each other and basically set guidelines for ranking. If you played outside that to get more rank you were pretty much blacklisted from the farm groups. Thanks for proving you are as big a fraud as Classicast and Asmongold though.
---
Agreed, we neither know the scope or probability sharding will even be used in the first place.
---
I still stand on the side of "no sharding" if at all possible, and have players deal with the impact of gameplay that will be temporary anyway.
---
As for server stability, I'd rather blizzard use stronger servers that can actually handle large volumes of players in single zones rather than rely on ever needing sharding to solve this issue.
---
The only statement we can go by is that ion stated end game there will only ever be 1 kazzak, 1 azurgos, and that they are looking st sharding to potentially be used in a limited fashion to assist classic launch. These statements appear to be goals and ideals rather than set in stone policy they are abiding by.
---
There's a difference between doing shit with your guild and doing shit in a pug.

Horde is gonna be nothing but Chads after those situps.
---
If you want to know why, find my comments of a “min-maxer” saying I’m selfish and ruining everyone’s fun for wanting to play a GNOME rogue.  ROFL.

Loot trading is in the base game they are working from. It would take dev time to remove it.
---
&gt;is the biggest lie and misrepresentation we have had since Classic WoW was announced and it has all come from the same clique of streamers.

1.12 release date: 22 August 2006
---
BC release date: 16 January 2007
---
&gt;because as I showed in my OP with threads from both the EU and US forums, the VAST majority of people don't want this crap and accepted it would never happen due to Brack's statements
---
Why are you ignoring the threads from the EU and US forums that *supported* it? Or the supporters here? How can you quantify the "VAST" majority?
---
&gt;Catering to sociopaths is always a good thing.
---
You are taking this way, way, way too seriously.
---
How I got into every guild:
---
"I'm good at the game, but most importantly I have no life no responsibilities and I will show up early to every single raid fully buffed and prepared.
---
Don’t tell me how to suck myself.  I’ll be just fine.
---
I've never seen a Classicast or Asmongold video. What the fuck are you even asking?
---
Yeah full feral is, the hybrid spec is really good though. Lol pretty much the same, fun but not optimal against good pvpers, the only shaman pvp spec for serious pvpers is 30/0/21. Enhancement is just auto attacking and hoping for a windfury proc. Sometimes you'll one shot people but most of the times you'll get kited to death
---
Bamboozled again!
---
PvP servers were pretty well balanced back then. If you joined one that was heavily imbalanced without checking the server forums, you were A) clueless b) had only yourself to blame.
---
Stupid people shouldn't ruin the game for people who take 10 seconds to check a server forum.
---
&gt; so why is it different in classic
---
BECAUSE THAT'S HOW IT WAS IN CLASSIC.
---
&gt; but if you're grouping with strangers or people outside your guild (aka 90% of the game) then demanding they do things a certain way is arrogant.
---
Do you not realize how incredibly rare the scenario you described is? Most tryhard min-maxers have their own premade groups and won't need to pug or those that do will find acceptable party members (most likely by inspecting them before inviting them) and accept whatever gear/spec they come with. The only "demanding" those groups will do is what any other standard party expects of their members (buff your party, give mage food, cc designated targets, etc.)
---
Do you really think min-max groups are going to invite a boomkin then start shit talking their spec or demand they respec?
---
Tanking, cat DPS, kiting, ranged DPS, healing, it has it all, plus you can pick your fights, go for it man, it's good. 
---
And if you know how to FC in wsg, people will love you. 
---
Vanilla had 1 year 7 months of no cross realm BG's. Time for you to say strawman again while using an actual strawman. Who do you think you are kidding there?
---
Imagine being such a salty little boy that you get tilted over a 3 month old comment... and then respond. 
---
&gt; What do you think about enhancement shaman for PvP?
---
can 1 shot people randomly
---
but its rare and between that he can be pretty mediocre
---
I literally said in the quote to play who you want to play with.
---
Thanks for reaffirming my point
---
&gt; How is playing a gnome rogue hurting other players experiences? Seriously explain this to me. 
---
You're making the shit you're doing with them take longer, thereby wasting their time.
---
Now explain to me how the game becomes any more enjoyable for you by playing a gnome.
---
&gt; I’m choosing to cooperate with like minded people
---
So you never intend on pugging, ever?
---
&gt; Like holy shit this is actually hilarious that your calling me selfish and ruining everyone’s fun for wanting to play a gnome rogue.
---
and it's incredibly sad that you can't see how selfish you're being.
---
LOL at not even realizing we had rank 14 as honor gear with pre patch and it was no longer "vanilla". We even had TBC talents champ. Thanks again for exposing yourself as a fraud.
---
Sounds great. If you’re Alliance feel free to join my Guild
---
Do you have any advice on where I can find the rewritten macros or is it too early?
---
Your toxicity and elitism is way more of a threat to this game than crossrealm BGs ever could be. I hope they have them solely so people like you won't play.
---
&gt;straw man

---
&gt;an intentionally misrepresented proposition that is set up because it is easier to defeat than an opponent's real argument.
---
OP, I don't hate you. Everyone has their own way of enjoying the game. However, there becomes this elitism mentality around many of those players that seeps into the entirety of the community.
---
It is kind of like a cascading effect in a way. This whole idea that if you are not playing the meta, you are doing it wrong takes over. I would say in many situations it's the vocal minority that makes everyone else look bad. 
---
I'm content being a helpful af class without being in the limelight. I've always enjoyed that about shaman because no one really expects you to do this/that as well as the pure classes, but damn if people always appreciate you being competent. You just make everyone else's job so much easier.
---
100% the same, dude. I don't agree with the #nochanges crowd; what's the harm in making boomkins or ret do considerably more damage so that they're actually viable?
---
I could never find the floating junk piles. They spawn around the dock, right?
---
Agreed.  TBC did a few things wrong, but in my opinion was the pinnacle of WoW thanks to the class balancing.  They really hit the sweet spot with pure DPS doing more damage but hybrid DPS like Ret and Boomkins still being quite good.
---
Ah right, prepatch.

A solid 3.5 months of XRBG. 15% is still no small duration.

You brought up retail having more to do, I just disagree. I agree PvP is a lame grind, but calling retail PvP anymore skill-based than vanilla is a stretch, it's been a button-mashy joke for a long time. And vanilla raids are very easy, yes
---
&gt;I just don't understand the hate for retail
---
Lmao alright man. No clue after months of the retail community tearing itself apart over the total sham of BfA right after the success of Legion, or after I tell you exactly why I can't stand how bland, repetitive and formulaic the endgame has been for years despite that being the only thing it even tries to have anymore. Fucking zoinks scoob what a mystery
---
Forever LFG
---
Nobody ever simply writes "DM" for Dire Maul since you wouldn't know which fucking one of East/West/North it would be, so it's not really a problem. Also, shift-click will reveal the player level, so yeah. Big problem. 
---
"elitism"? I am looking out for the casual player and alliance on PVP servers in my OP. Check my post history. I almost always play horde and I lean towards the hardcore side. I am not punished with this crap. The casual players who I am trying to look out for are. The people Classicast and Asmongold don't care about as they manipulate people while calling the people who don't accept their BS "morons" and "retards" on their live streams.  No wonder Blizzard didn't let Asmon have a press pass. Why would they? The guy is the most toxic sociopath to ever stream a game and a cancer to the community.
---
Gotta try this myself. I have packed on the pounds in the last 3 years.  Up to 330.  I need a good solid plan to drop about 75lbs.   I’m 6’5” so I’m not just round but I’m getting close at this weight. 
---
The time constraints wont be too much at the start. But that wont last long.
---
But once Naxx is released and you have to farm MC, BWL, AQ, ZG, World bosses and Naxx... yikes. Plus farming for flask and raid buffs.
---
NP, your thread made me start reminiscing and I wrote this: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i_envy_those_rolling_druid_for_the_first_time/

I have not begun looking for new macros yet. I figured that they will be all over the place a week or two before launch so I wait.

Camp with no fire is 👌

---
I respect a casual/inefficient players right to play and enjoy the game, I hope they respect my right to not want my time wasted by said inefficient players in my groups.
---
Won't matter because I'll be done with pre raid content before the bads even show up in LFG. That's the best part about going hard from the rip, autofilters out the trash so only people looking to do the same content as me are probably as good or better than me.
---
You said it better than I could. Its not the min maxxers themselves that suck the fun out of the game, but the elitists. Many times they are the vocal minority but I have seen a growing pattern over the years where there are more and more people with this elitist mentality. 
---
Unless you are pushing for hardcore progression, I see no reason on having to be forced to play any particular way. 
---
Heh, I wrote this just now inspired by a different person's question about druids, and I think you'll enjoy it:
---
[https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i\_envy\_those\_rolling\_druid\_for\_the\_first\_time/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/b2ongg/i_envy_those_rolling_druid_for_the_first_time/)
---
The TLDR is druids in classic are super fun and I highly recommend them, ESPECIALLY if you're not going to be hardcore raiding. 
---
Yep. It was also possible to "share" Tubers and NDBs
---
Levelling: Druids are an extremely good levelling class, second only to Hunters. You have next to no downtime thanks to mana continuing to regenerate whilst in forms, access to stealth allowing you to quickly complete many quests by skipping mobs, travel form and Feline Swiftness giving you much faster movement and decent CC in Entangling Roots allowing you to solo some elite outdoor mobs. 
---
Dungeons: Feral Spec for levelling will also allow you to be an excellent dungeon tank. Some people consider Druids to actually be the best dungeon tank, but regardless of whether that's true or not, they're absolutely very good tanks. Given that tanks are almost always the most difficult class to find, you should never have issues finding a party. Furthermore, many Warriors will have rolled the class to do sick dps and will baulk at being asked to tank, making you even more sought after. Your biggest downside on Horde side is not benefiting from Windfury Totem. And in the event that the tank position is filled, you can fall back on healing. Your only downside is that your only resurrection spell has a 30 minute cooldown, so being the only healer can be difficult. 
---
PvP: This can be a real rollercoaster for Druids. Check out [Azgaz's PvP videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EekNxwQ7izg) for a taste of what Druids can do. You can heal reasonably well, especially on Horde side since you don't have to worry as much about your HoTs being dispelled, and access to stealth is always powerful in PvP. Balance spec is actually viable but requires a lot of gear, and gear for Hybrid playstyles is limited to PvP rewards, AQ40 and the Tier 0.5 set. Your DPS tends to remain fairly low compared to other equally geared classes, but on the flip side your survivability and mobility are extremely high. In Warsong Gultch, expect to always be carrying the flag. 
---
What kind of macros are you looking for?
---
I agree with loot council on legendary/super rare items but those situations are few and far between. The way those worked in my guild was we gave them out based on attendance, which we still used DKP system to track. 
---
That goes for any group, most people don't hate the reasonable, rational part of any group, they dislike the loud, obnoxious, my way or the highway part of a group. The issue I see is that I see an overabundance of anti-min maxer threads while I generally see no threads of said min-maxers shitting on non-min-maxers
---
Looking forward to playing mage for the first time. Gonna enjoy simple rotations and sheeping.
---
These are incredible. Brings back all kinds of nostalgic feelings! 
---
I 100% agree. People that wanna play ret pally or boomkin or other meme specs shouldn't expect people to take them into raids.
---
This right here!
---
I'm sure. Just don't expect raid leaders to take you into raids.
---
Uh I don't think you know how ratios and percentages work. 
---
Go ahead and cater to these streamers Blizzard. Enjoy a pushback bigger than Diablo while catering to professional outrage artists and a community that listens to a mentally ill sociopath trash your company all day for 90 percent of his stream before having a breakdown after realizing he wasn't talented or entertaining enough to stream anything else and outrage and repeating the same thing every day and same content only sells for so long.
---
&gt;Alliance humans get access to the +weapon skill for swords and maces which helps them gear fury easier than the orc +axes. 
---
I'm not sure this is true. You have to fight over the good swords with the rogues. Its true that there is no axe counterpart for the swords that drop off KT, but for 99% of people that won't matter. There are good axes which are comparable to whatever swords are available for the rest of the game.
---
Yeah I mean obviously it will be a different type of challenge but now you have multiple guilds trying to get 40 people leveled as fast as possible and going to MC very undergeared which will provide its own challenge all to be first to kill ragnaros. 
---
I feel the same way. I'm worried that I won't be able to request vacation off in time if they keep delaying the release date.
---
This is all true, it's just that the class is very complex so a lot of people will give up and reroll before they even hit 60, and some do it at 60. A lot of people will think "well if I wanted to be a healer I'll just go priest" or "if I want to stealth around and nuke people i'll just roll rogue " etc and tbh I understand them, the class is not for everyone. And in PvP they are harder to play than other classes but very good and rewarding once you learn it. 
---
I think a streamer killed this guy's dog or something
---
Any warrior you won't know until 40, and only if you also get a great weapon at that level.
---
Because you are rage starved until endgame unless you get help/lucky drops warrior is paced like a mage starting combat with 0 mana....
---
People are worried about the prevailing culture that Classic will have at launch. 
---
The people who don't want to min-max, hunt for BiS, whatever, are worried there won't be a place for them at all in later game content. And with all the rhetoric that goes around "if you aren't our build you're dead weight", "you just want to have people carry you" I can see the tension.
---
And all the strawmen and stupid hyperbole crap just divides people more. This sub is a mess and I really hope things are more relaxed come launch.
---
Sit ups put a lot of pressure on your discs so i wouldn't recommend doing them.
---
Yea me and my friend are kinda like this. When a new expansion or content drops we level separately because I love reading all the quest text and experience the storyline of the game while he only cares about getting to max level and pre-raid gearing. Once I'm done leveling and going through the story I kick into his mindset so I join him on the min-maxing/preparing for raids. It's a mutual understanding that we both enjoy the start of games differently and that's absolutely fine.
---
What did I just watch?
---
Change out chuck Norris joke for a 12 year old saying the n-word or political trolling and it will probably fit modern barrens chat a lot better. 
---
Have to say I wholeheartedly agree 100% with this post. I first mained a Druid in 05 and 06, and by miles was it the most fun to level. At 60 I naturally went Resto, healed a few 5mans and some BRS. But soon switched to Mage. I'm really torn between Druid and Warrior this time around, and probably going to end up with both really. Again, this post is so true!
---
You plank until Mankrik's wife gets resurrected.
---
Speaking of which, where are all the restrooms in this universe
---
I've never played WoW at all and I'ved decided to roll a feral druid as my first ever class, I'm super excited to play.
---
If looking at a forum or asking in chat while low level how population is, you shouldn't be playing a MMO. 
---
That isn't me being an elitist. If you consider that "elitism" then good luck with Classic WoW and not communicating with anyone. Maybe that is why you want cross realm BG's. So you can sit there solo queuing all day and not dealing with "elitists". 
---
This conversation is simply too stupid to continue. Have a nice day. I don't really care anymore. If Blizzard wants to cater to these frauds and go under by ruining the one IP they have that is still worth money? Go right ahead. WoW's growth happened before streaming. Streaming will do nothing and all these people will cry about everything. The wannabe esport athetes that suck at real esport games will cry about "balance". The lazy players will cry about time and professions. The streamers who get camped will cry about wpvp. Catering to these people is a lost cause. It always was. You made them a esport game (Overwatch) and they don't play it. You made them esport level pve and no one does it. You took away the world mattering and they complain they have nothing to do.
---
don't believe the image, people are way to "not in a celebration mood" 😅😘
---
To be completely honest, I don’t understand why they would say “Summer 2019” woth saying July 16th or August 20th or what have you. I find that announcement very broad and perplexing. Yeah it’s better then them not saying anything. But Summer spawns across 3-4 months or so and that could be any date. I too find it very frustrating. 
---
Nobody back then called it Van Cleef. It was called VC as a shorthand. Since people commonly made groups in the general chat of major cities it was much less confusing to use VC for deadmines and DM for Dire Maul. Hate it or not, its the system that the community adopted.
---
without*
---
I don't think you understand how that helm is useful in PvP. You don't powershift to gain dps there, you switch forms to add more utility to yourself. For example you can switch into cat, go to stealth and pounce right away (if not in combat) giving you okayish burst and a stun, or more commonly, switch to bear and be able to charge and stun in 2 GCD. Then you go out, heal up if needed or stay in bear form. You aren't supposed to switch back and forth.
---
And in AB you will likely defend a flag and kite around, since that is what druids excel at, not being a big fight healer. That is what I meant by small skirmishes. In WSG you will likely be in the middle of the fight carrying the flag, but having more rage when going bear (which you should to be more tanky btw) is never a bad thing.
---
Druids do change forms regularly to dispell CCs anyway.
---
I have about 8-10 Hunter macros that I use religiously on pservers
---
The reason it’s easier to gear is two choices vs one. Not saying swords and maces are better than axe equivalent, just having two routes to have 305 skill on your weapon while dual wielding is very helpful before you’re BiS. When you are BiS, none of this matters and alliance and horde warriors are basically equal.
---
I agree, org is the best, my brother and I used to argue over either undercity or orgrimmar was cooler, and I even started as a alliance and prefer their races, but orgrimmar is always home &lt;3
---
No, they were not right in adding them. They're one of the things people hate, along with any form of cross-server. It's one of the things that have made people scream and petition for classic servers.
---
We've gone though this, we've seen the damage it caused and why it's bad for the game. Why are we allowing history to repeat itself? Just..why?
---
My biggest recommendation. Is that if you wanna lose weight. I would Highly suggest two things. The first is start intermittent fasting. Thats picking a 16 hour window where you may not eat and, an 8 hour window where you will. The second is If you are like me and not someone who likes to be an athlete. I would Highly suggest you prioritize building muscle over actually loosing weight. Every pound of muscle you build. Burns 70 calories a day. At your height no reason to go running. Just flex up and turn your body into a fat burning furnace.
---
so that's why retailers are none fit *wink wink*
---
Feral isn't that bad for pvp, just cat form is really bad. Enhance is basically a warrior with no plate, no intercept, and no mortal strike. It has some super rng burst and purge but it definitely wouldn't be in the top half of pvp specs for vanilla.  
---
Typically classes have 1 spec they are good at for pvp in vanilla, a few have 2 situationally but if you want to be strong at pvp really you should just chose a strong spec.
---
Most game subreddits have a population of elitist casuals who think anybody who cares more about the game than they do is a toxic no-lifer. 
---
These people are a minority and they're almost always more toxic than actual diehards. 
---
Thanks buddy, I appreciate all that. I would push back on this one bit however: 
---
&gt;This is all true, it's just that the class is very complex so a lot of people will give up and reroll before they even hit 60, and some do it at 60.
---
 They're complex compared to some other classes in vanilla. More complex than vanilla mages and possibly vanilla priests -someone can correct me if I'm wrong there-, but compared to any class in WoTLK they're usually pretty simple in whichever role they're in at the time. I would say they're less complex than warriors, and maybe less complex than Shamans and Rogues as well (though I don't have much experience with either of those classes in vanilla). 
---
Anyways, I agree with the rest of it, but I don't think complexity is the limiting factor for people. Glad to hear you're maining a a druid, you'll have a blast :). 
---
This is pure nonsense. This made up agreement you are speaking of never existed. Everyone on classic servers who got HW got there by being a no life who played 18 hours a day. Or got their by sharing their account with a nearby friend. This nonsense where gentleman agreed to windows of acceptable play time is laughable. Keep calling everyone smarter then you a fraud though. It makes you look great.
---
All I’m hearing is to make sure my future orc warlock camps STV after being in the first wave of level 60 chars.
---
Lets just hope they can make it to level 10 lol.
---
People complain about hunters before there pets, but I found Druids before bear form by far the worst.
---
The little OFC
---
More specific? :p
---
Everything is more efficient because everyone is more knowledgeable and skilled and so raids will go quicker and smoother. 2-3 hours instead of 3-4.
---
It is time consuming but... you put in x amount of time and you get x amount of reward, so there's really no problem. It's not like live WoW where you can luck big time and "earn" great gear by putting in 30min a day. No casino here.
---
He likes to sit down and drink after every 2 mobs.
---
Mrrrglmrglrglrglrgl
---
These graphics don't look like they from 2005...
---
He left the company because video games is a miserable business to work in now due to streaming. You have several loud vocal minorities that all want different things and when you listen to one you alienate another. Only a masochist would still want to work in this field. Probably why Blizzard fired their CM's. They are useless in the end and trying to get on these streamers good side is pointless. What did EA do with Apex? They took the money they would have spent on CM's and just handed the biggest streamer a million bucks to promote it.
---
 [https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/13/ea-paid-ninja-1-million-to-stream-apex-legends/](https://www.engadget.com/2019/03/13/ea-paid-ninja-1-million-to-stream-apex-legends/) 
---
Expect Activision/Blizzard to do the same kind of things in the future with their influencers. No more meetings and trying to include these dumb streamers in game design (that they nothing about and I would argue streamers hurt MMO's more than helped due to quality of life changes). Just hand them money and tell them to shill and shut up with any criticism. 
---
Want to know why Apex was good? It had no streamers and BETA and devs could follow a real vision like old Blizzard did instead of wasting time changing game design and making compromises.
---
i requested time off after the july 16 easter egg at blizzcon was made known.
---
hope it pays off...  but might just be sitting around for a week reading classic forums again lol
---
Hah! Well that's true. I didn't find it so bad due to having played a mage till 60, so spamming wrath felt about the same as spamming frostbolt in my eyes. But yeah, a druid before they get what makes them truly druids is not great. Plus moonfire is kind of fun due to being instant cast and no cooldown, but costing a bunch of mana so you can't spam it but can be fun to finish off a monster with it even though it's not efficient. 
---
Best bet is to make macros based off of retail's current system and then edit them to work when Classic launches.  
---
&gt; In WSG you will likely be in the middle of the fight carrying the flag
---
You'll get plenty of rage from everyone trying to whack you.
---
You don't change forms *regularly* to dispel CC. You change forms to dispel CC when it's *beneficial* to do so. Managing your mana is important in PvP, or you won't be able to swap forms for "utility".
---
You're in for a treat buddy, they're a blast and a great way to get introduced to the game I think. 
---
I'm interested! Serious but not hardcore is what I'm looking for. Could you pm me anything I need to know or questions? 
---
TY, but i don't want this type of guide, i would pref a guide for warrior which tell me which quests i shouldn't miss, which zone can give some interesting items, which spells rotations is nice etc
---
Hear here!
---
This is the distilled essence of why people dislike minmaxers. 
---
"Anyone who doesn't play the optimal spec is an asshole."
---
People play this game to have fun. If you have a problem with that, then yes, the weight is on your shoulders to avoid that problem.
---
Thanks buddy! Yeah I was contemplating playing a warrior too, I opted against it since I suspect there'll be a lot of warriors, and I'm worried I might not be as good of a tank as others... But that might just be me being self conscious. Plus Priest seems really fun and healing is fun. Best of luck in classic!! 
---
You are the most persistent troll I've seen in years. Either that or your fragile ego can't take being wrong. But I'm almost certain you were trolling from the start.
---
No, I'm calling people assholes because they're playing the game for their own fun at the detriment of others.
---
Min/maxing is looked down upon here because the vast majority of posters have unrealistic expectations about vanilla endgame.
---
That's what I'll be doing. 
---
They're both DM. Just shift click the name and it's pretty fucking obvious which one is meant.
---
Your attitude is a detriment to others; should you change it? Otherwise, you're putting more weight on THEIR shoulders, because of the way YOU like to play the game.
---
Check out skarm tank on YouTube if you're interested in bear tanking, he has a lot of videos and goes into great depth explaining the viability and weaknesses of bears in high end raiding content.
---
I guess bobs guy is trying to troll. Or clearly retarded. Still deciding
---
Yeah I am kind of worried someone is going to book time off for release and since holidays are first come first served.
---
And then they get flagged for helping and get murdered.
---
Seeing this artwork makes me want to play as an undead character come launch time. I always have such a hard time deciding between undead and orcs. 
---
30.
---
Absolutely, and you shouldn't expect people to invite you to groups if you're being purposefully sub-optimal. 
---
And if they don't invite you to every group and, at 60, raids, they're E L I T I S T.
---
Horde players are going to have some shredded abs.
---
I think the argument that sharding is going to preserve the population is bull crap. If they do sharding they lose their base to begin with and have nowhere to go but down.
---
Are you saying I'm a fake?? How dare you sir... I'll have you know on Netherwing I have over 200hks at level 49. I world PvP over questing every time.
---
Oh shit you've just gone against the hivemind &gt;:(
---
Well, to be fair, BfA art is scaling down and actually has down-to earth, realistic, adventurer-like sets. I really like them.
---
not #1 in anything, except being #1 :)
---
My thoughts are that you have very poor understanding of capitalisem and comunisem.
---
So true! 
---
Thanks for the advice.  I am a former college athlete so being an athlete isn’t the issue. Two companies, 3 kids, and a massive mortgage/bills and the stress that comes with it are what has gotten to me.   Thanks again man.  Keep up the good work. 
---
The reality is that at the moment classic isn't released, so group #2 is being targeted for presumed discrimination, while group #1 will complain for the next three years that the game is unfair, unfun, and unbalanced because ret pallies can't make up 30% of the raid group in Naxx.
---
We have a vacation draw where I work. It’s based off of seniority, so those who have worked there the longest get first pick. I let nine others go in front of me and chose not to bid at all. Just waiting for that launch day announcement...
---
NP you too.
---
I mean, if you're a solo player that isn't joining a guild held together by friendship, you can't expect people to carry you through content if you choose to play a spec that is terribly sub-optimal.
---
Are you going to be all right?
---
So apparently there are two things. Before coming into this thread my answer was that people are afraid that really min-maxing is going to kill a lot of what people liked. The discovery, trying new things, playing with people you don't know. And even in end game, a lot of content will be easier with more knowledge of the game and if expecting everyone to farm every best piece of great before raiding becomes the norm it can defeat some of the fun and challenge.
---
After coming into the thread it seems there are also people who want to gear and spec however they want and be treated like they're useful and not get replaced by specs that are useful.
---
Who is it to the detriment of and why does it hurt them?
---
&gt; We have a vacation draw where I work. It’s based off of seniority, so those who have worked there the longest get first pick
---
That sounds terrible.
---
I have something like 220 hours right now, and so long as I give like ... a week ... head's up to my boss, we're cool.
---
For real 
---
It seems some (not all) people who just want to goof around and play sub-optimally still feel entitled to the same rewards as those who min-max. That's the real issue.
---
If you don't want to play optimally, thats your prerogative, so by all means go ahead! But don't expect to be taken to a PuG over someone who's got better gear/talents etc.
---
&gt; When people refuse to group with bad specs, or insist that they should get gear because it's BiS according to some excel sheet, that shit is not fun.
---
Bringing a shit geared 2 handed Fury warrior who does very little damage to a dungeon run which increases the how long the dungeon takes is shit that's not fun.
---
And it's ironic that you talk about how having a gear or skill standard hurts the game because people not wanting to live up to a standard like that is exactly what caused retail to turn into the game it is today. 
---
Shit, you're the exact type of person that this argument isn't aimed at. If you have no expectations about raiding or end-game 5-man content, then nobody really cares what your spec is.
---
In comparison with retail, the BfA release date (14th August) was announced on 5th April. And since summer 2019 probably means June-July, we can expect to have a release date soon (not soon™).
---
&gt;skilled allies
---
fucking ELITISM &gt;:( &gt;:( &gt;:(
---
Yeah, exactly.
---
I'm seriously contemplating a new rig just for vanilla, and for the other games that will collect dust. Definitely burning some PTO once I get a date on the drop.
---
People always get ass hurt because I don't help them but I don't owe them shit. You get yourself caught and killed that's not my problem. 
---
&gt; Sounds good. I'll be halfway through Naxx and ret pallies/boomkins will be stuck on Ony or (much more likely) switched to healing 
---
This only is enough to show that you don't understand others way of thinking : We don't fucking care how fast we hard. Good job, good job and good job ! But leave-us-the-fuck-alone. Thanks.
---
The first point really dates this guide.
---
Playing a video game “to have fun” in 2019?
---
Druid will be least, hunter probably right after Druid.
---
Shamans and pallys will technically be “least” but because they can only be 1 faction they will be pretty popular.
---
Mage war rogue will be most
---
Everything else middle
---
So hateful hahaha
---
I just put together my rig. Gonna order it when the release date is announced
---
yea and having people randomly afk in a pug dungeon was still pretty common (And if it was excessive it was a good way to get blacklisted from my groups). Anyways my point wasn't that afking is acceptable, it's that afking was as prevalent as players in bad specs :)
---
&gt;Who is it to the detriment of
---
Anyone who doesn't want to minmax.
---
&gt;and why does it hurt them?
---
They can't play the game to their enjoyment without being harassed and called assholes.
---
Happy Cake Day nullsignature! To a person that’s charming, talented, and witty, and reminds me a lot of myself.
---
I respect the stance but also fuck you
---
My first character ever I was trying to explore and somehow fell off Teldrassil. Could not figure out how to get to my body so I decided that I had to delete my character. No other way.
---
Druid definitely. They get far less giant crits in pvp videos :P
---
The itemization is all over the place for them but if you can get decent high end sets they can do some crazy shit. 
---
It's not a matter of speed. It's a matter of whether or not you will ever be able to complete that content without begging a couple dozen "mix-maxers" to carry you through it.
---
Just recently I started the journey from redridge to ashenvale, but I had an elite quest in loch modan so I found a party for that on the way, since I had to walk from the loch till wetlands anyway.
---
And wetlands was crowded as hell for all the higher levels wanting to go to kalimdor.
---
It felt alive and adventurous as opposed to a quick port a FP to a place you've never been.
---
&gt; They can't play the game to their enjoyment
---
Because if they can't press button A instead of button B the game is not fun?
---
&gt; without being harassed and called assholes.
---
Who have I harassed? But yea, they are selfish assholes.
---
it was me smash that like button
---
Yes there will be lots of guilds who will happily bring sub-optimal specs and classes, they'll just progress slower but that's the price you pay (that a lot of people are quite happy to pay I might add) for not playing optimally
---
Nope. **No one needs any help in this game unless he's looking for it.** Scaring players because there would be "a" way to play your class or to gear your character is one of the things that will kill this game.
---
Just stop encouraging people doing that.
---
I think the sharding might become a necessity, whether people like the idea or not-the idea of a shard swapping item is something I thought of to compensate the lack of clarity of the sharding system and I thought of it combining the obvious ability of the hearthstone and my memory of how some smaller mmos (note:that I played like 8 years ago) used to deal with sharding. I think its a perfectly reasonable option for Classic to do some time down the road, and it might prove to be a nice middleground to what people are looking for vs what they can achieve.
---
I'm so behind on what's the latest and greatest. 15 years ago, I would know exactly what I needed. Now, feels like I'm reading another language lmao
---
I suspect Paladin. 
---
1. They're faction-specific. 
---
2. They're one of the slowest classes to level.
---
3. They're worse than warriors or feral druids at tanking. 
---
4. They're worse than (I think?) every other class for DPS. 
---
It's a pity because they're a really cool class, but I just don't think they're complete enough design-wise in Classic. 
---
Why you so angry friend
---
Expecting someone else to change *their* playstyle so that *you* aren't inconvenienced is peak entitlement. 
---
This game is ~15 years old. You dont need a new rig to play it.
---
I think the time commitment is overblown.
---
Contrary to popular opinion, you didn't need consumables on fights until Naxx. Even in Vanilla. They helped, sure. But enrage timers were far too rare and would often be abstract stuff that could very easily be worked around.
---
Off the top of my head, you had healer mana, threat caps, Vael, Huhuran and one quarter of one whole hour to deal like 2 million damage to Twin emps. It wasn't a whole lot. And 1.12 talents will have a higher impact for most classes than consumables.
---
On top of that, I think players being just flat better now than they were 14 years ago is going to help way more than people think. Look for old naxx kills from 2006 and count the keyboard turners.
---
Hardcore guilds are going to drive away their members real quick once they realize that putting actual brain cell effort into bosses like Ebonroc is just wasted. It's not really tenable to expect 40 guys to all be on board with putting maximum effort into minimum difficulty bosses. They're going to burn out and Classic WoW is going to be the side hoe MMO for a ton of people. Not that that's a bad thing.
---
due to faction restriction shaman or pally.
---
Everything you would need to know is on our subreddit r/workingadultsguild 
---
But yes I’ll take PM’s
---
only two DCs? good attempt 😂
---
Well for an example, lets use the Feign/Trap macro. Currently its a fairly long scripted macro that I don't feel like typing out unless you need me to :D hahah

All of us with your false equivalencies. You have decided that playing as a non-optimal spec is the same as afking. Most of us so not believe those are the same level of offense. AFKing in a boss battle is like throwing a brick through a window. Sub-optimal class is like driving the speed limit in the passing lane.
---
Do you think rogues and/or warriors will be overpopulated?
---
Not angry at all. I think it's funny as fuck people rage out because you wont help them. Shit makes my day. 
---
I feel you bro
---
Nah, I know that. There's a few other recent games that my current rig can't handle. I can play retail now, but on like low/med settings.
---
Hah or just get it all done with for 30mins-1hr a day and play uninterrupted so you’re not stuck doing sit ups all day because trade chat is spamming chuck norris jokes. 
---
Either can work, Fury has better early talents, specifically 5% crit and Piercing Howl which can be a real life saver.
---
Dual wielding isn't worth it until you get +hit gear and lots of AP. Stick with 2H.
---
Optimal leveling specs wont match end game specs. Specifically Imp. Charge makes it into my leveling spec because Rank 1 and 2 Charge are only 9 or 12 rage which isn't enough for a skill and you dont get rank 3 until your ~46.
---
With limited crit I dont go down the impale route until later, and I avoid weapon specific talents in favour of generic 2H spec.
---
My personal preference is
---
3 Heroic strike, 2 Rend, 1 Charge, 4 Tac Mastery, 2  Overpower, 5 Cruelty, 1 Rend, 2 Deep Wounds, 5 2H spec, 1 SS, 1 Deep Wounds, 2 Impale, 1 Ac Masery
---
Then respec at 40 to get MS, ditching Imp. Charge (and Imp. HS unless you want to tank), add Imp. Hamstring and Deflection.
---
5 Cruelty, 5 Umbridled Wrath, 1 Piercing Howl, 4 Battle Shout, 2 Execute, 1 Battle Shout, 1 Enrage
---
Respec at 60.
---
&gt; Expecting someone else to not be an asshole so that everyone they play with aren't inconvenienced is peak entitlement.
---
Are you even listening to yourself?
---
What's more entitled than being a detriment to 4/9/19/39 other players for your own "benefit" (which no one has managed to even articulate how it's going to positively impact them in any way)

Off-tank talent build warrior so I can pvp in the spec as well. 
---
I find of the classes I've tried Druid is the hardest to play decently. 
---
For me the biggest mistake was thinking I was a warrior/rogue/priest knockoff and trying to play like those classes. Ex. if I was out leveling in cat form and started dying, I'd try to out-damage the mob instead of shifting out and rooting it, healing myself or shifting into bear. Once I learned to utilize my entire toolkit and not rely on one form too much combat became significantly better. 
---
I never raided in Vanilla - if I just clear BWL and nothing else, I’ll still be happy so long as I have fun doing it. I have a job in real life, I don’t want one in WoW.
---
But they're insane in pvp and healing.
---
So much this. I plan on playing "hardcore" but I'm not a dick.
---
&gt;Yes there will be lots of guilds who will happily bring sub-optimal specs and classes, they'll just progress slower
---
Unfortunately, bosses aren't pushed by attempts. You have to do a certain amount of damage in a given time in order to kill most of these bosses. Ultimately, any guild leader willing to take a significant number of sub-optimal specs will be required to reply upon the optimal specs in their raid to carry the others through encounters. Guess who the gear should go to?
---
&gt; If you don't want to play optimally but also don't want to progress slower then you're an ignorant, entitled asshat. 
---
Now this we can agree on. Unfortunately, there's a lot of asshats in this subreddit.
---
No reason why I wouldn't be fine. Not the first time I've seen people like you incapable of even reading the OP, and not the first time either I see people as ignorant as you saying warriors aren't the objectively worst 1v1 class in vanilla. Thanks for playing.
---
threat isn't as much of an issue for alliance, so I prefer fury without walking on egg shells.
---
on the other hand, 2h fury dps is an option with WF helping with the dps and rage generation, not to mention its fun af.
---
People are always worried about how others play the game. It's always extremely hypocritical when people hate on min maxers. I enjoy min max, get off my back retards. You being mean to me isn't going to change how I play the game. 
---
Such a hard decision between IF and Org for me
---
Now who's making false equivalences?
---
Who's being hurt more by me going afk for 50% of the than they would be if I played a shit spec that brought no utility and did 50% the damage?
---
Oh I didn't know if you were having a stroke or just retarded. Seems like you're just retarded. Thanks for letting me know little man. 
---
I wonder how Gloomweed tastes! ;o
---
Precisely! 
---
igues this is one of the neckbeards asmongold talked about

Hopefully you'll end up understanding you're playing a game.

Arrogant assholes like you will ruin certain people's passion for this game. That's really sad.

Something like that would probably work. The macros have become really easy during the years :p

Possibly. It'll be very close.

I saw this poll which seems somewhat reasonable: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9DHtuNjHnkgDve6fYUiE2OYEDpI6akc5KOmhgGODgWCaoTw/viewanalytics](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd9DHtuNjHnkgDve6fYUiE2OYEDpI6akc5KOmhgGODgWCaoTw/viewanalytics)
---
Kinda makes me want to roll pally as well...
---
But pally's just seem like SUCH a drag to level. Tough call. 
---
The first ones free I always say. If it's even close to a fair fight when If I help out I'll dive right in. If you're getting quad ganked by higher levels I'll nope the fuck out of there. Being a rogue and priest on pvp servers helped out in both regards.
---
Was a druid in vanilla through cata. It was a blasty blast. I got bored one day in vanilla and swam from the westfall lighthouse to southshore.  I was a flag carrier in wsg. Druids are so much fun for so many reasons.
---
&gt;If you're incompatible with someone else play style then don't play with them.
---
On pvp servers you have a shared responsibility to protect your space to actually play the game. Pvp isn't an option, it's a rule. Let someone else die through your inaction, and before you know it, hordies are camping Thorium Point for the rest of the month.
---
For the Horse! 
---
Also, I don’t know if I’m ready to commit, but I’m gathering interest in the same thing 
---
Druids are so much fun. I was one in vanilla. 
---
Because that's going to help all the other poor souls who'll end up in groups with them?
---
I wasn't sure either but with his recent replies it's obvious he's just trying to stir shit up.
---
You may join a meme spec guild as a healer because you want a challenge? Or you may want to join because you’re a Druid healer and hardcore raiders only want one of you and that spot is filled? I mean, I’ve seen plenty of comments on here of healers who would be happy to join. 
---
All I know is if I’m going to enjoy a game, I don’t want to do it exactly how everyone else has already done it thousands of times, I would want to do something different, especially when told by people “it won’t work”
---
&gt;Then there's the fact that for the first ten levels you have no forms, and then all the way to 20 it's just bear form. That's probably a huge reason people give up mid-way. Not that I mind it, getting cat form and travel form feels like an achievement.
---
That's true. For me Druid just felt like a more-fun mage than anything else during that stage (possibly because I made the questionable choice of levelling as balance lol).
---
Won’t have to do any jumping jacks because its DM/N/W/E/tribute.
---
Just give me Hand of Reckoning on my paladin, that's all I ask, only one spell.
---
Druid cause it's the most underpowered class
---
Will there be a benefit? That's another thing I'm curious about - recommended specs. It's a 15 year old game. Are the recommended specs going to be 256mb of RAM and Windows XP?
---
&gt; If you're incompatible with someone else's play style then don't play with them.
---
You have very little mobility or survivability as a warrior. I think you mean "jacked up".
---
It’s sad that this needs to be said. Play how you want and it will be fun. I was a casual during original classic and only ever did ZG. I want to go hardcore this time around. I’m graduating college this summer and I’m hoping to get into a hardcore progression guild because I’ve always wanted to do Naxxramas. I did it once at level 70 in TBC but it was hard finding groups that were interested and attuned. And now I’ll get to have the full, authentic experience complete with weeks or months of wiping on the same bosses.
---
I’m ready.
---
&gt;hunter probably right after Druid
---
uwot
---
I absolutely acknowledge I'm playing a game, and all games are played for fun.
---
Which is exactly why I can't be fucked to spend 5+ hours twice a week carrying boomkins, retadins, survival hunters, ele shamans, shadow priests, etc. through content that they'll poorly equipped and poorly prepared for.
---
The streamer payo said it all the time
---
So true haha.
---
Heh, in TBC as soon as you had flight form did you start playing chicken by just flying up as high as possible and falling and then hitting flight at the last second? Or was that just me? 
---
You will have a six pack a week if you stay in the Barrens
---
And how is that going to help the people who end up grouping with them?
---
&gt; They don't have to. Enjoyment and fun isn't quantifiable.
---
If you can't quantify it, you have no reason to pick one over the other, so why not just pick the better option?
---
So 460 paladins on Alliance and 460 Druids split over Horde and Alliance. Remind me which will be the least played class again?
---
Both will be used. Loot council by the most hardcore and dkp by the progression raiders that aren’t pushing server firsts.
---
There's a dude on here, /u/awesometographer, that plays a paladin and has an INSANE guide for leveling one at super quick speed. If you do some planning, it can speed things up. You should look his guide/spreadsheet up if you're interested in paladin things.
---
Little ofc
---
Lemme offer a counterpoint. Every Druid form feels like a watered down version of another class, at least in a PvE context. Bear tanking is nice to be able to do, but just doesn't feel as good as warrior tanking - you just have less buttons. Similarly with cat DPS vs rogue and healing vs priest. Powershifting seems like it would be an obvious exception to this, but I haven't tried it personally.
---
In PvP, especially 1v1, you get to put all this together, and the class is an absolute blast. And, in some situations in group PvE you can use this stuff to clutch your group through sticky situations. And at least you can switch roles pretty easily if you want, and not be stuck just DPSing or just healing all the time etc.
---
But ultimately I find playing a more specialized class for a given role to be more fun, and I'm willing to trade off the huge versatility of Druid for that.
---
I don't see why they would be a huge drag, just the lack of big damage to kill things?
---
&gt;And how is that going to help the people who end up grouping with them?
---
They're the picky eaters. It's their responsibility to find food they can eat.
---
&gt;If you can't quantify it, you have no reason to pick one over the other, so why not just pick the better option?
---
Are you seriously this dense?
---
You don't need to be "persistent" sometimes. Some fish bring their own bait, jump on the hook and then never stop swimming.
---
I agree with much of your post! I do disagree with their tanking ability in dungeons though - if for no other reason than many groups will simply not accept a class other than warrior for instances.  
---
Shadow priests will use none of their tier pieces till 2.5 from AQ. You will be piecing together gear from all over. 
---
&gt; You aren't owed an explanation or justification for what other people find fun. If you pay their subscription then, yeah, maybe. But you're not doing that, are you?
---
Of course I'm owed a justification if you're going to call me entitled for wanting others to treat each other with respect.
---
Rp is pretty balanced as of right now. I’ll be interested to see how it updates.
---
Look at any of the polls, and think about it.
---
We all know hunter is lowest in dps during raids (aside from MC) because we’ve data mined the shit out of everything. They are only brought for utility so 2 max 3 hunter slots per raid that you fight for.
---
A lot of people will make a hunter as an alt or money maker but not as their main. It’s also got a bad stigma because of vanilla “huntards” even if they have the highest skill ceiling in the game.
---
Doesn’t sound too attractive of a class does it? Comparable speaking. But don’t take my word for it, look at some polls that have been done with 10,000+ people...they are all across YouTube
---
+Spell damage, +hit, +spell crit character screen stats.
---
How are you being ganked if you’re on a pve server 🤔
---
That depends on what kind of end game you would rather tailor your build towards, totem mana reduction is indeed great , you could do without the ancestral armor in raids if you know that other healers have it, but that's somewhat being lazy, the good thing about stacking multiple healers with the talent is that you effectively make it a 100% uptime on tanks, which is better for a raid that's trying to progress but less mandatory once it's on farm, though for solo content/wpvp/duels I'd definitely rather have ancestral because it helps you survive vs half the classes, not mandatory but surely has better impact that saving 50 mana off a totem in a relatively short fight anyway.
---
As for fire nova it's a tad tricky to estimate, without the talent fire nova is meh, the wind up is too slow but with the talent it becomes viable and it's value rises significantly for solo pvp encounters vs melee, in bgs you can make due without but i'd say only if you're in a premade and not soloQ bging since you can rely more on getting peels from your premade than randoms, the issue with bgs is that shamans are very high on the priority list for being focused since they're the best nukers so fast fire novas can help you setup combos with CL much more efficiently , but the talent becomes amazingly good in solo pvp as you can see the vid, but I guess that depends on your desired endgame choice, so it's all based on preference. 
---
I rolled a nelf druid named Brandlehof as my very first wow character sometime in early 2005 i believe. I never made it to level 20 since it I found the nelf starting zone to be unbearable ;). 
---
I was pretty set on human rogue after that. I even went combat and had a great time. I was such a noob though and I never made it past 40 on any character until TBC.
---
There’s very little yelling in higher end guilds. Everybody knows the content intimately now, there’s no need to sweat anything. 
---
Husband and wife team looking for a guild for classic.
---
* Horde
---
* PVE
---
* NA
---
* DKP 
---
* hardcore/semi-hardcore
---
Our raid times are pretty open. 
---
She intends to main a holy/disc priest.  I will either main a hunter or resto druid (I'll be leveling both at the same time, but still undecided)
---
We're looking for a level of hardcore in the "take a week's vacation when classic drops" area, which is what we intend to do.  
---
We both have vanilla wow experience.  We raided everything but Naxx in vanilla, and have been in serious progression guilds in the past.
---
We are not currently playing on private servers. (Cause they're all pvp, and we don't do pvp servers).
---
Yes.
---
I mean no.
---
Don't do drugs.
---
Btw, want to go on this spirit quest while you drink this magic water and chase a ghost wolf around the wilderness?
---
Nice virgin pre-raid BiS there. Spot on meme.
---
They aren't close to finished yet. They can either give us a rough estimate (summer) or nothing at all. I'm glad they went with the estimate because the "imo classic will release late 2021" posts were getting old.
---
Yeah for all its problems the customization added in BFA is a pretty decent upgrade.
---
You would die at the chuck Norris jokes. Sit-ups take quite a long time 
---
*personal trainers HATE him*
---
&gt; They're the picky eaters. It's their responsibility to find food they can eat.
---
Just because people are okay with eating shit, doesn't mean it's okay to serve them shit.
---
&gt; Are you seriously this dense?
---
Yea, I'm dense because I can't understand why a pick matters if you can't give a reason that it matters.
---
You said "Something simply showing the % horde to alliance would solve so many of these issues."
---
What issues are you talking about and how does it solve them? From what you said, if a server is Alliance-dominated you would have to be nuts to roll Horde there, because as Horde you won't get fair world PvP or world bosses. So showing the ratio will lead to more faction imbalance not less. What am I missing?
---
Oto’s rogue guide best guide!
---
Raids will consist of one shadow priest tops. You will be at the bottom of the gear prio list, really only there for shadow weaving lol it’s a fun class to play but it’s definitely frustrating if you want gear. You’ll also be at or near the bottom of DPS meters. I enjoyed it on a private server but started as a holy priest and went shadow when ours left. If you want a leg up on getting a raid spot as a shadow priest you should consider rolling a dwarf. 
---
&gt;chad
---
&gt;alliance 
---
Pick one
---
 (except dwarves, you guys get a pass)
---
why is min-maxing associated with playing 80 hours a week, if anything its quite the opposite.  When u play with mix/max players who play optimally and use buffs and try to push meters, raid time is significantly shorter, you spend less time farming for consumes since you kill bosses quicker, you actually gain gold from raiding alone since u don't wipe as often.
---
Ive been in both "hardcore" guilds and more casual guilds, and I have to say, raiding with an organized min/max guild is much more enjoyable and doesn't take nearly as much time vs the casual guild.
---
Believe me when I say... I fucked a marmaaa yeayea aaaaaid
---
Pre bis is easy. Getting raid gear is much harder. 
---
Excellent work.  You've got talent.  Odd that this is the second set of amazing paintings that are all Undead-centered.  
---
"I paused my game to be here." Sorry, but only alpha males wear stuff like this.
---
&gt; Unfortunately, bosses aren't pushed by attempts. You have to do a certain amount of damage in a given time in order to kill most of these bosses. Ultimately, any guild leader willing to take a significant number of sub-optimal specs will be required to rely upon the optimal specs in their raid to carry the others through encounters. Guess who the gear should go to?
---
DPS as a whole increases as a group accumulates better gear. Playing sub optimally just means the group will need more gear to overcome the raid comp which, as I said, means they'll progress slower :) Depending how poor the raid comp is they'll hit an impassable raid wall at some point during progression. That being said there are a lot of casual players who are fine with this, they don't need to clear all the raid content and they're perfectly happy doing the raid content they're able to do.
---
Yeah, exactly, I don’t want to be a try hard that yells every time we fail a fight, but I also don’t want to play the game with a sandwich in one hand and a mouse in the other - I would still expect people to TRY, especially since getting 40 people together at the same time is no small fear on its own, so if we fail, don’t worry, it’s just a game, but if we fail BECAUSE someone Leroy Jenkins pulls the whole time on purpose and then says, “chill, dude, it’s just a game”, then that’s not cool. Middle ground - give it your best - funny fails will happen on their own, don’t force a “good time” by being an asshole in the game, you know?
---
Absolutely they will.
---
^^ I was looking for a way to see this on my character screen on “other servers” for so long....forgot that it just didn’t show it back then....
---
ahh the good old days of "When it's ready"
---
People will be levelling faster than you, and more than certainly ticking things off like this along the way. The whole thing is going to be insane.
---
Get a new 1440p monitor so you can experience as much as possible 
---
That's how Seinfeld got arrested, you know?
---
They are just known to be slow levelers, no big flashy damage abilities. You kinda just auto attack mobs down. Good for if you want to watch netflix or something on a second monitor while you level though!
---
&gt; People will be levelling faster than you
---
Not sure what this means, really. I mean, yes, there will be people going for server firsts that are leveling faster. I'm planning on leveling *very fast*
---
&gt; more than certainly ticking things off like this along the way.
---
That's a direct contradiction to the first point. Leveling your fishing skill and doing the fishing contest is pretty much the antithesis of speed leveling. 
---
And I really hope all of those players find guilds that are completely content and perfectly happy not clearing raid content.
---
We used a zero-sum system that had a DKP cap of 400.  Items were rolled for based on DKP balance tiers: 0-100, 101-200, 201-300, 301-400.  So if say that sword that everyone wanted dropped, but you were the only one in the top tier you got it, otherwise it was a roll off between all contenders in the highest tier that wanted it.
---
The issues we had were of course as you rotated people in/out or brought in Alts the DKP pool got artificially inflated so we stopped granting DKP for items taken by Alts.  We also added some class priorities on items after the first Brutality Blade went to a hunter...  Learning experience for the officers in the guild for sure.
---
Thanks! I’ll check you guys out! I plan on maining on a PvP realm;m, but also want to try out RP-PvP - I’d be happy to join ☺️
---
What region are you guys in?
---
&gt;That being said there are a lot of casual players who are fine with this, they don't need to clear all the raid content and they're perfectly happy doing the raid content they're able to do.
---
And I really hope all of those players find guilds that are completely content and perfectly happy not clearing raid content. I really, really hope that exactly zero of them try to join guilds that actually want to clear raid content. 
---
Virgin: won't help dying allies as it's not "his problem" and will interfere with his XP:Hour ratio 
---
Chad: will buff you and help you fight the undead rogue even though you're both 10 levels lower and has no realistic chance of  killing the rogue but it's about the fun and chance to make a new friend
---
This is hilarious. Thank you.
---
Probably my cringiest moment was to explain to my boss that i still don't know when i want my summer vacations because they didn't release the date for wow classic yet. lol I really hope they announces it in the next community update.
---
See that's where you are thinking differently. If I, or anyone else I know, could see the %s next to servers, we would find one that has more horde than alliance, then roll alliance on that one. I, and I feel like a ton of other people, would rather avoid streamer servers, and would like to play on a balanced server. So seeing the % on launch day would help greatly in picking a server that isn't already one sided.
---
I'd rather be able to kill world bosses and have good queue times, you know? Instead of getting dominated by a 70% horde server.
---
What region do you play in? And which faction? If Alliance and North America, do keep me up-to-date if you create a guild ☺️
---
Don't know where you live; but if you got a Godfather's Pizza near you - you need to switch it up, man. You'll never go back. 
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; Of course I'm owed a justification if you're going to call me entitled for wanting others to treat each other with respect.
---
No, you're not. In your head, anyone who doesn't minmax has slighted you. These people paid for the game, their subscription, and are selecting playstyles and content that was engineered into the game. Simply for not living up to your standards or expectations, they are assholes. And this is why people hate you, and hate people like you. You have boiled down the game into a job and expect everyone to follow the same formula and same cookie cutter playstyles. Because you cannot comprehend how someone could have fun doing anything else, you assume that it is *impossible* to have fun doing anything else. The fact that you are requesting quantification for fun and enjoyment is proof enough of this; you're literally looking for fun and enjoyment to be boiled down into numbers.
---
Minmaxers are the minority. People looking to have fun are the majority. As I said, you are the picky eater. It is not up to the majority to baby and coddle you. If they are a carrot wrapped in bacon, and you want sausage wrapped in bacon, it is YOUR responsibility to find out what is under the bacon. They are not disrespectful by literally *playing the game the way it was designed to be played.* It is YOUR responsibility to find other people with the same mindset so these "assholes" don't cause you "detriment." Myself, and many others, don't care. The default assumption is that no one cares. 
---
Rekt. 
---
Yeah polls from a game with no release date. That's a very specific and tiny demographic. There's absolutely no danger of hunter being in the bottom 3 popular classes in Classic, either overall or lvl 60s.
---
OP is trying to murder his competition so he can get ahead.
---
Almost every class has something that takes up a bunch of space in their bags. It's not exactly the same amount for everyone, but to some degree it affects us all..
---
Mage - food/water/reagents, Warlock - souls, Priest - reagents, Paladin - Reagents, Shaman - totems/reagents, Hunter - ammo, Rogue - poisons, Druid - reagents + gearsets, Warrior - gearsets
---
Plus every class usually carries some number of consumables, even when just doing open world stuff.
---
Also, please take note at how he was repeatedly asked why he wanted to play a gnome, yet refused to answer.
---
https://github.com/yutsuku/BetterCharacterStats
---
Restrict character creation to Dwarf only. 
---
That's a fair point with regards to the feral forms. I would say that in my experience, balance does not feel like a watered down mage, and resto does not feel like a watered down priest. For balance, you're MUCH less squishy than a mage, and that makes a really huge difference. For resto, there's a sort of rythm for hots that's different than priest heals. 
---
However, you definitely make a fair point, especially with regards to the feral forms. The class isn't for everyone, but I see a lot of posts on this sub from people considering playing druid who are worried about how much fun they'll have, and I wanted to do my part to rectify that. 
---
The Good Samaritan Law was implemented to combat the ganking epidemic in ~~Massachusetts~~ Stranglethorn Vale.
---
At the end of the day, we want this game to thrive and that might require some new players. The fear that min maxing elitists telling people how to play will run off new players is a valid one. If people want to min max then go for it, but if someone wants to play ret let him do the same.
---
yeah that actually makes sense didnt even think of that
---
Thanks for the share! 
---
CPUs arent as important, RAM is key, GPU is key. Whats your price range? I can augment my spec or send it as is
---
*Looks at eachother*
---
What about side by side with a friend
---
Hahahaha
---
That was not my experience in Vanilla back in the day, but maybe things have changed since then. I do agree that happens in raids for sure, but I didn't find it to be the case with 5-mans. 
---
/u/xantek summarized it nicely for me. Those are my main concerns. 
---
&gt; His words, not mine.
---
How would you describe "using the detriment of other players to get find enjoyment" if not intentional trolling?
---
No... that would make a significant difference. 
---
SO...MANY... SITUPS
---
To a degree, druid healers are meme spec in that optimal spec guilds only want one (at most 2) Druid healers. You could definitely have a healer specced into healing but have deviations from an optimal spec - that would also qualify as a sub-optimal spec.
---
Perhaps you would not want to join, and perhaps many won’t want to do this on their main, but joys can be found in the challenge of healing a sub-optimally specced guild.
---
Yes, so in there it looks like druid will be the least played class per-faction, if that poll is accurate. 
---
I don’t think they’re going to give one.
---
Hear me out: letting people trickle in as word spreads would more closely recreate the vanilla launch, as well as reduce zone congestion and server stress.
---
I don't think that will be out at launch. It was released on patch 1.7 so more likely stage 3 or 4.
---
The exp rate on ND is very much the same , the thing about the data used in classic is that a lot of it was taken off opinions and feedback, blizz wasn't able to recover all the vanilla data because if they had they wouldn't have make mistakes in the demo to begin which, which means that they had to fill the gaps with popular opinion/videos and you guessed it, reliable pserver data, but even if it wasn't that still wouldn't answer the original question.
---
Just imagine it this way:
---
Pserver deviations :  slight differences to rep and xp on some servers.
---
classic deviations :   sharding , loot trading and probably a few more minor changes that we won't notice until the game goes live ( which I'll forgo for now ).
---
So which is closer to the original vanilla ?:)
---
The moment it is announced I'll put in for my leave. 
---
We’ll have lots of druids to innervate you if need be 😋
---
Elitist casuals are among the most toxic and vocal members of every gaming community these days. And yeah they suck. Most of the actual "elite elitists" are too busy playing the game to complain on reddit, unless there is some kind of serious issue happening.
---
&gt; See that's where you are thinking differently. If I, or anyone else I know, could see the %s next to servers, we would find one that has more horde than alliance, then roll alliance on that one.
---
Okay. I thought you were saying the opposite.
---
&gt; I, and I feel like a ton of other people, would rather avoid streamer servers, and would like to play on a balanced server. So seeing the % on launch day would help greatly in picking a server that isn't already one sided.
---
So that would solve the problem for you because you aren't on the lopsided server. But it does not help the people who are already stuck on that server.
---
&gt; I'd rather be able to kill world bosses and have good queue times, you know? 
---
Hang on, didn't you just say you wanted to roll on the less-populated faction? Isn't that the faction that won't be able to kill world bosses, because the more populous faction will get them first?
---
What?
---
Astonishing! I love the lights. I hope you're doing more.
---
Oh they won't, you know there's going to be entitled players who want to play how they want but reap the benefits of optimized guilds. Keep in mind that this will be a relatively small number of people and there will be an equal number of min-maxers who shit on casual players to make themselves feel superior
---
I know I'll be out there competing.  You don't need to be 60, just need a couple friends to watch your back on pvp servers or against higher level mobs trying to git ya.
---
oh lord... the barrens chat will murder me!
---
Toggle graphics. May or may not like the new vs old. Would at least like to test it out
---
AB was the prime honor grind because of the inherent time-limit imposed by the resource mechanic. Even in a super tight resource race where the two sides were basically trading a 3rd cap, I don't recall matches lasting longer than 15 minutes or so at the worst?
---
Pretty much only did WSG while waiting for a spot on the AB premade or the honor weekends.
---
We are going to have new graphics though so? And it's togglable.
---
Hey, glad to hear that! We are EU, by the way!
---
&gt; If I'm leading a raid, I want to bring 39 other players who are primarily committed to completing content, not primarily committed to playing their favorite meme spec.
---
Wow what a toxic tryhard douchebag you are! Those of us who have a *JOB* can't afford to respec every week for raids. But I still need Sulfuras because it's best in slot for enhancement.
---
Sure, I'll forgo talking about addons even though it is a technically a change, what about loot trading and sharding ?
---
Inb4 you give me some more justifications as to why it's necessary and good and all that, that's not what I'm asking you to change my mind on , comparing some of the most popular pservers with what we know about classic, which seems more similar to what vanilla looked like ?:)
---
Better to make an educated guess then just a random guess, and that’s all the data we have right now. So I don’t see why you are against it, do you have any reasoning aside from what happened 15 years ago when the game first came out?
---
I’m guessing they’re talking about [this thing](https://blessingoffish.files.wordpress.com/2010/04/screenshot_042110_165721.jpeg) in the Apothecarium. 
---
 Not sure if this will work on every boss or maybe only physical damage ones, but paladins have blessing of protection - you could macro to cast it on target of target, so if you lose aggro on a boss, the player the boss is after will be immune to physical damage, thus dropping aggro allowing you to recover it. Will have to test though. Also, this is a once-in-five-minutes taunt.
---
Literally this whole sub is just people circle jerking about how casual they are. Every day there are multiple posts like this one reaffirming how it's ok to do whatever you want in the game. And I've seen quite a few min maxing discussions get downvoted heavily.
---
So casual players are (as usual) going to be in the majority and the actual elite players will retreat to more private discussion forums to avoid burdening you with unnecessary knowledge.
---
If for nothing other than the ranged pull... yes.
---
Reminds me of block-value stacking as a prot warrior in Wrath. 
---
Lol calm down dude. All anyone is saying is to not be a dick (like you are) to people more casual than you. 
---
I feel dubious about it...
---
I never played vanilla, I started back in Mop but I really want to try out that old rpg aspect of the game. 
---
That said... What discourages me is exactly said 'pros', who have been illegally playing the game in pirate servers, it seems to me kinda unfair since they will obviously have an advantage over a person who has not.
---
You may say it only affects the top 1% players but I disagree and I think that's a big fallacy. And I'll give you a small example:
---
&gt; I make a nemesis while leveling. For the sake of the example we'll say he's a worse player than me but he's been playing pirate servers so he knows the leveling routes, items, and in general he is more efficient.
---
So even if in an equal fight I beat him multiple times, with time he'll be able to come out on top because he'll level faster, have some bis, or good quest items.. Etc
---
So no, I think every little difference will translate into a huge difference making a gap between honest players (newcomers or people who haven't played since tbc released) and people who have been practicing in illegal servers. 
---
Awesome link! Especially love this post from duckst0rm:
---
“Here's an interesting thought.
---
Druids can spec deep into feral and still be great healers. Imagine a raid comp with like 5 bear tanks that just tank and 35 feral druids that can all pop out of cat form and heal. You could then have a healer rotation, where 10-15 ferals pop out of cat form and heal until they OOM, then swap back to cat form, effectively "subbing" out for the next group of healers. Three big benefits, which compound each other:
---
1.	⁠You could adjust the number of healers on a per-fight (or even per-phase) basis, freely exchanging HPS for DPS, and vice-a-versa.
---
2.	⁠Healers could expend mana like crazy, knowing that once they go OOM, they go back to DPS. This means higher HPS, which can then be exchanged for more DPS by just reducing the number of healers you have in flight at any given time.
---
3.	⁠The more infrequently the players switch to healing, the more often their innervate will be off cooldown. The more innervate, the more mana can be spent, which means the higher HPS.
---
With really solid playing, you might end up with more players in the role of DPS at any given time, which would offset the relatively low output of feral druids compared to other classes/specs.”
---
As a warlock it was unending breath.
---
If you averaged the distance I was away from any water while casting that spell, the average would probably equate to over a 10min walk.
---
Darkshire for me because I’m a spookyboi.
---
Call in sick until you're out of allotted sick time. 
---
Then quit.
---
Easy.
---
Aw, sucks, I’m NA - but I’ll be on the lookout for guilds like yours 
---
I hope you find whatever you need to become a decent human being. I find people like you pathetic and it makes me sad.
---
How are you playing the game if you're on a pve server
---
Not to mention his guide is extremely outdated, there are current speed levelers doing it in the low 3 hours mark. One most notably was 3 hour 7 min 
---
another semi clueless post littered with dubious information lmao
---
Top guilds are still going to have ZG buff, songflower, DM buffs, and solo farmable consumes. Black Lotus cooldown has been 1 hour on every pserver I've played on, but looting it meant competing with anywhere from 2-4x the pop cap of a Classic server. If the server pop caps at 2500, it should be somewhat easy to coordinate with other raid guilds and get dragon head buff, or for hardcore players to log in and snag the buff at an earlier time, then log off
---
The little ofc...
---
&gt; In your head, anyone who doesn't minmax has slighted you.
---
It's objectively true that they're harming everyone they ever group with, so no, it's not just in my head.
---
&gt; These people paid for the game, their subscription, and are selecting playstyles and content that was engineered into the game.
---
Claiming that people are free to play the way they want because they have a subscription is objectively false, hell even the f'ing loading screen tips are encouraging minmaxing.
---
&gt; You have boiled down the game into a job
---
No, I have not, I've boiled the game down to having fun.
---
&gt;  As I said, you are the picky eater. It is not up to the majority to baby and coddle you.
---
And as I said, just because you find someone hungry enough to eat shit doesn't make it okay for your to serve them that.
---
&gt;  It is YOUR responsibility to find other people with the same mindset so these "assholes" don't cause you "detriment."
---
I wholeheartedly disagree, when you're grouping with strangers, the assumption should be that you at least attempt doing your best.
---
&gt; Myself, and many others, don't care. The default assumption is that no one cares.
---
And you don't think that's signals a sad state for online games? The fact that people are so used to people only caring about themselves they don't understand that there's a better side to all of it?
---
I think a lot of the min/maxxer hate comes from pre-raid content.  I've been messing around on a private server the last few weeks trying to settle on a class to play.  Was level 18 druid, had 9 talent points in feral.  Deadmines group looking for a healer.  I whisper I'll join.  Group chat goes:
---
Level 22 Warrior Tank - Do you have a healing set?  You don't have enough mana for this.  (I had 695 Mana in my feral set)
---
Me - Yeah, I have plenty of INT/Spirit gear.  (Over 1000 Mana at that point.)
---
Tank - Are you even healing spec?
---
Me - No, it really doesn't matter at this level.  The first five points in resto are feral talents anyway.
---
~long pause~
---
Tank - Sorry not trying to be an asshole but I'm not wasting time unless the group is going to take it seriously. 
---
He leaves group and the party disbands.  10 minutes later I find a group with a undergeared feral tank, me as healer, and a ret paladin in white armor and we cleared it fine.  
---
Point is those people exist in PUGS all the way up to shit like Baron/UBRS/BG's.  The kind of content where min/maxxing is totally unnecessary.  Those are the people that are hated.  If you don't want to bring a Boomkin to AQ40 I think most people understand.
---
The fact that theyre still sticking to the overly broad seasonal release dates makes it pretty clear the game is likely coming out in late August, maybe even September. 
---
Summer isn't technically over till September 20 something. People talking about freaking out if its not released in July are being pretty naive. 
---
Getting it in August would be us lucking out imho.
---
You type "/pvp"
---
OR more realistically, someone was still flagged yet not in a contested zone.
---
I'd say Fire is comparable to Frost for single target leveling. But yeah... Frost is way better on your mana pool.
---
I think he’s basing it off of the last 3 or so popular private realms, hunters are always one of the most played classes so I don’t think he’s taking a random guess.
---
Somewhere between 600 and 1000. I'm really not sure yet.
---
That's where the leadership is supposed to fix things. If you played WildStar for a few years you'd understand why the whole post makes sense. They constantly jerked things around, re-did itemization and gemming 3-4 times, honestly it was clear the leadership had no consistent vision. It's too bad because I personally (as a hardcore raider) loved the game.
---
I’m for sure getting a new laptop before then so I can lan with my buddies. I could use one for work as it is, so it’s a justifiable purchase 
---
I absolutely adored the BC content, especially the belfs and the squids and their staring zones. I miss the good ol eeebil belf paladin quests (almost like a class of its own by that point - had its own abilities etc). I love everything with the belfs and their culture and architecture - if I ever get super-rich somehow I’d be glad to make a theme park looking like Eversong/Silvermoon/Quel’danas (and they really ought to flesh out the amazingly beautiful language). I really liked the design of Outland and the lore they dug into and the general sci-fi theme was cool. Class design was better in vanilla too.. classes could fulfil different roles without losing their uniqueness.
---
buuut.. and there’s a big but; It’s design was flawed from the start. The old world became uninteresting and empty. We were no longer on a constant quest that sent us all across the world.People just stayed around Shattrath city. The idea of one neutral non-PVP capital is probably the worst game design in WoW history. It’s silly.. because they already had the Scryer/Aldor rivalry in the story arch of that city. The flying mounts.. you know the drill.. I could defend BC in one way though: devs seemed to have thought about that at least enough to implement those PvP things in Hellfire etc. But it made the world feel so much smaller.. kinda sad considering how amazing to explore Outland was in general.
---
But the biggest issue, imho, is the level cap thing. I wouldn’t mind bringing in Wotlk too if BC and Wotlk content could somehow be redesigned and integrated into the world at large, as say new 40-60 level zones. Or something. But since that’s not gonna happen.. nah - I’ll prefer classic to stay classic and I’ll remain loyal to it. In the best of worlds, it could develop in its own way and we could eventually get some kind of m alternate Quel’thalas along with belfs (why not with vanilla models? :D) and helfs for Horde and Alliance, respectively, But creative and innovative artistic thinking simply isn’t Blizzard’s gig anymore.. :(
---
Yes! this is a good one.
---
My discord is Trizzy#6713
---
Can add me to your list :)
---
I really despise the shardies. I am so fucking tired of hearing how tourists will leave. You either believe classic wow is the amazing game you remember or  you don't. You want to know what they will be doing 6 months after classic release? They will be making more servers as the better game pulls in more people and BFA dies. 
---
Heres the truth. Every expansion after WOTLK is a leech. A leech that thrives on Nostalgia. People looking to recapture what they lost when wow didn't suck. BFA can't stand on it's own merits and in the market place. The better game will win. You either believe BFA sucks and classic is better or you don't. Take your Shardie crap somewhere else. 
---
Its running on the new engine with the old stuff backported, right? So I would imagine it'll have similar requirements to retail, maybe a little lower with the low res textures enabled. 
---
I believe it devalues gear. Gear, in vanilla, was more than just stats or looks. They were trophies of your accomplishments. Gear was the original achievement system, in some ways.
---
By being able to dress however and hide those accomplishments, it takes away from how viewing you can say so much about your character.
---
Granted: gear is totally RNG in retail (and the last two expansions give you free legendaries), so perhaps it belongs there :/
---
Because of the way gear progression works in Vanilla, you basically cap out your gear pretty quick without raiding or hardcore PvP grind. I don't think you can even get proper epics in every slot.
---
So most people eventually pick raiding because honestly early tier vanilla raids are easy as hell, and WAY less time consuming than trying to PvP grind r12+.
---
LFG

Pvp server
---
I plan on playing Alliance but not dead set on it.
---
I will be raiding. My schedule is flexible.
---
My class will be either rogue, mage, or warrior.
---
I played from Vanilla till WotLK.
---
Are they?
---
I’ve played to 60 on a few of the x1 servers and I always feel hunters are super rare. Rarely in any raids and rarely even running around major cities..I could be wrong though, just what I’ve witnessed
---
At level 60 yes, who knows about total population
---
Looks like I'll be muting chat and leveling off boar kills in elewyn till 60!
---
Built in DoT timer

Seems like a horrible idea from a Blizzard perspective. Unless I am missing something Blizzards stance is that creating classic realms. Is like trying to host two completely different MMO's with two very different audiences. It seems unlikely then. That they will want to kick it up to 3 and 4 different unique MMO's running at the same time. 
---
All of that being said. I got what I wanted with classic wow. I wish all my TBC and WOTLK brethren the best in their goal of trying to get blizz on the hype train for more expansions. God speed Gentle men and Gentle ladies.
---
Man I hope so, but if Blizzard is just planning on launching TBC anyway, it seems likely to me that they'll just keep frozen 1.12 and the fixes will come in tbc classic
---
&gt; So 2H specced warriors actually do the best dps depending on gear, particularly on Horde side
---
This is only true in MC (also depends on what version of Bonereaver's Edge we get). In AQ40 progression gear level, DW Fury will overtake 2H (especially for Orcs with the best 2 handers being swords and the best 1 handers being axes)
---
Pretty sure tanks would have windfury for the added threat, whether the attack generated rage or not.
---
You have a source? They’ve changed the graphics a bit due to the engine change or whatever it is, but I haven’t heard a graphics toggle from blizzard
---
&gt; So that would solve the problem for you because you aren't on the lopsided server. But it does not help the people who are already stuck on that server.
---
Yeah it would alleviate the problem for everyone, though? People know they don't want to roll on a lopsided server, so they can actively see the population balance so they can actively choose a server that isn't becoming lopsided. It might be minor, but it could add up. Who knows?
---
&gt; Hang on, didn't you just say you wanted to roll on the less-populated faction? Isn't that the faction that won't be able to kill world bosses, because the more populous faction will get them first?
---
I'm saying I want to roll on a balanced server, not one where there's a 70% imbalance, so both factions can have a chance to kill world bosses. Like if horde is 70% and Alliance is 30%, we would literally never be able to kill a world dragon. Ideally, I'd want a 50/50 or 55/45. Somewhere between there you know? So it's balanced. And I feel like displaying %s would help get it there because from reading this subreddit, everyone dislikes the negatives that come with an unbalanced server.
---
If you’re rolling a Druid for the first time one of the greatest things is you won’t have any difficulty finding a solid guild for either raiding or PvP. On the flip side don’t expect to be the top dps, tank or healer around. Definitely the GOAT wsg class though. 
---
Is it worth investing in those 10 slots bags u get at vendor for like a gold?
---
Type up a resume in advance. ;D
---
From what I've seen on private servers meters, horde warriors usually do a little more dps than alliance. However, that could be because many sites only track the players' highest dps rather than the average dps. Due to the random nature of windfury, horde will have higher variance, and they will get the highest records. The averages are probably very similar.
---
I think most people have a little bit of anxiety about server choice.  
---
Just look at the demo mate?
---
One thought which might work is you could use the Warlocks Voidwalker to tank a bit, with the priest healing the VW and mage and warlock AOEing. I dunno how well that'd work, but it's a thought.
---
As far as where to grind at, tough to say. I think the best way to take advantage of 3 people instead of one is you've got three ranged classes so you should be able to spread out and pull to the center fairly well. Like, say each of you start at a point and one moves north 10 ft, tags two to three mobs and then moves back 10 ft, the other moves south 10 ft, tags 2-3 mobs, moves back 10 ft, and the third moves west 10 ft, and tags 2-3 mobs and then moves back 10 ft, you've covered a lot more ground than if it was just one person. 
---
That's just theorycrafting on my part though. 
---
I bought a Samsung 960 EVO M.2 SSD just for Vanilla WoW.
---
It pretty much has a read speed of the entire poriginal game folder and all it's files per second.
---
Sorry my other post got deleted for name dropping. If you happen to look up the most popular vanilla server at the moment you can see the stats of each class made. Hunter is #4 overall only behind Warriors, Mages, and Rogues. So they’re decently popular on vanilla realms.
---
You've never, ever tanked *any* instance without being full protection, correct? Or healed *any instance* without being full restoration or holy? Or did a quick 5 man in your PVP spec?
---
If you did, you're a thoughtless asshole and you slighted your group because you didn't give it your best and were objectively and willingly subpar.
---
&gt; I don't see GDKPs being used much
---
Same, unless you have multiple characters you probably wont be able to save yourself in a pug as you're most likely going to be needing loot (and if not needing to be helping the guild get loot)
---
what is min-maxing?
---
Is this to get the Salty title? 
---
Some of them you cannot get off the hook even if you try. You are literally trying to pry them off but no, they're not having it. It is like they get off on it.
---
That isn't min maxing, that person is just an idiot. Nobody levels as healing spec. Hell, most warriors level as Arms not Prot.
---
I’d like it. Give me my Blood Elves and a Quel’thalas based on Vanilla design philosophy. To be fair it kinda was.. and so was Azuremyst/Bloodmyst. Belf paladin quests took you all across the world and made you feel like a real dark knight/anti-hero.. not the cheap superpower dudes that came with Wotlk.
---
What they ought to not repeat more than anything is to raise the level cap and have the new zones be for the late-game alone, almost completely unintegrated with the rest of the world. That took away a lot of the “classic” feeling, imho..
---
Windfury adds this whole RNG element to threat. Sometimes tank gets windfurys and no threat issue. Sometimes thet dont and big threat issue. Since you could windfury at any time, dps warriors have to leave a bigger gap between their threat and tank threat horde side. Especially if they are two handing. 
---
You are limited by threat alot in vanilla regardless of faction
---
Rofl.  You asked me once so get your facts straight.  And second I want to play a gnome.  I personally don’t like playing humans in a fantasy game.  It really doesn’t effect you at all.  Don’t group with me.  End of story.
---
As a Rogue:
---
Always hide until the enemy wins then kill him when he's weak. Apologize for not arriving in time, you totally weren't watching them in stealth the whole time.
---
If the friendly wins then clearly I wasn't needed anyway. Wouldn't want to steal his thunder.
---
If there are two enemies I'll jump in right away. Not about to let that type of arrogance go unpunished.
---
If we're outnumbered, I was never there.
---
I like you. Let's be friends
---
Im more worried about the lack of a beta than i am about the release date. Atleast then we know were kinda close.
---
Love this post. I had a level 60 rogue and warrior and experimented with other classes but I played 120+ days as a Druid and I look forward to another 120. The variety and fun is unparalleled and even though you might not be the best at any of your mimic classes, you are so much better than the sum of your parts that it is completely worth it. After all, what class can tank, melee DPS, heal, caster DPS, AoE heal, AoE DPS, swim forever, and has its own special hideout with a free teleport?
---
Also, I loved the comment about seeing other Druid’s in the world. For my experience, I basically never got attacked by a Druid because they knew it was simply not worth it. Druid’s can’t root you fast enough given all your shifting abilities and stealth so unless they are rolling with someone else it’s almost impossible to gank. If a Druid rooted me I would /laugh and /spit and just be on my merry way.
---
I'm genuinely interested in how other humans function and it's hilarious watching your narcissistic psyche go into defense mode.
---
It's probably safe to assume hunter will be among the top most played considering how popular they were in vanilla. Personally I'm expecting Rogue/Hunter/Warrior/Mage all to be very popular.
---
On private servers they're barely played but that's because the private server crowd is mostly about min/max and knows how bad they are as raid DPS.
---
Also the polls are incredibly misleading, the sample sizes are way too small and they're biased towards the more serious min/max crowd (people on this sub + pserver players). Most of my friends either don't know about this sub or never come here but they're all waiting for classic to launch.
---
That candle idea is outstanding.
---
I will also point out they aren't comparable because dungeons at the end of the day are designed to be beatable. So if you dedicate 3 hours to banging out a dungeon you will most likely be able to get it done. Regardless of how hardcore you are. With BG's it's not the same. Waiting 3 hours for a bg to pop only to have it pop into a premade for the 2nd time today. Is demoralizing in a way that dungeons can never be.
---
So my plans have been figured out.
---
&gt; You've never, ever tanked any instance without being full protection, correct?
---
At lower levels where Arms outshines prot and before the warrior talent rework that actually made full prot viable.
---
&gt; Or healed any instance without being full restoration or holy?
---
Only with friends.
---
&gt; Or did a quick 5 man in your PVP spec?
---
&gt; If you did, 
---
Indeed.
---
