Bad person/Bad player aren't remotely the same thing.

Good to see there are more trolls than yesterday. lol. You gave me a good laugh friend. :)
---
Nah, playing that much is unhealthy without exception, and that person should feel ashamed. And before you say that I'm just jealous, I'm not. I would never dedicate that much time to a video game, nor any other singular hobby.
---
Blizzard can't even create content in a timely manner for one game.
---
I'm sorry, can't help it
---
"Perfectly balanced, as all things should be."
---
Historically this is what people have sought from MMORPGs.  Difficulty comes from building relationships and investing the time and resources into your character.  When you require time and personal investment into something, it gives a very rewarding feeling when you get it.
---
In Everquest there were mobs that required you to camp them for 8-16 hours.  If you died, you would lose EXP, often enough to constitute several hour worth of grinding.  It was genuinely hard to hit max level in Everquest not because of the mechanical difficulty of walking up to mobs, but because of the dedication and patience it required.
---
Wow classic is like that, but a little easier and more accessible.  It was the natural evolution and mainstreaming of the MMORPG.
---
At some point it stopped being an MMORPG and started shifting toward the modern gaming trends of fast, repeatable challenges that are more focused on testing mechanical skill / game knowledge much like a game of dota or counterstrike.  This is great in and of itself and I'm not saying this game cannot exist.  But this is not what people want from the traditional MMORPG experience.
---
Some people tip 20s, some people tip 5g. I'm content living off tips, so long as I'm not actively *losing* money. I like it when people are nice and give extra. Those archmage robes weren't cheap to make!

&lt;Blue Slide Park&gt; is looking for active players of every role / level to help us build our core raid team. We also group frequently for dungeons, pvp, and other events. There are no requirements or applications neccesary, all that matters is that you show up with the proper attitude and mindset.
---
Progression:
---
Many of our players will undoubtably rush end-game content, but we also hope to establish a community where players of all levels can easily find others for  dungeons, PvP, etc. 
---
Who are we looking for:
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a chill atmosphere with friendly people. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything else is optional.
---

‚Ä¢	‚Å†We should have raids going in 1-2 months months, but there's plenty of time until the next phase. You can use this time as you see fit, leveling slowly or even leveling more than one character.

---
‚Ä¢	‚Å†Loot council.

Well done...\*cheers\*...
---
You won‚Äôt see much frost resistance tbh, while leveling its good to continue to upgrade Fireball/Blast. Once I purchased my mount and had a bit of flexibility I upgraded Flamestrike for AoE shatters and Fireward as I‚Äôm on a PvP server.
---
Nice, I‚Äôm in Ft Lauderdale.
---
Thanks for asking, I didnt understand it either.
---
For DPS, absolutely.
---
For tanking, Tauren is more useful.
---
In PvP, both are strong and I personally lean Tauren. Having an extra interrupt is pretty invaluable.
---
Unexpected compliment :) thank you!
---
Someone gave me a bleach the other day
---
Pussies like you curioushino18, are the reason ill ask every rogue in my group if they will lock pick for us , if they say no  they are easily replaceable with a warrior who does more damage.
---
I thought that if you don't use set and you /reload it will not be saved.    This seems to be behavior I have observed as if you do a non SET command after and then reload, the variable will have the value assigned by the SET command.
---
forgot druids :)
---
There is more to content then dungeons and raids. And again. I point you to retail. Classes are bland and boring. The story is a joke. And the dungeons and raids are designed around diablo style loot. Sorry, that isnt what classic is supposed to be.
---
Modern blizzard screwed up the only thing they tried to make that was new for classic. Layering. So exploitable that they had to ban people.
---
I wouldnt trust blizzard to create new content for classic at all.
---
Go wash your clothes or something dude/dudette
---
Razorgore is a fine server. Lots of swedes though so it could still feel like IKEA
---
Reminds me I need to install Greenshot.
---
Really great job on this. Can you explain how to created this? I'm brand new to learning how to editing video, and you must have had to go through every frame to mask him perfectly? Thanks in advance for any reply/advice. It really looks great.
---
Great thanks
---
Move here from Stalagg last night. Ironforge was so depressing over there. Hope the faction balance stays healthy on HS.
---
I played with you last night! Either ZF or wastewander area
---
NEs arent hippies at all though.
---
A mage literally gave me a stack of food then /spit on me earlier. True story.
---
Obviously the answer is no.
---
Is this argual?
---
No. If blizzard automatically moved your characters to different servers to solve overpopulation, then it would be blizzard‚Äôs fault. The playerbase made the decision to use a system based on their perception of the game instead of basing their decision on any reliable information. The playerbase can deal with the fallout. The classic playerbase can‚Äôt shout no changes until my ears bleed and then whine when blizzard won‚Äôt fix a faction imbalance that was player created. It‚Äôs hypocritical at best. 
---
The free transfers along with increasing disinterest in the game have reduced my queues by over 90% since launch(which has a precedent in vanilla wow). They‚Äôve done their job as intended. The playerbase has created its own problem by trying to leave a server they perceived as imbalanced.  Faction imbalance was never grounds for free transfers and shouldn‚Äôt be now.
---
I'm really photosensitive and the glow gives me a massive headache in Tanaris and shimmering flats.
---
"Fastest" in terms of XP/ HR would probably be straight grinding green mobs (level 50 or so)
---
If that sounds insanely monotonous (it is), you can start hitting dungeons and accumulating pre-raid BiS gear.
---
sweet thanks!
---
This is great then, maybe it's strange but I actually can't wait to go home and put these into the game, I really missed the view distance.
---
Yeah except no one PvPs like this. Anyone geared will not die from dots and fear spamming that‚Äôs quickly running out of use. Again, by phase 2, every semi serious pvper will have the tools to break fear. There literally are items in the game that make you completely immune to fear. These items combined with a PvP trinket, fear just isn‚Äôt as strong as you make it sound. No serious pvper is getting fear locked lmao.
---
Unit frames look like [SUF](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/shadowed-unit-frames), the bars are probably [Bartender](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bartender4), and the map would be [SexyMap](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sexymap)
---
Because it‚Äôs 15 seconds! That‚Äôs 3 breaths. It‚Äôs not a big deal. It doesn‚Äôt matter. Definitely not big enough to complain about.

And I agree with the other poster. The beginning shows how random this occurrence was.

Hi Araxom,
---
Is there any sort of advance notice of these things we can give? I have to say, this post freaked me out a bit. I love classic wow and I'm actually back on the blizzard launcher because of it after having uninstalled it, but also, I'm moving from NA to Europe for work in five days. I will be heartbroken if this ends in me getting banned...
---
We're a bunch of old men howling with laughter at acting like the worst n00bs ever.
---
I want to hear your analysis
---
That's very true. Yay for the grind! This thread actually has me enthused for it üôÇ
---
They just say that the first time so only people that have a legit refute to the ban actually keep trying. Doctors do it too...they send you home with shit OTC medicine, if you come back it means your probably really in pain.
---
I picked up with classic with some friends who played back in the day. Now im full on addicted. Great game, never expected to like it this much.
---
For tanking troll is the best choice owing to their berzerking ability. War stomp is also strong for PvP I agree, but generally speaking I believe hardiness is more beneficial.
---
Your ePeen got smaller, that's why they sucked? Wow. I don't know where to begin with that, so I won't.
---
i dunno, MC is on farm and most people are prebis (except for rare drops like HoJ). Leveling alts works, but people still want more.
---
Not like DM is going to change much it's just another dungeon with mediocre drops and few enchants. Though pvp starting would be good.
---

Kingsblood was pretty cheap and I got my rep up for about 3 gold, though. Definitely worth it at this time.
---
id assume anyone driving for ups has extreme animosity towards alot of things.
---
All good, just reread what I first type, came off a little condescending.  It was not intended at all just rushed.
---
Are you high?
---
Nah mate theres a shortcut through the mountains
---
So that is where small flame sac comes from.
---
I was wondering about that in my cooking tab
---
What he did makes it a bannable offense and the item will be deleted. So if you do the same when loot rules are established then you can get banned and have the item deleted.
---
It's because it doesn't stack. 
---
If you open your bag I bet the sweet nectar there is in a stack of 12 and if you drag the nectar to your action bar it shows the number. 
---
Try to split your stack of nectar into a stack of 5 and 7 and see what number shows up on your macro and on the action bar.
---
The short answer is that you can't do that. It shouldn't really matter that much as you can have the macro count how many you have and then not delete the shard if you have below a total. 
---
This is a common macro for drain soul.
---
Good, then you can just simply not play the new content.
---
You can F off to a private server and keep playing 15 year old raids
---
What's the best way to park there and stay there? Once my bags are full and gear damaged, would I have to go back to Southshore and make the trek all the way back to SM?
---
The only part of endgame I really like is pvp and with no arena or bgs for a while idk if I‚Äôll ever raid, wpvp gear doesn‚Äôt matter as much
---
Stv and Badlands desolace is where I'm leveling. Make some friends or join a guild - playing solo sucks.

I'm 39 (probably hit 40 tonight) with 89g atm (probably get 90g when I check my auctions). IT analyst, no kids, just gf. 
---
My tip to having enough gold?
---
Don't buy ANYTHING from the AH. I stopped my skinning at 225, my tailoring is still 75. I only bought the spells I use constantly. Loot everything, vendor everything. If it has some value (silk cloth, heavy leather, decent BoE greens) sell it on the AH.  I mostly ran dungeons (SFK, gnomer, then RFK, SM + RFD).
---
Most likely yes, they probably don‚Äôt have the time and resources to investigate.  Then a Reddit post gets made with a thousand + upvotes and someone from marketing or CS sees it and Is forced to respond.
---
Exactly, daggers since lvl1
---
The good mages hit 60 fast, like in under 2 weeks. The decent mages who at least understand what's going on hit 6 in the first month. At this point, you're left with bottom of the barrel players who are just mimicking what they've heard about without having a clue what they're actually doing.
---
Perfect way to die ;)
---
On the topic of mages. The only toxic people I've met in Classic WoW thus far have been mages... I think it's time for a crusade, non-mage brethren.
---
Yeah, I think it's num lock by default, but you can bind it to whatever you want in the keybind menu.
---
Im still straggling with drain tanking. Can you give me a quick overview or some tips?
---
The ‚Äúmages are new hunters ‚Äú thing is pretty overplayed tbh.
---
Mages are unquestionably broken in vanilla. Period case closed. This is why people roll mage. At lest the good people.
---
Hunters aren‚Äôt and were never broken. Just popular due to pets.
---
Great insight dude
---
I'd be curious to hear your top 3, 5, or whatever you'd like to share. No rebuttal from my side or anything. I thought BC was great and WotLK the pinnacle. Everything after that though, not so much.
---
"hm I am doing less damage than this guy playing same class same level, I wonder why"
---
"hm, perhaps I will google how to do more damage"
---
two easy steps
---
gamers HATE him!
---
Hol up, what? How is blizzard at fault for this? Players made the survey addons themselves. The players who used them and made decisions on obviously incomplete information did this to themselves.
---
Go LEFT at every turn and you‚Äôll never get lost.
---
They should have thought better about attacking an elite. Yup.
---
soooo....later on....
---
argual?
---
I'm not saying Blizzard did even close to the best they could have, but how exactly would you force balance on the servers, if it is so easy?
---
When you use a console command the value listed in the config file, which follows the word SET and the Cvar itself, changes.  In other words, console commands actually edit the config file itself.  There is a way you can bring up the config file in game and actually edit the file while in game (I believe you launch the game via wow-console.exe, and then use the ~button to bring up the console, but I may be wrong).  But using console commands does the same thing.
---
It was a while ago, but I read the EULA, and I didn't see something like that. Sure, its slanted in their favor wildly, and its been a while since I studied contracts, but there's a necessary element of at least *some* parity between parties. If its too one-sided they'd risk voiding the whole thing iirc
---
That is awesome!
---
I was joking
---
Your gaurantee is dogshit, dont be a salesman, ever. We never ask for lockpicking services, I just vendor mine. But if I ever for some reason needed it open, id definitely tip, im not going to ask someone to do a service for me for free, thats not how I roll. But, if were in a dungeon, unless your bitch ass can can control the 3+ mobs in front of the chest, thats OUR chest.
---
We cleared molten core last weekend with a Tauren hunter. She performed good and she had fun. No need to min/max too much. Enjoy what you play.
---
What data?
---
Dragonmaw
---
Cows are awesome and hunters are super fun and breeze thru pve content. You don't get a lot of synergy with your racials but moooo cares about synergy anyway! As long as you're having fun that's literally the only thing that matters.
---
Killing Anger is super quick just keep grinding
---
My 10 days was based on /played time not days you are subbed for.
---
Where is /lick
---
The green quests give out bugger all xp though. It's much faster to level with a small group doing the whole zone worth of orange and elite quests as the hand in for each quest is in the thousands of xp compared to the measly hundreds of xp from green quests.
---
Indeed. I had forgotten that until you reminded me.
---
The skull means they're at least 10 levels higher than you
---
The lack of focus and direction the entire expansion had, for starters. Thematically and systemically it didn't have a clear goal. Sure, lore-wise you had "Arthas big bad, kill big bad" but beyond that it was more of a jumbled mess than BC's lore that people seem to forgive just because everything was a shade of blue. Central characters rotated in and out like they were playing musical chairs.
---
Class design was the closest it had ever been to a sloppy mess until BFA came around in that you couldn't go one patch without completely relearning your class or having to switch to another spec because Blizzard was seemingly incapable of parsing numbers.
---
The difficulty of Dungeons, or lack thereof, was a colossal misstep and completely reactionary to people whining about BC Heroics. Speaking of, the lack of attunements greatly hindered the game. It took away a necessary treadmill to keep the average play and engagement times up.
---
The constantly changing raid difficulties is probably an issue I can single out as the biggest one and it became a huge complicated hurdle in an otherwise completely simplified version of the game.
---
My rankings of expansions is more or less BC &gt; Legion &gt; Cata &gt; Mists &gt; WoD = Wrath &gt; BFA
---
Alliance is dwarf because of fear ward. Horde probably ud because of wotf. In comparison dwarf is better, because you can put the fear ward on whoever you want
---
The thing is, if you wait, the stuff you need to buy will go up in price as well.
---
Based on looks tho ancient bone bow is one of the best skins in the game imo
---
Damn bro Stitches was really gettin after it, mans got moves.
---
As someone who did not play retail the first time doing WC (with a group who also haven‚Äôt played wow before classic) took as a bit over 2 hours to kill all bosses. 
---
But I enjoyed every minute of it (except when the hunter pulled too many mobs with his pet so we had to all walk back, but these things happen).
---
Well worst case scenario is you are needlessly mean to and critical of someone who lost their little brother and make them feel badly. 
---
Idk why you'd want to take that chance with literally no upside.
---
Make sure you have..
---
    /join LookingForGroup 
---
to search for a group. The vast majority of players are searching on that channel.
---
If you‚Äôre Alliance, RFD is annoying to get to but still worth it. If you‚Äôre Horde it‚Äôs so easy a level 20 could walk to the meeting stone without any troubles.
---
Otherwise, try Scarlet Monastery (SM): Armory &amp; SM Cathedral. These are usually pretty good to run back to back for xp runs.after you get to 43 head to Zul Farak.
---
I have screens of a hunter in my guild doing this 2 days ago
---
if they wanted  to do damage, they should be ele. Ele shamans actually do decent damage in dungeons
---
I believe the ability to speak Chinese is a requirement of being a CS rep for Blizzard, which means most of them are secondary English speakers.
---
What a waste. They should find a way to do it differently.
---
Bro, thank you. This post was poorly received.
---
Easily dwarf for fear ward racial.
---
Run dungeons, add people that arent insufferable to your friends list. Include a note to remind you who/what they did to get added.
---
When you build groups in the future ask them first " hey, we ran x the other night and you stood out, im building a group for y and was curious if youd like to go with". 
---
Friendships in the game happen from playing the game, be active and cultivate them.
---
They weren't that bad considering many people including you like them now. The simplistic and relatable feel of the world yet very artistically done with obvious love behind it is what makrs it 'beautiful'. Combine that with the immersion and satisfaction through its questing, world pvp, socialization and progression, Vanilla was a definite beaut.
---
Plus with the tiny details they added which our powerful computers and processing power can now handle, it was like adding tiny paint strokes to an already masterpiece.
---
I don‚Äôt understand why people do duns drunk
---
Alliance would be dwarf. 
---
Horde would be undead. 
---
Both their racial spells and their racial abilities are great. 
---
Undead focuses more on PvP than any other race because you wouldn't use your racial spells in a raid.
---
I can respect that. But if someone goes out of their way to demolish someone over 20 levels below them then they already know how unimpressive it is. It's an act purely designed to cause you disdain, so expressing that to them is the feedback they are looking for.
---
Has Earthfury hit medium consistently? Last I checked, it was almost always low and had very few Horde 60s online even at peak times.
---
if you are doing PvE ONLY then I think troll has a slight edge over UD

Just play them all on rested xp! By the time they reach 40 you‚Äôll have enough gold to decide which ones get mounts right away

you spelled forgotten wrong
---
I'd argue Undead is better for 1v1.
---
Fantastic, thanks! I'm also using Nord VPN, I just wanted to make sure my account would be safe. I've had this account since original vanilla and it's never once been in any kind of trouble. I'd hate to start now
---
Arcane concentration only has 1 chance to proc per spell cast. A frost bolt, a cone of cold, a blizzard and an arcane missiles all have the same chance to proc.
---
Basically, when you spend the mana, it does a quick calculation: 1. Does this spell hit something? 2. If yes, then you get a specific % chance to proc arcane concentration.
---
Otherwise blizzard would always be proc it.
---
Arcane missiles used to be used by raiding mages I knew back in vanilla. They had a macro that would stop cast and cast arcane missiles when they got clearcast. It does more damage than frost bolt if they're both free.
---
Edit: also, arcane missiles is also a good spell for pvp, when someone is trying to LoS you, because it doesn't matter if they run LoS. If you can start the cast, the missiles will go thru walls and anything else while channeling.

HoJ is dropping from angerforge at the moment had 9 in the 60 or so runs I have done from him and only 2 from emp ( in the second week) I think they may have moved it to angerforge as that was where it dropped  for the first year or so in vanilla.
---
I am unsure if it still drops from emp but I think maybe not, Just incase people have only been doing skip runs of emp for them.
---
Oh look another Mage circlejerk post let's have this conversation again
---
I got my crimson whelp after 4 kills, I was in awe
---
I am pretty sure I have the legitimate answer to your question. I have recently started leveling a mage alt for portals and such. Reading icy veins I noticed in the dungeon section it says with a coordinated party using blizzard to aoe down mobs is the fastest way to do dungeons. I don't know who writes those guides, but I can tell you the people who read them are skipping over the part about a coordinated party. They are being told by what they believe to be an authority, that blasting blizzards is the best way to play.
---
Ok so either you fail at math, or economics, or both.
---
Jeff Bezos NET WORTH is ~$110 Billion Dollars.
---
That's his net worth, not what he has available in his bank account for personal use.
---
Even if we went on the extreme of your example and used his entire net worth, that would give a grand total of around $15 to every human on Earth.
---
Now explain how a human is supposed to survive off $15 for 10 years.
---
Word thanks man
---
This is platinum
---
They are definitely not quite as strong for raids, but I'm seeing a lot of acceptance for feral druids in raids compared with vanilla at the moment. Surprising to me, but might just have been lucky?
---
I'm with ya! Level 47 and close to 8 days. Journey has been awesome tho!
---
Yes, I feel the desire to play more than I currently can, but it does strike a nerve when those who have the free time are called pathetic. Just seems so spiteful and unnecessary.
---
I won't play retail again until dailies are gone. They keep trying to make them more interesting, while they should completely get rid of them.
---
Oh wow, I sure did. I never noticed that till now.
---
Becaide a single stack if food costs 1g, and i need to eat drink while i so dungeons/ grinding.  Sometimes i will wait for a group to see if they find a mage.  Usually its just faster to whisper the few i know who are in IF around my schedule and grab 120 of each.  Lasts me 6 hours of intense pulling or more grinding.  
---
I have also had 4 healers whisper me for groups because im not "that lock that taps to full mana, and goes into pulls with 10% health."  My excess food/water i get from mages for a single allows me to do that.
---
If you had worded this post different and claimed that only really good players uses their class' full potential, there wouldnt even be half this amount of butthurt posts. And to be fair it seems you think everything below greatness is awful. But I  agree with the argument.
---
Please play retail if you don't like classic. You can still play retail with LFR, and LFD. LFR and LFD was never in classic.. Why are you playing Classic if you want your hand held? Go play retail if you want to have your hand held 24/7. LFR/LFD helps keep this game social and not dead. It requires people to talk to others. If you haven't played any WoW expansions before LFR/LFD, people use the channels in the local area, as well as capital cities. There's also something called guilding. Something tells me you don't normally play MMO's, or are just used to hand holding. LFD requires no communication/socializing and ruins the game. There's a version just for you called retail, leave classic to the people who want to experience CLASSIC.
---
100% this
---
Tryn it
---
53 druid. No time for alts until 60. Not sure how everyone has time to have multiple characters 40+.
---
I‚Äôd drop the ST, get Spirit Buff, and then I‚Äôd go into holy like you suggested.
---
I plan to dungeon level so ST is wasted points.
---
&gt;Gaining gold per dungeon has only started to happen post 45ish.
---
I'm leveling my shaman as resto and from RFC to Uldaman I have yet to not earn gold on an instance.
---
&gt;People still run with a retail mentality which means tonnes of AoEing which is extremely mana intensive for healers.
---
Maybe your server is just filled with garbage players.  So far either the run goes medium paced and steady and I barely ever have to drink because I can easily use my spirit regen to keep myself up *or* the run is quick and wild and I have to drink every pull but it's because we're killing two packs at a time at record pace.  I can count the number of people who have died (sans wipes) on both hands and the number of full wipes on one.
---
&gt;My largest healing spell is about 480mana I have just over 4k mana, that's not a negligible amount per pull on a warlock,
---
It really is a negligible amount though.  If you're running up against such tight mana constraints in an instance someone or multiple someones are either underleveled, undergeared, or under-not-a-moron'd for the instance.
---
&gt;This would be less of an issue if tanks used shields, but barely any do so far.
---
This part is definitely annoying.  I don't recall dealing with more than the rare warrior who tanked with a two-hander in vanilla (and usually they were overgeared/leveled if that's what they were doing) while in classic I've had like three warriors use shields even though it makes the run go 1000x more smoothly and generally more quickly.
---
&gt;I'm not going to wiff money on AH greens when quest rewards and dungeons can fill that void fine.
---
For you, maybe, but that's only because you're playing with a tank 24/7 whether you're in a dungeon or questing.  For most caster shaman the only appropriate mail gear is going to come from the AH, which matters when you're either playing solo or god forbid doing the tanking for someone else while group questing.  For the majority of shaman who aren't in your specific shoes they're better off ignoring cloth blues and spending the handful of gold necessary to keep themselves in mail caster greens while leveling from 40 to 60.  There's still plenty of instance gear to be had in the form of jewelry, cloaks, weapons, and shields.
---
Use the mail
---
If you consider leveling two 60's horde and alliance doing all that leveling maybe pvping and finishing all the raids (which is what I consider "beating the game" I mean even if you no life it that would take awhile. It would take me a year. And if definitely take breaks so maybe longer lmao.
---
And that's kind of the point I want to return to the game in the state that it's in. Not changed. But I'm not against it. Just optional.
---
I use Will of the Forsaken in PvE all the time. Anytime Fear Ward is useful, WotF is useful.
---
Whichever one has the last players standing in front of it. Or at least the least tauren, they take up the most space. I don't like being stacked on loads of people, I'm an idiot and somehow accidentally open trade all the time.
---
If it's deserted, probably b. Closest to a straight line. But just depends on the angle I happen to run in at, I guess.
---
You can type bitch, it is the internet.

What I mean is that your interpretation of "cloud computing" is entirely wrong and that section of the EULA **DOES NOT APPLY** to this case. Not sure where you are getting confused.
---
Yes. It's a caster weapon, not a rogue one.  You're an asshole.
---
No im not tipping, im paying for their services.  I dont tip for the 10 seconds it takes a 60 mage to make the food.  On the other hand, 1g per teleport and 1 extra if they come to me from another city, though i usually just ask a mage i find in IF
---
Teach your kids how to mine then set them loose in durotar and the barrens (or equivalent zone if you're scum)
---
You can always just start leveling a new alt for the time being where people pretty much just form a group out of the blue without asking or anything if you are even remotely close to a difficult quest. Should pass the time. Lesson learned haha
---
Accidentally left the instance and the party after finishing Willix the Importer from RFK. If I go back, can I turn in the quest within the instance or do I have to do it all over?
---
My whole point is that it‚Äôs ridiculous to go out of your way to berate somebody for something so trivial as posting a picture. You guys are being so dramatic and hostile over nothing lmao, it‚Äôs just sad
---
 If there was no caster it wouldn‚Äôt of been an issue, a mage would have never rolled on your Agi daggers.  So yes you are the asshole
---
There are some people that make a game out of being kind to the opposite faction. With the added element that you can be attacked at any time, it makes it far more compelling, thrilling, and memorable.
---
Also, the idea that there exists a version of this game where you can‚Äôt do any world PvP perplexes me to no end. Anyone playing a PvE server is missing out big time
---
There are some people that recognize that the better game is on the PvP servers, but they don‚Äôt care for hunting down everyone. They really just want that ability to have occasional epic and memorable world PvP.
---
Oh I don‚Äôt have MP5 gear, I just measured my regen during combat and not casting.
---
Example: Cast down to 200mana, wait for regen to kick in 200-&gt;239-&gt;278
---
Its about 3 wand hits to start regen.
---
It also keeps regen while I‚Äôm casting my first heal after mp5 kicks in, so I keep that in mind when I start casting again
---
I used to like BRD until I had a kid and now it's the only dungeon I don't have time to do and most of my BIS is in there.
---
The thing is tho, they have a point. If you really were secure with yourself, you wouldn't take the time to make your judgments known. At least, not in the spiteful manner so often done. And before you say "no u", I am responding to you because you were being an asshole to someone else.
---
Luckily healers are always highly sought after so you should always be able to get into a group for whatever you want.
---
When it comes to selecting your class it's pretty much all personal preference but if you go for a priest be sure to grab tailoring if you care about min/maxing your BiS gear.
---
Whatever you choose you dont have to be spec'd in your healing tree for dungeons until around BRD, you'll do fine as let's  say a Ret Pally in SM but you'll want to carry a healing set with you/in your bank when you're running dungeons.
---
Before I continue, you need to provide your experience as a healer.  Just because your group was successful doesn't mean you weren't consistently pissing off the healer and making the run take longer due to forcing them to drink more.
---
&gt;1 It can keep mobs in place for longer for other group members aoe to affect them
---
&gt;2 give the tank and healer more breathing room to react to other dps pulling aggro
---
&gt;3 Relieve stress on both the tank AND healer because mobs are baywatch running towards the mage instead of smacking the tank.
---
1.) Where did I say there was more aoe?  If this is a spell cleave group, the dynamic changes considerably.  All dungeons I run have not been spell cleaving.
---
2.) When mobs can kill dps quickly, the rogue picking up a mob to save the healer makes you at fault when he dies.
---
3.) not every dungeon has huge open spaces for you to constantly kite.  Not to mention that you are splitting the mobs up and increasing the distance between the tank, the healer, and other dps.  
---
All three create stress on the group that you are thinking you are reducing.
---
Aoe damage on 40+ mobs is slow.  You need at least 3 to 4 mobs before your overall dps is the same as single target.  Thus you are reducing the time for the first mob to die, and if you don't steal aggro, it pushes the tank hard.
---
You also create confusion in the other dps.  If they aren't ranged, then they can easily pull aggro from you.  Or worse, you make the tank lose threat on the main mob, trying to grab the others.  Which makes the dps more likely to pull aggro and die 
---
Aoeing mobs down only works without melee dps.  Otherwise, they will get aggro and die. 
---
A good mage knows when to aoe.  And the frost talents cannot make up for that.  A great fire mage is better than an average aoe frost mage.
---
Your comments suggest two styles of play
---
- aoe everything which is spell cleave and not running a dungeon normally 
---
- aoe smartly where the aoe provides a benefit to the party
---
The latter scenario exists in very few places in wow.  And if you make it work, you are the exception, not the rule.  And arguing for less skilled players to try a build that demands high precision and good groups is trollish at best and naive at worst.
---
yeah well i did the same but only had to borrow 69g from a friend
---
bloody druid skills :/ not even buying them all
---
So it's wrong to work hard all your life and leave something for your children? I fail to see your point other than "Rich people bad".
---
If I leave my son an inheritance and he uses said inheritance to be successful himself, is he going to have to deal with people like you wanting to devour him?
---
Learn to stance dance, its important. 
---
Understand revenge and sunder are your most important abilities. 
---
Learn dungeons, groups will always expect you to be the lead
---
I made friends by joining one of the biggest guilds, joining their discord and just chatting. It also helps that you are vocal in guild chat, and are a skilled player.
---
Wait, that's what poggers means? That doesn't sound right but I have no idea where poggers comes from so I'll take your word for it.
---
You'd be surprised how often shamans just *don't train* some weirdly useful totems. I get not training all of them gotta save for the mount etc, but I was in a WC group with a 20+ shaman who didn't have Tremor totem and I was just like....
---
If only.
---
Yup always done it, classic ain't changing me. Only difference for me in classic is that I've been a member of the alliance for the past 15 years and I've made the switch for classic to give the game some more life. Made the mistake of referring to alliance ganking me as "horde dogs" a few times. Old habits are gonna die hard but i'm trying!
---
In order of creation 20 Mage, 12 hunter, 36 warlock, 21 warrior.

Install classic LFG adding and /join world
---
I was at Booty Bay waiting for the boat and I got a message from a priest saying 
---
"Watch out, there's a level 60 NE priest shadowmelded on the boat who  has been MCing people off the boat all afternoon. If you can keep him distracted, ill MC him off the edge"
---
So I walk on the boat and what do you know, this dipshit tries to MC me. So I constantly move in and out of LOS, which gives the horde priest a chance to MC him off the boat.
---
Funniest part was the /spit spam from the NE priest.
---
I try not to other yuck peoples yums, but I can't imagine a more boring and stupid way to spend hours of your day playing this game
---
When the titans made your character they hit it with the ugly stick.. twice
---
Ahh, the struggle of the guy who thinks people care enough to use screen print.  I have seen many get red in the face due to subs like r/diablo2 and r/civ
---
If you go immediately back in, you should still be in the same dungeon and can turn it in. If you've joined another group, or waited an hour, you'll need to abandon the quest and do it again.
---
"sorry guys, my power just went out"
---
Warlocks can solo princess?
---
Did I read that you go to bed at 9:30 and wake up between 3 and 4 (so 3:30 splitting the difference) how do you deal with only 6 hours sleep? I wish I could do that. I try to get 8 hours a night.
---
Shazzrah
---
Any of the 3 gathering professions are never a bad idea. Choose depending on class. If you can kill devilsaur fast, safely, and easily. Maybe do that, hunter / rogue. 
---
Mages / druids can also do that easily as well, and any class can herb / mine just fine
---
I bet they hired the same reps that call to ask me about my extended car warranty.... damn
---
I got to the barrens at like lvl 14ish. Was there for about 7 levels then dipped to stonetalon mountains. Then shipped out to tarren mill at lvl 23 for PVP JUSTICE.
---
Not a maroon, it's a rouge.
---
Farm until you have gold to invest!
---
LBRS is easy with someone who knows the way in their, and if you avoid urok like the FUCKING PLAGUE.
---
Wow. TIL after 13 years of wow.
---
Don't use language that is against TOS. I see sick shit even once and they are reported.
---
/lick does not have any vocal or audible sounds :)
---
A bootlicker for understanding basic business and economics?
---
There are definitely super wealthy assholes out there, they are the less than 1% and I agree they could do more with their wealth. 
---
The point I'm making is that it's not as simple as "This man's rich, he only got that way by exploiting people and hoarding money" 
---
The hard truth is that creating a product or business that gets you to the millions/billions level of revenue isn't easy, it's hard work and no one is leaning back in a chair and making millions without first establishing an office, desk and chair to do so in.
---
I usually just ask if it's ok if I can need on something, assuming it's a questionable loot like yours.
---
He really needs to word stuff better, what if someone enjoys ret dps but hates healing? Are they bad because of what they enjoy and for playing the game how they enjoy?
---
Yeah so in his rotation you would Holy Fire, SW:P and start wanding.
---
How do you get it to tell you the AH price?
---
If I was in your group and you won it I'd ask why you rolled. Then go out of the dungeon reset and go at it again. It's a upgrade for you the dmg on it +the spell power effects your poisons a little.
---
I hate having the bags like that, Bagnon for the win aha
---
No, you've just never scanned the auction house. It tells you the average price of all of your scans.
---
&gt; Before I continue, you need to provide your experience as a healer. Just because your group was successful doesn't mean you weren't consistently pissing off the healer and making the run take longer due to forcing them to drink more.
---
I don't have to provide you with anything.
---
&gt; 1.) Where did I say there was more aoe? If this is a spell cleave group, the dynamic changes considerably. All dungeons I run have not been spell cleaving.
---
Just because it's not a spell cleave group doesn't mean people don't aoe, I don't understand why you think that this is a binary condition. Regular groups also do aoe on trash, warriors use whirlwind, rogues use blade flurry etc.
---
&gt; 2.) When mobs can kill dps quickly, the rogue picking up a mob to save the healer makes you at fault when he dies.
---
This makes 0 sense, how would the healer have aggro in this situation?
---
&gt; 3.) not every dungeon has huge open spaces for you to constantly kite. Not to mention that you are splitting the mobs up and increasing the distance between the tank, the healer, and other dps.
---
Again how is this relevant? You're not kiting you just nova the closest ones and move the placement of your blizzard closer to yourself to keep mobs slowed. Everything you write screams of 0 experience past sm dungeon runs.
---
&gt; Aoe damage on 40+ mobs is slow. You need at least 3 to 4 mobs before your overall dps is the same as single target. Thus you are reducing the time for the first mob to die, and if you don't steal aggro, it pushes the tank hard.
---
Ok sure but packs of 4+ are common in the later dungeons. And now you're making up a hypothetical scenario where the mage doesn't pull aggro to support this point you're now making. It's actually hilarious how much you're flip flopping. You can't argue both sides and expect to be taken seriously.
---
&gt; Aoeing mobs down only works without melee dps. Otherwise, they will get aggro and die.
---
How so? Maybe if the tank isn't in range of the mob that's rooted but somehow the melee dps is? What fairy tale situation would this be? 
---
&gt; A good mage knows when to aoe. And the frost talents cannot make up for that. A great fire mage is better than an average aoe frost mage.
---
Yes, a frost mage can aoe when mobs are at higher health due to their talents since they slow and root mobs just by casting blizzard. Combined with frost nova and cone of cold they can put out a lot of damage while taking none in return.
---
&gt; The latter scenario exists in very few places in wow. And if you make it work, you are the exception, not the rule. And arguing for less skilled players to try a build that demands high precision and good groups is trollish at best and naive at worst.
---
Happens almost every time I'm in a group with a mage, you're making out as if classic ability rotations require any kind of higher brainpower: they do not.
---
Double gathering profession. Sell everything. Either vendor or AH. Keep an eye on Green items I have. Sell to AH if I can make a good return, otherwise vendor.  Over 100g by 40.
---
I didnt read it like that.
---
Noggenfogger is really nice imo. Still lots of scandinavians and dutch/belgium people but most all talk english
---
I actually put my dismount/stealth macro on #1.
---
Been slipping for years, gotten significantly worse with the layoffs at the start of the year.
---
Just look further down in the subreddit. You'll see the post, has 2 golds and 10 silver
---
I have a nightmare of a time getting in groups for dungeons, and raids are virtuous impossible. It sucks.
---
Similarly as an Int / Spirit dagger shouldn‚Äôt be seen as an upgrade for a rogue.
---
I favor carapace personally (don't have it yet) but either carapace or ancient bone will serve well enough until you can lay hands on rhok'delar.
---
It's just you. Join a guild that uses voice chat a lot. Talk to people, run dungeons. Practice how to be normal.
---
You called him a murloc lmfao

F
---
&gt; Bad idea, now you never get notified when some program wants to gain admin privileges on your machine.
---
Who runs unknown programs on their computer for this to be a problem?
---
I turn this setting off on any Windows install I use, but I also have a known-good set of apps I use, and have "common sense" (Avengers HD 4K.exe at 5MB is probably not something that should even be clicked). UAC is a PITA when setting up Windows, and has annoyed me more than enough over the years to make it useless (if I see the prompt, I click Accept anyway since what ever I'm doing to present the message is something I **want** to be done).
---
Absolute worst-case, if I somehow mistakenly download malware and let it run, then it'll have free reign for all of a day or two since that's how long my Windows installs last before I go right back to Linux lol
---
I respec'd to Holy at around level 48. From 45+ ret doesn't scale too well vs mob hp, imo. I find 1h holy better than 2h holy because I never have to heal mid battle and it keeps my mana up, but you should experiment yourself. I think I could keep healing dungeons as Ret but I would be drinking more.
---
Could* you elaborate. Never played street craps and always looking for new gambling methods.  And trying /roll 2 (1-6) doesn't work. 
---
You can also play super crude poker (no suits)  with   
---
/Roll 13  
---
/Roll 13
---
I am pretty sure you got silenced for a month for using more than just the "f" bomb.  The context in which you say things can also be taken into account.  People who complain about punishments usually won't tell you the entire story.
---
As a matter of fact he did.
---
it's easier, faster, and higher quality
---
there's no excuse
---
Haven't played without an MMO mouse in years man, absolutely can't imagine how/why people go without one. It's night &amp; day.
---
During whole run rouge keep poisoning up for sheep, just to keep checkin on our cocky mage, what a glorious night it was
---
No, Orcs are from space...
---
Fairbanks alliance checking in! :D Lok- errrr for the alliance!
---
Always good when things work out
---
As a new player, this sub is awful at times, especially compared to the community in the game itself. 
---
It makes a new player like me think about if I really want to continue playing when all of these elitist players who've played forever are around.
---
Congrats! As a solo war I got mine at 43!
---
No lifer..
---
Uhh false. Blizzard called this a museum piece. It isnt supposed to be updated at all. They even said they dont care how many people play, and expect massive drop offs
---
Lol. No way phase 2 is any time this year. I‚Äôm guessing February at the earliest. 
---
Less than half of the playerbase is max level, why would they rush out content that people can‚Äôt even do yet?
---
3 months to level
---
3 months to do MC + onyxia
---
Then phase 2
---
Do you consider dropping tailoring now?
---
For PvP Shadow, I'm fairly confident that Undead &gt; Troll.
---
Neither of the Troll Priest spells are especially great in PvP.
---
Undead get Devouring Plague, which is great in PvP.
---
Once could argue that Berserking is good in PvP, but it's not as good as Will of the Forsaken.
---
PvE or PvP healing is a different story.
---
Sundered? I ran ony with you guys a couple weeks ago.
---
I just ignore anyone who posts about asshat... I mean asmon.  It really works!
---
A game's difficulty can be made difficult just to waste the player's time. In that it doesn't really challenge a player's skill. Like bullet sponges in a FPS. Or putting exceedingly long timers on things to make actions take longer to do (those microtransaction heavy games have a ton of those). Those are a couple of examples of being artificially difficult.
---
Now I don't believe Classic WoW has that type of difficulty. Difficult content in Classic WoW serves to make players want to group up. The harder content can challenge players to use their class kit to the fullest to defeat enemies. It's possible for the player to win and get over the difficulty with skill or friends.
---
Looks moourvolous on your head, that isn't bull, you could bet all your mooney on that fact, even if I am milking these udderly horriBULL puns for karma, wheat can still agree the hat makes moo look like Christian Hay Bale

---
Reading this story brought tears down my face. There are a lot of memorable places to me but none as impactful for better or worse.
---
Though I am a night elf druid and I've never been to Undercity, I'll attempt to make my way to Gallow's End tonight (8:45pm EST) on Whitemane to make my toast, we'll see how many times I get ganked. Maybe a friendly horde will show me the way.
---
Keeping threat has a ton of factors. Your level, dps level, level of mobs, gear, etc.
---
In short, no, its not going to be possible to keep threat 100% of the time unless you're playing with cooperative dps
---
Me and my boys do it with Sourfang , let the legend grow
---
Just craft runecloth bags to 300. You can usually sell them for a bit of profit, though it can take a while at this point.
---
Just hit 60 as a Warlock. Having a hard time finding groups for LBRS/UBRS/Scholo etc to finish out gearing. Guild is fine, but doesn‚Äôt yield groups with any regularity. Any tips? I stay on lfg and in major cities.
---
The mage can spellcleave the hell out of this dungeon so he'll have plenty of chances at the dagger. This is SM, not pre raid BIS.
---
All 20 of them
---
I actually made my first "Do not play with" spreadsheet today!
---
Two more questions
---
1.	How much xp/hr can I pull in ZF normal way, Im a lock cant join AOE groups?
---
2.	Who the fuck enjoys Uldaman?!
---
Most of the playerbase isnt even max level yet.
---
I stopped watching after about a minute because the editing and music was untenable.
---
Not a ninja, but you're gaping asshole.
---
Seems like a solid deal
---
Good question. Short answer: no. But that‚Äôs because the very best dps understand how aggro works for a warrior and plays around our ability rotations.
---
Edit: read the question wrong.
---
Nice, trying it later
---
Speak for yourself; anyone who even slightly cares wouldn't be causally handing their information to FB and Google, especially nowadays.
---
RIP Monitor
---
Finish up what you can in STV then clean up Dustwallow and SoS before moving into Feralas and Tanaris.
---
Just build lol
---
The fairest thing to do would be to have everyone roll need, then have the druid buy it off whoever wins for 500g.
---
Tell her to talk to you through the [b.net](https://b.net) app it will tell her what game you are playing through that.
---
DoN'T YOu gUys HAve PRNt SCReeN BuTTOnS?!?
---
It was the 2% crit mace from Uldaman
---
I have said this in a raid during an actual power outage, 100% legit.  UPS battery for the win. =)
---
I love that interface wut is it?
---
I believe Devilsaur lasts you until deep into BWL. If you're intent on raiding, get the Devilsaur. Epic mount will be a great help if you have gathering professions or intend to PvP.
---
Lemme ask you what‚Äôs a better upgrade 10dps or 5 more int? 
---
Don‚Äôt worry I‚Äôll wait
---
wtf is a campaign
---
As he stated you may play the game however you like, it is an RPG after all. But yes if you are not playing a game to optimize group success or playing to your maximum potential then yes you are 'bad'. A good player would be optimized and flexible to ensure the highest success rate with the great players being min/maxers. This is an objective viewpoint only and does not take RP into account.
---
Those 3 jobs clearly aren't paying that well if someone requires 3 of them at 60+ hours a week?
---
Sounds like minimum wage or low entry labor positions.
---
You're just derailing the entire point here, you can bang your head against a production floor for 30 years at 60 hours a week and make a mediocre living if you want, that's YOUR choice. There's absolutely no shame in it whatsoever, I come from a single mother that did it for 35 years.
---
You know what she told me? (Hint it's not :"Damn those rich assholes") she said "I wish I invested myself in something better, I wish I went to school to be a doctor or a veterinarian instead of getting complacent with this facorty job at a young age, I could have worked just as hard towards something better than towards mediocrity"
---
Hard work ethic doesn't = more money, I never once claimed that it did, however, hard work ethic does = more success. 
---
Whether you're a fast food employee, a factory worker, a surgeon or an engineer, hard work ethic will propell you further in YOUR FIELD than those without it. Period.
---
All those wicked claws QQ
---
ELVui
---
Yea I‚Äôve been trying to get some macros going just sorta confusing. Thanks for the breakdown
---
What? Phase 1 is when devilsaur demand is highest. Did you mean it‚Äôll never be MORE expensive than it is now?
---
Cancel your sub and demand a refund for the time you're missing then. If not, charge it back and provide evidence to your financial institution that they denied service to you.
---
Thank you :3
---
I did it last night as a 34 druid and it was rough at times with the resists and misses. I had a high group though, all in the high 30s. So not sure if that made it easier or harder.
---
It's TukUi classic
---
On a serious note, why would that appear? I know there's that certificate bs that the Battle net app does, but what would WoW itself be doing?
---
Guild Wars 2 told me that I should have used the auction house... when my mats got stolen by somebody who promised to craft for me. I couldn't have done that on the auction house. It was bullshit.
---
Yea I need to rework them just  haven‚Äôt got to it thanks for the tip
---
No you‚Äôre an asshole and probably a hunter that wanted to hit need on it lol
---
3rd 60 get a life
---
Do you think it's more worthwhile to get these robes or epic mount first? I'm debating where to invest my gold.
---
Nah that‚Äôs not true. I think most people are normal and chill. Only a few are weird.
---
If you look at the summon skills for your pets, they show a count of how many shards you have...
---
Love the group removal at the end! lololol
---
This
---
Wait wait wait... everyone just gonna ignore the fact that he said he is leveling his 3rd 60? I can't even fathom how much time you're putting into the game. Not even people who make a living off of playing classic WoW have the time to be working on their 3rd 60.
---
Daggers are all about the dps at that lvl. It‚Äôs a fair upgrade for a rogue. 
---
A agil dagger would benefit a mage zero. 
---
Ya I would have let the mage have it but it is totally usable by a rogue. 
---
Ur not a ninja just kinda greedy.
---
Wrote the name wrong too.
---
It's Gorishural, not Gorishurai.
---
You admitted it you crossed the line.   You don't get a say in your punishment, so if that's what Blizzard want to do, then that is what it is.   I bet you won't be doing that again in a hurry!
---
Yeesh dude.
---
Counter example: I reactivated my NA account while in Europe, played there for two weeks then returned to US, and have been playing with no problem
---
Start your own group! I've always found it much easier than waiting for a group that just so happens to have room for 1 more DPS.
---
Making friends with an active Healer or Tank is probably your best bet.
---
At this point, it's your connections that matter. I'd recommend trying to see if there are any Tanks/Healers you run with for other instances or those, and try to see if they'll be doing that content soon.
---
Best guy around! ^
---
What do macros have to do with this?
---
Yes, as stated in the title.
---
Well it prints you what‚Äôs on your screen. Giving you a picture.
---
Issa joke
---
Why are you getting downvoted? I thought this would just be water under the fridge at this point.
---
Sounds very similar to what I did! Never bought anything off the AH, stopped buying skills at 32, stopped skinning training at 225. AHed everything lol
---
Berserking and shadowguard are both pretty good but I agree that UD shadow PvP is probably better overall.
---
Not a ninja. Plain and simple.
---
Well you can be specced enh and be in the healer role for example. That's about the only time it would make you remotely an asshole if you were healing and rolled for dps gear over the other dps.

"Your shithead failson" Man grind your edge down, you're either a troll or the most misrible misinformed human I've ever seen on the internet, which is saying something.
---
How is that a strawman!?!? LOL so not only do you fail miserably at math in your previous post, but you don't even understand what a strawman is.
---
You're making a very VERY hyperbolic assumption that those who get inheritances "never have to work" that's not how most estate transfers even work.
---
You need to get off the YouTube conspiracy theories and actually get out in the real world LOL
---
I kind of went with the model that if some people were already listing them for significant amounts I would try the AH, if it didn't sell I would just vendor them after the first time
---
WoW has a pretty mixed history of success with windowed mode Gsync, but I find that on the new renderer it usually works fine with FPS capped. If you don't cap it Gsync will constantly disengage whenever you exceed your max refresh.
---
- Log in during peak times
---
- Start your own group; perhaps with a guildee healz/tank
---

Apparently ‚Äúhealers‚Äù can only roll on healing gear.

Yea but its not gonna happen where you can set ultimatums like that. Its already a rare spawn
---
Imagine having thoughts about Classic as a retail player

And you won the tiebreaker? Nice
---
Exactly, you have the power to control your own experience. The dynamic of two opposite factions who can't really communicate with each other and have the power to kill each other can either turn into a bloodbath or work together or anything in between.
---
Absolutely. Never played before 730pm, which is bedtime. 
---
Except launch day which I worked out with my wife :)
---
Imagine playing WoW for the first time and elitist walnuts like this guy look down on you and often laugh at you in game. Not a very inviting game with folks like this around.
---
If you really are this angry at people with more money then you how about I PayPal you $15 and you can feed yourself for a decade HAHAHA
---
you mean don't piss off an undead warlock when he's trying to dry off after a hot lava bath?
---
&gt; What would be glorious is content like BRD where the intent was, you clear it, maybe that takes 2-3 painful runs, and then you don't have to do it again.
---
That would take way too much time and resources on blizzards part.
---
It would basically be as much effort as Mechagon, except you would finish it in a day and have no reason to go back.
---
You become bad the moment you elect to serve as a cop, and you stop being bad (from that axis) as soon as you stop.
---
I'm not saying that they're assholes. I'm not saying they're bad people who won't go to heaven. I *wish* that were the problem I had with the police. If it were, we could just fire all the cops and replace them with good people.
---
The problem is not police, it's *Police*, the institution. I don't believe in the abolition of Policing with no replacement and leaving everything else in society the same, that is the first ten minutes of a movie by the same director as *The Purge*. 
---
I know that the Police are a privileged class of society who operate like a criminal family, constantly covering for one another, when if they were truly in the right transparency would be their friends. 
---
I know that police are trained to view civilians as an Other, an Outgroup, separate from The Force. They have to do this because otherwise the way they treat us would cause cognitive dissonance, and also because they have to constantly be on guard for threats from everyone they encounter. 
---
I know that the existence of desk jockey cops doesn't change the history of the institution, its purpose to protect private property from the interests of the populace, its function as an oppressive force against minorities throughout the world, and that as long as we are outsourcing the defense of our own communities to some privileged Other we are completely and thoroughly fucked.

Went to classic WC with my guildies last week. Worth mentioning they‚Äôre all veteran players who played actual vanilla back in the day. We still took a few wrong turns and the whole ordeal took so bloody long and after about half of it none of us were enjoying ourselves. I‚Äôll take Gnomeregan any day.

Nope, I was DPS.  Other person who rolled was Druid tanking.  Maybe he was the party leader, can't remember.  Might explain the boot.

Weapon swing timer.

I actually enjoyed alot of Asmons content but not any longer.  Its about more then the item, its about how you treat other people.

People used to be so adamant on not using modern technology that they‚Äôd actually write down the message on paper, then give it to another person who would take it to the recipient.
---
Doesn‚Äôt that staff have Agility on it? If so, then no the as an Enhancement Shaman I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs bad. If it has Intel on it, arguably no because you can still cast spells and the Intel will help with that, but not as much as if you were a caster, or a caster was using it.

If ‚Äúemp‚Äù or ‚Äúlava run‚Äù is in the name this goes to the last boss. Lava run skips a lot to rush the end. 7D+Emp is the slower more thorough run that goes to the end. You could do 7D+Emp at 55 but it would be a challenge. 
---
General/Golem/Vault are the medium difficulty bosses. At 55 runs that mention some of these bosses are good for you. 
---
Arena/Prison are the easiest parts. 
---
Quest runs will add extra quest stuff in the prison area and Baelgar who is close to the entrance but leads to a dead end and so is skipped by normal runs.
---
Kek?

You may feel comfortable over at /u/whoosh

Has no stats other than AP vs beasts.  It's really not an amazing weapon.  Just a hard hitter for WF.

I have a game pad I use for keybindings. Shift/ctrl are both under my left thumb, alt is under my pinky, then I have numpad 1-5 bound to my mouse. I physically don't touch my keyboard unless I'm typing. Couldn't recommend it more if you're playing a bind heavy class.
---
Damn. It's baffling to me people like to come up with bullshit stories like this, but what's even more impressive is that this sub just eats it right the fuck up
---
I will do that once I get home, good call!
---
Theoretically: If both are at top performance a mage or warlock will still pull aggro off a tank with their most damaging AoE setups, but this can be both avoided and controlled to the point that it doesn't matter who has threat anyway.
---
Realistically: No leveling dps is going to care much unless you have a strong line of communication or they realize that if they do die they won't get the experience and that having to run back slows down the entire group/grind as a whole.
---
You're right, it's way more fun to hang out with someone complaining about how all people suck.
---
But you see, you're not thinking about the shareholders profits. Think about their profits!
---
What?
---
I didn't have any mob grind in the 58-60 region. It was spent farming scholo for witchblade however
---
Don‚Äôt do stuff as a warrior where the enemies are higher than you.
---
That is what OP should have done, that way winning the item wouldn‚Äôt have made them feel like a dick.
---
Exploration. A lot of my favorite moments have been just figuring out where things are. Like my Paladin got a quest in Westfall to kill these bandits in the golden coast quarry. I found a cave with the bandits and kobold's. Too the back of the cave was a chest, it took me three or four tries to get to that chest (guarded by a kobold brute, a kobold, and a mage bandit)  but when I finally got it I got a new two handed weapon and some other cool stuff. 
---
Being able to explore and find hidden things like that make the world just feel more interactive and fun.
---
This rep is doing a great job and the embodiment of what a rep should be. I feel sorry for the processes which allow such false positives to slip through even with supposed manual review. It just creates more mess for the good guys to clean up...
---
Well problem is you. You are running a dungeon a few levels below what you should be and if everyone is 7 levels above you of course your are not going to be doing any damage or holding aggro.
---
It has beast damage not agil
---
Is it an upgrade? Are you using it? 
---
If the answer is yes, then you're not the asshole.
---
Fair enough. Although I didn't keep playing, I have come back for classic.
---
Just in case I haven't been clear, I don't necessarily have a problem with inherited wealth.
---
I have a huge fucking problem with inherited *billions*.
---
Any advice as for what a priest could do instead? I just hit 36 and I don‚Äôt even have 20g...I‚Äôm being incredibly inefficient in my leveling and gold usage for the sake of fun but gods do I want a mount xD
---
You are not. I have to take two laps to find the bat handler sometimes. The reagents vendor seems to move to wherever I am not too.
---
People often roll heal/tank spec because it's more useful in groups so everyone benefits, but the reason they are there at all is to get their DPS gear upgrades which they use the majority of the time they play. Trying to deprive people of the loot they use the majority of the time they play is ridiculous, this type of loot distribution is only justified in cases like guild runs to gear up people for their raid roles. Don't think it's reasonable to expect that from every pug. Best to talk about loot rules before starting the dungeon.

Probably because [it's far more secure and the inconvenience is minimal.](https://www.howtogeek.com/124754/htg-explains-why-you-shouldnt-disable-uac/)
---
For a mage / caster : obviously the intel
---
For a rogue / Melee DPS : strength / agility and then DPS
---
Really if the mage or any other caster is in the group and you can see that it is an upgrade for them because of the Intel / Spirit being on it, the Melee DPS should either pass on it, or at least ask the caster if it is okay for them to also need roll on it as a DPS upgrade.
---
Damn did I ever get screwed.  I couldn't make it back to the instance entrance before getting booted to Freewind.

I dont think you know what phase 2 is.

I have I think 16 days played on my main. Now I play on white main so i am going to day about 30 of those hours at least were afk to avoid going back into the queue the first few weeks. But i am just now pre raid bis of 2 days ago. I doubt that OP actually enjoys the end game and primarily is in it for the leveling.
---
I don't have the exact wording, but I remember thinking it was pretty funny the day it happened because my friends were giving me a hard time over teamspeak. I said something along the lines of, "Why was I banned for real world trading, I've literally never traded or used the auction house on this account."
---
Stalagg Alliance player. Please no.
---
go gank lowbies in the meantime. no communication required
---
Got it yeah I agree.  Ultimately time is everything in mmorpgs in general but classic really makes you invest in your character in terms of not only time but his reputation in the community and all that
---
Well. You deserved it. Now deal with it.
---
You take a picture of the printed paper with your phone. That's how it works.
---
Its bloat.
---
Well done on the work/life/gaming balance too. I'm also a father this time around and I've found leveling is much more enjoyable when you don't treat it like a pure grind!
---
The druid tank is stupid, if his weapon had any form of stats he misrolled, damage of the weapon don't affect druids in forms, the APvs Beasts is so situational, he was in the wrong
---
What about a soggy cracker???
---
And Skyshroud Leggings.
---
What song is that in the video? Also I'll never understand why people do that sort of thing its rarely a dog eat dog world in Classic but it happens
---
I mean.. it's nice for him and all but it's not like he took it from the guy. Would have dropped whether he got the chest or not.
---
"I know that....."

"I know that ..."

No you don't know anything of the sort that you're spouting, all you know is what you're being fed by bias sources, you couldn't be more wrong. I have never once been "trained to view civilians as an other, or seperate from the force" that's completely false and clearly comes from some authority hating mentality.
---
Everything you've just said is coming from the image movies, TV and bias news media has perpetuates of the police. Do a ride along for one day and see the average day of an officer, it isn't chasing down minorities and protecting the interests of the 1%. You're as bad at interpreting reality as you at dividing $110 Billion by $7 Billion people.

Pretty much this. Also I actually like to wait for one. I work shifts so I log in on pretty much any time imaginable here and there. It's amazing to see 10-15 people dropping off and getting on a zeppelin/boat at like 04:30 AM.

I was in a Mara group earlier where there was talk of going fast.  Usually going fast means just chain pulling without stopping much between pulls.  Nah, how about let's pull FIVE groups at once.  That's fast right?  Queue 5 minute run back.  
---
To be fair, I think the guy was just a noob.
---
Depends on the ratio of guildies to pugs I guess. If it were like 80% or more of the hosting guild reserving a legendary seems fine, but if there were so many pugs things wouldn't get done without them maybe open it up.

---
Blizzard cs has been on the decline for years now, this isn't new.
---
keep it simple. if a mob goes to the healer, run and grab it. if it goes for dps, ignore it. It is not realistic to think you can hold all the mobs with dps AOEing. Let dps have their tanking moment and you just worry about the healer. Either the dps die and learn to wait longer, or they tank the mob just fine and you don't need to save them. rogues and shamans are especially  good at easily handling a single mob.
---
Save the healer, forget the rest and your job is done

It really makes a big difference in Stormwind too.
---
Yep. That's why I farmed DM so much early on with my Druid. The hammer with 11 strength and 4 agility is absolutely insane and lasts you for an extremely long time as a Druid since the actual damage does nothing.
---
If someone lies to you constantly for years, gaslights you, abuses their authority, and you call them out on it, does that make you biased against them?
---
Dunno what server or faction, but alliance windseeker we‚Äôve got a pretty good more social guild going, lots of friendly folks, would love to make friends. If you‚Äôre up for it, let me know.
---
I had this problem all my friends ploughed ahead and then dragged me to dungeons 5-10 levels higher sadly I just had to stop running with them and just do my own thing now I am 50,000 x more effective but am not playing with my friends I am 50 now and they are all 60 so not too far apart endgame but yeah definitely sucked just tell them there is no point doing shit more than 4 levels higher than you cause you are pointless sad but true

Reserving legendaries, especially bindings, is pretty normal.  But it's also pretty normal for the core group to be providing most or all of the tanks

Can‚Äôt all be warriors. It‚Äôs already one of the most, if not the most popular class. He‚Äôs kinda right. If tanking stresses you out or whatever, then you probably are just not that good of a player. Tanking is very easy and is only hard when you don‚Äôt know the way in a confusing dungeon

The amount of times I've seen someone whining on forums about being banned for being toxic claim they "never even say anything bad" is so fucking funny.

They're actually some of my favorite threads to read. Most toxic played actually delude themselves into thinking they're not toxic, and are genuinely surprised when they're banned.

I was the first to post a picture in the tavern semi-expecting these posts to be the result. As much empathy as I have for the original OP it was also meant to symbolise the memory of all the other heroes we have lost over the decade since WoW originally dropped. In 15 years I feel we all have likely lost someone important to us and whether it be in game or out of game saw it as an opportunity to remember the people we love so dearly and lost..

The fact someone thinks its done for internet points borders on the line of sociopathic in my opinion but what do I know?

Dude you're a shaman, you're gonna get shit for anything you need on, even (and esp from) Hunters.
---
As much as yes, the team that is currently in place is the same team that ruined the game for a lot of us, classic might be an eye opening experience for them, and since a lot of the are the people who were playing this game vanilla-wrath they might be reminded why they fell in love with this game and try to go back to the roots of wow's game philosophy.
---
 As much as yes they've added a lot of QoL improvements (some of which I wouldn't mind in classic) they clearly went overboard with some of them. Classic is probably proving to be a good sign that players didn't want a lot of that shit. There's also the way the fuck overboard "loot has more RNG than fucking D3" loot system they have devised, and all the cross realm shit that brought horrible and shit tendencies to the majority of the playerbase ( basically "cross realm so no consequences"). 
---
Honestly if there was a way to gut all the cross realm (maybe keep it around for zone more than 1 xpac behind? Maybe...), and stop all the bullshit loot RNG (warforged concept mostly) along with the endless grinds for player power (artifacts or whole xpac legendary quests), retail would probably still be... tolerable.... I mean those are the big 3 in my opinion. I don't agree with everything else that has changed over the years but I would still be playing if those 3 things were reverted.

I don't believe so. Objectively speaking if you don't min/max you aren't playing the game well. I'm going to translate this to league of legends. Annie is a mid Lane champion. She is best played in mid Lane as her role/kit are best suited to doing so. Now there is nothing stopping you from running support or too Lane as Annie but this has a coat on the team comp (lack of healer/ brawler) and she will likely be outclassed by someone who is fulfilling the optimal role. You aren't wrong for playing Annie support but it is not the optimal play and will likely serve more as a hindrance than a benefit to the team. Make sense?

It's a million times easier with an MMO mouse man. Every ability your left hand is hitting, you could hit by moving your thumb 5mm instead
---
Flametongue is objectively the worst weapon imbue. Frost brand us actually pretty decent once you get ravager. The aoe can proc the weapon imbue for 300+ to everything hit.
---
If they are ‚Äòbad at tanking‚Äô, then that‚Äôs in agreement with the OP, who says it‚Äôs ok to only dps but that means you are not too good at the game. 
---
If you are taxed by tanking at all, you are probably not a strong warrior or player
---
vs Beasts is decent at the level considering all the bullshit you're gonna be doing in Arathi and STV.
---
You don't need to use an addon to notice that your faction is getting destroyed. Just play long enough and you'll easily tell which is the dominant faction in a server.

Black crow is just as BiS for warriors and rogues. Add on the gems, plus the good spell power gear means theres tons of people doing voone runs.

I was actually annoyed yesterday with a mage that landed at thorium point, I pmed him that I'd pay 1g for a port to org. He turns around runs up to make and stares at me for like 10 seconds, so I assume he's trying to invite me to a group, so I drop my group then he pms that he's in a group for ubrs and can't. His body language seemed to indicate that he would port me, then didnt which was annoying.

So I'm a tank, if a +hit "dps" item drops I would be needing. Now you might say that's off spec, I might even say it is off spec but in reality it is a situational item that is critical to tanking. While the DPS might use it for all encounters it doesn't make it less of a requirement for the tank. I think it is best to stuck with the "if you need, need" taking into consideration the item (I am looking at Hunters rolling on HoJ because it has +ap while ignoring the fact you don't melee hit anything)

None of those because I am not a filthy demonic orc.
---
I haven‚Äôt seen any coming from the Horde. I don‚Äôt spend too much time in the cities as I‚Äôm currently leveling in other zones.
---
and /fart
---
That's fine... as long as the 50 leave my group before the run and one of the other 50 joins instead. ;)
---
There's a twitch streamer called trainwreckstv who has bananas in his chat. Basically if you watch his stream for every couple minutes or whatever you get a banana that you can spend on sounds to play while he streams. I spent 2 hours the other day doing this method (I didn't know about it and made it up) going from 50 bananas to 1000. I eventually lost by losing 9 times in a row. Then did it again and lost by losing 11 times in a row.
---
This method does not work at all, because with enough bets you eventually keep losing continuously,.
---
I think people just don't really realize yet how difficult LBRS/Scholo/Strat are. I keep seeing people who are like 56/57 trynna find groups for them when really you're better off just waiting til 60 or sticking to BRD. Sure once you start picking up gear they get noticeably easier, but it's gonna be rough until then.
---
He literally just made the joke that asians eat cats. I thought it was funny but undoubtedly racist.
---
hey man whats your name and server, so i can, uh, help you get it if youre on my server
---
&gt; And there we go. No willingness to provide any experience of what classes you play, thus rendering your arguments free of context and full of hidden agendas.
---
Actually no, if i did tell you what class I played all it would do is confirm your biases and/or give you something else to latch onto to make excuses from. Keeping the discussion away from my "experience" on a certain role or class keeps you in check into discussing actual reality instead of making up strawmen in your head.
---
&gt; I will freely admit that I've not healed past SM. My main in vanilla was a rogue. And I can tell you that popping blade Fury in a pack of mobs was a huge no-no. On non-elites, sure. On a pack of 4 to 5? You'll die really quickly.
---
Yet every rogue I play with are able to do 500+ dps in an elite pack and not die. Says something about you? Maybe you never bound feint?
---
&gt; Blade Fury and whirlwind have cool downs. Thus limiting how much aoe damage and threat you actually pull. When you are aoeing, it is with the understanding that your targets will die quickly.
---
And they do a lot more burst damage than caster aoe does, plus as you've mentioned before they are in melee range and therefore a lot easier to pull aggro.
---
&gt; Additionally, mobs don't just target you. If they are rooted and have threat on you, they will not be static. If a player is in melee range, they will hit the player then continue to you when they break the root. So your Blizzard makes it lethal for anyone but a tank to be near.
---
Like I said, in which fairy tale situation would a melee dps be in range of a rooted mob and the tank not? Making up scenarios that never happen do not help your point.
---
&gt; As my final comment, you are willing and forcefully advocating a playstyle that strips aggro from tanks and forces the group to defend you.
---
The whole point of a tank is to defend their party. I'm not advocating or forcing anything this is just the type of scenario that I have witnessed day in day out in dungeons. I never did any spellcleave nonsense so maybe you're just unlucky and finding all the mages who dont know what they're doing at your level bracket since it's infested with them.
---
&gt; I'm done arguing on this. My experiences with mages in your playstyle have been 100% negative, especially as they think their talents are helping. They would literally be better off if they were fire as they would not have the false sense of security their spec gives.
---
Mine have been mixed, as expected. Some mages know how to aoe and not put undue pressure on their tank and healer and some just run into melee and die.
---
Your 100% negative experiences just shows you have some internal bias honestly.
---
The rules are good but I am confused about your DE comment at the end. Disenchanting is not something that the group is entitled to benefit from. It should never have been added to retail.  That's their profession and unless they agree to DE for you everyone should greed for the non needed item. 
---
With their consent thats an entirely different scenario. 
---
Best wishes on your future runs!
---
The crazy part is that you don‚Äôt even need to spec tank to tank really really well
---
He mentioned it like 4 times in his post dude.
---
He left out blink though
---
That‚Äôs not the offspec I‚Äôm talking about. 
---
I‚Äôm talking about resto shaman taking enhance gear because that‚Äôs their main spec and they are only healing for the dungeon and didn‚Äôt mention that before the run.
---
Plaguelands are real tough at 55. I was just there. Dying A LOT. Granted, I‚Äôm a warrior but just dungeon spam BRD
---
Dungeon is totally different. Part of what mages bring is free water especially for healers. So bigger pulls and faster runs for everyone
---
People were talking about his darksouls playthrough more an an expose as to how someone reacts when they're in a different setting.
---
It kind of shed a light onto Asmon without his support network of viewers to boost him through content, how he would fare on his own.
---
It also showed his viewers just how thoughtless he is, it's not just that he was 'bad' at darksouls, nobody cares about that - but it's how he approached the game - I've genuinely seen children pick up the game and play it better than Asmon.
---
It showed such a bad side of Asmon that his community pretty much had a nuclear fallout. Its pretty well documented on reddit if you care to see it. 
---
Basically, the issue a lot of people have with Asmon is that he's full of shit, has incredibly dumbed down content, doesnt play WoW at a level above auto-pilot and is generally an interesting person outside of the game he plays. 
---
If you've played any endgame content in WoW at a mythic level, you're already more qualified to talk about the game than Asmongold is.
---
I think you're right on the money.
---
If you think nature = hippies then are completely off. you know nothing about how NEs act in the warcraft lore, they are decidedly un-hippy like.
---
I think Blizzard made the absolute right decision. The actual offense is usually 3 times worse than what a person admits in public. You sound like a complete ass. Change your attitude man.
---
I just dont understand people who want to mount at 40. Take your time mount later enjoy the game the mount is still going to be there. You dont want to mount the first mount you see, take your time and grind baby grind it's going to feel so good when you get your mount.
---
Also, do we even know if it is specifically the Kolkar? Since there are 4 other centaur tribes I believe..
---
*When tanking as a Druid.*
---
I usually moonfire what I can then rejuvenate before jumping into bear. Is this a good idea? I forget which spell but I remember reading some will help with threat as well
---
*Not a Classic question, but laptops overall*
---
I use a pretty good Asus laptop. I can max out setting just fine without any slowdown. Only issue is it gets pretty hot.  Do my settings effect the heat output? I‚Äôm sure prolonged heat isn‚Äôt good for my laptop
---
I always used these two maps as rough guides, they're not perfect, but good enough to get a good idea:
---
Azeroth:  
---

---
Kalimdor:  
---
http://www.conradaskland.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2007/04/kalimdorflight.jpg
---
WPL is 51-58, EPL  is 53-60, WS is 55-60 so you're fine for any of those.
---
‚ÄúThreat spec‚Äù is a legitimate tank spec. So gear with +hit is fair game for tanks (I will say this is barring most/nearly all leather/mail pieces for warriors of course).
---
Oh, well. Crackers in a bowl. That could be a meal.
---
How much gold did you get for that long?
---
Awesome, man!
---
I grinded out the purple raptors in STV.  A little secret peninsula behind the arena.  It‚Äôs not super secret, but hardly anyone goes there.  But yeah.  I slaughtered them for an entire level.  Made a decent amount of gold too.  They frequently dropped a stackable Gray item that vendored for like 7 silver each.  And of course skinning then racked in a bunch of money too.
---
That's fair. But yes, if they mention they are enhance before the run it's fine. If they didn't it's annoying but I wouldn't call thema ninja - just an idiot.
---
Yeah, I bet you are. 
---
Can't believe this basic simple issue has left you unable to formulate a response mate, it's kind of embarrassing to be honest.
---
Oh cool.  I am using vendor price right now. Maybe I‚Äôll try and turn vendor off
---
If you don't have one setup already, attach the authenticator to your account. I used to frequently travel and play and all I did was fill in my code and I was good to go.
---
From what I can tell the spin can proc the WF aura but it won't spend it so its almost always up when you finish your whirlwind
---
If you dont like your name know, its only going to eat at you. And there is no way to rename. 
---
19 is not insignificant, but definitely not a whole lot in the grand journey to 60.
---
Was this on the same pc and everything? How would they know it‚Äôs a different person?
---
Yo definitely recommend getting the add-on "five second rule". All it does is add a little timer you can move around that counts down to when your mana starts to regen, and also counts for each regen tick.
---
widepeepoHappy /
---
Yes.
---
So you play too much that on your 3rd toon you have hit the bottom of the barrel and it's the mage's fault? *Picard facepalm*
---
I don't want to play that much. Post epic mount I don't need money lol
---
How many runs did it take you and how hard is str!tholme for a new player like me who has literally never done a dungeon before?
---
Love mailing my friend bleach with the title 'Drink this'
---
Believe it's a twitch emote that has extended beyond it, can probably find the face it shows through Google.
---
B is the only option
---
Knife ears get out
---
I've never ever seen this posted on this sub before. Not once!
---
Eh, I guess he meant for his wife then who was like 16 or something
---
&gt;I understand mine was account sharing but my younger brother can't play when I'm not home ?
---
I know it's shit, but according to the ToS that you agreed to, that is exactly the case.
---
&gt;Like come on... I've played wow since vanilla first came out never once had an issue I've given blizzard tons and tons of money over the years subscription transfers all kinds of stuff... 
---
Yeah I get that, and people have made all these arguments in the past about how ridiculous it is having someone banned for letting friends/family play even for a little bit, but that's Blizzard's official stance on it.
---
&gt;I finally hit 60 and boom next-day hit 30 day ban.. I sent an appeal in tho see how they feel about it. I could see if I did something serious
---
Hopefully the appeal goes well, but from what I remember in Vanilla, we even had blues posting saying that sharing with family was against the ToS.
---
You are braver than I.
---
Dang! You're definitely not in the wrong. If you're a Shaman, Hunter, Druid, or Warrior I'd say that's a great weapon for the level! Personally I was lowkey triggered the two times I saw it drop and the above stated classes greeded and payed no attrntion to it despite it being an upgrade because it was a staff...
---
After I get my little bro his level 30 warrior axe tonight, I'm going to bring him to Gallows End to show it off to all the noobs :)
---
I would never be in this position because I'm not stupid enough to roll greed on a 400-500g item in Classic WOW. And even if I were stupid enough for that to happen to me, it didn't, it happened to someone else, so why are we all discussing it for hours and hours? 
---
The guy who got this ninjad can take it as a learning experience. He can even apply the lessons to real life.
---
Or don't even jump and just run right down the middle.
---
Since when is str or agi valued over dps?
---
I actually drew inspiration from all the deer pictures, never knew a raccon was also involved! :D
---
Im not there to gear out someones questing set. If you roll for offspec gear without telling before the run, youre an asshole.
---
Then why do you have the app on your phone? Because hitting accept allows just that.
---
I guess you don't understand my point.
---
Warden Staff is nice and all, but what's the name of the song?
---
It's not a full meme spec raid.
---
Druid feral and resto aren't meme spec.
---
Feral tank is legit, feral dps is lowish but with effort it can be good. Resto is the prefered druid raid build.
---
That Rogue already knows he pissed him off, pretty obvious when the dude ran over to the chest while the rogue was looting and the rogue did a smiley face in say.
---
Showing him you just got a world epic takes some of the guys enjoyment away cause he knows you are now ridiculously happy.
---
To be fair, your attitude towards me would also get you silenced if it rubbed 5 people the wrong way.
---
What I want to happen is what happened with osrs. It started with the base game, then went to early expansion content (gwd, etc.) Then they veered after that. 
---
So basically:
---
2yrs classic
---
2yrs bc
---
2yrs work
---
Transition into "classic+"
---
it's more about good dps will not take aggro off you. any dipshit can buy gear off the ah and steal aggro with their leet dps.
---
The AH is your friend, put everything on there apart from the greys, you get your deposit back if nothing sells. Install auction mate or whatever it's called and just sell everything. I'm at 12g @ lvl 27. I have all my skills paid for and I have 12 slot bags. When I want a break from leveling, I just go out killing low level mobs and farming herbs until my bags are full. I even sell the bread and milk and other food pickups, generally you'll get a little bit more than selling them direct to vendor. 
---
Put every item up atleast twice, if it doesn't sell the first time, undercut your price a little bit and put it back up, who cares if someone buys it and resells it for more gold because it would just be taking up bag space if you don't sell it.
---
Are Males called Nurses?
---
I would like to know how they know it‚Äôs your brother playing since it‚Äôs the same computer. 
---
However if you got banned for that then esfand should be banned for that other streamer accepting the trade on stream. That clip was floating around here a while ago
---
Forming your own gold farming team is the only acceptable reason for having kids
---
It works and doesnt work for the same reason. You are equally likely to enter huge winning streaks as you are losing streaks. With enough money and time martingale with end up with a net profit, unless of course you run out before you will it back.
---
Rolling need on gear that isnt for your spec isnt considerend ninjaing? Then what is?
---
Thankyou so much!! You're an absolute legend. Eagerly awaiting the 10/20/40-man version!!!! Is there any way I can track your releases, /join Priest will only work if I'm on your server :(
---
I see people making a ton of hollow ass points.... 
---
A warlocks soul stone goes on healer so he can rezz everybody. No one has to walk. The warlock using this on himself is ridiculous and stupid, wasting time. No warlock will SS themselves with half a brian.
---
This goes for summons, mage food, and more. 
---
These aren't the same as lockpicking.
---
Without that rogue, you, do,not,get,chest! Simple as that, your group would literally skip the damn thing because yall had no choice. But if the rogue isnthere, let him have it, there are many chests in most dungeons, locked ones go to rogues. 
---
We paid for tools, and spent time and energy leveling this profession up, not for you, but for ourselves to obtain loot and tips via opening boxes u can hold in ur bag/bank. 
---
Do we ALL get to roll on that skinners onyxia hide ? Or the miners ooze covered nodes and other special late game nodes. Can we take special ammo from raids and 5mans that a hunter would definitely need more ? 
---
Not everything is just all fair and for grabs. These locked chests are meant for rogues, if he wasn't there youd be skipping it. Ppl call them selfish for not sharing one of the 4+ chests but they wouldn't be getting jack if it wasn't for us taking the time to even level our skill. 
---
I'm not against sharing, i go far out of my way to lend a hand, give and make gear, or just helping lobes out. But locked chests stay for rogues in my opinion. I'm very very open if someone can change my mind here. I like to see other ppl perspective on this.
---
I am thinking about picking up enchanting as a profession for myself, but I have no idea how this is typically handled in groups... If I were to offer a DE service to the group, how would the shard distribution be handled?
---
Thanks, good work on this post!
---
R.I.P
---
What are yall deleteing shards for?
---
Leather - sure. Mail - depending on the item (Bracers, Belt) it can be worth the small arm or loss. Just look at True Flight from Majordomo - they often are Tank prio. A mail helm on the other hand...
---
My friend is travelling to New Zealand from Europe and is planning on raiding/playing with us whilst away? Is this something I should now advise against or are they safe to play on EU servers on their EU account whilst on holiday?
---
If he waits it out the DM:North mace will be out in Phase 2 and most druids won't buy a Warden Staff ever again.
---
Thats balls dude, Blizzard Admins will definitely temp ban someone for doing that in WoW
---
Don't shield bears either
---
Is this from Twitch add-ons?
---
Idk man, it's not as straight forward. Both Tremor totem + grounding totem always tripped me up as a lock back in vanilla. Of course, admittedly, I was a bad.
---
haha EXACTLY
---
Zezerouth is right
---
I mean other than it being an actual cultural delicacy in certain Asian areas? You right it racist.
---
Under command-line based operating systems such as MS-DOS, this key causes the contents of the current text mode screen memory buffer to be copied to the standard printer port, usually LPT1. In essence, whatever was currently on the screen when the key was pressed will be printed.
---
Yes, the print screen did exactly what the same says it did. But it is now 2019 and there is no reason to print 99% of things because we have the internet. Same reason why we dont have to use our phones to post pictures of our computer screens. Literal button for it.
---
Hi u/Araxom, I work as a flight attendant and as such I travel to many different counties for my job. I was considering to buy a gaming laptop so that I could at least log in and play Classic while overseas. Is there something I should do within my account settings etc ahead of time to prevent any issues like the OP had? Thanks
---
A million times!
---
Mmmh I live in Asia but play in EU servers as that is where my friends live I hope nothing happens.
---
It was about 9-13g/hour depending if greens dropped (level 40 frost mage )
---
is there a classic version of this website?
---
http://maxdps.com/
---
used to use it all the time
---
It's literally ur opinion there. That unimportant loot might be enough for the opposite to argue that they think it's more than worth fighting for
---
time. it ooms them then they have to drink mage water to make more. its honestly boring and a chore. Still its something to do in down times.
---
If you grinding as any other class at a mage aoe spot you are stupid and a bit of a douche. . I hate mages and their attitude but there are literally hundreds of other grind spots just as good, and you intentionally choose one of the 2-3 viable spots aoe spots in your level? You know there is gonna be mages there, you know they are gonna be annoyed at you being there, and you also know there will be competiton making the spot shit. So you are intentionally going to a place that annoys people, where you won't get good exp. They don't own the spots no, but going there to grind is just stupid.
---
Euh what? Combat is more than fine in pvp
---
I started doing the stv grind but it was way too populated on my server. So I went badlands. No one bothered me. No one ganked me.
---
This was always why I loved the original WoW and even Everquest.  
---
You had to take care or you would die.  The regular world was very challenging and the dungeons could be even more difficult.
---
That is just wrong. If he is in the group to heal, resto talents, resto geared, he is a resto shaman. I dont give a fuck what he does in his sparetime. He is here to heal. He gets the healing gear.
---
You even admit to not do it, how can you still try to defend that point?
---
There's no xp penalty on quests until they turn grey (or 1 level before grey on some quests, but that might be a bug).
---
Improved drain soul proc in affliction tree for mana regen. Requires you to use drain soul when killing a mob  and if you are using it every time your bags will overflow with soul shards.
---
Took vacation to level up and to get most of the pre bis.
---
Now I mostly play on raid nights.
---
Part of the dps job is threat management.  Most of them don't do this well right now.  You can hold aggro from crazy mage aoe no problem as long as the dps work with you.  They need to give you time and understand their own threat which sadly most don't.  Example with a frost mage... he doesn't need to wait long just to start blizzard... if he leads with a flamestrike straight into blizzard he would have to wait longer as the initial hit of flamestrike hits harder and then instant blizzard ticks on top of that with the burn ticks he will pull aggro quite easily.  He could wait a good 20 seconds and if he wanted still pull aggro just by blasting all of his mana into arcane explosions.  It's a cooperation for an aoe group to work with the tank.  They need to give you time the harder they plan to aoe.  Don't feel bad if they pull from you that's them failing at their job.
---
I swore I was never going to play again, so halfway through Wrath, I deleted everything on my character.  No money, no gear, I don't even think I kept a hearthstone.  Didn't delete my character, though - JUUUUUUUUUUUST in case.  The alts I had were all low level; I deleted all their stuff, too, but kept the druid I'd leveled some.
---
So then I resubbed and bought Cataclysm.  Oops.  I sent a ticket in, explaining what I had done, and get gifted shortly after with a full set of "catch-up" gear, some food, little bit of gold.  It was amazing.  So yeah, the old guard of CS was pretty solid in my book.
---
It's not itemized for healers just like stam/int/spirit isnt itemized for caster dps.  Both can use it, but the priority should go to who it's itemized for.
---
At least thats what all the healers that bitch about casters rolling on stam/int/spirit cloth say.
---
Someone was outside BRD waiting to get a port from a mage. He opened trade with me(a rogue), then proceeded to trade me 1g. Random guy. Never talked to him before. Then I proceeded to watch their conversation. Warrior says, "Port?". 
---
I laughed all the way out of BRD.
---
That dagger is our 3rd best dagger outside of raids lol, you still use it at 60 until you farmed the Scholo one.
---
No way in hell that rogue used it for more than like 2 levels.
---
You can cast one buff on the target before MC is considered broken, no other person required. If you want to cast multiple buffs on them then you'll need to MC them again. You might need to have it keybound though, for example my Fortitude is blind to alt-1 so I can MC somehow and quickly press the keybind and my very confused target now has a lot more health. Then I dispel it before melting their face with a mind blast crit and /cackleing .
---
I lived in China for quite a bit. The authorities will tell you not to eat from corner bbqs as they serve mystery meats like cat meat. 
---
It isn‚Äôt about Asians eating cats. It‚Äôs about shady restaurants serving any meats. 
---
We had food scandals every week there from painted meat, poisonous powered milk and frozen dim sum, etc. So yeah... it was intense. 
---
Also bear in mind that in Guangdong province they have a saying that they will eat anything with 4 legs except tables and chairs. For example, they would eat monkey brain from a living monkey.
---
I wouldn't do that if I were you. If someone by chance would mark a moon for you, by pressing that macro on the same mob you would remove the mark. Unless you were planning on having 2 separate bindings.
---
Hey what helm is that? Super cool.
---
If  I am frost does +10 magic spell damage the same as +10 frost dmg? Or is it calc different
---
First, this is exactly what I try to achieve, clear upfront communication. Second, your attitude towards support chars is ... interesting. Congrats to all pew-pew damage dealers that they get their grinding gear directly from their main role. It is kind of selfish to not think about the support chars... I would not like to run dungeons with you, if you only see me as a walking heal pot.
---
Hi, /u/w1nddancer

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dblxb5/finally_hit_exalted/). 
---
Why do you assume he has resto talents? That's like assuming a tank is speced as protection, its actually not a requirement (but it might make it easier). I tanked every instance till I respect at 60 as a MS spec as levelling as protection is stupid.
---
it's just the mechanics of the game. you'd do more damage if you pulled out your ranged weapon. 
---
you could also focus on 100% uptime on your shouts, hamstring runners, your utility skills.
---
curse of exhaustion and then /walk away
---
People have things to do too. Wow is not their only responsibility
---
And some people never want to get better. Or dont have the time to do so
---
I wouldn't have a problem with that. In fact that is what the original summoning stones use to do. Nobody used them though because they were not that efficient.
---
That dagger is a casters 3rd prepaid BiS lol, you use it all the way to 60 and with SoA in the offhand it's a few percent worse than out first preraid BiS.
---
It might be SM, but it's an amazing caster weapon and a shitty dagger lol.
---
And you chose the master race as well, good on ya laddie.
---
I think the biggest difference is that Lower is mainly a 5 man dungeon and Upper is a 10 man, so you're really never gonna be doing the whole thing in one run like you can with BRD.
---
Engineering and consumables. Do what you can to keep him stunned and rooted. It‚Äôs a race to see who dies first, so crank out your burst damage. With geared rogues and warriors, soul link is always the answer.
---
Thank you. I appreciate that
---
I did something like that in Dustwallow Marsh.
---
I was grinding Murlocs for a quest when an ally mage runs in, pulls every Murloc in the camp and proceeds to AoE them down. I wait until after he's used frost nova and it has expired, then I counterspell his Blizzard. Before he realize what happened he had ten Murlocs tearing him to shreds. 
---
I then went back to farming and finished up and left the zone just as he was coming back from his corpse run.
---
I was 42 when BC dropped. I also only got to lvl 35 ish on the Horde before LFD tool and heirlooms came out. 
---
I just got to 36 on my tauren and I'm very much excited that I have no clue what to expect for leveling or endgame from here on out
---
dude, this is classic. There isn't that kind of offspec, ie nobody is going to be changing their talents back and forth constantly.
---
Offspec means as the other gentlemen mentioned, hit gear on a tank or spell damage for a healer for when they want to be more offensive etc.
---
When you run back to Orgrimmar and turn in a 7k xp quest.
---
To other classes: Yes we do.
---
Good. I don‚Äôt want to group with someone rolling on 2 item sets because they are unable to do a quest solo.
---
I was definitely considering doing that if I didn't get any responses! Thanks for the advice üòÇ
---
Please do not compare my lovely night-elf homeland to fucking Florida, the scum of my IRL homeland.
---
I know what offspec means. Why are tou commenting on a deleted post?
---
Add on, just bandage the pet.

I came to ask the same thing. I have never had a rude reply and I have opened many tickets over the years for multiple issues including a few for similar reasons. I traveled to China for work back in CATA and was there for 5 days and got suspended and all I had to do was show my flight info and passport.
---
He's already said in another comment he's going to roll need when it drops as a rogue lol.
---
kinda needy
---
350 is fair. I‚Äôm on Herod horde and bought from guildie
---
I'm a huge fan of old school machinimas like Myndflame, WoWCrendor, and Oxhorn's content for example, and my friends and I aim to bring back some of that Classic vibe from the olden days, but with out own unique voice and style.
---
After over a month of editing, I can finally say that this project is complete (with two more episodes hopefully coming soon). This video is more a TV show episode than a regular gaming video. It aims to parody sitcoms, noir films, John Wick, and Quentin Tarantino (especially Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction) while also being its own unique and entertaining piece.

This took forever to make and I put a LOT of work into it. I'd love it if you guys gave it a watch, or shared it with someone who would be interested!
---
As with all art, sometimes it is portrayed differently than the author intended, so let me know what you thought of the video! As it's a parody in some ways, you may notice an excessive use of laugh tracks, even in very serious moments. This is all intentional, as I'm making fun of the use of laugh tracks in the first place. Let me know if I went overboard with that, or anything else! Were the John Wick references clear? Was the intro too long? Did you like the obnoxious, eardrum breaking screeching of the intro? (again, some parts are intentionally bad, but I hope I didn't go overboard since it still is intended as a high quality and hopefully enjoyable video)
---
This video took a ton of effort to make so I really hope you guys appreciate it!
---
I'd love any feedback from you guys in the comments cause all feedback helps me improve in future videos. The best ways you guys could help me is by watching and giving feedback as well as sharing with people you know would be interested!
---
Note: I'm sorry for the repost. I changed my thumbnail after uploading the video and despite making the original post on here AFTER changing the thumbnail the reddit post would show the old and less glamourous thumbnail. Finally after like three days reddit has recognized that I changed the thumbnail but only after I made it into a new post. Deleted the old one. Again, I'm sorry if this broke any rules.
---
FUCK that guy. This is Kromcrush server. IF ANYONE SEES THIS GUY KILL HIM. He fucks with people all the time, and if you leave him alone he will try to get you. Sledge killed me twice on my escort quest in feralas, so naturally I killed him 4 times in a row on his.  When we first saw him we weren‚Äôt trying to fuck with him, and this crazy motherfucker just starts dotting us up while he was on the escort. Good to know he‚Äôs in Tanaris now. I‚Äôm coming for you, you little gnome fuck.
---
The pulse is just aggro, it isn't a true taunt
---
Screw then , I go and tag mobs just to piss them off. They think they are elitist that own the game because they chose an easy mode class.   I mess up there pulls as much as possible
---
The key is minimizing downtime unless you're seriously aoe farming. Fighting more than 1 pack at a time is generally pointless unless you're overleveled/overgeared. 
---
Pace is mostly limited by the healer's mana. Focusing down mobs generally results in less damage taken, and therefore less heals needed. A mob at 100% generally deals as much damage as a mob at 20%. Also, focusing damage should practically eliminate the chances that a runner will break away and aggro another pack, which is bad for obvious reasons.
---
Because I can see what talents he is using? Are you trolling?
---
How else would I know what his talents are? This isn‚Äôt an assumption. 
---
You quest more than dungeons yet somehow you don‚Äôt have a set of gear for quest? 
---
Are you 60 and have issues doing quest solo? What quest that‚Äôs solo gives you issues?
---
Some of these dances would have been so good to have , if blizzard respected their wotlk promise
---
People use to do this, enchanter would tell the grp then de everything and people would roll at the end on the shards. You need to trust the group but it can work well. Usually we would roll the more expensive shards first and it was round robin.
---
Lol, what you get for an undead rogue leading
---
I spent a good time sightseeing in Undercity (so beautiful) before realizing Gallow's End is in Brill.

It took some doing but I'd like to give a toast as well.  [https://i.imgur.com/bekMB8k.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/bekMB8k.jpg)

Sadly a bunch of town guards spawn every time I enter the tavern, even if I kill them. Which made taking the screenshot very difficult. I hope this suffices and maybe one day I can find a way to peacefully hang out with my undead friends. Thank you for sharing your story with us! &lt;3
---
Whaaat? I thought I‚Äôd read on another post that it was a lot less than this. Don‚Äôt suppose I could do anything to make it chew up less data?
---
Which ones are the streamer servers? Ik Faerlina is one but idk who streams there or the other stream servers
---
BS! The dagger has SP on it and is a mages wetdream up to lv 60! No rogue rolls on a trash caster dagger that at best is gonna be replaced at 38-40 anyway. Ive leveled so many times on pservers and ive legit never seen a rogue roll on this dagger EVER for obvious reasons.
---
In a spellceave group, you are not tanking in the traditional sense since warrior has zero consistent/effective aoe ability. A tank in spellceave group has the role or pull and gather the giant numerous mob into a ball before the mage blizzard the shit out it. Once the blizzard slow apply, your role become using taunt to guide loose mob back into the big ball of mob without getting pummel by frost nova mobs.

While your group is setting up and/or waiting to kill the packs over the bridge to Drakis room, run around the room at the other end of the bridge (between the bridge and the bonfires, and all the corners) spamming flare and trying to cover all the ground. You need to get that assassin if you want an easy kite, and don't go if you haven't found it. It feels to me like it only spawns once people get on or over the bridge and then patrols around. 
---
Once it's gone you can safely run to Rend's room and that should be more than enough time.
---
noobs everywhere
---
You think we do but we don't.
---
Stampi forever.
---
It would be great if an addon automatically did this.
---
AFAIK, there isn't one. I hope I'm wrong though.
---
Depends if you want to be selfish or selfless. Also the buff limit issue might be a factor, not sure wether that's completely fixed yet.
---
On my original Vanilla/BC character I was lvl 41 with 14days play time haha. A year or so ago I tried to grind quests to max level but quit around 70 because it was boring and not challenging. I never did dungeons or anything above 40, I'm nearing that on my new classic character and I'm getting pretty excited!
---
The threat the totem generates is very little, some attacks, a shock, or a couple of heals is enough to take aggro off it. Best used if you pull more than one mob, dont have anywhere to run, and just focus one down.
---
Not buying anything off the AH can also be a mistake. I periodically checked the AH for low priced BOE blues/recipes that would invariably go up in price as the server economy matures. I ended up making about 15 - 20g just buying and selling 3 BOE blues lmao 
---
Hell I even bought a Savoury Deviate Delight recipe for 8s that usually sells for 5g+ and the price is still going up lol 
---
Make your gold work for you :)
---
I‚Äôm being stubborn and refusing to get any addons until I start raiding and need DBM lol. I have put a few things up on the ah but half the time it doesn‚Äôt feel worth it ya know?
---
We had literally just run through that room and over the bridge after the previous wipe. We'd already killed some assassin's too so I thought it was taken care of.
---
Yeah i hate to call out Mythic+ since I know lots of people love it, but it forces dungeons to be pretty linear and boring. Even some of the more interesting ideas like Waycrest Manor end up feeling quite linear and you're more or less taking the exact same path. King's Rest is probably the worse example, it may as well just be one long corridor with boss rooms.
---
Word, will have to try it out at 60, 58 right now
---
B , because people who go to A or C must have problems
---
For priest its debatable actually after a certain amount of fear wards its redundant and the extra spirit becomes better.
---
Same here
---
I was perm ban in  Wrath  for doing  Casinos,  \* i didn't take  the  first suspension serious\* Watch  out.
---
Well "way too much effort" is debatable -- I mean, they put in the time and effort in 2003 with shitty tools where everything took way longer to do things like this. Every dungeon probably could not be done to this standard, not should it, but it's probably feasible to ship a few experiences that are of this design philosophy per retail pack. The juice isn't worth the squeeze when you look at it through a pm / production perspective, but in the long term, having deep experiences that are not intended to be mega repeatable allows for a lot of a greater breadth of content. And arguably, a lack of that content breadth (ie, all content feels like a modulated, uniformized, effectively similar chunk) is why people are quitting retail.
---
 It's not an efficient use of time in the short term, because in the short term, you'd rather feed your 95%. But, if you forget to design for your 5%, your game suffers too -- basically, you need your AQ40/Naxx even if 1% of players run it, and even if that development time was super inefficient. Same concept with your BRDs and mechagons. 
---
Reasons to go back would be "it's fun" or "I want some cool loot", not "the games progression is physically forcing me to need to repeat this content". Blizzard can sweeten the pot with incentives to run it, but I think putting a hard mandate on it is where the fun dies and players hate it.
---
Best
---
No no, you want no kids and 3 monies, not 3 kids and no monies!
---
Or just posting it from your phone.
---
6s+ was fire. Best phone I‚Äôve ever had.
---
Its got + spell damage its a caster weapon.
---
When I make macros for my weapons ill shift click the weapon with the macro script open and it auto fills it in. Try that
---
Eh it sold well through all of vanilla, I'm sure it'll be fine. That said, if you can get 300-400g from it now I'd 100% do that.
---
&gt;they'll probably think I'm a rude asshole.
---
So.. they'll be right..?
---
He literally terraformed parts of Azeroth. It's really weird how there are some that think he just didn't exist before the events of Cataclysm. He even infiltrated the Alliance during the second war!
---
Combat dagger: Sucks don't ever play this.
---
Seal fate dagger: Very niche burst spec that won't be good.
---
Coldblood prep dagger: The go to dagger spec, strong burst especially with coldblood, and quite versatile. In general dagger is better than swords but a lot harder to play efficiently due to the high energy costs and low combo points. However you are specced wrong, should be 21-7-23 or 21-8-22
---
Prem dagger, no reason to go this over coldblood prep dagger.
---
Combat swords, useless.
---
Seal fate combat , useless.
---
Hemo, Idk what you are doing going 24-3-24, should be 21-3-27. This is the cookie cutter sword pvp spec. Very easy to learn and quite strong. Early game this build easily generates combo points without energy pot/items and 5cp eviserate crits like 2.1k early which makes this build oneshot. Also very nice spec if you want to do other stuff than pvp, hemo does decent pve damage just don't go to raid with it
---
Sealfate hemo, no reason to go this, hemo already builds combopoints fucking fast
---
Also you are missing out on the imp sprint specs. Basically take the prep dagger spec and the hemo spec and instead of going coldblood you spec down to imp sprint. This helps a ton versus mages and druids for BG's, but you kinda want a bit of gear so the loss of coldblood isn't that bad.
---
Your attitude is amazing! I love how you view the game.
---
Hot take, but if your weapon was a lot worse I think its fine. Also if there are no similar/better daggers you could get other content.
---
thats such bullshit, no wonder so many people have issues with this guy. literally no repercussions for being a ninja
---
Awesome. Reactions like this show me how valuable such a macro will be. For me and for you. We will never have to play together! Oh, communication is beautiful.
---
Based on what I see in trade chat people are constantly looking for healers.
---
Woohoo! We in the building!
---
People can bitch all they want about loot. bis is bis. I dont care what the stats are. There's a reason it's bis for casters and healers. 
---
Its literally just 29 bonus spell/healing power and not in anyway confusing or something that can be claimed to be an offspec trinket for anyone. 
---
If you wanna roll on spirit gear go for it, personally I don't care. Ill run a dungeon a hundred times if need be.
---
I vendor almost all greens.  No one is really buying shit at this stage in the game.  Everyone is trying to save their money for their mount.  I think by about Feb or so when most people have hit 60 and are wanting to do some raiding then the market will pick up.
---
I am not so sure about this anymore, I had a vendor I was camping lose limited items without anyone else approaching.
---
Lol dude. A mod removed your post because it wasn‚Äôt good. Nice communication. Can‚Äôt even see your post anymore üòÇ
---
Not sure on druid questions but I know heals cause threat so self hotting can't be bad.
---
On the laptop if you're getting more fps than your screen's refresh rate (hertz) then set the max fps setting in game. If you want it to run cooler set that max fps setting to your refresh rate and then lower the settings. This should allow your hardware to cool off a bit.
---
The increases dps from using a cat is more than the wolf buff gives as long as you are proper minmaxing your cats dps.
---
Nice robe though!
---
I‚Äôve become the guild‚Äôs tailor so not at all!
---
"You are higher lvl than me, you must be neglecting your kid" lol fuck off
---
It's weird that we are such a rare class. I was worried that everyone would pick one because of the fast leveling and general all-rounder vibe. As it turns out, there's no competition for loot and we are extremely good in p1 raiding. 
---
Hunters are definitely the class that has advanced (in terms of average player knowledge) the most since vanilla days. I'm certain that 99% of hunters in 2005 didn't even keep their pet on passive and manually send it when at a safe angle, so of course it body pulls on auto engage. Same things with using decent macros and swing timers.
---
No, but I had a toxic and impatient rogue running ZF today.  Took 30 seconds before he was bitching about other players DPS, irritated when the leader had to take a 30 second break, etc.  It was constant in the first 5 minutes.
---
I could see how it was going to go for the rest of the time.  I was the tank, and just said the rogue goes or I do. Rogue talked more shit so I just left.
---
Found another group in minutes and had a smooth run.  He imploded that group after I left, then imploded the next one he tried.
---
I get wanting to be efficient but this rogue was lower than everyone else and just downright toxic.  I want to level quickly, but not with him!
---
Asmon's whole argument is that you never roll greed on a BOE epic, problem is,  Roy was leading the group and clearly deceived the group, yes, they should have waited for him to roll before rolling greed, but they're not stupid for thinking they can trust the officer running the guild raid.  That's victim shaming, and it's just fucked up.  He ninja'd from the group and should be banned.
---
They're only like 1-2 gold each
---
I quest more than I instance? That is an assumption.
---
Draw your weapon and /ready.
---
If he is low on mana do /drink then /ready.
---
I‚Äôm not always a rude asshole. For every bad interaction I have 10 nice ones. I wouldn‚Äôt have made it to 60 and found a guild if I hadn‚Äôt. I know people like to assume I‚Äôm a terrible human being who does nothing but cuss others out, but it‚Äôs not that black and white. I just got tilted and said some stuff I shouldn‚Äôt have.
---
yes you were wrong. it is a caster weapon and a caster rolled need. 
---
if the casters greeded, you should have asked to roll on it and linked what you're currently using. then roll before anyone can say no.
---
Reddit suspends my account when I use it from work. Stupid security shit
---
Good point
---
I bound it to middle mouse button, and literally use it while tanking
---
Yes, you are in the wrong.  On my warrior I picked that dagger up for the same reason.  Was a big dps boost for more threat tanking.  Of course I got it when no one else needed on a run and even told them why I was going to need it before rolling and linked the dagger I was using and had no issues.  It's obviously a caster dagger.  If some cloth dropped with int and stam would you roll against clothies because you wanted the extra stamina?  Probably not, same reasoning you shouldn't need that dagger if any caster needs it.  Don't ninja gear if the proper class is there and needing it, big time ahole move.  At the very least ask before you just hit that need button when you know you felt dirty doing it.... that's why you were waiting.  You are absolutely in the wrong.
---
After reading the threat guide, I think you're pretty much on point.  Some key points to consider:
---
1.  You didn't specify your level, so just know that caster form FF generates a flat 108 threat so if your MF doesn't hit as hard then this may generate more threat.
---
2.  If I am interpreting the guide correctly, then talents in Furor and the Wolfshead helm will generate 75 (5 per rage) threat with mobs when you shift in combat. This means powershifting not only buys an extra maul/swipe but is also essential to building threat.
---
3.  You should pop rejuvenate right before taking damage to maximize its threat potential because threat is only generated for actual healing done (not overhealing).
---
4.  You should invest in a cheap laptop cooler if you don't have one. The ventilation will add years to your laptop's lifespan.
---
Very helpful thank you !
---
On a side note: i don't get why mage is such a popular class anyway. They can't heal, they don't get to wear cool armor, and they can't keep pets or summon demons. They're just boring.
---
Take my upvote for that adorable gname!
---
Not sure if you're a Hunter but be prepared to run UD Strat forever to get lotsa bis items
---
I really don‚Äôt know about this one. I‚Äôve tested this theory out and found I killed mobs a lot faster using heroic strike still. What makes you wish you had done this?
---
for every person i murder, theres 10 i dont, so i dont know why ppl think im a murderer.
---
You wish.
---
Greedy Rogues imo. Childish greedy and entitled view if they believe they have a right to Need those
---
"i gtg lobster just gave birth"
---
it also has higher weapon damage. Which is the most important thing for a dagger. Spell damage is irrelevant.
---
Friends
---
He rolled up to Onyxia and found a raid about to go. A mage says in /s, "Trade for water."
---
He trades the mage and gets several stacks, but he's not in the raid. He effectively ninja'd the water.
---
It's incredible to me that you were able to complete the quest that bugs it given its uh....interesting droprates.
---
Ok. Now reply to the rest of what I said.
---
I was leveling in Tanaris, doing the quest to kill Swashbuckler pirates. I was near the ship docks where there's a lot of swashbucklers. Some mage named Krillen came up to me while I was killing 2 swashbucklers and said "Why you gotta ruin the mob spawn man i'm aoe-ing here". The guy wasn't there when i killed the 2 mobs previously. He proceeded to run up to some more swashbucklers, pulled them, ran to me and dropped aggro. I died. He /spit on me.
---
Krillen, if you're reading this, I'm glad you died to that horde rogue you fucking dogshit gnome. If you're ever in need of a tank you can go fuck yourself too.
---
What? You can shield, just not before the pull. Use it as a "I need you to stay alive untill I can get this heal off" button. Don't  heal DPS, maybe a renew at best, unless you think that you can't finish the fight without them alive.
---
Sometimes it takes a repair bill to get some people to learn.
---
Not how weapon scaling works. There is no "caster" weapon penalty in classic wow.
---
Definitely the robes. Mount ain‚Äôt going anywhere!
---
Can't wait for Classic+ where the night elf dance is changed to Elaine's.
---
But think of how many multiples of 15 seconds you wasted thinking about how you wasted 15 seconds! You'll never get it back!
---
I was really determined when I was duo speed questing .
---
Are you comparing usage of edgy language to murder?
---
Thank you, sir.
---
I see, this is a good point too. The personal story makes it more believable to me than people just saying others wont want to play with me over a lock. I love the class and abilities. It sucks its not a more viable dps option. Ive rerolled a Warlock and made it to level 25 already. I cant believe how easy leveling a lock is
---
It's often sneaking around in the corners and might not aggro naturally, including if you kite. Or it might be there to daze you in cheetah as you kite. I just always consider that assassin a potential stumbling block that could humiliate me and cause a wipe - and so hunt for it myself in downtime as we move over the bridge and pull the easy 2 mob packs at the other side and wait around for the big dragon patrol.
---
I agree. The most i've ever spent before clearing raid trash is 15, and that was because we were only 2 warlocks in the raid and the other guy was afk. Then you can just get as many as you need from trash for the rest of the raid.
---
Wrong wep damage is worth way more than any agi/str. Why do people like you who are uninformed and wrong pretend to be right?
---
Are you serious? The dagger would be replaced by a green in a level or two by the rogue. That dagger is best in slot for a mage for like 10-15 levels easy. Also spell damage is important to casters and healers for obvious reasons.
---
Dwarves for Alliance, and Undead for Horde.
---
I don‚Äôt know why so many people are recommending Trolls, there is literally nothing valuable for PvP based off their racials.
---
Roll Druid and never look back &lt;3
---
Lol, that is the opposite of most cats I've messed with. They always play, but claws are definitely involved.
---
Dude. Hat is off to you. Even undies up for consideration at this point
---
And you play a priest.
---
I noticed that for the first time when I started a nelf in classic. I've played off and on since vanilla and ran that zone many times. I was ashamed.
---
I mean yea it sucks but for real just report it and be patient. They'll fix it when they can.
---
for every candy i steal, theres 10 i dont, so i dont know why everyone thinks im a thief.
---
Hahaha, nice rolls! Had the [same thing](https://i.imgur.com/NOE85Tc_d.jpg?maxwidth=640&amp;shape=thumb&amp;fidelity=medium) happen a week ago.

I actually know a guy who put WoW on the back burner to build an irl Mario Party board and they made little mini games for it

I appreciate the effort

Hey it's me ur brother

/question is my favorite for when someone tries to gank me and I end up chasing them down.

I currently have 5 lv 40s and been playing casually. I just need to just hit lv 60 already but I like all my toons.
---
Well, either I suck at explaining myself or you just love to assume the worst in me. I‚Äôm out. Have a nice day.
---
I'm going to say the gators just hanging out in the middle of the road in Wetlands is the most Florida thing in WoW, as any low level Night Elf attempting that run will know.

Yes, I did.  Done more since.  You're just ultimately wrong and/or trolling.

I dinged a warrior to 27 with 10g, gave up, re-rolled as a mage, got that to level 12 with 10g and now haven't played in 2 weeks :/
---
They beat ragnaros with what a 40 man where what? Half the raid was 60s? Who ever is min maxing is trying too hard.
---
Headed there now. I don‚Äôt know you or your brother, but as a member of the horde, his memory lives on. LOK‚ÄôTAR OGAR!
---
Edit: https://imgur.com/qr3viiM
---
For horde if you are playing a race that an orc can be you are gimping yourself, that stun resistance is the most powerful thing in the game
---
Imagine not knowing how to aoe in a level 30 zone, 10 levels after getting your primary aoe spell.
---
Wow, you are trolling. You really dont know how to see someones talents?
---
This. I was literally about to write " threat is more dps's job than the tanks". 
---
Tank has a responsibility but its the dps's job to stop if they f up
---
Well, now is the perfect time for Blizzard to not implement flying. if I remember correctly they regretted implementing flying into the game which was introduced in TBC.
---
the stun resistance is the most powerful race racial in the game
---
So, why no frost nova?

Florida is a meth soaked hell hole. Darnassus is beautiful. WTF are you talking about?

Idk if you are a parent as well (new parent myself to a 5 month old) but I learned that your body becomes capable of surviving off of so little sleep. I would love to get 8 hours of sleep... just sometimes the baby say ‚Äútoday u get 5‚Äù and I just have to deal with that

RWT?

Bad customer support by Blizzard, but good support from this particular CS Rep.

That is, and will forever be, the greatest thing I have ever read.

Activision CS is garbage ...

Love hear stories about people like us. I was able to grind out a level during nap time. Felt so good. Haha

Mouse over still clears combo points right?

IDK, apparently people don't like Trailer Park Boys quotes
---
for pve, for pvp dwarf is better cuz stoneform, fear ward. I am saying this as a pvper who is playing a human priest
---
A lot of skills are based off 1 auto attack, so the bigger the auto attack, the bigger the skill hits. You swing slower, so the damage comes out higher. The other weapon swings faster, but it has dps stats.
---
except the thousands of people who upvoted those threads
---
Prob go outside and stop lvling. Might calm the nerd ness down
---
He gets off work after the kid is already sleeping, like he explained there. What should he do, watch her sleep? Sure it does sound like he isn't sleeping 8 hours a night, but not everyone even needs that.
---
It‚Äôs legit my favorite zone. I love it.
---
Ok?
---
I don't want to see the people back in chat after just 3 days if they are toxic.  30 days sounds reasonable so you can learn.  You even get to play still!  I don't see what your issue is.  You apparently are incapable of using your adult words so you get all your words taken away, now you pout about it.  Rethink why you feel the need to insult people's moms in a video game from however many hundreds of miles away in an open forum.  You have a month, think about it.   In the mean time keep playing and stop complaining, use discord and only annoy your group with your tongue.
---
what the fuck is Atalu'Akbar
---
I read this as "dad left us yesterday," and for a second I was both sad and taken aback.
---
Just feels like kicking puppies to me honestly.
---
You're right that anything hardcore is not my speed right now haha. This is definetly the most intimidating game I've played, so I'm looking to go slow and just get confident enough with mechanisms that I feel like I'm really controlling my output. So yeah as long the game can be playable for me, I'm happy. Hoping to keep getting better.
---
Any Shaman can give the Windfury totem. An Enhancement Shaman who is perfect at totem twisting only adds 67 agility to 4 raid members compared to a Resto Shaman. It's not that big of a deal.

If you bring an Enhance Shaman, you are bringing him for the flexibility of having an extra DPS who can also put on healing gear and heal when needed. Not for the totem twisting (which does not make up for the Shaman's very poor personal DPS).
---
Twist: guy.
---
I get what you are saying. But where does your demand come from to be able to get everything there is in-game?
---
R14 ist something almost no one will ever get. However you don't have to. You could just get rank 12 or 11 and get the rewards there and be happy?
---
Honestly, this was the longest grind of the game. 1-60 EZ, finding rexxar multiple times for ony attune? Never again.
---
I forgot about /train. The gnomes doing that at the AH back in the day... oh god
---
You can solo all the collection pieces at about lvl 37, but you'll need some help with the final elite (lvl 40 i think?)
---
Win+Shift+S
---
Yeah man. To add to that, I don't think enough people realize that leatherworkers can make slightly over 1g per 14 thick leathers just by making and vendoring Nightscape Tunics every time you get 7. Adds up real fast and was probably the only way I could afford my mount at 40 (only had 4g at 35)
---
It's just the damage Range of your Attacks without attackspeed being calculated
---
I think the idea behind hunters is that they'd be a good class for people who don't like dungeon raiding and wouldn't miss the gear anyway. After all, they're probably the most impractical class to do a raid with and often have difficulty finding groups as a result.
---
I‚Äôm a lvl 44 dwarf priest 
---
Where should I be leveling?
---
What‚Äôs amazing and what blizzard failed to grasp and well not just blizzard.
---
Is this is a game people want to play and will play, people like making progress towards a goal that is challenging that is what makes it fun, know in the end you will achieve something.
---
Retail lost that affect a few years ago now.
---
Effort and progress lead to reward and success
---
Zf cuz fuck entering ulda at all
---
There's a bunch of youtube tutorials to get in there, just google "caverns of time vanilla" and there's the walljump tutorial in there. Took maybe 5 minutes.
---
No I think it's just I chose to spend time with my kid when he's awake, that's the difference between us.
---
Combat sword useless? lol explain,  maybe?
---
"G2g nipples are bleeding"
---
Realistically they're both for lvl 44, when you can comfortably hit the last bosses.
---
I had a tauren shame me for not having a level 60 yet about a week or two ago. It was weird. Dude kept referring to me as "orc", referred to himself in 3rd person. I dunno if he was trying to RP with me or if he was just had something wrong with him... It was pretty wild.
---
That wouldn't make sense. And you now it. He is for sure interested in cat gear.
---
So he helps send her off to daycare and that's all the interaction he gets with the kid?  I sure hope not becuase when I read it. It wasn't *nearly* that bad.
---
Hey, I do have a lady Tauren! :) I really dig entering this weird world from a very "simple gunter on the grasslands" type of origin. Feels very heroe's journey to me.
---
Doing a blank trade for 500g likely set off the automated RMT alarm bells. Especially this early in the server's life cycle.
---
&gt; Then why do you have the app on your phone? Because hitting accept allows just that.
---
I don't have Google nor FB installed at all on my phone (iPhone btw). And even before an iPhone, I had an Android with LineageOS without Gapps (so still no Google nor FB installed).
---
I'm not sure what point you're trying to get across.
---
leave enchanting out of it. if a chanter wants to form a group to farm mats, let them worry about it.
---
But his main spec is healing, he is only tanking the dungeon. Why isnt he allowed to roll for his offspec but you are?
---
Explain more, I'm kinda iffy on xferring from stalagg. Is there alot of end game groups?
---
"Tearsfall Glades" is fucking poetic. &lt;3
---
Every group ive had in WOW Classic has greeded on BOE's.
---
I'm honestly surprised i haven't seen anyone need.
---
Gnomes make a fart sound.

---
Somebody said the difference is smaller with a lady Tauren, which I am!
---
nice dress, takes me back to when i played a paladin in vanilla lol...i could not go thru that torture again
---
If that‚Äôs the case, then another deterrent needs to be used in lieu of ‚Äúban first, ask questions later (if at all).‚Äù I agree that this is the likely philosophy behind it, but this seems like a solution that would inherently lead not only to false positives, but no recourse for those cases outside of hoping you get attention elsewhere. Social media blasts should be a last resort for these kinds of issues, not the only viable course of action.
---
Indubitably.  *Raises glass while sitting at a fireplace wearing a monocle*
---
Me too fam.
---
I can relate. I was an absolute newbie back in vanilla, levelling up through exploration, grinding mobs in horde territories (was playing a night elf). This was extremely fun but, back in those days, I was too young to completely understand the game. 
---
Now, I discover Azeroth again and I enjoy my new level 30 hunter. The feeling of levelling, socializing with others players, running through dungeons, in the same conditions but with my grown up brain feels better than any other game progress. 
---
And as a baguette speaker (as you surely have already noticed) I want to add this little french quote : "c'est dans les vieux pots qu'on fait les meilleures confitures".
---
Thank you Blizzard!
---
Should he quit his job or what? I thought the issue was playing video games :)))
---
Thank you! &lt;3
---
In the first week of classic I snagged two Sentry Cloaks und a pair of Feet of the Lynx from the AH for under 5g total. Once the BGs are out they'll make me a fortune.
---
So long as they have appropriate security on the account (authenticator) there shouldn't be an issue.
---
You're sure to get there!  I had about 65 gold at level 38, 2 levels is a long time.
---
haha, anyone that says they are the best at something, are clearly the worst. looks like magetastic item to me
---
Soonish? P2 Isn't for another year at least, maybe a year and a half.
---
And I just named my next cat. Thank you.
---
Since everyone in this thread clearly has no idea what they are talking about:
---
14 Attack power adds 1dps.
---
This means the slower the weapon the more **damage per swing** is added (there is normalization, but you get the idea).
---
A weapon with 1.0 attack speed gains 1 damage from 14 attack power. A weapon with 3.3 attack speed gains 3.3 damage from 14 attack power.
---
*squees mechanically*
---
While going SS into blade fury and then popping evasion only after getting kidney'd is certainly not the optimal play vanishing while it's on CD is the impossible play.
---
Yeah, I'm just wondering why the dmg range of the slower weapon is higher, even though they deal equal dmg.
---
My kinda guy. Self aware. I respect you.

Warlock here. Can confirm: i seem to be everybody's friend. :)
---
STV has always been the vietnam war of vanilla. I do feel different depending on zone, more on edge or what ever. For me mostly how a zone feels depends on how many quests there are.
---
Whats funny here, is the rogue probably waited on them to attack the mob before he opened the chest.
---
If the rogue had attacked the mob, he would get the epic but instead he got a shit chest because he was being greedy.
---
Except this is a well known and used tactic by mostly all the early 60s who didnt do the pure dungeon route.  Has been proven on Vanilla, Private, and Classic.  But you know, damn the gained knowledge in 15 years and do it your way.  That's actually all that matters as long as your happy doing it.

Thanks for the laugh. We need more post like this haha.

Randomly searching Desolace at level 30? You'll see Rexxar between every quest.
---
Looking for him for Ony attunement? You better run up and down that road half a dozen times.
---
Like my dumbass cousin, 2 kids, doesnt pay much attention as hes too busy vaping and gaming ( different games/consoles). But its ok, now they play on the switch too!
---
Yes, agreed!
---
One month of silence sounds like it can only improve chat for everyone else.
---
Basically, your weapon has dps and swing speed built in. That's where the damage range comes from listed on the weapon: dps x swing speed = average damage per swing.
---
You then have to factor in the dps you gain from attack power. Because on a white hit, the swing speed gets applied to this as well.
---
The faster weapon gains less per swing from the attack power dps because it does more damage over time, but hits more frequently. More smaller hits.
---
Instant attacks have a different formula, so the higher dps faster weapon might end up doing more overpower / whirlwind damage.
---
This is fair and I appreciate your love for the class. However part of what makes it frustrating is that Druids get so many options thrown at you early that it doesn't really feel like they start to flesh out until later. Cat form is particularly bad for this, where you can go cat but you don't get a lot of the important skills (can't remember which off the top of my head) until later so it's frustrating.
---
I also agree with you in a post 30 context with travel form and the like, so saying that they're better than other classes pre 40 is besides the point. It's just when they feel like they have half of a bunch of different skill sets that they're frustrating for most people to play.
---
Always choosing the path of least resistance is just weakness. Min maxing for these encounters is a complete joke, they aren‚Äôt difficult and people should be allowed to have fun.
---
That or blizzard needs to balance the classes like they always should have in vanilla so there are no ‚Äúmeme‚Äù specs.

You're a vegan right?
---
Thats lile saying: yeah i have a criminal record, but i only stole some stuff from wallmart! 
---
... yeah bro. Maybe you will finaly learn your lesson of not being toxic. No one likes people like that, and espacily in classic, you will get a reputation, get kicked out of guilds because no one wants to be the guild with THAT dude in it, and so on.
---
It depends on your lvl, using sunder armor at lvl 10 doesnt make much of a difference, but once you get rank 2 or 3, you will definitely notice a difference, since it doesnt REPLACE a rage generating attack but rather being its own attack,  and the armor reduce helping you generate more rage since you then deal more damage
---
(also it can be dodged for free overpowers)
---
Dont rank up conjure food untill it takes u longer to get ur hp up than mana. I was drinking 1900waters with 552 foods. Ur mana pool is so much larger than hp. Only got final rank of food when my tank in strat was asking for food and was dissapointed at my glutein free sparkletoast
---
Yeah but league is competitive in nature, wow can be played however one would like thus min/maxing isn't the "best" path for everyone
---
Bought mine on grobb for 500- am durid
---
lot of people don't work
---
Slower weapons hit harder to achieve the same dps. 
---
40 dmg per swing, 1 swing per second = 40 dps.
---
80 dmg per swing, 0.5 swings per second = 40 dps.
---
I mean it‚Äôs video streaming so it uses alot. You can turn the stream setting to ‚Äúfast‚Äù and it‚Äôll use less data but look worse
---
What realm is OP on?
---
I refuse to join guilds that invite random people, allowing anyone who just clicked accept to join. Even trial members should be vetted
---
thanks, needed the clarification
---
If you have a gathering profession, anywhere near node spawns is good.
---
If you have skinning, the Gorilla's/Panthers in STV drop greys often and can be skinned for a bit of a bonus.
---
Other than that, I'd say find somewhere that there are humanoid enemies about 1-2 levels lower than you and farm up the cloth/gold/drops.
---
Yeah but according to the story the issue isn't the gaming, its the fact that he gets off work after the kid is asleep _most_ of the time. So I just fail to see how the gaming is the issue. 
---
Sure working long hours sucks when you dont get to see your kid much, but should he stop earning money in your opinion?
---
You‚Äôve never used a swear word towards another person?
---
Uhhh, I play a Druid. What is ‚Äúdowntime‚Äù and ‚Äúwaiting‚Äù?
---
You‚Äôll be glad you‚Äôre a Tauren when you use that stomp to stun someone and get back out to bow/gun range
---
Meh, I had 100g at 40 and bought upgrades pretty frequently off the AH if they weren't overpriced.
---
Just don't be stupid with your money and you'll have close to 90g is the best advice. Also, take skinning and vendor the leather.
---
Kromcrush is high pop and i don't get queues anymore
---
That's still OS rolling on MS drops though, your primary role is a healer, theirs is DPS. If you're needing DPS gear when you were brought in as a healer without telling anyone before hand you're going on lists lol.
---
MS &gt; OS, if you want damage gear join as a DPS or form a party in which you clearly state you're needing for your OS.
---
Edit: or wait till no one needs and then ask if you can, I've literally only seen one guy say no because he needed the gold and we all just said to ignore that guy and to take it.
---
Priest is super versatile all specs.
---
Yes
---
But u said ur also leveling professions at the same time. I did that on the beta but just grabbed gathering professions when classic released. There‚Äôs a big difference there. 
---
You seem to have a presumed ‚Äúhow long it would take me to get to ur level must be how much time you‚Äôve already put into the game‚Äù 
---
I just think there‚Äôs more factors here than you are willing to put on the table
---
Or when as a gnome I chased and killed an orc named 'gnomeslayer', the entire time he appeared confused as to why I was attacking him ^^
---
In what world is raw spell power itemized more for DPS than for healers?
---
hey i dont know if you are still paying attention to this thread, but is there a video you got on how to do arena runs? as in where to go, i got everything ready but wasted the last two days trying to find some sort of a map or a guide on where to go and who to kill.
---
NO. No no no. DONT say this. This is TERRIBLE.

I swear to god if the next Warcraft game is mobile I'm going to corpse camp you for life.

Orrrrr spend those precious morning with the kid and then drop him off instead of making the so do everything lol I mean maybe I am the crazy one here
---
I don't get it.

But the male gnome train is the best vocal emote in the game...
---
Yeah man that stuff was there in OG vanilla. It means exactly nothing that it's there now.
---
I am chill though. Just stating a fact.

i mean warden staff is BiS all the way to Naxx soooo :/

Skerim is like 1.5 hour queue at peak, no queue off peak.

Dammit you're right. I have these all typed out in macros and sitting in action bar slots. I knew there had to be a better way of doing this.

I was in eastern Europe for vacation as well up until 2 days ago and played on my NA account with no issues ..i wonder what flagged your account !?

I just let those fuckers run with us anyways, and then Need if it drops.  Might get the item and the tears from the privileged individual are always fucking priceless.  Unless he validly wins the roll, then the bitching is still there ("wtf! That item was reserved!"), but it doesn't feel the same...
---
Agreed, but in combat you're unlikely to get more than one tick off.
---
aside from the fact that if they wanted to implement it, it wouldnt take a lot of work. what in the fuck is wrong with all of you?

Just stating facts ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Warriors are completely useless while leveling against mobs that are higher level than you. We simply cannot hit them, even from behind! You can't under level tank either. You need to match or be higher level. You're basically just an annoying fly in there at that lvl
---
Not everyone plays competitively in LoL. But raids could be considered 'competitive' for the WoW community. Find a group of ppl who appreciate your style and stick with them. Again play the game your way
---
God screw those fracking invisible wolves
---
I only NEED if it is an upgrade and I actually need it. Otherwise I just GREED or PASS.
---
Heartseeker seems more active on Alliance side at every level bracket. LFG channel is scrolling twice as fast as it ever had on Stalagg. Ironforge is packed, and I‚Äôm seeing more allies out in the world to help with horde issues.
---
You said it meant that classic+ stuff is obviously coming. It doesn't mean that at all.
---
Nah
---
ah yes, TOS break
---
... except Hardcore Raiding is a joke in classic. The only "challenge" is wrangling 40 cats
---
If I see an alliance member attacking a horde player for no reason, why would I help? I don't approve of senseless violence. Given the number and magnitude of world-threatening dangers (Scourge, Black Dragonflight, etc.) the Horde and Alliance should be working together rather than wasting manpower on pointless battles.
---
Now, I'm on an RP-PVP realm, but even if you're not, a player can still respect an honorable combat rather than turning it into a dishonorable gang beating.

What server are you on my dude.  I'd love to hang ok  skeram.  But outside that it's just engagement I message my friends list about ok nce a week just to see how everyone's do im ng how the lvling going and if I know them well how life is.  My philosophy on making friends is forcibly hang out with people you see until you've seen them often enough to be friends
---
true that. 'hardcore raiding' doesn't exist hey. Even more reason not to re-roll. Enjoy your Tauren huntard! :D
---
I picked up tailoring for the first time on my gnome.

I logged off standing in a moonwell so I could make mooncloth when I next logged in.  
---
When I logged in, I was lying dead in the pool, drowned :(
---
My main is around 14 days and a dozen-ish hours /played, but a lot of that has been me just RPing or AFKing in SW/Darnassus looking for RP.  
---
But I don't have a job at the moment and insomnia makes it so sleeping isn't a daily thing for me, so I have a lot more time than most people.
---
that does sound a bit strongly worded
---
If you have 2 mages blizzarding 1 mob... someone ain't pulling right.
---
Praised be.
---
Thanks, haha
---
I would probably take 2 away from defiance and put it into cruelty. The crit is going to help you tank and dps, while the threat will only help you tank.
---
It was fcking scripted so hard for reddit bait haha! i love it man.
---
C seems closest. I just always go C
---
The other thing is, your wolf can passive beside you and still give a buff, if you aren't keeping an eye on your pet and it dies, you lose time and mana ressing

 If you search reddit there is some guy who made rp /e pickpocket stuff as a rogue with a random value 1-100.

Oh ok. I kinda dislike long, confusing dungeon, i get tired after 2,3 hours run or so. I like the Scarlet Monastery 4 wings design.

The necklace is the only one I thought?
---
Don't listen to that guy fyi. Vendor all your greens.
---
Fixed what?
---
Sounds good!
---
see, the rogues are taking all the good stuff
---
I always make my hunters Tauren as well! Sure, it's not _technically_ the best pick but you wont notice at all. Plus pets scale with player size, so you'll get the biggest pets =)
---
And like others have said, that stun can be very helpful it getting out of melee range
---
I disenchant them all because I‚Äôm a basic bitch and went tailor/ench lmao
---
No
---
Yeah but... why?
---
Go outside ulda, and kill the elites and they will drop the necklace, start that quest go back to ironforge and talk to the guy in mage quarter.  Now you can complete every quest in one run.  Also im assuming alliance, not sure the horde quests.  There are 4 of the quests that probably show green to you they are all outside the instance.  The 4 pots, the power stone thingies from the dwarves, kroms treasure and the tablet of ryun.
---
There are only 2 data centers as confirmed by Blizzard. One is in Chicago, the other in LA. There is also a website that list the location by data center and Garrosh is supposed to be eaat coast but is listed in the LA data center. Using ping times is not accurate due to variations of ISPs and paths to servers. I myself being East coast have tested pings to listed west coast and east coast servers and sometimes get better results to west coast than I do to east coast, so ping is not accurate measure.
---
Mechagon is a lot of fun, the fights are mechanically hard and there‚Äôs 8 of them so it‚Äôs engaging and has a lot of room for oopsies.
---
If you‚Äôre geared, there‚Äôs hard mode which is quite difficult (particularly the last boss).
---
It‚Äôs not an exploratory dungeon like Kara (to some extent), and certainly not like BRD.
---
I'll put them on my guild's KOS list for ya.

Ah okay I get it now

ABSOULUTE HILARIUM BRO ü§£ü§£üòéüò©
---
I did the gnomish &gt; relearn &gt; goblin route and i did the gnome turnins at booty bay. What i assumed after relearning and hitting 200 was getting a quest then going to tanaris and doing another set of turnins.
---
There was a problem though. Couldnt find a quest that would send me to tanaris. Oh well, didnt think much if it and went there anyway, but the goblin had no quest for me either. To my surprise just by speaking to him he told me to go to the port east of gadgaetzan and seek out a book, which i did, and the book just let me get goblin engi without actually doing the turnins at all.
---
Hope this was of help
---
It wasn't on CD. Look at the vid again
---
This is awful advice.
---
Don't use renew and don't downrank before 60. 
---
Renew is one of your least mana efficient heals and downranking costs way more mana per hp than just using your biggest heal.

There's a teleporter in BB

As an engineer, it's great.

Cool schematics, lots of resources, and the mobs can even drop some materials.
---
I wouldn't recommend it for most people though.
---
No need to overcomplicate it like that imo. Just throw out a counter spell. They should be dead before they can start casting again anyway, and if not just pop ice barrier and they'll go down without you taking any damage.
---
They're pretty bad, especially in p1. I'm pretty sure they could spam rank 1 Starfire and still go oom.
---
Its cool you helped this guy but I know others who have this problem and got the same support answer. How are they going to get helped? Make another reddit thread til it gains traction?
---
How do? There are hit trinkets healers can‚Äôt use

I didn‚Äôt know that! Maybe I would be willing to run it after all. Know the level range offhand?

Hitting all sorts of buttons with your thumb makes your mouse movements less accurate.  By far the best set-up is having two of the most convenient mouse buttons bound to modifier keys and then triple binding the most convenient keys on your keyboard.  Highest accuracy and most ergonomic.
---
You will always be waiting for a tank/healer for a long time. There isn't some huge wave of tanks that are soon going to be hitting cap compared to damage dealers.
---
Well I'll admit I just went through some of your comments, and they are mostly just you arguing with people and being a condesceding dick.
---
Maybe you should get off reddit for a while and go spend time with your kid. :)
---
And if you actually talk to people like you comment here, as you seem to like to say to a lot of people "I feel sorry for you wife".
---
It's pretty aids though
---
Nightfall recipe maybe?
---
Hmm. You may be right. I haven't looked at the EULA in ages so I don't know if it's changed or what.
---
Don't avoid green quests. Go back and clear those zones.
---
HA! that gave me a good laugh, take my upvote
---
Watching with interest. I'm currently tanking as an arms warrior. I want to go protection as I spend most of my time in groups and in a tanking roll, happy to cop the dpsoss when questing.
---
People keep telling me I won't be able to hold aggro if I go prot. However I'm finding aggro hard to hold in the aoe meta anyway... Single target is fine it's when mages go ballistic on 5 mobs before I've even gotten one shout out

Which isn't out?
---
Nothing beats a human /wait on a dead hordie

"stay put"
---
Dang, I just hit 36. I guess I‚Äôm out of range now. Maybe on an alt or something.
---
It was on CD...
---
Oh?
---
remember that each server is different it depends on the makeup of the server.
---
The average across all servers, imo, would be around mid-to-high 40s. My server seems to be in that range, I'm just behind them as I hit a wall at lv. 37ish
---
Yes, but, did she really?
---
Well 54 is different thing then, if youre running 2handed you already have ww and ms anyway, so your rage is pretty much already spent on those id say (unless its an elite probably)
---
How did they break it?
---
EDIT: Spelling
---
I've reported a known power leveler with proof and he's still not banned. 
---
Blizzard just doesn't care anymore.

dude like really? i carry a shield and two one hands and a 2 hand at all times for this reason. if you cant "spec swap" then your not worth the time tbh. like dont get me wrong i dont mind if your only in it to be dps but if you really want to progress u need to be able to fill more than one role... plus as a war if your not stance swapping at least once per fight your doing it wrong
---
the whole part of a video game is to have fun playing it doing whatever the fuck you want imo. oh and if it makes the person happy playing one role it should not be hated on just because you and others can‚Äôt have fun. it‚Äôs a game
---
Easy if your main reddit device is your phone.... don‚Äôt need to do anything with cloud or email or downloading either, take photo and upload directly in app. It‚Äôs easier.
---
That's quite odd yeah.
---
If you bitch like this on Reddit I can‚Äôt imagine in game
---
Is this another 'I'm a rogue, I deserve all weapons/chests/lockboxes/etc..." thread? 
---
You are totally in the wrong. None of those stats are intended for rogues. Clearly and extremely obviously **not**.
---
"Even though this weapon has Spirit... Int.. &amp; Spell power...  it has more dps than my weapon so therefore as a Rogue I'm needing it!"
---
A class clicking Need on an item that has no stats designed for that class is the very definition of a ninja
---
Be a druid, take the -20% difference.
---
I say you let us name it for you
---
Yeah exactly.
---
It's one of the tough things about Vanilla... Couple of levels behind your friends? It is especially bad with warrior.
---
Best tip: get your friends to help you with Whirlwind axe quest at 30.
---
At least use auctionater or something. We used it back then and we still use it because the default ah was and still is terrible.
---
Looks like a game of cat and mouse.
---
im down gimme suggestions!
---
/r/OfficeSpeak
---
that dagger drops alot  and he's a mage means easily get into Spellcleave groups for xp
---
lol
---
It‚Äôs not that bad. I personally just never cared to learn the nuances of playing the ah or I would get more involved with it
---
The answer to both of those questions is sex.
---
Imagine further proving my point on elitist player egos.  
---
How do you know this wasn't some handicapped person playing with no hands?

The second wave servers (Like EU ashbringer, which was spun up the day after launch) have a 30m queue primetime during weekdays, 1hr queue on primetime for weekend.

a BM hunter becomes a grind machine in the 40's. by then you have Beastial Wrath, the STV bow/gun, and have probably picked up a pretty blue or two. you can tear through mobs and with some practice be extremely efficient on mana and downtime
---
That‚Äôs just what ***they*** want you to think!

All raids always reset on Tuesday

Same, ffxglow on, gamma down a tick or two, contrast up a tick or two and brightness up a tick or two. Looks great
---
When looking for this group, were you forming the group or trying to find an already made group?
---
You‚Äôll almost always have better luck forming a group because there are a lot of people that can‚Äôt be bothered to create a group but would be willing to join someone else‚Äôs group.
---
You‚Äôre a poor excuse for a human being. You can‚Äôt possibly imagine how little I think of you.

Been holding onto that quest for a while now holy shit lolol

Personally, I never kill alliance druids. Attack all other alliance on sight tho. Especially gnomes.
---
I use the 12 button mouse but I have it bound to ctr1 through crtl10. I can hit shift with my pinky finger and use my index and middle fo 12345 qwertfg are also shift bindings/regular bindings for me
---
I'm trying to use clique for hovercasting, but can't get it let me self cast with alt. Anyone have any tips on how to do this?
---
That fucking guild is just full of ninja loot assholes. Have had nothing but negative interactions with them. I fucking hate this server but oh no its the ones my friends just have to play on. So ready to just go back to my RP server.
---
The biggest demons come from the smallest summoners. It's not the size of the gnome in the fight, it's the size of the fight in the gnome. Also, crits.
---
Appreciate the insight. I've been gone for two weeks, gotta get home and see how things look for myself.
---
&gt;Recently we've been testing the capabilities of Melee Moonkin, which is the idea of using a weapon which is faster than the GCD (1.5 seconds) or matches it, while spamming Moonfire. It isn't game breaking damage and falls behind Starfire at later points in the game, but it may prove to be more reliable and consistent damage in the early stages of Classic.
---
Sometimes, you see someone so far down their own rabbit hole that they don't even realize how far gone they are, as they twist and turn and spin things to justify whatever rationale exists in their head. This quote and the overall contempt for "handicaps" show up as seriously large red flags to how seriously I should take this guide.
---
By all means, play what is fun for you. But when someone is seriously considering a rotation on a primary caster specialization that is melee autos and the instant-cast portion of a DoT, it's time to take a step back and think a moment about what is really being accomplished here.
---
Yes, this all day.  Everyone I see posting about how they can't find a group for x... never once made a group and tried lfm instead of lfg.  A whole lot of people refuse to make a group for some reason.
---
So the sub is making you wanna quit a game you‚Äôre otherwise enjoying, so you‚Äôd rather quit the game than just not browse this sub
---
Something tells me you can think of a better solution. Use that noggin.

 Reddit in general is a net negative on 99% of people‚Äôs lives, just the same as any other social media

I helped a 31 alliance warlock kill the 38 infernal for his robes quest.  As a lock myself, I felt some small obligation to aid my similarly shunned brethren.  Then I killed him.  Because it's what we horde do to alliance scum.
---
Uldaman is kinda cool and is a classic dungeon, as well as dropping lots of good loot. It‚Äôs about a 2 hour commitment though. I enjoy it more than ZF and tan it 3 or 5 times and got several good blue items,  two of which pants and grimlok vest I am
---
Still wearing at lvl 51. Don‚Äôt try to do all the quests in one run and do take some time to study on YouTube and gather the quests - there are at least seven of them and it can be confusing to do in one run. I think it tops out at level 48 on the high end. ZF is about 2-4 levels higher.
---
A mage int buffed me in arathi. Then invited me to group because he thought I was on the same quest as him. When I said I'm not on that quest he got all upset and asked me to "remove the int buff, then." I hadn't asked for him to buff me or for an invite. I was so stunned and perplexed by his attitude but thinking back i find it funnier and funnier over time. 
---
P.S. I kept the buff!
---
Yeah, I guess I should have feared him but well I was a beginner
---
If you're level 20, you dont have a spec. You're not a ret pally, you're a pally. And you're using melee. Almost nothing makes a lvl 20 "ret" pally different than a lvl 20 "prot" or "holy" pally. So really you're question is:
---
"When does pally become unfun? And so far, I prefer doing melee"
---
Computer keyboards used to have a Return key instead of an Enter key. It was for carriage return on a typewriter, and it was copied over. We just have to deal with things like that.
---
wouldn't 12AP be &gt; than 1 dps? This seems to say 3.5ap = 1dps but I'm not sure how 'Classic accurate' it is.

That's insanity. I could NEVER sell this axe for anything close to the deposit price alone. Criminal! Fucking goblins man!

Is it really a non-aggression pact when the alternative is mutually assured boredom because the duel lasts literally forever?
---
I've deleted the app 3 hours ago, but my wife sees me logged in on mobile for 3 minutes, and I am really confused.
---
Did you find kirtonos less populated than this server?
---
Wait, they can't see custom emotes?
---
Domo despawns after 4 hours. If you don't kill rag within 4 hours of sending him over you gotta do him again.
---
Im typing this ingame and its not working. What am I doing wrong?
---
Literally the only time jumper cables have worked for my hunter is when I was out of a dungeon. I'm currently 0/7 rezzing in a dungeon, but 4/4 rezzing random people I'm walking by in the open world
---
Wtf
---
I wonder if all variants of Wilfred Fizzlebang are taken yet.
---
Huh, what's the point of using clique for self casting? Not sure what you're trying to do.
---
Yep! Been running SM stuff since about 34. Did one armory run and got the shoulders so far. Time to grind for that Axe!
---
Bro I avoid Desolace at all costs. I was questing in Swamp of Sorrows earlier, it was raining and made me feel very relaxed and somber.
---
I said that with an optimistic intention lol.
---
Well yeah. Mages are popular for a reason. Most people would say they‚Äôre the best class in vanilla and it‚Äôs hard to argue with that
---
No pussy is better then gaming.
---
Thanks.
---
 RemindMe! 5 hours
---
TY
---
That is pretty weird. Definitely change your password. If it continues, I'd contact blizzard and see if the IPs match your usual activity. Good luck!
---
I wonder if it had to do with how many people are in the zone. Most purple want to just focus on leveling, but a small percentage want to pvp whenever possible. But once you get ganked, you want revenge and then it gets out of control. Arathi and stv were blood baths on my server. But my faction was heavily outnumbered in badlands and it was still totally peaceful.
---
Haha yeah that‚Äôs great! It‚Äôs like a country girl with her dog and gun out in the wild world. 
---
I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre having so much fun with this!
---
You are sucking at the instance because you are too low level compared to the mobs to hit anything. I'd get up to at least 32-4 then go back to SM.
---
Assuming alliance, @28 you need to be doing some combination of Wetlands/Duskwood/Redridge/Southshore. Then STV once 33-4.
---
I ran BRD dozens of times and corpse walked hundreds over a decade ago. Only 44, but I'm hyped to get back in there.

Try /equipslot 16 daggerName. This should equip the dagger in your mainhand and unequip your sword. /equipslot 17 is for offhand

May wanna use that big brain to figure out the last time that was updated, and the legitimacy of the data in the first place
---
Aye! Glad you found this! Now I have someone to tell the horde that I come in peace and to stop murdering me while I level
---
I did a lot of Arathi, I did a little tanaris but quickly ran out of yellow quests there so maybe I hop into STV but honestly been trying to avoid that mess
---
Do it
---
Yeah it's bis tank wrap too lol
---
Yeah I ran it today and it was fine. I was in a group last week that couldn't get past either
---
Meh how do you know the druid was telling them to need greens - why not just ask then? I would have rolled need, won it, and gave it to the druid and would have been super happy for him. Idk guess I want to see other people be happy and succeed rather than being spiteful over 75s drops
---
It's that last bit that's such a killer...the dwarves (with their bombs) and the nullifiers.  
---
Before that it's fine...just long.  By the time you get there you've been fighting for hours, got lost a couple times, and just want to finish...only to get your ass kicked.  That's where people get cranky and sucky.

how in the fuck does that relate m8

Good luck my dude!! It's worth it in the end :)
---
The only key here is whether or not you agree with the default settings on sixtyupgrades. I feel it overvalues spellpower significantly, and disregards crit far too much. Honestly it's a pve ele dps set, which doesn't do PvP justice.
---
This is what I came up with:
---
https://sixtyupgrades.com/set/3Pw8M95sWHFF2mW5iGHih6
---
It downplays spellpower, incoporates both armor and stam as having value. Unsurprisingly, the int oriented pieces of the dungeon set show up. Overall though, durability means a lot in pvp which is why you'll see some pvpers running in almost pure stam gear.
---
I bought only Deadly Blunderbuss for Warsong supplies quest. Amirite?
---
Ulda is infamous for jump in level. The last boss of th dungeon is 47 for gold sake. However, it is very easy once you know that you cheese it by pull him to the golem top room.
---
P.s. avoid that toxic power source drop quest with 8/8 drop, it took me 2+ hours with a healer and two dpser.
---
I think he meant the racial stomp ability, which stuns the area around you for a short duration, could get you some extra range
---
People like you is why I shouldn't use Greed for expensive BoE items? I'm not gonna be like you.
---
Just did that the other day feels like about 5% drop on both of them.  Took me at least 20 of each guy to get the 2 drops at least.  On the flip side, the elite guys next to thorium point, killed one got that single drop needed.  Not sure if that was just really lucky or those guys have a higher drop rate for that quest.
---
At any level ambush does way way way more damage than sinister strike.  Backstab does too.  
---
Level 59 and ambus's flat added damage is higher than my average SS with thrash.

That's what I always been seen used in Guild Wars 2 for duels in WvW. I don't know if it's a custom in WoW

Let me see if I got it: it's in the old pots where you can make the best stews"?
---
Man I love the French language.
---
Exactly they kicked him because they were reserving loot. Then he didnt have to run in a group with reserved loot.
---
The really dick move, which has happened to me before, a tank is filling a group, getting up to rend in UBRS, switching to master looter right before pulling. When people ask why during the encounter, he said "reserving dal'rends" which he hadn't mentioned to anyone beforehand, killing rend, no sword drops. Tank immediately hearths with half the run still to go. Now that's a dick move.
---
Caster weapon penalty?
---
Question for Shadow Priests and even Holy/Disc Priests
---
Are you using threat reduction talents or are they a waste?  I plan to pvp and dungeon mostly, very light raiding.  I dont want to invest in them if they're not needed to do content.
---
In theory once you get sweeping strikes and whirlwind you can open up with some good Aoe and hold agro well with a 2H then just apply sundors around. For sub 50 dungeons

---
Sadly I don't know a way to show your own nameplate, and its not really within the scope of this macro! Best way to learn is to experiment, or by reading other people's code and ~~stealing~~ learning from it!
---
Oh perfect, that‚Äôs where my friends are and I just remember hearing about awful ques at launch. Good to know it‚Äôs better!
---
Probably my favorite WTF quote in this game
---
Yeah that seems weird. Possibly more to this than op is saying(whether he knows details or his brother is holding back from him). I mean, I play on two separate computers at two separate houses and haven't had any issues...yet
---
Yes. Derogatory to call us Murses. I will be offended if you do
---
I guess I was just looking for a way to set up spells to hovercast while still being able to self cast while leveling is all. I'm leveling my priest with a group and so i like being able to hovercast heals and stuff but hate having to hover my nameplate to self cast if i need to
---
44 warrior tank and this is good news to me.
---
Welcome to reddit and especially anything to do with gaming.
---
Tauren do have slightly larger melee range afaik, but nothing that will affect you.
---
What the other person meant is that, as a hunter, you'll want to keep enemy players far away from you when fighting them. Your Tauren racial ability, War Stomp, gives you time to put some distance between them and yourself.
---
is revantusk village not an inn i can rest at? is it bugged?

Good people

Just make a TMW/WA2 to show when it's not up. Easy enough!

ah addon just auto undercuts so if youre not paying attention and just throwing things onto the ah, thats what happens.
---
Yeah, that's why I'm not too worried. But I definitely am excited to get home and change my password when I get off work in 7 hours.
---
I was really hoping you were gonna get consumable buffs
---
Can confirm this- this server is alive (coming from that imbalanced Skeram)
---
Buy gear. Epic mount isn‚Äôt that big of a deal until honor pvp imo
---
ElvUI, Dominoes, Bartender, any of those can do this.
---
Nah, you had every right to roll on it. Perfectly usable by an Enhancement Shaman.
---
I really hope you became a nurse, "because you mained a priest in a classic and developed a passion for healing."
---
Ok so what has happened in the past, would be that people who the item may be good for/ bis just roll need, then just decide that they would rather 400g than a minor upgrade, so just sell the item anyway. The other issue is that if it's good for 1 person in the group, it's all fine and dandy until that last person to hit greed is looking at a 50/50 shot at 400g. If everyone needs then everyone gets a shot at it, rather than the people just being dicks. Discuss it later.
---
BoE is probably worth rolling need on, if it's worth money. It kinda sucks, but there are people out there who ruin it for everyone. 
---
Theres an expectation that you will be kicked from the group if you need BoP. And the most you will make from that is like 3-4g tops. Probably not worth the reputation or the kick from group.
---
We ruined his Reddit 100% Speedrun

It doesn't matter if the game is new or old. Do you want to let negativity bias drive you or just ignore the bad eggs?
---
You poor bastard

I actually believe that the way one acts on anonymous websites can be an excellent insight into one's true self. There are no real world consequences.

And glossed over free water.
---
You‚Äôve just been at the circus long enough to smell the elephant shit, take a fucking break
---
ok wait is this a real thing that getting drunk in game does?
---
They are fine. Rng is rng.  Saw an epic drop from one but only once ever seen that.  Mostly they contain a bit of food and potions.
---
I meann hunters can kinda benefit from spell damage :D
---
Kick it up a notch, get drunk irl and in game.
---
Why wouldn't you let the tank get to 50%?
---
Even a 2h tank doesn't take that much damage unless they are doing big pulls, in which case - bomb those big heals anyways and everyone should be drinking after.
---
Also if we are comparing rank 5 renew to rank 4 heal - Renew is 1.8hp/mana vs 2.5.
---
Renew is quite a bit less efficient in just raw numbers. That doesn't even factor in the fact that most times you can just let dps spirit regen their health up between pulls instead of healing them when they don't need it.
---
You can't track both in classic.  You could alternate between the two often though.
---
Along with a "/s Polymorphing %t (moon). You break it, you buy it."
---
To be fair, a lot of people use reagents during dungeon runs. I probably already spend a gold just on Ankhs, so my group does not have to walk. And about 5 Gold on mana potions to prevent a wipe.
---
I think he's saying that the people putting items on AH for 5c above vendor price are dumb because they're eating a loss after you factor in ah fees and time spent making the auctions vs vendoring at repair etc.
---
However, that said, people are allowed to play the game however they'd like and Crafters need these "dumb"  people  to have access to many mats they'd otherwise have to farm themselves.
---
I wouldn't say it's dumb but it's not something that will be making you money by any means, it's kind of like those people are actually unsung heroes .
---
&gt; Raid leader says "Youre a healer wanting priority on a DPS trinket,
---
That's nonsense, it's bis for healers too.  The problem is it's a 28% chance on a rare spawn.  The healer should absolutely be allowed to roll, but it's ridiculous to reserve something everyone wants when you're the pug.
---
Lol what? Play a warlock then
---
yeah you are right, claiming they would be ready for naxx with that gear was a bit of an overstatement. but the initial point was there not being any catch up mechanics, which is very untrue. it might seem that way because the catch-up gear is available from the beginning, but its still gear that was designed to be catch-up.
---
Is it still okay to roll need on stuff that you need but arent yet ready yet? (need 2 levels for BS ring)
---
Boys support boys
---
&gt; Content is intentionally designed to be jussssssst barely un-doable by average players. 
---
Think of all the quests, especially in the early zones, where you are given a quest to kill 8 trogg fighters and 8 trogg mages (or whatever), and they spawn in camps of 4-5 around a fire, with 3 or 4 that patrol around the outside of the camp or in and out.  You can pick off the outer patrols and finish the quest eventually, but the in and out patrols can screw you even then.  But if you really want to finish the quest in a short amount of time, you're going to have to tackle those camps.  And they're doable, with good tactics and timing, or a group.
---
The game is pushing you to group up.  And grouping doesn't even always make it overly easy, sometimes that's just the barrier to entry.
---
2nd best*
---
I'm bad at macros. How do you make ones to put symbols on targets?
---
Some auction house add ons have default settings set up so that when you selling an item it prices your item 1c under the lowest current ah price. Since those add ons are pretty popular, the most common trade items will be affected the most because there are so many people selling those specific items and each new person selling will undercut the current price by 1c.
---
That and everyone is racing to 100/90g as fast as possible and selling stuff rather than using items for professions.
---
Blizzard has confirmed it's on the table for later.   It was in vanilla.
---
That being said you won't be able to go pve to pvp. At least you couldn't originally in vanilla.
---
no I was the one making a group the only response I got was "you can solo it I believe in you"
---
I always try when I get to ubrs ahead of time, but recently I've been hitting the point where I'll get locked with 1 more and not seeing him.
---
That's great! Thank you. It's truly amazing all of the alliance players who are doing this despite the challenges it poses.
---
Reason I asked is that the implementation should be very similar to yours, in that instead of mana, it‚Äôs health. And as for location, maybe that‚Äôs a separate rabbit hole. Thanks for the links! I‚Äôll check them out.
---
He has bartender it doesnt do that. You can also see that he has macros on the right hand side that do have text, so this guy doesnt have any for skills.
---
Yeah what strikes me as odd is why these people don't make the groupa
---
You don't know what carebear means.  Next time don't put a chat spammy macro near to one you'll be spamming to target a mob.
---
You understand it doesn't mean much as long as there's multiple layers on higher population server, you can have more people in Stalagg, Skeram etc. in Ironforge and it won't look as crowded because of layers. (The more peoples on the server the more layers).
---
&gt; Why wouldn't you let the tank get to 50%?
---
idk I guess it just made me uncomfortable, just in case something bad happened, like a crit or some unforseen damage. I haven't healed a dungeon for a long time (played priest in TBC) so I may have a muddled vision of what it's like.
---
Reason why I only hit on level 54 or higher mages. I usually ask for 6 stacks.
---
Must be nice having zero obligations so you can level your **third** sixty in under two months lmao.
---
Sure. As always though, just ask in chat.
---
The goblin cross faction AHs have a increased deposit and they take a higher % cut from the sold item.
---
If you dont have the poison filter turned off yes. Its mandatory to turn off in zg. There are spiders that have the same impact.
---
There's 3 trinkets most healers want.  1 is a 7% drop rate in BRD.  1 is a 9% drop rate in BRD.  Briarwood is a 28% chance to drop, if Jed is up.  Believe it or not, if you actually make sure the instance has Jed, it's the only one you have a very reasonable chance of getting as a healer besides the quested trinkets which are substantially worse.
---
You're not actually lowering their level...
---
You have to buy a NA wow account. You can use the same battle.net but have to have 2 wow licenses.
---
You also cannot transfer anything between them.
---
Can't say about the asshole part, this is up to debate, but definitely not a ninja for rolling "need".  
---
Did you need it as in "will it upgrade your damage from current weapon and will you equip it?" The answer is yes, you need it.  
---
Should you have let the mage get it anyway because it's a BiS for 5 level for him? That's up to debate.
---
How so
---
When I hit 30 I really wanted that WW axe. As a new player to WoW, it was the first big accomplishment on my account. I got some help with the charms, but none of the friends I play with were high enough to kill the elite at that time. I found a level 54 in IF and whispered him asking for help, and lo and behold he came up and killed it for me. Since then, I've made it my mission to help every single warrior who asks for help with Cyclonian, no matter what I'm doing. 
---
Ran two Alliance warriors through it the other day, but when we got there we saw 3 horde warriors, with the highest only level 36. I was either 51 or 52 at the time. You could tell they thought they were dead cuz one of them started running away. I ended up killing Cyclonian five times that day, and everyone on both sides ended up with a new axe.
---
The only zone that affects my mood is in mop expansion. Dread wastes depresses me so much.
---
Aux
---
I did have a few mages do this to me. But I was like "Don't bother, I still have 5 stacks". because the first thing I do on every login is to hit up a mage for 6 stacks of water.
---
Must be a virgin since wow player joke
---
Lol bruh someone Plat'd us. Cheers kind stranger üçª
---
They will never add PVE to PVP transfer. It's pretty much 100% they'd add other transfers cus $$$.
---
you could check wowhead and see that he follows a linear path up and down the road from feralas to STM.  I get that you're joking by the way.
---
&gt; Healers have more options than DPS for trinkets

Do you mean the one that's 7% chance to drop in BRD or the one that's a 9% chance to drop in BRD?  I'm at a point where I don't need UBRS except for Briarwood, so unless I'm helping someone for attunement I'm simply not going to heal it if I'm not allowed to roll.
---
A priest with mindsoothe makes it possible to do without aggroing anyone. Just clear the fire pat on the ramp and get the party to go up there, the priest can mindsoothe, hop down, open, and weave their way back up.
---
Yeah BRD is the best dungeon. Until you realize you made the mistake of rolling a rogue anyway. Been trying to make/find a group for a regular quest run since I hit 55 and all anyone wants are Angerforge spam or aoe with the occasional Jail Break. Now I'm level 59 with every single quest still sitting in my quest log other than the overseer and fanny pack ones. Kind of sad really.
---
I'm partial to.  
---
&gt;Sorry guys wife aggro.    
---
I'm not even married
---
And this, is bronze.
---
I /fart in it's general direction
---
Really tough, i Enjoy both! Tanking is fun for me aswell als dpsing as Arms. &lt;3
---
It's basically autioneer/ator with more options without the desktop app. It just also gives the realm averages and now region averages for everything as well if you download the app.
---
And I a shaman heal want MP5 and then Int, because Spirit gives me nothing.
---
Personally I'd do enhance till 45 using all the mail scarlet monastery gear since they're beast. 
---
Swapped to ele though and I have noticed a kill speed increase, at least by a bit. Although it's not any more entertaining than enhancements style of auto attacking and pressing the level 40 talent ability. You just... Lightning bolt.
---
Thanks.  I downloaded Luna and my initial impression is positive - it seems to have the option I was looking for.
---
yeah man it dropped while running, make the person insta equip it and be stoked for them. Whatever, gold comes and goes. I'm not pushing it on you to have the same out look on it as me, it's just how I choose to play the game. I like the game because you get to choose to help people and work as a team, that's what I find fun about it. Not stupid items or a faster mount, I have just as much fun without that shit. It's ok to have different perspectives. I get where you are coming from too.
---
Im playing my 4th mage to 60 right now (3 were on private servers). I'm a good mage. All this new mage hate (new huntards lulz) is sad to me... but also deserved.     
---
    
---
I've seen the same kind of shit you're talking about all over the place. But... I still see hunters multishot into CC, warriors trying to retail style 3-pull entire dungeons and wiping the party (regular groups, not cleaves), locks/priests/warriors dotting/bleeding CC, healers not drinking between every pull (despite having 60 freshly made mage waters), total ineptitude of every class with what there specific abilities are capable of CCing, etc etc... it's a torrent of shit players at the bottom with a sprinkling of pros leveling alts. Just keep a stack of salt in your bags to trade when ppl get mad at you for explaining their class to them because they cant be bothered to read their abilities tooltips, or use more than 3 fucking brain cells on situational awareness.    
---
P.s. whoever came up with the term "spellcleave," go fuck yourself. It's fucking aoe farming. No caster has any cleave.    
---
End rant.
---
why not make a new character with her? Preferably something you've got little experience in as well
---
Are we suppose to know who you are after watching it or something?
---
They were drinking man cmon!
---
&gt; and warriors wanna use 2h Weapons anyways who *barley* can hold aggro.. lol
---
Excuse me but I take that with a grain of rice!
---
Lowbers sucks.
---
And they have decent stats so you can even sell a few.
---
You don't get silenced from calling people an ass ...
---
You made this whining thread and you've proceeded to argue with people when they're (for mysterious reasons) criticising you?
---
Surprised?

&gt; Alternatively, use Linux.

"Took their time"

---
/shindig is always a favorite
---
So just skim reading this but, here's a few things to consider, OP.
---
1. PvP servers are for PvP, it's gonna happen.
---
2. Yeah, the lock is a bit of a twat. But I'm guessing *you* never mentioned it to him - if you did and he continued, you then simply don't heal them - throw them a Renew and that's about it. You enabled his way of playing.
---
3. Warriors do NOT need to be Prot at all, hell most Warriors don't even sword n board these days - you can do dungeons without a tank at all, or even a Shaman/Pally/Druid/Lock or whatever you want tanking. The Lock could have tanked it for you, not even kidding.
---
4. Mage using CoC is for burst damage due to shatter, he should have waited for aggro for sure, but no reason not to CoC. Not everyone is AoE farm Blizzard spec, and no it's not worth it on the stairs unless the entire thing is pulled as everything that pulls after will just run straight to the Mage.
---
5. The evade should not make the boss unkillable. Not sure what that issue is, tbh.
---
Genuinely just sounds like you need a break from the game. The only real issue you had was a Warlock that could have been fixed by simply communicating with him.
---
with honored rep the mount+riding is 90g! you're practically there!
---
okay thank you, what about Schematic: Hyper-Radiant Flame Reflector?
---
AP raises weapon damage. That's all it ever does, unless you're a Fury Warrior with Bloodthirst. "Just a higher weapon damage" is all that everything you just listed cares about, and the higher damage range on Stoneslayer will outperform the significantly lower damage range on Bonebiter.
---
All you need is a rollie cigarette and a cracked-screen iPhone 4 and you‚Äôll be that guy with the really nice kickflips at my local
---
Honestly dude, don‚Äôt do anything except answer her questions when they come up. Since it is classic, this is the best time for her to learn, because ‚Äòvanilla‚Äô was created for people who had not experienced wow (as it was not around yet), and classic is (more or less) the same as vanilla. The absolute beauty of vanilla and classic is just going through the game and learning things as you go.
---
in vanilla you can disenchant everything with skill 1 in enchanting, you just need to be lvl 5.
---
Re roll because you are too low level to actually tank correctly? Yeah makes sense
---
What's this trend recently with people posting their small "achievements" and redditors upvoting it heavily?
---
Full time hair dresser with no kids but other games to play and hit 40 with 12g in the bank wtf
---
Necro set gives you more attributes such as Int and Stam that are superior when AoE'ing, because spells like Blizzard and AE don't scale very well at all with spell power. With more Int however, being able to cast more spells is amazing.
---
That was the nice part, being able to get there before the curve. Made my devilsaur set without much more difficulty than actually killing the devilsaurs. A few stealth skinning horde but whatever it's done with
---
that is weird, ive definitely had some issues with it. its not as polished as it was in vanilla but most functions still work. cant say ive had that issue though. Do you still have drain a soul macro that deletes shards? maybe that is causing the issue
---
In vanilla we had so many hunters that wanted to raid, that we could legitimately require them to be engineers to be invited.  At least try to shock someone back.
---
All the bad mannered players in this game are mages (especially gnomes), rogues and hunters. All three of those classes attract utter lowlifes.
---
Be that as it may, by sharing this tale with strangers in Reddit, you are going to get criticised lol
---
Shouldn't you be complaining about how bad retail is instead of posting about classic.
---
Doesn't it stop giving levels at 75?
---
Chests hold nothing of value.
---
Seriously, some random tradeskill mats if you are lucky and mostly potions.
---
Should point out that lots also do 'emp runs' but do the lava skip in them. It's good to ask if they're lava skipping or not.
---
The problem lies when your pre-raid BIS is on inquisitor, or if you're a mage, two of them are. People with their BIS stuff on the easily farmed bosses get lucky, but if your BIS is on ambassador, or the seven, or inquisitor, you're in for a bad time.
---
Lmfao look at this. Then, when a hunter rolls on your sweet leather agility, you'll curse them for being a ninja.
---
Making sure to only play after bedtime and after all other duties have been accomplished with the wife :) honestly, idk how it happened either
---
I‚Äôm not sure there is an inn there. I think the closest is tarren mill. Set hearth there and fly to the coast.
---
Imagine looking at the character creation screen and saying "yep, I'm gonna be yet another undead rogue".
---
Blizzard we thank you, and the simpsons for your forewarning. We have ample time to prepare for the incoming trickery.
---
It's like 5g to level it up!!
---
Yeah, it does sound odd. Maybe it has a lot of afk time in the /played.
---
But this other guys "math" is questionable to say the least.
---
Tbf if this sub was around during vanilla we'd have way more huntard threads. This months meta is bitching about mages. Give it some time. The meta will shift
---
God you seem like a toxic man child, chill out dude. Not everyone is as hardcore as you
---
Generally the tank won't go from 50-0 in the time it takes for your heal to wind up, and if it looks hairy you can always shield then cast.
---
It's 5g you to train it higher, and a higher skill is unnecessary at level 40.
---
Then you're going to dislike basically every dungeon you have going forward. Dire Maul is the only one I can think of that splits them up, but even then, each wing is pretty damn long.
---
Nope just regular old drain soul. I just gave up on it and deal with it manually now!
---
Also get Align. It‚Äôs an add on that just adds a toggle able grid so you can actually line things up instead of just guessing
---
I had the same experience in this quest too!
---
By the way what's with this overuse of the word wholesome these days?
---
Literally same lol
---
Ripcasters
---
If the ganker is a disproportionately high level, I usually just rez walk up to him with without attacking and /fart /spit on him don't really caring what happen next.
---
The math doesn't add up doesn't imply anything, but the fact that your numbers don't add up. If you have a /played of 8.5 days you needed to be online for 5.8 hours on average a day, which just doesn't work with your description of 2 hours every morning and 4-5 on the weekend. I personally don't care how you spent your time, but you just seem to underestimate your play time.
---
I almost feel bad about getting mine on run \#1 in a group where nobody else wanted it.
---
That's a tip I would never try. I know it's probably true, but I don't have the balls.
---
How is a grey belt better than 10 silver and two mana pots tho
---
Lmao someone took part in the raid layering exploit
---
üëâüö™
---
If you only get one, start with Questie.
---
Just to on a pve realm and pick what looks cool, that's how we all start out
---
Go watch madseasons class videos on YouTube if you need help picking class
---
Oh yeah, tier 1? I just hit 25, loser! Get on my level!!
---
Yeah this can be frustrating. You'll find a tank that can handle most of the dungeon okay except for the last chunk because crushing blows just destroy them.
---
I did an ST run that was a cakewalk all the way through until Eranikus, because the crushing blows just destroyed the tank and also most of the party.
---
Yeah.. This is why many people are worn thin emotionally in WoW atm.
---
Your first mistake was using Succubus
---
Because it vendors for like 20-30s
---
Go there at lvl 40 and have at it with the yeti of your choice.
---
TSM is the best addon, takes a little setup to sell things but the buying works out of the box.
---
Bought one from a 45 warrior. He was selling it on trade chat. I asked how much and he was like: "70g fixed price". I said okay and bought it. Poor little guy.
---
Just dont play on Herod and you can avoid most of them

I hit 40 last week with 30 gold in bank, you're better than me! And thank the light I'm a paladin
---
I only attack other Druids in self defense or defense of my IRL friends.
---
5 hours for the first mount and some XP? Not bad IMO.
---
Probably elwynn Forrest...
---
Yeah, BFA sucks, buff shamans on BFA.  There.
---
Literally never been to A or B
---
See I don't know how true that is because I can hit them. While when they are red to me I can't thats why I am wondering about it.
---
I haven't even bothered hitting 60 yet on my priest (58 in mostly pre-bis cause I can do whatever at this point so just no drive to bother hitting 60 lol), have a 20 lock(second account for summoning myself places etc), another 24 lock, and a 23 mage. Alts are fun v0v
---
I can only dungeon so much before I just want to be out in the world. Once honor comes around I'll be on my priest a lot more, but that'll be out in the world pvpin' :P
---
Loot council scammers,this is horrible
---
Are you alliance as well?   I rolled an alliance mage.   42 currently on fairbanks
---
Weird, not banned like the rest of them.  Maybe it's because this isn't a raid layering exploit.
---
Layout and similar stuff. In retail I'm never suprised. I play it all with DBM because the entire game is made with DBM in mind. DBM tells me what to do, so I just do it. Not much thought behind it. Every single boss strategy the raid lead tells is something he got from a pro guide to do it exactly like this. Fighting trash in retail is simply filler. There is no danger behind it. This is because there are no patrolling mobs, etc.
---
In raid every little bit counts, and you'll see the difference in your dps. Current content it is not essential, MC and Onyxia are too easy and you can get along with a decent pug with no consumables. But later on aggro really matters a lot.
---
If you have the same outlook irl then I could pm you my Venmo account and you can just send me money.  I promise I‚Äôll deposit it straight away and I‚Äôll be incredibly stoked to receive hundreds of dollars from you.
---
i just left thousand needles. where is two thousand needles?
---
All high level greys sell for a decent amount. A level 48 cloth belt vendors for 22s. (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=3944/twill-belt)
---
Nice
---
Recently graduated grad school, have to wait till late October to take licensure exam so not working. Got 60 sometime a week ago or so, downed onyxia and mc past weekend. Doesn't mean you have that amount of free time or need to be 60 and raiding. There will always be 800,000 people spamming for scarlet monetary I've learned. Do it at your own pace everyone else is
---
All my clears are streamed.  Check the vods.  You can have this gear with good luck and set feeding.
---
Feralas
---
&gt;nor that you are unemployed,
---
If you play 10 hours a day, unless you've taken out vacation days or PTO - it means you're unemployed. None of us know OPs situation though. Maybe they're unemployed because of mental health issues. But even then, playing 10+ hours a day and being emotionally invested in a game isn't good for your mental health. It leaves pretty much no room for relationships or self care.
---
I‚Äôm leveling my warlock main mostly.  The advantage of doing this is money is much easier to get at 60, and not needing it for a lock I can just throw money at my alts when they need it.
---
Yeup, everyone pretends they don't remember that shit til BC hits and rogue mace stun is the meta and I'm laughing as I resist and overpower
---
Time is money, friend!
---
I mean I guess but you are not going to gear mp5 when 95% of the time stacking + healing is better.
---
Not on all my priest BIS lists, they don't even list the flamelash one as an alternative (but I know that it is, obviously). Second Wind from Argle is though, definitely.
---
He seemed like a really nice dude, engaged with the viewers and answered a lot of questions. Although I agree that kind of played time is rather extreme.
---
No this is one of the things they specifically decided to let it stay, because the games balance was based on that limit. If you remove it, content would become laughtably easy and thus would need readjustment.
---
Could be 1 dmg, could be 10,000 dmg.  No one really knows.
---
Tac
---
Auctionator #1
---
Get the dagger for your offhand instead. Vanquisher's sword is better and obtainable not long after
---
"Cope"
---
Losing threat to anyone other than the healer is not your fault. it is 100% the dps job to manage their own threat
---
I salute your sacrifice. O7
---
Sigh, they shouldn't have hotfixed this then. It's meant to be no changes.
---
Dude it definitely wasnt that the feature wasn't ready. Seeing how warlocks can summon in the same fckn way.

There is an addon where if you click a player, instead of their face, the portrait will be a picture of their class icon.

Two of them a tailoring friend made them for me. The other 2 were drops. The bigger one dropped off a tangled horror in Swamp of Sorrows!
---
I understand, but in those pug raid i have been the debuf wasnt the Problem (cleared as stated the Thinge, didnt got enough water).
---
I was Most of the time top dps warrior, just one fury warrior with krolblade was above me.
---
So i have the feeling the dps from arms was better with 2h, but i can Not prove it. if you prove me fury with 2h is better (and also furytak) im open for changing:)
---
How is 2h fury in pvp?
---
&gt;I'm only pretending to be a shit
---
&gt;cmon guys it's just a prank
---
&gt;mom they're being mean to me online
---
Also would throw /cast riposte in there.
---
Saves you not having to look out for a party unless that's your thing.
---
Which one specifically is this? I've looked at TSM and Auctioneer and the tooltip looks nothing like this.
---
That's what I'm saying, got epic mount and still making money from profession but I don't know why I'm doing it.
---
Why? Assuming they continue raiding which they should, how is it a scam? There's 8 pieces someone doesn't need, not to mention how most likely more than the 8 sham pieces have dropped and other shaman have pieces now too. It's funny when people don't understand loot council
---
Badass! We only have docs as hospitalists, didn't even know an NP could be a hospitalist. Makes sense though!
---
And gratz on hitting 60!
---
Sounds like Lineage II. Never heard of this MMO before, thanks for putting it on my radar.
---
Didnt considered this. Will do in Future, thanks!
---
That's impressive! Thank you for the kind words. But you have a disgusting amount of gold lol
---
For a small fee of 90g i will teach you how to print screen
---
Skeram could use you! We‚Äôre low on alliance as it is. I haven‚Äôt been in a queue for over a week now.
---
I had success going upstairs to log out.
---
Yes. You stun and have time to move away from melee so your at range enough to shoot again
---
I'm lvl 37 with 18g
---
Not optimistic or pessimistic, it's truth.  You can't close the gap on a mage between frost nova rooting you and then them blinking to make another gap if you get close.  They can just poly you and start at max distance if they want to reset the fight.  You need to catch them afk if you want that kill.
---
I second this.  Make a char with her. Also make a class that compliments hers. A lot of couples go for the tank and heal. I advise against this, she wont be able to enjoy the game staring at peoples health bars. Unless shes into that. Make it fun for her. It will go a long way!
---
I didn‚Äôt get it till tonight at 45 in Feralas there‚Äôs gryphons that drop good trash loot I farmed there for a full day and made like 50g
---
Would you mind listing all the cc ability categories? 
---
There are roots, stuns, charms, fears, anything else? 
---
Are slows their own thing or does it fall under one of these?
---
Come to Herod, it's got a lot of horde but the alliance guilds are no joke and hold spots down all the time. The server reaches "full" very often but there hasn't been a queue in weeks. Best of both worlds.
---
Would be very hard if you want to aoe farm using blizzard with it
---
I actually really get excited when I see a chest. Its like opening a lootbox, except Its free! Never know what could be inside...
---
Hilarious how Horde players always think they're highly skilled by playing on a faction with heavy numbers advantage. If you're a real pvper, reroll Alliance and see how it is
---
I haven‚Äôt had a queue on Whitemane in a week now. In general this issue seems to be going away.
---
Dude watch the whole epic npc man series, it replaced netflix for me, they are so good, one moment i cry, the next i burst out laughing. It's so good :D
---
Is Leatherworking worth it? I've gotten it to 192 while my skinning is 275. Just hit level 40 as a shaman and only halfway to my mount gold. I feel like it would've been better to just vendor the leather instead of using it to level up my LW? Not sure what I should do now, unlearning it seems like such a waste of time
---
I just leveled fishing and sold flowers.  110g at 36 idk

Vanilla "content" is so faceroll this is actually a viable way to play.
---
Can't we have just gone straight to TBC and skipped this?
---
I‚Äôm currently 45 and levelling as Arms spec. 
---
I find a good way of holding threat of packs of 2-4 is to charge, blood rage, sweeping strikes, switch to zerk stance and whirlwind, then switch to defensive and begin tab-sundering. 
---
Ideally I do all this with a slow 2-handed and switch to 1h/shield when I go to defensive stance IF the mobs hit hard enough to warrant it. 
---
The opening sweeping strikes/whirlwind does a very large amount of damage and even though not being done from defensive stance generates a significant amount of threat on a pack.
---
While in def stance after the opener, I‚Äôll still switch back to zerk and whirlwind every ~10 seconds to keep the aoe threat going.
---
I find using the above I rarely have to bother marking any targets and let the dps go nuts. Obviously things break away from time to time and I‚Äôll taunt a runner.
---
Oh man, good idea! Let's go back in time and slap the devs for not dragging the warlock spell onto the fucking stone. What were they thinking?! Forget about all the code they have to deal with and just make the stone a fucking warlock.
---
Do a bid only, starting at 250g. /shrug
---
You just do arenas at 52. Which is fine since he's a warrior and he needs to do many arenas for SGC
---
STV always makes me hate the game. I‚Äôm a bit OCD about quests so I go there and struggle. The rest of the game feels easy by comparison.

Are you saying we should gank the children also?
---
Typical Horde
---
Glad you are in the minority then because this game would be fucked if we all stayed in our dps specs and waited for tanks and heals
---
It's a matter of opinion. My boyfriend absolutely loves it and considers it one of the best instances, while I hate it. 
---
I find it unnecessarily oversized, easy to get confused/lost, and wonky with some of the levels/walls where you suddenly pull mobs from below.

Oh and the god damned bots that reflect spells. As a healer I despise them and those casters who kill themselves on it.

oh yeah, it does. I thought you meant you needed skill 75 in disenchanting to disenchant certain items.

There used to be a cap on how many debuffs you can have so summoning this pet out gives you a debuff so your first debuff disappears.

Thanks!  15 years ago when I was in undergrad with a lot fewer obligations it still took me 6 months to hit 60 so I think it‚Äôs funny so many years later I was able to do it with a lot more on my plate in significantly less time. 
---
Yeah I work in New Mexico (live in Texas), and NM is an independent practice state for NPs and we have full admission privileges.  My company actually operates with more NPs than physicians in our practice since our compensation (although great) is still less than what they would pay a physician to do the exact same job.  Our quality metrics beat many of our peer facilities in states that operate exclusively with physicians so it‚Äôs been a really rewarding experience.

Oh and im playing Alliance(Miss windfury;_;) so i read 2h fury only viable to Horde due to WF.

let her lead the way and play patiently! i did the same thing when i introduced my boyfriend to wow and he was a complete mmorpg beginner. join her on a character you intend only to play with her so there's no worry you'll leave her behind, she'll probably have fun if it's an experience you can both share at first while she learns the ropes. answer her questions as she develops them, but don't overwhelm her with info or pressure her on how she "should" be playing to optimize some aspect of her game, because right now it'll probably sound like gibberish and get in the way of feeling immersed in the world. i was pretty bad about info-dumping stuff to my boyfriend and rushing to where i knew we had to go before he had even read the quest, and it made him lose interest for awhile... but once he caught the wow bug and started playing solo that was that, he was hooked! goodluck!

Thanks a lot

I originally thought we were talking IRL drinking. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
---
Out of curiosity, why did you transfer off Sulfuras?
---
Was a 13 yr old account.  Wtf just happened lmao
---
While that is true, 2h fury is still more viable on alliance than 2h arms.
---
What did you Farm there? Gotta find a spot for myself as I‚Äôm 40/41 on my characters and no mount yet. Need another place to level that isn‚Äôt STV lol
---
Hell yes. I have 3 chars at 21-22. Way behind you.
---
Can you aoe farm without Blizz?
---
Yes the cloud PC service. It‚Äôs not against the ToS. 
---
Illegally distribution of blizzard software via cloud is. Been playing in the cloud for almost two years now, making videos as I go. Blizzard knows; doesn‚Äôt care.
---
Step 1: Get to 40
---
Step 2: Learn mortal strike
---
Step 3: Pop out of the berserker shack
---
Step 4: Crit
---
Yeah I definitely planned to play with her. I'll just try to take it slow.
---
One I used to use back in the old days was "my hamster is on fire"

I think I have a new hobby now

Lets not all be doom and gloom.  Frost mages are a hard counter to warriors, even more so without pvp trinkets, your biggest edge is gear.  My best advice would be to find a frost mage buddy to duel a bunch, many frost mages at your level will lack pvp experience, this will give you a slight edge, the whirlwind axe will also help alot as it gives you the spike/gear advantage in the 30s.  Aim for stam gear as much as possible.
---
For the actual combat:
---
The mage will get close to nova, if you are quick, have rage and you dont have bleed effects on the mage blow intimidating shout and use this time to bandage if uve taken damage, the mage will likely ice block (not sure what level they get this).  
---
Pressure is key here if you reset the mage will win but if you stay on the iceblock and hamstring when it breaks it will force the mage to blink, you can then intercept and burst him down (hopefully), be ready to pummel as the last thing the mage will try is probably sheep to reset the combat, interrupt this and hes done.  
---
Sadly until 40 you are completely reliant on auto attacks so things arent great but they get better in time!
---
There are a tonne of other ways the fight can go down, practice remain calm and youll increase your odds of coming out alive, or level with a shaman and eat those mages for breakfast :p
---
Its one button  on your keyboard. You saying it was faster to grab your phone?
---
This is also why us old farts love the EverQuest and Ultima Online classic servers. Its so brutal and fun
---
Oh, look at mister armchair dev over here. Warlocks can summon, so just make the stones cast that spell. Genius.
---
The code base of the game was wildly different 13 years ago. No one knows why they had issues implementing it, but they did.
---
The first mention of classic that wasn't a "No." stated something about a code issue. Classic wasn't as simple as slapping vanilla shit back into the game, but I bet you think that.
---
Can confirm you're not.
---
What about the /Train ? Chugachugachugachugachiga woooo wooooo

  You just can't help stupid.  You misunderstand literally everything and take your ego so far. Stop eating glue
---
Put windfury on and proceed to be the slot machine of Doom. Will you one shot them, or will you not get a single proc? Only rng will tell.
---
That's not true, winning pvp as a warrior is expensive, you need to carry free action potions. and you MUST not let them poly you after you use it. Use intercept to stun them when they go to cast it and use intimidating shout as well as a second interupt. Not having pummel till 38 sucks.
---
If you have engineering use iron grenades.
---
In this guild as a shaman, couldn‚Äôt be happier we got maevey his full set tonight, he pumps

All the morons coming in to defend Roy sound like the stupidest scum I've ever heard
---
To be fair, sometimes you just have horrible luck with drops. My bear druid is still running it at level 52 for the hat off the chieftain. I've ran this dungeon about 20 times in the last week, and still have not seen it drop. He's dropped about 2 BBPs, 3 Ripsaw, and about 15 Chief Enforcers. Sadly, this is probably my best threat helm until Strat live, so I'll probably keep running it until then
---
Im level 31, and seem to be running out of quests on every zone, mostly have only red ones left which are quite hard to do, only have a few orange quests here and there, time played per level has gone up to 3h for the past 2 levels already, am i the only one or is this common?
---
Not everyone thinks clearly when panicking.
---
Are you the level 60 who jumped and camped my level 44? Go find someone your level big boy
---
Played mage on private aervers a long time... These guys give mages a bad name. Honestly people are very classist to me evrry day im playing and are always glad to call magea op or dumb right to my face even though id consider myself a very good mage. (Multiple glad throughout the years)
---
Whoa, nicely done.   I like that stylized vector look.   What program do you use?  Illustrator?
---
&gt;This NPC can be found in Scholomance during the **Scourge Invasion.**
---
So, phase 6 or whatever.
---
Most people here are saying it's a bad gun, which tbh it kinda is. However most are missing that you are BM. Assuming you are fully speced into BM you won't have access to aimshot till earliest lvl 51. A fast wep has it's drawbacks as mentioned by others, ammo consumption and dmg scaling on skills. But if you are just hunters marking + serpent stinging + pet attacking to level. Which was what I was doing when I was BM. I think it's totally decent gun. I however would rather try and sell it and use the gold to upgrade other pieces of gear that will become available after 50 or even for your epic mount.
---
Well shit, I may have to sign back up then.
---

---
Why, does the auction house even take a cut? What do they do with all that virtual none existent money? Spread it to vendors? Seriously.
---
Sorry I just hate taxes in all forms.
---
Cant stop inviting mages. They are just too good in groups. Try strat ud without a mage. Pain.
---
Significant until you get the core leather gloves
---
No Pve to pvp as it‚Äôd be unfair. Also this is asked every day so you could just look it up... not tryina be rude. Just saying.
---
&gt; Tbh its almost never 'broken'
---
Dude, we know.
---
Dumb hawkhorse can't get ate.
---
Hell ya! I never did any raids. Or brd. Played on my brothers character when I transferred it to my account and did strat and scholo. Once tried to host onyxia raid and we were all ready but I wasn‚Äôt attuned. Good times. Looking forward to trying a lot of this stuff
---
I do it both in game and in reality.
---
Whatever, HORDE FILTH! 
---
(love ya)
---
C is clearly the superior one, numbers don't lie. You can even see it in the picture more people at the C.
---
B might be good at his job but has poor intersocial skills so people don't like dealing with him.
---
Are you in a raid
---
I just did this on westfall to a tauren warrior last night. Someone asked on lfg in alliance if someone could help them. I saw that someone had already spawned cyclonian at level 34 and was just stiting there.. staring. So I pointed and /charged and all that till they tagged it and killed it for them, then did the same for the guy who asked for help.
---
If you were the tauren warrior I helped last night, you're welcome :)
---
You kinda disappointed me in picking up the hammer over the axe.. but.. ya know.
---
You only made it worse. Now he has to go into debt to recoup his losses by gambling more.
---
having the same issue here
---
spent mine in BRD and running dungeons for Pre-BiS.
---
My first reaction was to send a picture to my wife while she was at work. Couldn't do so with my computer. Lol sorry.
---
Yeah and he's probably now running with other people making alts who've seen mage aoe damage and think that's all you do. They're not even mage mains lol
---
working for alliance
---
we just started it kept the costumes on followed him and ended up dying at the end but did not res till it completed and ran back and handed in
---
obviously dont let him get too far from you or like any escort i assume it fail's
---
I'm a casual player. It will take me quite some time to get to 60 and explore the full enjoyment of "end game" Classic.
---
If they change it too soon, I will be sad.
---
Also, the reason I quit modern WoW is because of class changes. Every update I had to relearn new skills. Left me with level 100 toons that I didn't know how to play. Extremely annoying. If they do that to classic I'll drop off for sure.
---
Lol same
---
Another warr and I (both of us fury) took a group through UBRS by dps tanking.  Admittedly we threw shields on for that one pull in Drakk's room and for Drakk himself, but for everything else, it was ww and cleavetown.
---
Shut up you‚Äôre not my dad
---
8 hours a night is rare tbh.   I'd wager most gamers are used to 6 hours a night or less on average.  I know I did that schedule for almost a decade.
---
I find fire much more fun to play, and in later dungeons you can‚Äôt just Aoe.  Unless they‚Äôve made the end game dungeons a ton easier.
---
But you're not a human?
---
Yeah, I scoffed at such a notion at first, until I saw it firsthand and then did it myself and now I don't know what to do with my life.
---
O yeah arena they are set, just can't get much further than angerforge
---
Year seriously congratulations, you must be a master at multi-tasking. I work full time, girlfriend, no kids 22 years old and I only just hit 22 and played on launch :/
---
yeah i was thinking paladin too
---
I see lotta ppl jumping that way, I jump off ledge walking backwards angled towards the rocks almost always land on rocks no lava jump needed. Is that unwise?
---
It only took you 2 months because you probably did a lot of standing around or waiting for groups or ignoring mobs and not actually leveling.  You are just being active this go around.
---
 Or a flare. I saw an alliance rogue sneak through the orcs next to blackrock Spire entrance and my flare simply revealed him when he passed through them. The next second 4 blackrock orc elites proceeded to beat him to death before he could get out of the flare radius and use vanish because he got dazed in the process as well.

Disable half the add-ons. If it doesn't go away disable the other half. Then take the half that makes it go away and disable half of it and so on
---
Hunter is a class that has always interested me and classic was the perfect time for me to try it. I love managing the ammunition, something most people see as a negative to the class. Managing the pet and it‚Äôs training and skills. I hated how they took away stat sticks for hunters, but that‚Äôs obviously not an issue in classic. Their tier sets are amazing. 
---
All of these things make the Hunter feel so good to play. When I stop in town I really have to prepare for venturing back out in the wild. Make sure I have food, ammo, and dog treats. It feels so much more rewarding than retail.
---
So has every other 35+ character in the game that went to desolace  lmfao
---
Considering there‚Äôs nothing stopping you from moving on/leaving, at no point would I call it griefing.
---
It has more DPS against 1-2 targets. 3 targets is debatable - more than blizzard, less than AE spam.
---
Alternatives is not equal to bis...
---
You need imp blizzard.
---
Mostly important element.
---
Some people don't auto-loot everything in a chest; they leave all the food behind for the next guy.
---
I don't see much point in unlearning it now unless you want to go back and level up a different profession before continuing levelling.
---
If you feel its a money sink, stop spending money on it for now and just stick with selling the leather. Make a decision to reskill at 60.
---
Very satisfying to watch.
---
Nice. I won't bother getting them until they are cheap. What's the point of having BIS when most people are still fucking running ZF?
---
hmm i must be thinking of the wrong guy then
---
Feral leveling spec druids lose to mostly everyone else's leveling spec unless you jump them unprepared and with mobs on them.
---

---
That's not entirely true. I've tried to hearth a few times and just died so I logged off. I suppose I could take a Rez hit and hearth but at that point I'd rather just not play.
---
I'd personally consider it Griefing.
---
Depends on how costly the patterns are. I top 5g on devilsaur pieces
---
It never turns into griefing if by griefing you mean something blizzard will take action against.   It's a pvp server
---
It‚Äôs weird, because they didn‚Äôt have a ‚Äútemplate‚Äù during Vanilla. They just refined the MMO and made a great game with talent and hard work. The evolution of corporate game production really sucked. :(
---
I don't use an MMO mouse. It's really not necessary to have that many keys.
---
I got the Logitech g603 and it has 6, but I only use 5. With ctrl and shift modifiers it is equivalent to 15 buttons.
---
Then I use 1-5 along with q,e,f,t on the keyboard (and modifier versions). Which is a total of 42 keybinds, well in excess of whatever you might reasonably need, even in the most keybindheavy game.
---
I used to use mmo mice like the steelseries wow edition, razer Naga, corsairm95(?) but they're just ugly, bulky, not comfortable and overpriced.
---
No the playerbase is a dumber than a rock. 
---
Letting players dictate what the game becomes is how you end up with BfA.
---
Nope, I wasnt in raid. I didnt stray far from my party either. Everyone else in my party received credit except me. We all started and received the quest at the same time
---
Yeah, when I go to kill someone and they start FAPping, it's a real power move and I back off.
---
Maybe a stupid question, but why no 1h weapons here?  I see the off-hands listed, but no main hands.  Am I missing something?
---
Not really, ace...
---
Just think. In a few expansions you'll be able to rise that dragon.
---
I'm languishing in the 30s thanks to a combination of tons of OT at work, and the fact my AC unit passed unexpectedly and nobody told the weather it's supposed to be fall.
---
Hard to play in 90% humidity, 98 degree conditions.
---
Yes, but do it after you get your mount! At least that's my thinking
---
repost of a repost, i like it
---
B because of the lower concentration of meat sacs.
---
They could reliably reproduce BC and Wrath (though Wrath's introduction of LFG mechanisms could be a point of contention), but I think Cataclysm is where they might think about veering off the beaten path. It's in Cata that a lot of people feel like the road to retail wow was paved. Especially in terms of its approach to questing and class specialization.
---
Personally, I'd really like to see them take the visual assets of retail, while freezing other systems and exploring new or alternate stories and progression strategies.
---
Yeah surprisingly enough I didnt fail it either. It just isnt marked as completed.  
---
I didnt even die, so Im not sure what happened here. I ticketed a GM but idk if they can even help.
---
I still have the not completed quest in my quest log as proof lol
---
Could be revenge... I have a friend that was killed ONCE, he then proceeded to make an alliance toon on another account to track his killer, and continuously stalk and gank this guy for weeks!
---
Probably want to check out arathi Highlands, hillsbrad, or shimmering flats
---
Is that a Classic feature? I thought they changed something at some point so kiting wasn‚Äôt possible.
---
For real
---
I might help a horde do that quest, but if probably kill them after too.
---
I had to do this, not because I didn't know but I got dc'd reported to find myself in the middle of the tunnel. Walked my way to iron forge only to find stormwind. Was my angriest tram trip
---
I mean you just said you could have spirit ressed. The only person to blame for your repeated deaths is yourself.
---
Just log until morning. This is what pvp entails. Just the reality, sorry to be blunt and not the answer you want but don‚Äôt like it move to pve.
---
Call for help from your faction. Log out and play and alt or organize your bank alt and auction things
---
Mate only the hardcores are Max level, and the game and release schedule isn't dictated by them
---
What exactly does "hit cap" mean? What is the hit cap for a Druid, and how do I check if I've hit it?
---
It never becomes griefing, you could always just ask a 60 to help you out people always love gankong dishonourable people
---
i didnt downvote you m8 i swear
---
Okay, I am hopeful it is just a bug. I posted here because I was sure it has happened to someone else before. Thank you!
---
Never.  You consented to pvp with full knowledge of all that entails when you chose to play on a pvp server.  Look it up in the official faqs.  Says the same.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/10184
---
Simple. Retail only players (who will be able to vote since we share a sub) will be able to influence/troll the vote if they want to.
---
Besides that some potential changes sound cool on paper but suck in reality. Like flying mounts etc.
---
"hard seltzer" lol get outta here
---
Damn 69g? Those are worth way more than that on whitemane.
---
Glad you had a happy ending!
---
Most of the best players in WoW use only keyboards. There are more than enough binds on KB alone.
---
Because you are using their service to sell your item rather than posting it in trade chat. I'd call it a service fee. Auctioneers need to eat as well.
---
I'm doing seal fate/sub build right now, how much of a dps increase will i get if i respecc to combat swords?
---
Not in my experience, people have no issues with me doing it
---
In the website, security page, where it shows all logins I did click on "sign everyone out" and added a blizzard authenticator on my phone. So if it happens again I'll get a pop up on authenticator that someone is requesting access to logging into my account
---
I work as a day analyst, have a pregnant wife and two kids and I only have a 27 paladin and a 20 warrior.
---
That's really impressive you hit 40, and I seriously need to make my mind up with which I'd rather play
---
dance like nobody's watch............FUCK

You‚Äôll probably be able to run it a few times, and they‚Äôll get more chances at drops
---
i work 7 jobs, have 3 wifes and 78 kids. Finally reached level 3. Please upvote.  
---
Edit: Thanks for the gold kind stranger
---
I was shadow up to 60, healed pretty much every instance along the way. I'd say swap back now, by the time you hit 60 your respec costs should be down a bit. 
---
I didn't take shadowform until 45 though, as I kept wand spec. 
---
I found that 45-50 involved quite a lot of zone swapping between Tanaris, Feralas, last few bits of STV, the Hinterlands and a few quests in the swam of sorrows.
---
I can, weird.
---
I asked where the flight path in darnassus was and someone called me a noob.
---
Bump as sweet God I want this
---
&gt;This is not good design and to say that it just adds complexity is idiocy at the highest level.
---
I did say "complex or obscure", the relevant one being obscure in this case. BFA is an excellent example of a normalized, well designed game that most people don't like. Many people like me hate that kind of game with a passion, everything on a platter no thought ever involved.
---
Think about what this bad design mechanic creates for the community, or should I say forces the community to create. We have theorycrafters who dig into databases. We have guide writers who argue the merits of X or Y. The average player doesn't want to spend all this time themselves, so they take the quick way out of talking to people and asking what items or guides are good. Communication and thought are required in larger amounts as a result. 
---
Yeah, it's bad design. But sometimes bad design creates good game elements. Remember every inconvenience, triviality, challenge. All of it is engineered in game worlds, intentionally or otherwise.
---
Ye really nice to watch
---
I dont think we are going to encourage a level 30 to use consumables just to avoid regular ganks. At 60 sure but before a mount that's not reasonable
---
Ah, I guess through Discord or something. But she has no wifi at work. So text was my only way. And I don't have a text app on my computer.
---
&gt; It could be things as making flight paths more direct
---
No because this removes potential player interaction by shortening the distance people have to travel to objectives.
---
&gt; or you no longer have to dismount to attack
---
Just macro /dismount into your abilities.
---
If anything needs changes it would be under the hood things, like melee range compensation and spell batching.
---
"We care bears"
---
I forget WoW has a lot of RP and I just think of NPCs as just that. I forget the lore of the game, and I get reminded of it occasionally, and then it makes me like the game more. 
---
Thanks bud.
---
Wait is 8 intel leg and helm enchants a thing now? I thought dm brought those
---
How about YOU quit now, and the rest of us will quit when that day comes? 
---
You very obviously don‚Äôt enjoy Vanilla or else you would be playing it instead of wasting a single second thinking about what you are going to do when it‚Äôs over.
---
Whenever I'd stop at rexxar for my attunement I'd /1 rexxar is at x,x  such a pain in the ass.
---
 Time to call cps
---
It's useful on raggy
---
Any guilds who post in tradechat or LFG chat are those super casual mass invite we take anything anybody anytime guilds who gonna spam this for the entirety of phase 1-6 because there are like 100+ guilds like that per server and most people dont care.
---
We have a premade guild from a private server, we have 120 people who all know each other, we run 3 molten core raids with 30 people each atm while waiting for the slowies to hit 60 soon.
---
We wont ever post about recruiting and we wont invite anybody unless its a friend of someone.
---
But I tell you this, you wont ever find a decent guild if you wait for people to spam chat or just invite you. Like I said those guilds are nothing but "invite everybody, invite all the level 1s, everybody can invite even more" massguilds who wont get anywhere.
---
You have to interact with people of good guilds in dungeons, you have to show that you know your class and can perform and you should make them understand that you are a team player and not a retail "OMG FCK YOU I NEED EVERYTHING BECAUSE I CAN AND REFUSE YOU BUFF YOU OR GIVE YOU ANY WATER" annoyance.
---
If they get a good picture of you they gonna add you to the friendlist and group up again, once grouped up enough you can bring up that you are looking for a guild and they might invite you starting as a friend, there will be the day where someone is missing for the raid where you can jump in and help out and soon you might be promoted and be a full raid member.
---
My alt is sitting in one of those tradechat guilds and they have like 600 members, 300 of them offline for over 2 weeks. Again avoid those tradechat guilds if you want a healthy, long living guild for classic wow.
---
Everyone with verizon fios couldn‚Äôt use the log in servers. Blizzard acknowledged it. Even if you are on fios, using a vpn routes the traffic differently across the internet and bypassed the communication problem between Verizon routers and. Blizzard routers/servers. I used Express VPN. If I had t that one time, and another time since I would have beeen able to play. The rest of the Internet was fine with or without the VPN both times.
---
It is a really well done pen and paper dungeon and the 3d design is amazing and hard to do in pen and paper.
---
Only 50?  You've still got *at least* 200 more, and that's if you're lucky!
---
I wish I could get into to, but i feel like I couldn't keep character ever.
---
This, stv is really fun too
---
I think it is out of date
---
did the 2 minutes it took you to screen shot this, import to paint and post to reddit feel productive?
---
You're talking about the OP's kid here.
---
As a wand using priest, nothing gives me more joy than seeing all the enemies I've danced with in the chat log :D
---
This is how it should be. I love it.
---
I actually sold it with 500g got 475g out oh AH after the cut they take, i can provide screenshot after i get out of work.. Happy days
---
What weird spec are you that you have only 3 points in bane lol
---
Well that hasn't been the case for me in any instance. Warriors, rogues and hunters all feel it deep in their loins when I teabag them after they try having a go at me.
---
/yw works for "you're welcome" too, i think
---
It really is just people using TSM though.  You can set it up to make noises as soon as it finds something or anything changes with your auctions.
---
He said combat daggers, not seal fate daggers.
---
You WILL get a dps decrease, but the damage decrease isn't as significant as if he goes to seal fate.
---
latter
---
Why are people so upset? Gz man, and gz to your guild on having a full T1 shaman early, support important for the healing team :)
---
you need free action pots like every other melee and then u just hope windfury procs
---
No surprise he‚Äôs an undead player.
---
Do you not have a pc? (just curious)
---
Thanks so much for posting this, I had been trying to figure out how to solo Bannok in his 1st and 3rd spawn locations as a rogue for the past few days. It's possible for a rogue to execute the pack splitting method by sapping one melee mob and blinding another, then running away with bannok and vanishing, and then immediately attacking him as he tries to reset.
---
lmao - PvE guy tries PvP, doesn't like it, must change it.
---
I felt like 30-40 was a pretty rough band in terms of running to different zones, like others have said you can do the earlier part of: Arathi Highlands, Thousand Needles/Shimmering Flats, Hillsbrad and STV. But I would recommend trying to get a few levels through Scarlet Monastery runs, these zones are much easier to traverse and quest when you are 33-34
---
&gt; full t1

I only have 1 thing to say to the guy... L2P Warlock !
---
we ar speaking baout stun, cmon.
---
Leather sells on the AH, why would you vendor it
---
I am firmly in support if Classic+ but I am also firmly against any sort of QoL change.
---
Anything that waters down the RPG feeling and the breathing world feeling, I'm against. Anything that would make Classic closer to modern mmorpgs (dailies, switching specs on the go, linear quest hubs etc.. ) I'm firmly against.
---
Asking the players to vote is a bad idea.
---
Yeah you see people parroting that because it‚Äôs the case in retail. In reality, race choice matters a good amount in classic. However it‚Äôs still not significant enough that you should choose a race you don‚Äôt enjoy looking at in order to chase racials. But that 25% stun resist is something the top 1% and the bottom 99% will notice plenty of times throughout playing. Either way though war stomp is a good racial and Tauren is far from a bad choice for hunters. Night elf is probably the worst choice.
---
Pinch your nose and blow
---
C is the only good one
---
You can teleport from Booty Bay as Horde, quest starts in Org, sends you ton ratchet then BB
---

---
Only horde warriors can realistically compete with DW (equal level gear) with a 2 hander due to Windfury totem. OEB is awesome for pvp through, MS and white swing crit is going to destroy most all clothies.
---
It's lile watching an ant colony.
---
the same thing happened to me, i was in Stormwind dropping things in the bank and saw the egg i was like wtf is this, jumped on wowhead and laughed like a maniac haha
---
I am loving Bigglesworth nothing but the classiest here in my experience
---
No layers were abused in the making of this set...
---
DESTROYED!!!
---
How is this humblebrag? 2 out of the 3 stories are about this Warlock getting mobbed by lowbies constantly.
---
No, if you‚Äôre a tauren none of your racial bonuses are insanely effective as a hunter, but that‚Äôs okay! Your damage  will be comparable to other hunters of other races... as a tauren hunter your thunderstomp is actually really good for survival because you can thunder stomp them when they get to melee range, run, turn around and use a concussive shot to slow them, then kite them along.. this is to avoid taking damage while avoiding going into melee combat simaltaneously
---
no, you can. Everyone can see EVERY day dozens of post about ‚Äúhaha, im new to wow thats so cool‚Äù , so why you are acting like u didnt know there are plenty of fresh players now in WoW?
---
So jealous. Resto?
---
Maybe when you get older you will undestand some of these things better.
---
You look like Alliance, shame on you, wearing their colors !
---
&gt;How is this humblebrag?
---
&gt;I almost feel guilty to run into him and destroy him without any real effort. Is it even real pvp at this point?
---
LBRS and Scholo are the hardest high level dungeons and LBRS is supposed to be lower level.
---
majority of wow players are elitist pricks... tell the tank what hes doing wrong and try to make it work. ur pathetic attitude just makes it worse.
---
Priest here. Got my mount at 40 with 12+ gold to spare. 
---
My advice? Fish the coast of STV from Booty Bay up to Grom‚ÄôGol. Fish every school you see. You‚Äôll get Oily Blackmouth, Stonescale Eel, Firefin Snapper, Stranglekelp, Rumsey Rum Black, and Mithril Trunks that contain: Bolts of Mageweave and Runecloth, Greater Healing and Mana potions, 40+ level green items, thick and rugged leather, etc.
---
All of those things sell on the AH for decent money. I made more than enough money and also didn‚Äôt sell any of the cloth, as I use it for tailoring. It‚Äôs a pretty solid run. Just toss on a podcast or some music and fish to your hearts content. The mount is 100% worth the investment :)
---
I'm on the other side of the fence on this one. Yes I like unique classes but honestly I really like the retail combat tbh. Not how easy it is or the fact that there is no need for mana conservation but I enjoy the procs and rotations and big cds
---
So the only retail I played was WoD and I loved the combat. Wod had many many problems but combat wasnt one imo. I played frost mage and having big cool spells and procs was hella fun. Mirror image, icy orb, ice comets, haste buff, plus a pet. And you had frost bolt as the main damage spell with procs for ice lance and frost fire bolt. But in vanilla as a frost mage my damage rotation is frost bolt over and over with a fire blast mixed in on cd. That isnt exactly engaging.
---
I liked the variety of big unique spells and simply having more buttons to push and procs felt good and I liked building up my procs so I could spam 3 in a row.
---
And I like my classes extra specialized ie a frost mage shouldn't have fire spells, a fire mage shouldn't have frost spells and arcane should have it's own arcane spells etc. I liked the dual spec though or just being able to reroll without too much of a big penalty. Bc it is fun to try different things out.
---
Also I dont have experience with most classes so I dont have any opinions other than mage and warlock.
---
Anyone can do it.  That's what makes OG wow great.  You need to step up your politics.
---
That's cause retail is garbage.
---
I'm a simple man, I see a thread that says fuck mages. I updoot.
---
You feel normal.
---
Everyone should do at least one full Questrun in brd.
---
I had a 3 hour run where we did the entire onyxia Qline, (multiple portaling to sw and if to turn in quests and getting followups, pyron+baelgar. Darkwire for key, blood of mountain and incendius for Qs.
---
The proceeded to bar and did all 3 things there (in retrospect we rly shouldnt have messes with the bartender). And finally, we saved the fucking princess xD
---
Only to then have her tell us that she likes it black and we can fuckoff and tell her da that. see if he shoots the messenger.
---
luckily the dwarfking was an understanding man and gave us a bis ring xD
---
Whahahahahha
---
Awesome thanks for the analysis üòä
---
Not gonna lie I was one of those when classic first launched. First time playing wow. I only rolled PvP because the friends from other games that convinced me wanted to. 
---
I've recently been converted thanks to STVietnam. I've been ganked a handful of times while there. So what do you do? You group up. Now there's three of you and you're farming stuff, waiting on respawns. There's 1 or two of the other faction nearby farming too. But he has mobs over there. That should be your tag. Guess he should've grouped up, the jungle is dangerous. 
---
Then you get the 60s that "claim" an area. Flew into grom gol tonight and see chat has people complaining about a 60 mage camping the nessingway camp. Put the call into guild chat and went to check it out. Ended up getting a raid group together, and fighting over the camp area for about 2 hours. ALOT of allies just trying to turn in quests got caught in the crossfire. Same with horde. In the end once the mage had been killed a bunch of times he wound up running off, the group disbanded, and nessingway went back to peaceful. 
---
I freaking love PvP now lol.
---
I just started a mage alt with the intention of going for single target fire damage. I fully expect to be shunned by all other mages.
---
The thing is sometimes it works in open world too but maybe the player is afk it doesn‚Äôt accept for some reason, so we may never know!
---
Some people must live a very sad life if they need to camp someone in a videogame and shittalk them like an hour.
---
They are like those 60s who kill a AFK level 44 player in tanaris and spam their faction chat macro "o WN ed  yOU"... I mean wow you kill someone in a video game who wasnt even on your level, much good, so wow...
---
I'm doing a Mage for my second character, and I want to respec fire or just a better PVP frost build, but god that AoE build XP is just too good.
---
I know it's not cool to complain about QoL stuff from retail, but I miss dual spec.
---
Yeah if you take that alone... The rest of the stories build him up to him being someone who can't even beat low level players at an advantage.
---
It might not be the average player who buys it
---
you guys are welcome to shake your ass to a different server that has "changes"
---
touch *MY* shit and ya'll gonna get clapped

but the issue here is that he was able to add me through battlenet some how, and when i deleted him he is still able to send me messages
---

RIP ROG monitor
---
Good luck out there!
---
Killing the same person more than 2 or 3 times who hasnt already offended you in some way I would consider  dirtbag move.  Would probably kos list them at that point.  Anything less than 4 kills or so is just good old pvp.
---
I can get behind that. Gnomes only.
---
"After all these years?"
---
You really trust Blizzard to keep the spirit of Classic intact while making design changes and content updates?
---
Keep in mind that content updates over the long term fundamentally demand earlier content be revised. If you add gear at a certain point the power delta between a geared 60 and a nongeared 60 gets too big and you have to rework old gear. If you add levels eventually the grind to max level takes too long and you have to change it. This is what happened the first time around.
---
Private servers did really well with launching fresh servers and merging old ones, I'm really leery of leaving that model behind.
---
You don't need macro for that, you can keybind marks directly in settings.
---
But if you really want to, or to combine with something like /target this should work
---
\` /script SetRaidTarget("target",8) \`
---
That will put the skull up, for other symbols just replace the number at the end (7 for X, etc.)
---
You get the axe, always. 2h fury is better for the Horde due to windfury, but you're fine either way.
---
The main context of this (from u/williampizza) chain is cleave dungeons. not the 'normal' way to run dungeons.
---
I think the egg is on your face but ya just aint gud nuff to no it.
---
To be fair, this is a timelapse, not a hyperlapse ;)
---
Go to you battle.net launcher and remove them? Iirc, a report doesn't mute or block anyone.
---
You could have been in a raid with just 5.
---
What did they whisper you?
---
sorry for a question, when is Bop and BoE? addon offten marks items in a bag with those words :(
---
that's a great response . are you defending your boyfriend or what? wasn't even talking to you... lol.
---
 [https://imgur.com/a/hx5POjM](https://imgur.com/a/hx5POjM)  theres no option.
---
The honor system should be in before most players are max level. That would be most similar to vanilla.
---
In the case of VE you do the healing by doing damage.
---
You can complete this quest alone which may help. Never leave the human form let the NPC kill everything. You will die to the skull mob just don‚Äôt release until you get credit. Tirion will come and kill all of them. Once you receive credit release from your body and turn it.

B.) which addon makes your mini map like that?
---
You look like an alliance character.  You must be a traitor.
---
It seems you are not feeling normal...:(
---
I always preferred /fist
---
Scalding Whelps in the northeast are good.
---
There is an option "add as battlenet friend" and I believe its enough to have you targeted to do so.
---
For the entire message thing I suggest reporting this to blizzard, open a ticket because he doesnt simply harass you, he even exploits the mechanic of battlenet to talk to the opposite faction.
---
I dont know if you can put him on ignore but did you tried this? Is it possible to ignore someone on battlenet?
---
That‚Äôs probably the dumbest reason to quit tbh
---
Ill take 50 quick arena/angerforge runs anyday over spamming rend for the damn mainhand. 
---
The ubrs gearfarm is byfar the worst imo.
---
Wait 1 more month and it should be much more alive
---
It's flooded now...who knows what will happen after they remove layering and people have lv. 60s.
---
not that many people lvl alts and there's a few people who hate farming. Also, a few drop their gathering prof/s (which they only have whilst levelling) and do double crafting. 
---
So, demand will increase whilst supply decreases.
---
At least, in general. We can make a guess based upon what normally happens, but it's not certain.
---
on the [battle.net](https://battle.net) launcher friends list is where i reported them, they were removed from my list but are still able to message me.
---
What level fishing do I need to be to fish there?
---
Grandma's chain knitted hat.
---
You get it when you're at it's level or complete ass it
---
Yes I remember having similar issues as a 13 year old nerd and now as an almost 30 yr old nerd it‚Äôs a similar issue. Maybe I‚Äôm the problem?
---
They should have done a query for "iconic" items in the game; selected a few, and provided an upgrade path for those items in TBC.
---
It has nothing to do with my dick; just ask your mom.  She'll tell you what I said then, and in WOTLK when I'd hung up raiding.  A landing zone upgrade that A:  Looks like someone stapled two rocks to a stick.  B:  exceeds an upgrade that took quite some time (Khorium goggles, for instance)...to obtain - if that's what they want to do, then there should be a way to keep them in the game, even if it requires more work than selecting a quest reward.
---
To Relegate Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros to a bank slot item is downright disrespectful.
---
When in doubt, just look up a good place to farm 1 or 2 levels under you. Until you get your berrings on a new place or hit the mark with your current ones.
---
The warriors struggle is real!  Some rare blues drop in SM that are worth 20g-90g on the ah
---
They aren't called OOMkin for no reason.
---
Def wasn‚Äôt a raid lol but I understand how it‚Äôs possible
---
And then what?  Autoattacked for 190 dmg against mail and a shield lol?
---
Meh you'll find trash on both factions
---
thats pretty fair.
---
What's the warlock wand/dance macro? I tried one but it would just never wand and only dance. Dont know if I needed some kind of delay or what.
---
Gratz! Full time nurse, wife, and two kids but I'm only level 30 lol. Keep up the good work
---
This is true, can attest to it
---
Seems like a bug then. Can you probably try to log into retail and check if said player is listed there? Or any other battle.net game.
---
Also, write a ticket and tell them you want this player removed and blocked.
---
I wasn't sure, but I appreciate the information. I have very limited knowledge of Warriors as I've never leveled one. I really want to level a warrior with the intention of going protection for raiding. Any advice for a new comer to the class?
---
I feel like Biggles has some really shitty people overall. My guild just decided to bail because of how toxic most groups have been. Kinda sad because there are a few great people on there, too.
---
Classic meme.
---
I‚Äôm honestly not sure. You could probably look it up online.
---
Mine was pretty high, 180-200+ at least, but I fished pretty consistently as I leveled. There are items that can boost your fishing for a period of time, or you could just fish the lower levels for a bit before heading up there if you are really low.
---
Will of the goddamn forsaken. Bane of my existence as ally lock
---
Ive looked and there doesnt seem to be an ignore list on battlenet, ive ignored their character in game but still able to message me through the bnet chat.  ive opened a ticket but it appears the wait time to be over 1 day, i just hope this person doesnt stalk  me through bnet zone to zone camping me for that long.
---
I mean, there‚Äôs a reason modern games all follow that model: because it IS the best method.
---
The reason classic is so successful is because of the loyal consumer base they‚Äôve built. The name it‚Äôs associated with and the nostalgia it brings. Classic is an unrealistic target for any other RPG in the world and simply won‚Äôt work. 
---
Nobody but the people who played classic are saying things like ‚Äúman it‚Äôs so good to not be able to fly everywhere and take 20 min walking from city to city‚Äù.
---
I highly doubt their new player acquisition numbers are astonishing.
---
I believe you can always disenchant everything, even with enchanting at 1. Isn't that why it's a very popular profession choice for bank alts?
---
Honestly, it sucks. You're crap until you get a windfury proc here and you go yay! But other than that, your attacks are pitiful.
---
Fairbanks FTW
---
They don't call it Vietnam Vale for nothing
---
To make sure it stays hostile while I was leveling in my mid 30s with a friend we would attack anybody and everybody.
---
Even killed a ?? warrior once feelsgood
---
Runs linux, doesn't apply.
---
The problem is that most of the times the good q rewards are from dungeon quests. Try to find a scholo grp on my server when you are not a Tank or healer.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve tried it a few times solo but it‚Äôs rough as a healer. The scarlet champion pack also can kill taelin, which causes the quest to fail. I‚Äôve had him die in front of me while in disguise. It seems super finicky
---
It's one of my favorite zones as far as asthetics goes but yeah it's bad
---
The only real problems here is noone got the Harry Potter quote/wordplay;)
---
I am thoroughly enjoying classic but I totally forgot how absolutely terrible everyone‚Äôs attitude towards loot is. We get new recruits coming into MC bitching that they can‚Äôt free roll on the Leaf for Hunter Quest or that the people that farmed rep for quintessences are given priority over some random dude that joined the guild 1 day ago.
---
Almost like the guy is just enjoying the game the way it was meant to be played, how ever he wants to.
---
Get over yourself man.
---
Lmao!
---
As a January baby, I can assure you that Emerald is not the birthstone. That would be Garnet. Or shitruby.
---
I would reroll, I made that same mistake 15 years ago... At some point I leveled a new character.

A mage would essentially have endless mana with AM or any AOE then - busted.
---
It still is on average a 11.1% mana discount to damage spells at max rank, which is very decent.
---
 People tank sober?
---
Did you even read what I wrote? I said the tank was drunk and he was using a 2 hander. He was talking random shit in chat and was just unfun to play with, so I left because it wasn't worth my time. I'm the last one to bother a noob tank. Learn how to read coherently.
---
I swore this wouldn't happen this time around. 
---
I'm literally on the same boat, of course.
---
Print Screen
---
OSRS is a good example.
---
... of how shitty something will get when you bring in QOL changes which weren't meant to be there.
---
Just play and be quiet about most things. Noobs don‚Äôt know shit, and they have no context to understand anything you tell them. Answer simple questions, let them figure stuff out.
---
Windfury doesn't affect a feral druid right?
---
I rezz at the graveyard and move on

and i told u to quit being a bitch... learn how to take advice correctly

I don't think it is.

Google what? Your wow character name? Your reddit name? Your unknown streaming name? Lmao I‚Äôd rather not waste my time
---
Aren't these things computed at random anyhow? Isn't it perfectly plausible the ninja would have gotten something completely different?
---
Indeed friend
---
Hit 40 with 91 today too. Enjoy!
---
We need more of this
---
Yeah, im 60 now and Ganking stv and SM. In Blackrock there is just Horde camping alliance (on our Server 65h:35a). Just feels satisfying
---
Wait which blues??
---
I‚Äôve checked around and garnet is the official birthstone but emerald is also associated with January.
---
Shift+1 through 6 are by default bound to cycling through the default action bars. Shift modifiers do not works if that button combination is already bound to something else in the options, maybe want to check and unbind that.
---
You're the one complaining here and insulting people, idk what your definition of bitch is, but it certainly ain't the same as mine "youngjay"
---
It will be solid after a lil' bit of licking.
---
If you want to hold threat roll a mage.
---
You get shield bash pretty early
---
Do mages make you cry in pvp as enh?
---
Try rfk, get to 30 get WW axe. Then start farming mount gold.
---
Hahaha
---
On Classic+ servers, maybe.
---
On the Classic Vanilla servers we have now, \#nochanges
---
this means you just didnt met a real ‚Äúdps spec‚Äù warrior. That was AWFUL. First: they have no mitigation. You have to heal them so often that u can forget about 5seconds rule. You will always have no mana and u need to sip ur water every free second. Second: You wont have alot of free seconds - such DPS bois dont want to wait, they came for a ‚Äúfast run‚Äù, so its hard as fuck.    
---
yeah , they are doing alot of dmg. But i think next time ill just pass on a dungeon run with such a tank. I wasted like 3 gold for a ZF run just on Water. 1 g on pots. And alot of nerves. Not worth it :(
---
I experienced another interesting take on this yesterday. Had two higher level players (55 vs 58) fighting (I was 51), the 55 player was winning and on my faction. The 58 player is running away and I felt that it was unnecessary to get involved since my faction was already having the upper hand there so I just rode past but slowly enough to check what was going on. Basically I "spared" the 58 player by not executing him when he was running for his life, felt that maybe he would at least appreciate that I didn't get involved.
---
Nope, he later came by when I was questing to gank me. Thanks I guess.
---
Why didnt you kill the dragonkins??? Silver AND skinning.
---
35-40 you'll make 60g if you save everything. You arent far behing.
---
I let my toon get rest while I played Rust. Good idea.
---
Is console port hard to set up? I've wanted to try it for awhile now.
---
60. Interlaced. When I splay my fingers and wave them in front of my eyes rapidly I hear purple.
---
Open a ticket.
---
yuup! my server too(blaumeux) constant horde camping blackrock instances, and stv constant ganking. so im like 58 right now and just decided to go have some fun with it. yeah man it felt soo good. Can't wait for honor to come out
---
there will be so much more when layering is gone
---
Same here, go up to the top level.
---
Notadog
---
I mean... it's a pvp server. I don't always kill horde, but world pvp all the time. You get got or you get them. Like he ruined your escort mission so you camped him for a bit. Seems fair to me.
---
Wrong on so many levels lol
---
Not if you're high level.  You can just run past them, and fish in the room with the sleeping dude.
---
Doesn‚Äôt look like a Shaman to me
---
Your chance to hit can't be higher than 100% so there's literally a point where extra hit chance does nothing. 
---
Your chance to miss against a raid boss is about 8%. Your first 1% extra hit is ignored or subtracted. 
---
This means you need a 9% extra hit chance to not miss against raid bosses. 
---
Go through your gear, enchants, talents and whatever else and add your extra hit percentage up, if it adds to 9 then your at the hit cap. 
---
If it's above 9 then your above the hit cap and everything above that isn't helping you.
---
Wrong
---
Lol no stop spreading misinformation when you have no clue
---
Cute!
---
Had the same happen to me with the chicken escort in hinterlands, only 1 got credit of 3
---
Where are the custom ‚Äú/emote %T‚Äù COMEON AMIGO
---
You‚Äôre acting like it‚Äôs elitist to not lick windows.
---
Of course you're playing a priest...
---
Thank you for the info. One thing that I'm a little afraid of is not playing enough to get the best gear for my warrior and falling behind/being a liability to my groups. Is that an issue I should worry about?
---
install spinx gathermate database, use gathermate's import function
---
loved this story !
---
This is some vanilla magic
---
Like what you did here, would be cool to.see every city.
---
... Yes, the first player to 60 did it in 3.5 days iirc. They didn‚Äôt sleep though. That‚Äôs still some serious fucking time.
---
I honestly don't see the point in doing these low level mob grinds, you're not leveling and the only thing you're gaining is short term gold. 
---
People are sleeping on fishing HARD in my opinion. i am lvl 48 and i've currently got 100g and bought my mount at 41. Fishing between 00:00 and 06:00 is a goldmine if you know what to cook and sell. Because i maxed fishing i've got a reliable means of moneymaking even at max level. Instead of short term gold farms like this one
---
Im 5 days 16hr to lvl 55. A guy who hasnt played WoW since wotlk and not even tryhard pushing. If I did more dungeon cleaves I would been 60 with this played.
---
yeah and as a result of this; the majority of mages you will meet are going to be mindboggling bad.
---
for instance, what do you do vs a ret/prot pala as a mage?
---
**get distance by using poly**; the best time to do this is by polying the pala, shooting em with frost bolts at range. and when he freedoms you poly again. after freedoms gone you use r1 frost bolt (to apply the 50% slow, and winters chill if your specd into it. and this is 1 sec cast time and cost little to no mana. it does basically no dmg) then nova into cone+fireblast. that right there will near kill most people sub 60. with more hp it becomes more difficult but 2500\~ hp is fairly standard for a lvl 60 mage atm. and if your specd into it (as you should be at 60) you could simply use CS's silence effect too get a free frostbolt or 2 instant casts off before the pala can dispell. 
---
im not going into this as there is more to the fight then that, but you get the idea.
---
the reason i went through all of that is because alot of mages dont understand the power of poly in a 1v1. in there mind, healing the target up is bad even if your being chased by someone using a free action pot/pala freedom.
---
this is a direct result of most mages only learning aoe strats.
---
what im saying is, if your a new mage...dont do spellcleaves. dont try and aoe mobs, play normally. because you need the practice. if your an experienced mage then its entirely ok for you to speed run to 60. but you gain nothing from hitting the lvl cap and being brain dead.
---
Im playin wow for 15 years and this is still my problem :D
---
That BiS carrot on a stick though
---
You are prepared.
---
Nah! When I was about 11yo in early 90s  a collectible game of trubo bubble gum spot cars pictures on fads was massively popular. 
---
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turbo_(chewing_gum)
---
Best players had massive collections and were considered local celebrities. Average amateur game started about 10 vs 10, while thouse "Pro" had sometimes up to 200 v 200 games with very rare cars in their "decks". Usually player could take up limit of to top 20-50 collectibles they flip per turn, other times winner took as many as he could flip.
---
So being a totally new to collecting game I got 3 brand new fad with one semi rare sport car on it. Eventually I mentioned about it in a class showing it and neighbour kid got interest in playing with me, but at my home. He came with about 37 collectible of his vs 3 of mine. After loosing about 5 times he started raising bets. 1 rare vs 5 common. He won about 4 times and I more than 10. 
---
So in the end he was broke of *paper bits with cars drawn on em* but asked me to lend him some to play back. After trying really hard he won his "debt" back, but my was he a sight. Sad kid full of anger and greed. For me it was just a competitive and fun game and I cared less for the winning, because I had only 3 fads to loose I started from. After loosing another small game he Zayed goodbye and went home with 3 common pictures in his pocket.
---
Did I get gambling addiction after that? No. The next day I went to his place and said I don't want to collect those things so it was a fun game and all, but he can have his pictures back. It was a short friendship of sort, but eventually he continued to play other collectible games while I was found of nintendo console video games at that time.

I got mine at 41, all good!

dunno, for me as a new player thats pretty funny :3 hehe.

What level were you all?

Did you just burst him down then, loot and vanish?
---
I wanna do this :D

Im leveling a mage, grinding when fully rested then stops. Want him 60 for P3 to PvP with.

No napping after 2pm, physical activity in the afternoon, big dinner, tv off 90 minutes before bed, all distractions put away, basically bore the kid to sleep. 
---
My guess he needs to be more active in the afternoon.
---
That's rad.
---
Lol, I thought I was getting old when I felt like playing with shades in Shimmering and Tanaris. Thanks for this!

My MMO mouse (Razer Naga) doesn't add keys. It just puts my numrow or numpad (I can choose which) on my mouse so I can do other things with my left hand.

Comes in handy with shooters like csgo as well, where 1 is your primary weapon, 2 is secondary, etc.

As someone who usually eats up this kind of garbage and asks for seconds it is the most boring isekai this season. Even the dumpster dire that is Arifureta is more interesting to watch than this show about teenagers literally spending their entire screentime going "But MOOOOOOOOOMMMMMM".

I tested it on Princess in Mauderon and I think you all are right, I missed just as much as if I was sober.
---
excuse me? shadow form means 15% more shadow dmg from any source. So, its a boost for shadow Wand too. -.- So, with max shadoweaving its 30% more dmg for a shadow wand. (but its more fair to calculate like 25% cause u are often not at 5 stacks of SWeaving)

As long as they dont nerf maces for rogues they can keep my 15 bucks a month
---
All 60s yesterday, but I did it today with 2 60s and a 58.  Helps that I am mostly in pre-raid BIS gear.  Everyone pops AR and BF.  Whoever gets aggro Evasions.  If Evasion wears off before boss is dead, that rogue vanishes.
---
You can kill him quick enough that you can loot and have combat drop before his adds show up, so you can just restealth instead of vanishing.
---
No just do the drain tank build 
---
The Problem with a multi-dot or a AOE Cleave is that you gonna have the aggro Everytime. Your only aggro reduce is your death. I played with the drain tanker build till 60 and then I switched to the DS+Ruin Build.
---
SM+Ruin Build could be good too because you have Nightfall/and your Imp but the Tanks on my realm can't handle a dot on every target unless it's a druid tank.

I love how people like you are quick to assume he's a bum to belittle him and take away his accomplishments. God I fucking detest people like you. "Nice but haha, get a job loser nerd!!", can't you just be happy for him rather than throwing the fucking jobless card? Who cares, for all you know he could be unable to work whether it's a mental illness or physical illness. Stop trying to tell people how to run their life. If he's a jobless bum then so what? How does that relate to WoW at all? Moron

Looks like you'll need at least 130 to catch anything, but 225 to not have any of the fish get away.

They're alliance in this video so im not fucking sure what to tell you.
---
I had a guildy help me collect charms, then a rando come out of their way to help me via LFG chat. After it was done, I offered to pay them for their services, but they denied my gold and said to pay it forward to help other Warriors when I reach a high level like he did.
---
Will do brother. I will honor the Warrior's Code üó°üõ°
---
It's nice, I can level with out it. I'm 44 with 184 spell power. Maybe shit is a strong word. Overrated might be better.
---
Yep , I could be raiding mc on my 50 rogue by now If I didn't decide to just level a shaman to 48 and then a hunter to 44. The worst thing is the Idea of rolling a tank warrior has already taken place in my head * insert spongebob "I don't need it" meme *
---
I also stopped at 53!!!
---
Try to watch SonyDigital won on classic duel tournament. Hes warrior and won good mages
---
Never happened to me. Out of curiosity after you close it open task manager and see if it's still running.
---
Nope.
---
No more than 2 levels away from the last boss is a good rule of thumb.
---
The label on your thumbnail for the macro will be red writing when you are out of range, and white whilst within range.
---
You have your phone number accessible through that link on your resume and cover letter just fyi.
---
Yep. Rough math. 10-12 days played to 60 at 4 hours a night is ~40 real days. I wouldn't expect a lot of people to be 60 until almost double that real time.
---
Wait untill you see an orc in tier 1 and can't wait to look cool like that aswell.
---
Ah thanks, but why are your name plates so modern looking? is that another addon?
---
No it isn't.  This has been a thing since vanilla.
---
Ive been 60 for 3 resets now and im working 40 hours a week.
---
But theoreticly youd only need 1 week to get a full t1 set.
---
While its probobly likely that hes been nolifing it, its by no means a requirement to get full t1 if you have a very weird loot council.
---
Bright cloth cloak
---
Currently player count is huge. If you just have at least decent gear and be level 60 you are guaranteed to get into raid. I am 52 currently and even it feels a little bit bad that my guild already farms MC/Ony and they have no room in core team, I know that I can still raid at some point.
---
In the end I do not envy people who are currently raiding. I am not saying this in negative way but those people clearly focus a lot (too much for me) into WoW. If you have family, full time job, hobbies there is no way you could be raiding right now. Even I do have all those listed things I have basically cleared my week end plans to play.
---
We are all going with our own pace. Just hang in there and eventually you will get to 60, get geared and get to raids. Also remember that next new raid doesn't come until phase 3. So we have P1 (who knows how long) and P2 time to run MC/Ony. We have so much time that people will already get bored killing Raggy.
---
Im working full time but i have no life. 16days played.

I‚Äôve tried playing classic with shadow pc on an iPhone, basically it doesn‚Äôt work. There‚Äôs no button overlay like this and I couldn‚Äôt get a keyboard to work. iOS 13 added mouse support so that works but it spins the camera around all crazy when you try to drag it.

It would be great if it had a touch control overlay or if you could use a damn keyboard

At 205 LW you can make the Nightscape Headbands. Crafting and vendoring those gives you about 7s per Thick Leather, compared to 3s for just vendoring leather.
---
Um, no. This old content was built in a time before garbage post process trash filters started ruining the visuals of games. It was never intended to have that overlayed on top of it. It looks more true to 2004 with this crap off.
---
I do have a few people that I have done with, including a few newer players (which i made notes about). Only a handful so far though.

Ally or Horde?

Those are Arcanum enchants from Burning Steppes, can be very expensive.

Every single thread has at least one of those. Also a "lvl 24 here but having fun lol" with 200 upvotes. I posted a picture of my Benediction to share my happiness as a first time priest main, got called a jobless nerd.

Have you tried talking to tge npc even though he doesn't show an exclamation mark? If you've outleveled the quest, he might not have an exclamation mark. Alternatively, look up what quests follow that one and check whether you did some of the quests

Because gnomes are dirty.

Collecting T1 has nothing to do with a huge time investment, the raids take maybe 2 hours a week.

Thanks for the advice, I will definitely have a look!

I believe very select mobs/bosses/elites have their leashes adjusted.

**Stanford prison experiment**
---
The Stanford Prison Experiment (SPE) was a social psychology experiment that attempted to investigate the psychological effects of perceived power, focusing on the struggle between prisoners and prison officers. It was conducted at Stanford University on the days of August 14‚Äì20, 1971, by a research group led by psychology professor Philip Zimbardo using college students. In the study, volunteers were randomly assigned to be either "guards" or "prisoners" in a mock prison, with Zimbardo himself serving as the superintendent. Several "prisoners" left mid-experiment, and the whole experiment was abandoned after six days.

Yes, as healer It can even be 3 or 4 levels. but as tank and dps 2 levels is good rule of thumb. Otherwise you will keep missing the mobs

Why is your druid speccing resto for dungeons if you're disc?
---
Uh don't tell about how much you work on here and not having a epic mount at lvl 60 yet! You just aren't using your time effective enough!!
---
For real tho, gz man. I hope that I will reach lvl 40 by end of this month. 34 at the moment :)
---
Did about the same yesterday, full time worker and parent. Great feeling.
---
I have a lvl 53, 2 level 30's 1 level 20 and a few 15 ish. I try very hard everyday to just stick to my main so I atleast get 1 level 60
---
Yeah you definitely could imo, especially if you are specced deep frost for ice barrier/block
---
Wtf is heirlooms?
---
The instance portal is a placeholder, in alpha/beta versions you would enter Hyjal from there

Logan‚Äôs the one hanging after that
---
I don't see a problem with it. People have been soloing "hard" content for years. You can still mess up, and she can windfury punch you to death in a split second, or throw rocks at you to stun you over and over... then punch you.
---
&gt;It has to be fixed or it will not last. We got the changes we did in TBC for reasons and we WILL end up getting them again, one way or another.
---
That's why thousands of people played private servers for years? Though I wouldn't mind TBC at all, and I agree it was a huge improvement. WOTLK is debateable and cataclysm would obviously be a mistake.
---
&gt; even if theyre not shown listed on my friends list i dont want to be listed on theirs
---
That's the odd thing here. Battle.net is usually a mutual thing. But yes, please keep us updated.
---
done 3 raids and still not seen a single druid piece. damn
---
Most likely you've already finished one or more parts of the quest. Look all stages of the quests up on wowhead, could be in Camp Taruajo, Stonetalon Mountains, etc.
---
I tried this with wand macro. Problem is spamming chat :/
---
Whaaat? I'm pretty experienced gamer and mobas are possibly the hardest thing to learn for me. There's so many characters, so many items and a pretty involved map, it's just far more complex than most games out there. Little in terms of transferable skills.
---
inquisitor has no bis for mages
---
Is there a way to /dance (and use other emotes) without it creating a chat message, so that I can do these sort of things without spamming chat and annoying those around me?
---
Ancient Bone Bow that drops from Sholomance is one of the best pre-raid bows available.
---
Where can I find my realm discord
---
Like unless you want to join apes or whatever classics method is it shouldn't matter
---
Completely depends on your specialization, professions, etc., and especially your skill-level. Go try it, work out a tactic for when you get stuck, and if you can't progress beyond some boss, come back a few levels later.
---
I think a better way to say it is unless you really want to perform the best possible in the game then race doesn't matter. 
---
Its not like what race you are is the difference between being able to level, do dungeons or raid and not being able to do anything.
---
Fight everything, loot everything.
---
Four words.
---
Spent 2 hours with another person helping with their quest. Would have taken less time if I knew my way around the dungeon more efficiently (it was their 2nd time being there).
---
I'm a level 38 warlock and have 110g. My professions are all nearly max level and I have purchased every skill. I have 3 other mates that I play with and we all agreed to stay within the same level range.
---
I spend a lot of time waiting for them to come online. However, I have had a lot of fun doing so :) I also like to remind them that I don't actually need to buy the mount.
---
You need iron grenades, FAPS and the frost reflector. Grenada them when they walk into dead zone, laugh spam their nova attempts and hope they don't sheep you till it's burnt and reflect their shatter combo if a Nova lands.
---
Just require that people who vote have a level 60 that has completed certain objectives from the most recent phase. Like when phase 6 comes around have requirements like "killed a boss in 4 wings of Naxx" or "compete on x amount of BGs" as prereqs for voting. Or even have the prereqs earn you an in game ticket that you can turn in for a vote, so people who play more get more voting power.
---
Four words. :D
---
Horde on Razorgore here, can confirm, nice server
---
Have track humanoids on and never let them get the jump on you
---
Missed opportunity
---
It is.
---
Smash kegs to spawn Hurly.
---
Talk to Ribbly to make him hostile and fight him.
---
Buy beer from barkeeper and give to Rocknut to fight Phalanax.
---
Attack barkeeper to fight him, turns entire bar hostile.
---
I think that's a bit excessive. It's hard enough finding a name not taken. If they are rping who cares what there name for the toon is.
---
Standard dps "But everything in the game is for meeeeeeee."
---
Thank you!
---
Me too, for 33s. Starting to wonder if that was a mistake though.
---
What do i need to buy?
---
Dang, Horde ganked his post. RIP.
---
When you boost someone sure, but what about twinks? They don't really want to get xp, even if they start it early levels.
---
Or you have a friendly lvl 60 guildie who kills the last boss for you a few times. Or princess boost where non stealth classes can paricipate. 
---
Sure it does not work and I think it's pretty clear why would have it been broken if did.
---
I'm trying to get one to 60 but the urge to make a second got too much so I caved and made a mage. then got bored and went back to my warlock. After partying up with a warrior a few times doing odd quests I now want to make a warrior. Which I will... Once I get my first ever mount in WoW.
---
[Been using this since I got it to drop back around level 38] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13045/viscous-hammer), will see if it takes me to 60 or beyond
---
Standing in many spots of that "Inn" doesn't grant the rested status.
---
Have you ever thought, maybe you‚Äôre just not very efficient in your play? Reaching 60 around 7 days played time is pretty average
---
The selfie camera from retail would completed the package.
---
A Gnome to boot, and a good name to boot! Seriously though, keep it up.
---
Did you also go to the Pet trainer instead of Hunter trainer?
---
After buying the skill you still need to teach it to your pet. Open your spellbook (P) and use the Pet Training ability
---
Meanwhile some streamers are almost at 10k gold
---
If you go through the trouble to comment why not make it as enjoyable as possible?
---
&gt; lvl 55 hybrid dps warrior with 80 dps 
---
How the fuck?
---
A lot of guilds decide to get one person full t1 at a time because the 8 piece bonus is so good. That way you don‚Äôt have 6 shamans with 3 or 4 pieces four months in.
---
It is an Inn, it's just fairly broken, you need to find a spot that grants the bonus and logout there.
---
I need this so hard :(
---
Just zone into SM during peak hours and ask in general chat rather than LFG. Once you have a group often people will want to run it more than once as the runs are so fast. As a tank you should get a group going quickly np. I did this from basically 32-40.
---
&gt; for Shamans, yes they do. Shaman Resto tree has % reduction in threat for healing spells.
---
Well, i dont see them as worth taking anyways (in raiding). If you get raid healing aggro, it means tanks and DPS are dead.
---
&gt; That's why thousands of people played private servers for years? 
---
There are MILLIONS of people playing Classic and Blizzard will want to keep it that way. 
---
Having thousands of people playing a game does NOT mean it is desirable enough for a company to maintain a status quo with, especially when they could inflate or maintain a much larger player base if they updated or otherwise invested in the game.. 
---
Blizzard is a business and it will approach WoW Classic AS a Business.
---
Players are as they have always been and once they start getting bored, they will (rightfully) want changes and new content.
---
The idea that a meaningful amount of people would stay subscribed for a game that never changes is absolutely silly, especially when there are and will always be free alternatives to that same product.
---
Of course you are. You cant make use of none of those added stats and the item is clearly not intended for a rogue, well deserved kick from group.
---
I have to agree and hope they‚Äôll reconsider. 
---
The player base has already conquered so much in phase 1 with no sign of phase 2 yet. Then also consider that many expected this gap between phases to be the shortest of them all. Phase 5 won‚Äôt be here for a long while.
---
Done all of those, only reds left. Guess ill do some instances for a couple of levels as someone recommended. Cheers!
---
I have one kid and hit 42 yesterday, am I bad at leveling :(
---
Which skill or item does this?
---
Keep your Fade up to date, the rest is fluff.
---
If you need to drop threat, stop attacking, stop healing and fade, make sure the tank is aware of the situation (either mention in chat or walk the mob up to the tank if they're far).
---
It is Seed of Life. I was gonna turn it in but ended up in winterspring. Then I felt too bad to go back there after slaughtering all those furbolgs.
---
What's that mod that shows rare seen in your chat box?
---
Some people value a quick sale, finding a buyer for 200+ seems like it would take a while.
---
Teach it with beast training. Learn it from pet trainers.
---
I planned for awhile and took time away from responsibilities for the first 2 weeks. Hit 60 at the end of day 8 by playing 17 hours a day, 30-60 was done with a spellcleave group that synced our sleeping schedules. 
---
Dropped to about 14 hours a day after the leveling grind, took about 10 days to get full pre-BIS and epic mount. Think my total is about 20 days /played. 
---
This is all to say that I've more or less beat Classic P1. I feel no addiction or obligation to play, I just log onto raid or do some solo Maraudon for gold at my leisure. I've done MC/Ony for every lockout and have 3 T1 pieces and 2 additional epics. 
---
I paid the price up front to be on the cutting edge because once you're there, you have to commit very little time to stay there. I can play 2 hours a day or 13 hours a day and it makes little difference for the next 2 years.
---
did it? this sub has been salty for months about layering and it‚Äôs ‚Äúabuse‚Äù even though it really only had one major issue. then they were salty about the number of servers even though that got worked out. before that it was how blizzard didn‚Äôt let the entire fan base into the beta because they were jonesing to play. 
---
not to mention all the saltiness over an LFG addon that essentially congregated all the chat channels into one simple place where you don‚Äôt have to advertise and read chat for 40 mins because of the dumbass #nochanges mentality. or how blizzard had the AUDACITY to charge people their membership early to reserve names as a way of seeing server population and demand. 
---
right now we are on the mages are tards phase and next it will be how blizzard isn‚Äôt releasing the phases quick enough because the sweaties who complain about all this other shit that doesn‚Äôt matter are ironically bored with the game they told everybody they wouldn‚Äôt be good enough or dedicated enough to maintain playing. 
---
the best reason to browse the sub is to be entertained by the overreaction and drama. if you‚Äôre here for actual discussion and debate about things classic related you‚Äôll just get mad at how bad the hive mind is and end up frustrated yourself despite having no complaints before coming here.
---
I don't use clique, but with stock macros I just hover nothing and it self casts.
---
Unfortunately druid DPS really is abysmal if you aren't using it. It's not on par with other consumables as it's far more important.
---
The point of the statement isn‚Äôt at what stage it‚Äôs about building on an older code base based on democracy. In case of runescape 2007 because that‚Äôs the earliest version they had available. For wow 1.12 because it was the most stable I guess? Your comment is irrelevant to what OP is saying.
---
True, but he only needed to roll 1 higher than him, which was a 1% chance in this case.
---
Yeah i downloaded it immediately, great addon.
---
Every addon that changes the roll window has this issue. Elvui, Tukui for example do.
---
I refuse to provide an answer until you say sorry for using the stupid word "spellcleave" instead of aoe. 
---
Cleave is an attack that hits targets in an arc once per cast. Aoe affects an area for a length of time hurting anything moving into that range on tick. Using dots on multiple targets is just target swapping. 
---
The closest thing to even fitting the name spell cleave would be a mages cone of cold.
---
Who the hell started this stupid new name for aoe in th3 first place?
---
North cave in stv is freaking great for farming. Got like 40k xp an hour as an level 38
---
We need to go full sci-fi and have a company teach an AI to create and manage this sort of stuff.
---
Leave the major content to humans, e.g. raids, legendary/artificat level items, major lore... well.. up until the AI has learned to surpass humans in creating and managing all gameplay aspects.
---
Then when full body VR is released the AI can go rogue and trap us in the game just like in the simulations.
---
That's Game Over for a lot of casuals leveling on the wrong side of a pvp server faction imbalance. I don't think Blizzard wants to lose those players. Though given how poorly they have launched I guess I wouldn't be surprised. 
---
And they need to figure out what they are doing about layering before they can announce Phase 2. They said it would be gone before then.
---
This is a good way to drive people in your party insane with the spam :P
---
Rogue‚Äôs distract ability
---
Just keep questing, you'll make it in no time.
---
Just play whatever race-class combination you want. I used to crack my head over this too but in the end, you're gonna spend alot of time with your toon, so might as well play whichever you like. Its your game.
---
I've got a level 60 and a level 15 and I work 48 so get on my level.
---
You could test this by leveling an alt to 20 and then get locked out in Deadmines/Wailing Caverns with your main then see if you can enter with your alt. &lt;-- Then post here if it is succesfull or not, for info purposes :)
---
I'm not sure, but you know what's amazing if you're farming low level mobs? Magic Absorption. You resist a ton of their casts and they basically feed you endless mana.
---
So you start the fight with 30 rage for sweeping strikes huh?
---
/pat
---
Nice my dude!
---
Yeah as a rogue you just need to impress others with your competency in earlier level dungeons, make friends with tanks and invite them to your own runs..profit. I‚Äôm level 53 rogue and have killed emperor 3 times already due to what I mentioned above
---
Wanna play soggy biscuit with me??

Parrot in the oven
---
Nah mate, what you do is you fight 10 people and eventually one shot windfury proc one of them and instantly forget the other 9 people who wrecked you whilst you autod them.
---
It is fun though, but it's slot machine the build.
---
Remember in later expansions going to IF and it be like 2-3 people there. So fun to see them full again and having a purpose!
---
Locks are mandatory in Spell cleave, what are you talking about?
---
What is this inspect add-on? And if it's a whole UI thing, can I use it strictly just for the inspect?
---
Why is it surprising that he sided with his guildie? People don't care about ninja-ing as long as you're not screwing over people in the guild. That has been the 1 rule that has been consistent through all the guilds I've been in.
---
He said "anyone" not "everyone"  By pure # of items dropped it is impossible to have everyone as geared as myself for this example but you're wrong in the appeal of "everyone should use dkp to avoid these situations"  All the shamans in my guild didn't care for tier and I mainly focus on PVE (they focus on PVP) therefore it makes sense to give the guy who is dedicated to PVE the PVE gear
---
Lol, almost the same here.
---
Feel like I'm no-lifing this shit 'cause I'm gaming almost every day and I'm fucking level 29 with 11 gold in his pocket.
---
So you both need either a raid group or players that are much lower to get some kills in open pvp? That's an interesting coming out
---
Looks like I won‚Äôt be doing it then, lol.
---
Flair checks out.
---
That screen is way too expensive to have a feral druid attack it.

0 mouse movement required. You basically go back to the to low as f resolution and zoom in hardcore. Mouse stays centered. And of course its not allowed but that doesn't stop this gem from working and so far being undetected. Or ateast I'm not using it enough for blizz to ban me...

Ask your guild, if it really matters to them that you hold off your epic mount to min-max then sure go ahead.
---
The epic mount is a huge quality of life improvement.
---
I looked into this a few weeks ago. I think the answer is 1.3 doesn‚Äôt support this... someone else can confirm. Not sure when it will be available. 
---
Also: I share your pain. Sorry!
---
Hell no, if classic+ is to be a thing, it 100% needs to be on a separate server.
---
I see you, life is suffering as Buddhist might say. WoW is life
---
Cute ! Did she accept ?
---
Yay! Got sick of Peggle lol.
---
First fight was good, second one was a mounted level 59, not much of a competition when you have an end-game trinket. Overall a majority of the fights were against level 60s so it's still much better than a lot of the shit posted here. good job.
---
Basic and boring + those ppl play really bad(rofl on gnome mage)
---
Is the suggestion data still buggy? I liked auctioneer. But I feel like aux does decent job and runs a bit smoother.
---
This worked! Thanks!
---
Absolutely true, and I've met some who've said they're new to the game who have done solid DPS while providing good support and been great team players. Mage is a fantastic class in the right hands. 
---
It does seem like whenever you get someone truly awful it's very likely to be a mage at the moment though. It's not at all helped by the max XP/hour AoE cleave culture that clashes with any group that isn't set up for or wants to AoE cleave. It also doesn't help that mages have so many ways of being annoying, from instant AoE aggro steals, mass pulling, not buffing and decursing, getting the healer killed by frost novaing mobs next to them etc etc. Like, if a rogue is playing badly I probably won't even notice, but a mage can be a massive pain in the butt for the whole group in a whole lot of ways so you really notice when they're being terrible.
---
Shit man 5hrs per day is not hardcore? There is my problem then, my view is very skewed.
---
You're already not getting this shot as it was. Everyone keeps saying the content is being cleared so fast because people sucked back then. Hardly anyone talking about how all the items are in their final, fully power crept forms. Mechanics might be the same, but the gear is not, and, effectively, neither is the game.
---
Apparently that guy is a vagetable.
---
Not weird to fully complete a healers 8/8 bonus when it is good
---
Where is it from. Ive seen the phrase on reddit alot. But not somewhere else
---
Look at the nameplate.
---
I think the biggest issue is that you need to run it a billion and a half times for Ironfoe.
---
*Every day*? Just how
---
Fuck the biggleworth boyz
---
Why not? I expect phases to be 3-4 months at most, probably 3 tbh, wouldn't be shocked to see it mid November.
---
You can always adjust your pricing.  Reserve all green BOEs and the first orb and then go up/down from there.
---
For supper? Bad dog!
---
You're a moron if you think ele is trash in PvP.
---
I have a high limit on putting people on ignore, so when you get on that list, i have a pretty clear opinion about the person getting banned.
---
Example. We were in Strat, we had a L57 mage, at last boss with melee group. We wiped getting there few times with triggerhappy dps etc. Still nobody seems to be pissed. Wipe on last boss, im healing my ass off. But 3 melees in boss aoe, some cleave etc i just go oom (with pretty damn good gear).
---
Rogue goes to repair his weapon. At this stage the mage whispers to me, FUCK YOU and leaves the team. I whisp to him to ask wtf is he talking about, im already on ignore. I wasnt group leader, nobody was removing him, he just snapped, left himself and put me on ignore. I didnt even talk to the guy, i kept wondering what the fuck happened there.
---
Thats a guy i put on ignore myself. Either hes a mental case, or whispered the wrong guy and put me on ignore. The group lead said that the mage had whispered him the whole run, about the loot he could get and the mob he wanted to kill.
---
This made my day! Thanks.
---
It's not about Shadow Guard being bad, it's about Devouring Plague being good.
---
You should have disenchanted it in front of him

No, as a large amount of the specs in vanilla really stink. A talent revamp more akin to the talent trees in TBC where they address the weak points of the different talent trees would be far preferable to just adding another talent tree.
---
A big issue I see with adding a 4th talent tree on top of the existing talent trees is I think it would be difficult for them to make the 4th talent tree as weird and bad as most of the vanilla trees are. Adding a 4th talent tree without revamping the existing talent trees would run an extremely high risk of just having the 4th tree be the best tree by a good margin for the majority of classes.
---
Never heard of a rogue needing on a lockboxe, the game also has areas with trash lockboxes for all the way to 300 in the open world
---
I don't get it, why the reference to Logan Paul? Did he hang himself?
---
The best way to get out of combat with a Frost mage is easy: strip down to remove all stamina gear so you die faster.
---

Dwarves and Undead priests always stare each other off knowing they can't fear their way out of a confrontation.
---
I'd love to see a retail comparison time lapse.
---
Yeah I did BRD 51-57 and LBRS 57-60, made those levels a breeze and instead felt bit sad hitting 60 cuz could no longer get shit ton of XP while getting my BIS gear.
---
Getting one big level every 4-5 hours + nutty gear + ton of money was dope.
---
Please no. This sounds far too similar to both the Legion Legendries and Diablo 3. I absolutely don't want that.

It feels like wasted effort to me if I level a character than lose that character in a realm restart. If they reset everyone's progress than I would quit.
---
The main reason people ALWAYS pick the axe is because it's the slowest of the 3 weapons at 3.60 speed. Slower = better for warriors. Bigger hits. Bigger Overpowers. Bigger Heroic Strikes. Bigger Deep Wounds. Bigger Sweeping Strikes. Bigger everything. Slower = better in almost all cases.

Shhhh I do this too, delete this post now
---
The presence of danger also gives texture and meaning to otherwise routine quests and excursions. When you're off the road taking on enemies, you always have to keep an eye peeled for something wandering up on you from behind. You monitor your food and bandage usage to determine how to use your resources. You make estimates of whether you should take on the next enemy or sit and eat to be safe.  
---
Retail dungeon and raid content is definitely far harder, but a lot of it ends up being possible without thinking. In classic I'm always thinking.
---
I have bound the slot where the pet attack skill is to Y on my keyboard. Works fine for my lock, should work for a hunter, too.
---
Nah, he hanged someone in "suicide forest" and then pretended to stumble upon the body.
---
The amount of mages I have seen using blizzard for 2 mobs is absurd.
---
May you die alot, inferior horde filth. Fuck you. XoXo A human on the same realm.
---
Booty bay
---
But that's in TBC, which basically is Classic+ in a way.
---
I think they should focus on stuff they never managed to release to WoW at all, like the Dragon Isles, the Emerald Dream or Azshara Crater.
---
There are precisely _zero_ warriors in this video

For any future broken tooth campers, just set a simple eagle eye macro with target broken tooth. you can check all three spawn points within seconds, afk and check again

This is great any more charts like this for other creatures?

He went to the suicide forest in Japan and actually seen someone hanging. 
---
Instead of stopping his video he continued, and throughout it was being really disingenuous and an overall shitty human about the whole thing.
---
Damn that‚Äôs 26 kids per wife!
---
This is something to reminisce in when the game is dead for the second time. Whenever that will be.
---
Much oof
---
This isn't remotely true, for one yellow yields higher XP/hr unless you struggle with them (rogues shouldn't have a problem with them).
---
Questing yields vastly more experience than grinding mobs, but they're limited and you need to really plan your travel if you want to keep your efficiency up.
---
Metaphorically yes.
---
I always made a hunters mark macro with /petattack or whatever the command was
---
Ok but that‚Äôs a lot different then ‚Äúliterally nothing of use from troll racial in pvp‚Äù
---
I don't attack other druids. I'll just /lick them and be on my merry way. So far one horde druid felt the need to violate the code and got me.  
---
In addition, in true Druid fashion I haven't killed a single critter
---
The good news is it stacks up faster the higher level you get. 
---
I think I had about 50g when I hit 40. I managed to accumulate the rest of what I needed by 43 and earned enough additional by 45 to catch up on my skill training. And I'm just a lowly holy priest who doesn't play the AH.
---
Don't buy stupid crap off the AH. Don't spend money on professions. Don't purchase any skills or skill ranks you don't really need. Vendor aggressively. Also, dungeons can be a reasonable source of income. A few gold/day, at least.
---
Felwood! that's what i did
---
I have mouse wheel up as attack and mouse wheel down to pull it back
---
Time to roll a tank/hybrid that can tank, then? :)
---
I think it's just the nature of having such an enormous guild (think they were capped like 2 weeks in) so they don't generally give a fuck about anyone but their own guildmembers.
---
As a mage, I agree wholeheartedly
---
So you agree to reserve and then ninja? That makes you the asshole.

I‚Äôm not sure what server you‚Äôre on, but blemeux horde has an absolute ton of level 60s! My guild is so large we are forming a second MC raid squad

I also read it as this, and was aware of this section before making the topic.
---
I just realized some people actually care about this. I have a custom emote bound to my power word: fortitude cast, and I usually buff random passerbys, or everyone in the area if I'm on a Zeppelin, etc., And had someone tell me to fuck off the other day... Like oh no, sorry to clog your chat log, I'm sure you had so much important stuff to keep track of in there while waiting on the Zeppelin....
---
IRL drinking and tanking is fully endorsed for players over &lt;insert your locale's legal age here&gt;.  How else does one deal with losing threat to windfury?
---
/challenge
---
As a 34 rogue I've bought weapons twice and it made leveling so much easier. I also bought three armor items, but those were so cheap it costed me less than 10s if you calculate in vendor price when I replace them.
---
However, the weapons are like 1g each so make sure you can miss that - I'm currently at 60g with all professions high already so not too worried about not hitting the 100g at 40. Don't do it if you don't expect to have money left at 40
---
You can die.
---
üòÖ Sorry for letting the secret out.
---
Do you use Chrome Remote Desktop for it?
---
What do you mean by blocking NPCs?
---
do you use passive to pull back pet?
---
Whether it was staged or not, those suicides really happen, and the way he went about it was still disrespectful.
---
Heard nothing but bad things about that server.
---
I made an "emote grid" using the numpad buttons for each emote and then ctrl, shift and alt modifiers for positive/negative/neutral emotes.
---
Until I realized that I couldn't afford to lose 4 out of my 10 action bars as a druid.
---
2h keeps better aggro, dummy. It‚Äôs only bad if healer can‚Äôt keep him alive.
---
mhh good idea can you do combat with pet attack?
---
Funny, usually Horde players try to gank Alliance players, lose on 1v1, cry and call for backup, gank the Alliance player.
---
I have multiple level 30s.  Alt-a-holic.  For real.
---
Whats happened to him now? Last i heard from him was a collab with Summit, which clearly didnt do so well (for Summit at least)
---
It isn't a terrible choice, it's just that Orc's racials are OP.
---
Controlling your pet can be a little bit overwhelming in certain scenarios. I highly recommend binding scroll up to have your pet attack and scroll down for follow, while keeping it in passive at all times. Practice kiting with concussive shot and aspect of the cheetah (once you get it), practice weaving auto-shots while you move away from your target. Hunter is a very fun class to master.
---
tldr; hardcore players might point out your choice of race, but it wont hinder you from any pvp/pve content, so don't worry.
---
Don't move. Do not mo-ve!
---
My joke was about him killing a person but whatever.
---
Oh fuck ya! didn‚Äôt know this
---
I'm sorry, the hashtag you want is #gnotallmages, this is #notallmages.  Please check your privilege.
---
You need to be in the bosses aggro list, so fucking wand it once as a healer. After that you can just run away from him if you like until the npc comes.
---
This is extremely relevant. I find it hard to belief that just anyone would drop their integrity though.
---
There is an AddOn that records splits per level on one character, I know Quin used it when leveling 1-60. Don't know the name of it though...
---
I actually like using a fel hunter because its main attack doesn‚Äôt use mana like lash of pain does. Sure it‚Äôs less DPS, but it definitely gives me more mana. 
---
A bonus is having it in dungeons with lots of casters or curses.
---
yeah,i know :D well,i wasted like at least 10 hours on roleplay,so you can understand how im powerleveling :D Also i like helping low lvl players :(
---
Forgive my ignorance but what's so special about this pet?
---
ruining the shatter for mages everywhere :(
---
You can try /petattack [combat] but I'm not sure if it accepts conditionals.

My question is how does +healing work as a stat? I know it says "Increases damage and healing done by magical spells and effects by up to 21." But how do I know to what extent it affects my healing spells?
---
Like does my healing wave now heal for 21 more? And what about my chain heal (I heard somewhere that move will not receive the full benefit of the +healling, so would be closer to a +15 healing buff added to my chain heals) but overall I just don't know how it works.
---
&gt;3 months to do MC + onyxia
---
I don't think you know what phase 2 is.
---
Phase 2 doesn't change MC and onyxia being top end. It just introduces Dire Maul and world pvp and world bosses.
---
There are 6 phases. If they took 6 months between phases it would be 2.5 years before Naxx was released and people would spend a full doing MC, then another full year doing BWL. That would be a ridiculous schedule that would have raiders bored out of their minds.
---
3-4 months is much more likely as they would get Naxx out in about a year and a half. That would also put phase 2 right around christmas.

Lol and there lies the charm in the classic experience. I love it
---
- Priest
---
Loved playing this in vanilla, it was my main. Loved Shadow PvP and healing in dungeons/raids as Holy/Disc. Fun and diverse class. 
---
- Warrior
---
My main during BC, probably my favourite class in the game because I love tanking and there‚Äôs nothing more satisfying than getting an MS crit - although I‚Äôve never played Fury. Love tanking and being easy to get groups. 
---
- Hunter
---
Played one in vanilla to around 30, can be an annoying prick in PvP with the feign/trap, I like the pet aspect of it and it is super easy to level
---
Been playing the game since launch and I‚Äôm struggling to pick a main. I originally rolled a Warlock in another server, which is fun but I don‚Äôt want to put more time into it until realm transfer has arrived. 
---
I rolled Horde on the server I‚Äôm on as a Warrior and Mage which got up to around 20, but I really don‚Äôt enjoy Horde. 
---
The game is here forever so I don‚Äôt feel I‚Äôve wasted time or anything, but really need to focus on just one class
---
Blackcrow for Warriors, Hunters, Rogues, Skyshroud Leggings for all clothies, Rosewind Circle for healers. This is only the 3 first bosses. For full runs there are also some items but it's less exciting, mainly Gloves of Power for clothies (and healers). Bleak Howler Armguard for resto druids.

Thats a classist argument and an overused trope. Certain elements of society are unaccessible to the working class and those who are discriminated against such as people the black community or people with disabilities. Lack of transportation, poor public infrastructure, illiteracy and non-English speaking, prison records and racial profiling, lack of quality schools or businesses and food deserts are just some of the many issues that prevent working class people, especially in urban areas, from "working hard and getting a 6 figure job through grit and sweat". Not only does this effect communities in cities, in rural regions that were dependent on singular companies for town economy the opportunities have closed up. Mining or forestry industries, manufacturing. All disappearing as the elites move their production overseas to be able to exploit cheap labor and lack of regulation in Asian countries. And all of these communities have similar threads in having worse economic outcomes, lower access to healthcare, lower life expectancy, greater illiteracy, lack of healthy food. The list could go on. Maybe there were other factors that prevented your mother from "working hard". Perhaps she had a family to provide for, perhaps she was dependent on the income and didn't think she could afford/time for education/training, perhaps she felt reliant on the benefits. I don't know your life, but a singular personal anecdote is a pretty piss poor counter argument when there is a plethora of data and studies demonstrating how being born in the lower class and coming from single parent or low income homes and low access to education leads to lower economic outcomes. People have been talking about this for decades.

It was a bit of a walk, but you went through something much more challenging today. So if our visits help in any way to ease your sorrow, then they are well worth the time.

That‚Äôs an entire different reason tho

Guru - undead priest catch me if u can
---
These are my favorite posts! Good on you!
---
Not 100% sure but I believe it's a % of your +healing. If say your healing wave heals for 100, then the actual healing amount it would do with gear would be 100 + (x% * 21)
---
Quest rewards really start to get lucrative around then. Most quests give like 50s and the item rewards start to vendor for nearly a gold in the late 30s.
---
I've gotten to the point where, as an enchanter, I have been vendoring most of my unused greens. The cash is just too hard to pass up. Most of the time, it would be cheaper just to buy mats on the AH.
---
The only wep with 80 DPS a warrior can wield at the moment, is Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros.

My minions can Yolo most things that would attack me while AFK.

---
I have 69 jobs, 420 kids and i just hit ((__) with 1111D gold in the bank.
---
Is there even a 80dps weapon in the game yet?
---
No, I think they see "x does some weird gestures" or something like that.
---
Yeah my bad I was mistaken to claim he said everyone. However I stand by what I said about tier one set. Besides the MT there's no reason to prio t1 to anyone. The content is too easy to make it a priority. 
---
When that changes , my opinion on which loot system is best will also change. If BWL is (hopefully) challenging in comparison to MC , I'm all for gearing the best player of that class first especially if it's making a clear impact on the raid's success.

However, that isn't the case for tier one or MC. It can be cleared efficiently without being even full prebis, it's a joke. There's really not much reason to funnel gear at  this point in time, especially because of how long phase one looks like it will be. I'll be surprised if we seek BWL before spring 2021. That's a loooong time to get everyone full t1, idk if I'd even wanna be in your position tbh , you're not gonna get any new upgrades for literally 5 or more months :( gunna be kinda boring
---
It is easy to fail there if you asspull additional packs/ let mobs run and aggro more. Do that few times and corpse run back and there goes hour or two.
---
Mount. If you love to pvp it will help you chase ppl down. Also going slow sucks.
---
ShadowedUnitframes
---
Just do what's fun for you, it's the only way to live life honestly. If you're stuck worrying about what other people say is good or bad, you'll never get anywhere because the truth is that there is no general consensus.
---
We've all got our own niche to carve out, and if your niche is playing as an anthropomorphic bison that somehow manages to fire bows with hooves for hands then all the more power to you.
---
Don't worry about them! I guarantee you they work a 9-5 retail job and think they're better than everyone here cause they work a job while still being level 30 running around STV lmao
---
Yeah compare gold and iron ores to greens potentional blues. Absolutely the same.
---
I picked up Tailoring for the first time. I always thought it's nice and simple because linen cloth everywhere. Yesterday morning I had to farm Gnolls in Elwyn for like half an hour so I could even lvl it up to be able to spend all my money on couple useless recipes to advance. But it's kinda fun so I'm not regretting.
---
hahaha - this was me and a buddy last night. We would sap and moo, or flirt or lick and then vanish if they came at us or just stealth if they scattered. Pretty funny given we were outnumbered 3:1 or more also.
---
probably but distract doesn't aggro guards
---
It might help to know what helm you are upgrading from.
---
I managed to finally get Blanchards Stout last night. I got super lucky, and it's a hammer that means a lot to me, being an old friend of mine's weapon way back around 2005 (Rest well, my friend).
---
It's a weapon that bears great sentimental value to me... but you know what? For a 47 Human Warrior, that had a friend that enchanted it with Greater Impact? THIS THING IS AWESOME! I literally freaked out when I got it. It felt so good!
---
Getting rares, winning rolls, being able to SEE and FEEL that your character upgrades and becomes more powerful... God, I missed this! GEAR -MATTERS-!
---
The 8p should be fucking amazing. Dont think of it as -80%, think of it as +24% increase to your main single target heal (when in raids it will jump to near targets). That you get mana back (\~9%) with 5p bonus. First bonus is LITERALLY 1 talent point in resto, they dont stack.
---
If you spam like rank 4  healing that does something in the 600-700 range, its now effectively doing 744-868. Using that spell with 3.0s cast time you get \~86% of +healing, so if you wanna transfer the extra oomf to +healing stat, its about +181 healing in optimal, no overhealing situation.
---
Holy fuck they are awful. Why didn't the shaman immediately ankh and shock you, I wonder?
---
No.
---
you might have cured my trinket headaches.
---
Ngl actually laughed out loud and annoyed my roommate
---
Chests despawn minutes after being looted the first time whether or not anything was taken, simply looking at the contents will cause it to despawn after 2-3 minutes.
---
Found this out the hard way whilst managing my invent to make space for stuff after looking inside a chest to see if anything good was in there.
---
Its perfectly reasonable...
---
As other people have said, a great way to save money is to not buy skills.
---
Example, a frost mage *can* use fireball, but why would they? All of your talents are going into frost, so just buy those spells. 
---
Obviously, other spells like Fire Blast and Arcane Explosion are still useful and worth buying, but it always pays to think before you buy. 
---
For new players, you may not know immediately if a spell is useful. Doesn't hurt to buy the first one. If you find yourself using it a lot, keep upgrading! If it seems to be only of very limited use, wait to upgrade.
---
Nice.
---
Nope, this is how you ensure you're never gonna hit 60. I have one alt Warrior, but I made him after I hit 60 on my Priest.
---
But if you enjoy this sort of thing, go for it.
---
Well done sir
---
Yeah idk I‚Äôm not a mage, just see Ven and Zico rocking the full set
---
Yes but the general economy will make prices overall go up. I saw these selling for 800g+ heading towards the release of BC, because people had lots of gold to throw at alts.
---
In Vanilla i Player an orc hunter which besides the 5% more pet dmg also has no benefit for hunter in PvE. Those 5% are worthless in vanilla anyways. Only troll has meaning full racials for a hunter in PvE.
---
The taurens warstomp can be quite helpful in PvP situations and sometimes even in 5 man instances. So play what ever you feels best to you.
---
On a sidenote male troll hunter have the coolest bow shooting animation.
---
Google
---
Off the top of my head I‚Äôd guess 30.
---
Declawed cat?
---
Not cute.
---
Yeah.. I have been DEing everything to level enchanting but was at like 13 gold at level 33. Then I checked AH and now I feel a tad stupid :)
---
Depends, 20 grilled squids go for 6-8g during peak raid times on our server.
---
I don't have the number, but I'm pretty sure I can get up to 30-40 squids per hour when fishing in Bay of Storms.
---
If you get really lucky you can get some good pearls and depending on the amount of stonescale fish you get, it's pretty good GpH, especially for healing\tanking spec characters.
---
Where is /spit
---
Lol what do you mean? I purposely wrote something contested to bait out more answers. Win/win.
---
Right that explains it. This is the 4th or 5th time i've seen her posted now
---
I hit 40 yesterday, have been buying stuff like cloth semi-regularly on the AH, have most of my skills trained. Tailoring at 200, enchanting at 205 and I still have 15g left after getting my mount.
---
It's good to be a Warlock, haha.
---
Sunder, sunder, sunder till you have 5 on the target then keep sundering. 
---
I tanked as arms till 60 and pretty much just cleave and whirlwind one I had it with a 2h. Almost always had at least one mage who could frost nova mobs in place for me.
---
To me epic mount was the first priority. Feral druid money using order was epic mount -&gt; warden staff -&gt; breastplate of bloodthirst. So similar items as you in terms of how great they are, but being fast with mount still seemed like the necessity. I hate going slow.
---
I have there really isn't a guide for tanks at this level for RFC or classic in general.
---
&gt; 5 invites within a minute
---
Considering how rare they are, I'd say 5 in the first 30 seconds :p
---
As for not getting raid spots, to be fair, there ARE some guilds rising up all the time. I don't need to be in a guild trying to achieve world first, it's enough that eventually we'll clear the raid content. For me it's the content that's the most important part, I'm not concerned with being the best or part of the best guild. Heck, the best guild are probably *very* rigorous, and I am not looking for that kind of stress (plus I can't commit the kind of time that hardcore guilds need. I thankfully got a job I got to wake up for in the morning).
---
My buddy was in guilds of this sort, and to hear him talk....nah, *leagues* too much commitment. He was an officer in that guild and made sure everyone was up to snuff. I really don't have time for that kind of stuff, and I'm not even married.
---
Play Horde and you'll have people from Alliance ganking you lol
---
The priority gearing not mattering is true, but it's not like the other shamans also aren't getting upgrades.  We've gotten something like 16 shaman tier pieces (across all slots) and many other pieces.  I knew going into this I wasn't going to get upgrades after getting tier, I was just lucky that I got all 8 pieces this quickly (4 lockouts). BWL will 100% be out in 2020 btw.
---
Yes, also I think the coefficient(the x%) changes depending on the spell. I know some spells have higher coefficients than others.
---
You should already have the core toolkit.
---
Spam sunder armor, and use Revenge when available. Revenge has always priority over everything else.
---
Use demoralizing shout to collect all stray mobs from a pull, and to counter _heal_ threat. Spread your sunder armor from time to time on other targets, not only your main one.
---
There's not much more to it. This basically works up to level 40 when you get your 31 talent. 
---
If a priest heals you, tell him to not use his PW:Shield on you. You don't gain rage when absorbing damage. And tell those Shamans to not use Rockbiter on their weapons.
---
I mean, in RFC, nobody really cares if the tank actually has all the threat, since the mobs die incredibly fast anyways.  Don't worry too much.
---
As a horde player, no u.
---
But really, grass is always greener on the other side. Like you said, people are people.
---
yea but its been like at least 15 seconds, blink.
---
God I hate people like you.
---
Demoralizing shout after you switch to defensive, it gives a threat multiplier.  Other than that, just sunder.  Tab through enemies to try to spread it around.
---
I like how the two guild names are related. Where was Hurricane and Tsunami?
---
Gift of arthas means the faster your pet attacks the more dps it does because it is a flat bonus to phys damage delt. 
---
Therefore broken tooth is the maximized raid dps pet.
---
alliance have a camp with a flightpath that's technically in alterac, but it's an argent dawn camp right on the border of western plaguelands and might as well be in that zone for all intents and purposes.
---
Yet another reason level penalties not applying in PvP is annoying.
---
Auctionator too
---
It's fine to have that trinket, it works wonders when it's off CD. But that doesn't change that when it's on CD,  you would want to use briarwood reed. Wiping on ragnaros? Now you have a trinket whose only advantage will not be useable for at least 1 retry.
---
This one is a reference to him going into a forrest in Japan notorious for suicide victims and filming a dead body for one of his vlogs
---
Your kitty is a troll druid in disguise.
---
Downranking with healing power isn't as good as stacking intellect till you get to later dungeons IMO. None of the content is hard enough to exhaust your mana pool unless you get that one mage that always AoE and insists on tanking 5 mobs
---
2h fury really is where its at. Though I take blood craze over imp demo.
---
Its such a small heal but I quite like having it.
---
Didn't notice it but holy hell you are right.
---
I like randoms who ask for food/water when you're out questing and when you ask for money turn into assholes. Main reason I just ignore requests from people not in my party.
---
OF ANTS!
---
/who hyjal
---
Works for any zone, and you can do other neat things like /who 60 gives you a list of 25 random level 60 people on the server.
---
/who Stormwind 60  gives you up to 25 people in stormwind who are level 60.
---
 It only works for your faction though, so no finding out if you're completely alone in Winterspring or not.
---
So then scroll up, idk, just seems like a silly thing to get upset about.
---
Ya man we have seen sooo much shaman and warlock tier too!!!! 
---
And sorry it's late I meant spring next year lmao idk why I said 2021
---
But ya i wasn't trying to sound like a dick in my OC I just really meant be proud and grateful  and congrats :)
---
/quillboar REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I got to level 52 in classic. I get you, it's great.
---
The term you're looking for is healing / spell damage coefficient. 
---
Every spell in vanilla uses some fraction of the +heal/dmg if its cast time (not including talents) is lower than 3,5 seconds or not channeled.
---
 [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) 
---
This thread shows the coeffecient of the original vanilla game and should still be valid for the live classic 1.13 version.
---
This is what you are looking for: https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/formulas-spell-coefficients-classic-wow
---
Short version: The "Up to" part is based on a 3 second BASE cast time. Spells with shorter cast times benefit less, and if you talent your 3 second cast down to 2.5 its still treated as 3 seconds.
---
Lol what do you mean? I purposely wrote something contested to bait out more answers.
---
You even went into detail about your answer.
---
Win-win.
---
"Increased the difficulty" compared to what?
---
Grats on having the gold at 40! I think I'll have enough or very close to it.
---
Some absolute paragons of intellect created "Noggenfogger Elixir". On Noggenfogger-EU.
---
as I see it, the mount would help you get the next 1000g quicker because you move faster from spot to spot and time is money. the helm would help you do your job better but I am guessing you don't have any problems anyway so... mount
---
I completed the quest on  Verdant Keepers Aim. And save my gold.
---
I have started playing a 2 weeks after lunch, been playing daily, but only a couple of hours each night. Just hit lvl 30, how long do you guys recon lvl 60 gonna take me? 
---
I heard the real grind only starts after 50 because there are no more quests anymore so it‚Äôs all just mob farming.
---
We had Teremus destroying Stormwind city a while back on Firemaw, it still happens
---
Aaaaand now I have a slot dedicated for salt in case shit like this happens. Worth it.
---
I like to express my chaotic good side by fearing enemy mobs off people in the middle of crowded murloc camps. No need to thank me random warrior, now I'll be on my way.
---
Hes just not that lucky with rolls
---
Definitely the mount.
---
You are right. +healing basically adds more healing to your spells to make them heal more. However not all spells benefit 100% of + healing or + damage (let‚Äôs call it spell power for now :p). For specific spells it‚Äôs best to google ‚Äúwhat is the coefficient for healing wave‚Äù, that will show you the coefficient of healing wave per rank. Usually though, spells with longer cast times benefit more and up to 100%. Instant/faster casts benefit a less.
---
For example, for a mage, fireball benefits from 100% of your spell power, it also has a 3.5 second cast time (reduced to 3 seconds with talents and that .5 second reduction in cast time does not affect the spell power coefficient of fireball at all, it remains 100%). So if your fireball hits for 100, if you have 100 spell power, you will hit for 200. For frostbolt, the coefficient is around 85% I believe, so if your frost bolt hits for 100 and you have 100 spell power you will hit for 185.
---
Hope this clears things up.
---
There was a great post a while ago with all spell coefficients for all classes though I can‚Äôt seem to find it :x
---
that is what any reasonable person with an internet connection would do
---
That's not quite right.
---
AOE players want maximum damage numbers and maximum xp/hour, while maximizing the chance of beating the content.
---
Methodical players want to relive their childhood and the sense of adventure that comes with not knowing how to play.
---
Thanks :)
---
Ahhh, okay thank you so much! I just got revenge at 14.
---
I'd go for the Helmet. Crafting material prices will go up and down over time, so you might need _way_ more money later for it. Mount and riding prices are always the same.
---
I'm a new player, coming from ESO and that's what I love about this game. In ESO you get epic drops and so much stuff all the time just thrown at you that there is very little sense of progress. Even grinding a dungeon in ESO is somewhat lame because you know you are guaranteed to at least get something. Classic WOW is the game I've been waiting for, just didn't know it.
---
Or just use an add-on
---
Sounds to me like he's camping a quest area and not you. 
---
That's a PvP server dude. Multiple zones for your level bracket exist for a reason. So do instances.
---
That guild is normie trash. Nobody worth them best friends club tho. Stay away from those guys
---
It's not vocal but my favourite emote is /nosepick or /pick
---
TL;DR Well... shit...
---
That's some low hanging fruit.
---
I love it
---
And it's an issue that they should be aware of if they are to use one of those addons.
---
Could you get off my ass for informing them?

Then roll a rogue for your chance too. The majority of these chests have food, shit materials and a potion. If we get a blue I think we earned it for taking the time to level it oursrlves. Youd be skipping this chest if the rogue wasn't here anyways. If a blacksmith brought a key they could have it to themselves just as fair. If no one was prepared youd simply move on and never know about ur maybe blue item. You want the loot for yourself as badly as the rogues do. When I main a mage or whatever idc about the chest, I'm here for quests and dungeons.
---
I can 100% confirm, the "twitch meta" has a really nasty effect on casual players and if it didn't happened so often I wouldn't even bother comment but shit is real. I remember when I was leveling in STV I found myself forced to log in in the mornings ( I work from home) to do the troll quests because every single evening there were 3-4 mages pulling just every fucking mob possible, even trying to blink past me to snatch to one I was going for, and often dying just because "that's how mages are leveling". 
---
Another effect that I strongly dislike is people only going for "spell cleave" runs and looking for insanse reqs for doing basic shit. You don't need to be 48+ to do ZF dafuq.  
---
Also people spamming shit like "LF HEAL TANK DPS, drop resserved". Like really? are you expecting to get free boosted like that? 
---
Luckily I'm playing with friends who rolled tank and heal besides other specs, but I can't even imagine the struggle of a casual solo rogue trying to have some basic fun with this community.
---
What is a Jed run? I need to get that guy
---
Is it out for classic? Need something to do in raids as a hunter xD
---
\#druidthings
---
Also sixtyupgrades.com shows all current upgrades obtainable for your current level, including Quests, just click an item and hit replace and it will show in a list
---
Adibags ftw!
---
Stoneform isn't bad.
---
If anything, it comes down to matchups.
---
For instance, UD Shadow Priest vs Dwarf Shadow Priest goes to Undead in my experience because you can't dispell Will of the Forsaken like you can Fear Ward :P
---
Doesnt recount have a tab for it?
---
At least the person wanting to reserve tells people their intentions. You‚Äôre much worse.
---
Ehehehehehe
---
I think trolladins are becoming a thing now?
---
it's no t3 that's for sure, also not as good for +healing as other gear but it definitely has its place for tank / prio target healing
---
I barely know her!

I just googled my server name followed by forums and it gave me the official forum and the subreddit, both of which had links to discord.
---
Same... I'm really disappointed. Played heals to be a team player.
---
I'm almost positive.
---
You dont even realize **how** bad it is before using an addon like TSM and see what it could be
---
Meanwhile, burnt out at level 34....
---
Don‚Äôt think bigglesworth is any more toxic then the other servers
---
this Sunday i got into a group at around 1pm.  we managed to kill around 5 bosses, got the key, lost 2 hunters and found replacements, and by around 6pm our healer suddenly disappeared mid bossfight so everyone gave up
---
and everyone was 55 or higher
---
next time i actually finish this thing is gonna feel so satisfying
---
It's not quite like that, I did 50-60 only doing two dungeon runs and minimal grinding. The quest choice does become pretty limited, but it's not too bad.
---
I started playing at launch, reached 30 in probably two weeks and reached 60 two days ago so I'd guess at your pace it'll be another 3 weeks before you hit 60.
---
I hate to see good secrets get out, but this advice is spot on.
---
Also a fishing rod in STV seems to give you a little protection from the other faction.   I've had 2-3 horde ride up to me, and just wave and leave.  Fishing pole of peace!
---
An entire raid budget of water!
---
Stuff like this makes me happy. Good on you. As a player with no friends interested in Classic, leveling a Warrior solo on Bloodsail, I salute you...and hope I run into someone as kind and helpful on my journey.
---
I bought one for ~300g. It's basically forever-bis, and I plan to raid a lot, so I'm sure I'll get my money's worth. If you're a more relaxed player and only plan to tank instances and MC-Ony then Unyielding will serve just fine.
---
I'm not sure why you think random, unwanted spam isn't annoying.
---
Would you like people to spam whisper you for no reason? That is basically what you are doing to everyone around you.
---
Anakin! I have the high ground!

Good point.

Returning player, looking to start again in the next day or two. Started just before TBC released, hit level 60 just before it came out and never got to experience vanilla endgame content. Hardcore raider in TBC and WoTLK (quit playing before Ulduar was released, favorite raids were Karazhan and 3drake). 
---
Good with any role or class (never raid tanked as warrior, though, would LOVE to do that for vanilla), just want to play with a fun group of people who are good at the game but also have fun and treat it as a game.
---
Can you link to the post about this?
---
I loved the original AV it was one of the few games that had what felt like a proper war with a frontline
---
Yea, it's just an edit of my evening wpvp so show how silly rogue is in those scenarios. Next one will have some quality content with proper dueling etc. 
---
Thanks for your input and support.
---
Strat would have been the entrance to Naxx (just past Baron's Ziggurat), but they decided to skip that, and simply gave it a separate entrance in EPL. Both MC and BWL can be entered from BRD and UBRS respectively, however (once BWL is open that is - the portal is there now though).
---
I had a ?? nelf druid moonbeaming me at the druid trainer in Moonglade on Fairbanks a few days ago.

I give up every item that drops, but that's because I get sucky rolls. Does that count towards being a nice person?

Lemme turn this around: you're working on your 3rd 60? What the hell is wrong with YOU?

I have my forth char with my highest being lvl 48 - I have seen the endgame and I remember as an European that raiding MC at 3am local time (on US servers) was hard but I loved it - now that I started again, am working fulltime (back then I was studying) I just dont need to get there again any time soon ..
---
I just enjoy the journey - play different races I didnt play before, read quests texts, get immersed - no need for endgamerush for me anymore and I like that I can enjoy the game at the pace I am currently playing - back then I always felt I NEED to raid or I NEED to have certain gear - I am glad I dont feel that pressure of my young self anymore so yeah I think I can also count myself to that camp :)
---
It will probably take you around 2 times as long as it did to get to 30. There are plenty of quests after level 50 you may have to grind out a bar or 2 of experience but I had no problem questing to 60 and doing every dungeon only once.
---
Crafting is more of a money sink than a money maker, at least early on. Usually skinning and mining/herbalism are levelling professions to generate a steady income. 
---
Late game you want/need engineering for grenades and stuff
---
Just a tip: every single one of the mainstream raidframe/healing addons (Grid, Vuhdo, Healbot, ElvUi, LunaUF) supports incoming heals/healcomm by default. Just make sure you have an up to date version.
---
You don't even need those, technically. If you just want to use default raidframes, installing Healcomm from warcrafttavern is enough.
---
You need to wand more. You open with mind blast + power word pain and then wand them to death keeping your shield up. You kill things slowly but you won't run out of mana or need to stop to drink so you will be pretty efficient. The key is to spend as much time as you can out of the 5 second rule that stops spirit regen. You can actually have less downtime then a rogue.

55 resto shaman full time job, 2 kids, wife.. I think i hit the roof now... full brd runs are just to much
---
Use the mace, man. No need to respec now. It will only get more expensive.
---
And then they end up in STV somehow
---
Just bought everything on the AH, I had more than enough gold for that at 35 with 2 gathering professions.
---
I also only use them when needed, so now 10 levels later, I still have most of the once I made for first aid levelling.
---
I bet the dal rends rogue next to you would argue against that
---
It's not possible to completely lock yourself out of any part of BRD.
---
Even if you flip the lever closing the gate, that doesn't remove any part of the dungeon, it merely blocks off one pathway, in that you can't then go between Incendius's platform and the highway to Baelgar directly. You can still however go back past Darkvire, through the Dormitories, and over the bridge to the Ring of Law's upper section, which also connects to the gate room - and from there you can access Baelgar.
---
I agree, this does not seem possible.
---
\#showtooltip does that
---
There's a guild named "Ashbringer" on Ashbringer.
---
You sold a 200g pattern for 69gold for a meme!? Nice.
---
That's great!! I made most of my gold selling all my mats in the last 2 levels.
---
Compare vendor price to the price you get for disenchanted items on average. Usually, you want to vendor mail and plate, chest pieces, legs and weapons since vendors love them, and disenchant cloth and leather, gloves, belts, etc
---
I too need some tips for quest reward gear on Rogue
---
afaik you get a good blue neck from In Dreams chain in EPL
---
then a trinket from UBRS q to kill the general
---
thrash blade from mara q if swords but I wanna be daggers
---
But why male models?
---
Isnt mage rotation in classic more or less frostbolt/fireball and not much else?
---
I ran some friends through it at 42. I could have soloed it but it would have taken longer. You could probably solo it earlier if your really interested in it but I don't think it would be very efficient.
---
Man the horrificness of wc is enough on it's own without all that crap. Was tank 2 tagging the druids or was he just lazy and didnt want to hold aggro of more than one target? If the latter maybe he should respect and dps
---
Spent so much time trying to do this in Un goro that I kept getting ganked by devilsaurs cause I didn‚Äôt look on the other side of where I was jumping, and naturally got dismounted every time.
---
I‚Äôm pretty good at it now tho
---
Good AOE players, maybe.
---
Bad AOE players - and thats most of them - are still trying to maximise the numbers, chance of success be damned. Because it's the tank's fault or the healer's fault, right ?
---
Get that gearscore shit out of here man..
---
I farmed my essences because I ran out of quests at 58 so I figured I'll get two birds stoned at once getting exp and essences.
---
My high pop server's IF can be 2-3x as crowded to this post. It's good to be back in Lagforge :')
---
No spots to group. Flooded with healers end game. Have to compete with tons of mages for shadow gear ( everyone gets mad even if you say this is why you came ). Also they can't really farm anything alone so aren't even able to produce much gold.
---
I feel you. For me, I will always loved the leveling, and still do! I don't have time for raids. I can't even block a window where I'm 100% sure I'm available for 2 hours to do any dungeon.
---
none
---
Thats good to hear, because I do this to every tauren I see and I always wonder if they roll their eyes and are annoyed by my lame mooing :p
---
weapon skill? our claws don't need sharpening
---
Probably a lot of the hate for ICC has to do with the fact that it was the primary raid for a long, long period of time with no new raid content. As great as it was, it also got old after a while.
---
Just picked up a 16 slot travelers bag in a random chest in Azshara today, so there's that.
---
Damn dude why are you so negative.
---
The guy just likes theory crafting stuff.
---
He isn't down a rabbit hole, it's just about finding interesting ways to make a spec work.
---
The only clean gnome is a dead gnome.
---
Bad players are bad... what inspiring insight.
---
Fair point
---
Thanks guys :) i ever wondered why no one is using this for communication \^\^
---
mind you some green items are actually good pre raid gear
---
Read this at work and I‚Äôm now sitting at my desk in tears trying to hide it from coworkers. I‚Äôm sorry that you lost your brother, and glad that Classic gave you the chance to relive a special memory you shared with him. Thanks for sharing the story with us all. Will make my way to brill after work to raise a tankard for Gorishural.
---
sword is garbo as well, too fast
---
I'm using Grid and I can see those durations. I do, however, have another addon installed: classic buff (or aura) durations. You might wanna try that.
---
It doesn‚Äôt matter unless your min maxing, but not everyone into that level of autism when it comes to wow, so just do what you want.
---
I tank mona with my WW axe and it works lovely. I just equip a shield in case of a bigger pull than usual
---
What addon is that? I like how much bigger the view of the character is.
---
Oh I'm definitely inefficient. 
---
Even though, that's not the main problem I think, the problem is I have around 2 days /played and I can barely squeeze in more time.
---
This makes me sick, u must engage in combat and ruthlessly kill every alliance player you see
---
Really depends how hard it is to aquire the pattern. Something learned from a trainer in major city 50 silver. Something learned from a drop from molten core your looking at 30g.
---
Similar thing happened to me. I helped an undead warrior and he helped me in return.
---
At that moment we were simply fellow warriors, and the faction rift gave way, for a solemn moment, to honest camaraderie.
---
I really think they will end up doing TBC and not Classic+, although I think Classic+ could be cool (potentially). Just from a business perspective TBC makes loads more sense. 
---
I don't think they will rule out Classic+ for a while because there's no reason to until they announce TBC, and the potential promise of actual new yet old content is cool and keeps things feeling hopeful/fresh.
---
tuaren is the best race regardless of racial abilities
---
dont let anyone tell you different
---
Nope, was pushing some friends through and got my first ravager drop after 40 times. I'm level 49.
---
I think it's `/dance motion`? Might be thinking of something else though
---
Oh and he instantly ignored me too lol
---
im lvl 50 and if you want a stack of my sparkling warter its not a 3.5sec cast
---
and everything below maxrank is useless and will net you insults
---
You're being downvoted, but I agree. I didn't know about this quest, and if someone had this quest and refused to say what was going on I'd be pretty peeved too.
---
How? I have roughly 29g at level 36
---
Tbc is peak wow imo.
---
Yes, there is a German tank called hetzer:)
---
taco
---
Nothing that does it all in one mod, but you can piece together the functionality using two mods.
---

You have to manually add the NPCs to "scan" for to the list.

---
Read all of it and enjoyed every second, very good sir!
---
There are dozens of us!
---
Have you found a working one for Classic? I‚Äôve been looking every now and then but I haven‚Äôt found one yet!
---
Meanwhile we‚Äòve cleared 5 IDs and si haven‚Äòt gotten my hands on a single drop.
---
Alright, thanks! Have you found anything like a CC timer (when on the receiving end)?
---
Which nameplate addon are you using? I like that it has decimals for the CC/debuff duration on target unlike Neatplates.
---
Most likely nothing. Viewdistance and farclip are both maxed out by default if you have maxed everything in video settings. You can't increase them further.
---
Cat‚Äòs happiness says it all
---
Like the other said, 2h axe is superior, even better when you do harm string kiting. As a human, 2h mace is an option you could go for, but thats more of a style choice (same with sword, which is the worst option)
---
Ok great, without ice barrier I didnt know if just great FP pots were enough thanks.
---
No it isn't. You'll make serious money with herbalism, though.
---
He definitely tried to get aggro but there was just too many, it was mostly due to the fury warrior accidentally pulling more mobs.
---
Yea, thats more or less what I experienced aswell.   
---
People tend to act liked spoilt prats when it comes to sharing stuff with other ppl. 
---
The only way to avoid these as much as possible is buiding your own groups with ppl you played with before, i guess.
---
To add: Outfitter has not been ported yet, but ItemRack Classic is available on Curseforge!
---
same did my rogue 60 couldn't find any groups outside of guild and even then they wanted heals/tanks and rarely rogue cuz mages exist
---
so i just had to roll mage
---
They've been taken down, was in the middle of The Last Guardian :(
---
I though the common concept is you need the boe world drops, no matter who is in the group. So you did nothing wrong.
---
theyll be respeccing so you wont find many prot warriors. You are more likely to find feral dudus, as you can offspec that as healer :)
---
Are you supposed to have to re-equip the Rune of the Argent Dawn (spell power ad rep collection trinket) every time you die to be able to collect scourge stones or is that a bug?
---
Thank you for the awesome comment man, I appreciate the critique and review :) it was a ton of research getting this one done and you're certainly right, like 3 spots in this video are so crowded I couldn't even personally use them in my classic server. 
---
But the Swamp spots imo are both very unpopular on my server, wonder what others are feeling in their servers tho 
---
Also subscribe to stay up to date, up next is likely a gold farming level between 50-60, but to be honest these vids take the most practice, time and research I've ever put into any video and if I'm working on the same vid for too many hours I get distracted and do smaller vids in between hah. 
---
Expect that though ;)
---
NE and SW to be more specific
---
innervate in the wild is a good trade. buffing MotW is a godsent for mages, thorns is nice but generally not needed.
---
Tanks are by far the most needed class from my experience so far... And good tanks are even a rarer find. I'm almost tempted to roll a tank just so I can get easy invites to any group.
---
To be honest, the graphic in classic is really starting to bug me out. I would like a remake with todays graphics, interface improvements etc but leave all the hand-holding out.
---
I've been told that a faster speed is okay for 2h fury because of the faster rage generation and bloodthirst scaling with attack power instead of weapon damage.
---
A bad Methodical will still try and be methodical.
---
A bad AOE will still try and be AOE.
---
It's about ideology, and there's good and bad players in both styles.
---
It's when you try and mix them in the same party that problems happen.
---
pretty sure the truce only exists in moonglade, although personally as a mage, i try to avoid fighting druids because i have dinner reservations for next week and i'd like to not be late
---
&gt; You must be playing Hunter better than every top tier Hunter from private servers/currently playing.
---
That's a hilarious statement considering those are the ones that taught me the importance of melee weaving.
---
Do you think players such as Journey and Amph are buying white melee weapons for the memes?
---
&gt;  good luck finding yourself a raid group bud.
---
Why would I need to find myself a new raid group?
---
I had people calling me out for winning too many greed rolls in a dungeon ... like wtf...
---
I know stats what I need but I have trouble deciding between how much stright AP is better than how much agi or is a whole crit percent worth loosing half a crits worth of agi and the AP it brings with it. 
---
Any just basic stat weights that include crit and hit% for combat rogue?
---
But you're not Horde *or* Gnome, so pfeh!
---
so it's more silly and outrageous for somebody to be upset that you're clogging up their chat with multiple unnecessary messages, than it is that you're blowing a kiss or some shit to every person you buff? \*he's\* being the unreasonable one?
---
Ask for a layer hop
---
The time investment is grossly overexaggerated, especially in p1.
---
I'm in a top raiding guild on my server, it took me some fair amount of grinding to get to 60 and geared up, but after that the time requirement falls off immensely.
---
I've got pretty much all my prebis and some bis as a healer, we do MC and Onyxia in about 2 hours, Ony alone takes less than 5 minutes for this guild. Takes longer to get there then it takes to kill her.
---
Pretty much all I do now on my priest is raid and do specific dungeons that are hard to find groups for with friends needing them, test of skulls etc.
---
I've even started an alt, something I never thought I'd have the time for this time around. Level 28. Leveling an alt when you already have a maxed out character that can only be improved with raiding gear, is so much more relaxing than the rush I did on my first character.
---
I've seen an addon that places the CC you've been affected with on a retail style but haven't really looked it up yet.
---
The nameplate addon is KUI Nameplates,  you can enable them on friendly units too and they look like ElvUI if you're into that.
---
I'm not that much confused that people play videogames this much, not even that some are 60 and downing MC/Ony. 
---
What I was more confused about was that there are *this many*. It looks like the game is filled with raiding guilds, reddit too, and the casual players that were saying how they're gona "take things slow this time" kinda disappeared.
---
But anyway, the post was meant more to be just humorous.
---
I don't think rogue would be granted with epic drop if he was the one who killed the mob. I think every time the mob dies, there's a dice roll that specifies the drop. Not like the mob is spawned with the drop pre-rolled.
---
Even if the speed didnt matter and we say that the damage on the procs on either weapon, the -100 armor from the mace makes it much better
---
To be honest in classic, once you are able to kill the bosses to get the raid gear you don't need it for anything anymore. As far as I'm concerned any manual designation of raid loot is just at each groups discretion, I doubt there are many groups who desperately need that gear to make progress in MC/Ony that are also progressed enough to get pieces of it.
---
After joining /world and /lfg and having to scroll up/down all the time I just made separate chat window. It helps a lot.
---
Sticky sick
---
Can a 17/34/0 fury warrior tank all dungeons including ubrs?
---
That says something about the entire guild, not just that officer. If they kept playing with him after that you must clearly have been an outsider in a closer-knit group where "they" didn't want to give away gold to someone else. That is an ez /gquit right there.  
---
In my guild you'd get banned from rolling until you paid your dues, and if you didn't try and it was a substantial amount we'd make a bigger deal out of it too.
---
wowhead and icy-veins both have stat weights for every class.
---
LOL
---
me no comprehend
---
Depends on the group, but usually is fine. Ask in your group if you are unsure and then roll need anyway
---
Also, most often than not, people will be depending on you (the tank) to know dungeon maps, boss mechanics and which trash to pull or avoid. So it's always a good strategy to study beforehand the dungeon you want to do, routes and boss strategies, it will make for a smoother run.
---
If you choose the Question Mark icon (default), and use #showtooltip it automatically picks the correct one.
---
Some1 did already do it, but at launch, so maybe not ever1 saw it :)
---
Look at all those alliance roaches!
---
You have always min max pro hardcore nolife who want to save 2 minutes to do raid faster :D
---
Some of these like /incoming won't send the text part under many circumstances so you can spam the voiceline without spamming the chat which is nice.
---
Congrats! That's a great achievement. Also, weird question, but do you like it working as a nurse? I'm considering going for an RN but I'm hesitant because I've heard it can be a really demanding job. I like the idea of doing something undeniably good with my life (helping people in need). Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated!
---
The real salt was the OPs we made along the way?
---
xD
---
Does anyone know if sundering after a 5 stack of sunder armor generates additional threat even though it doesnt continue to stack? Might be a dumb question, but seems worth asking.
---
Oh. Yeah :(
---
not always, just more of a chance.
---
Where do i find them? I know stat priority which is what i keep finding but classic weights?
---
Thought i would update. I met a kind mage i had ran dungeons with before and we killed those assholes several times, as well as a few horde that tried to help them. After about 4 or 5 times they disappeared.
---
Whether he killed someone or not the video was really in poor taste and she‚Äôs how disrespectful he is.
---
The real question
---
well both have their kinks, rogue vanish is hard to get a clean one off, hunters feign+trap is hard to get off in some situations and both are quite integral to their pvp kit.
---
I feel unless you're used to it the minimum range will be a deal breaker for you, most people understand they have to deadzone a hunter (too close for ranged and too far for melee) and it's always a struggle to maintain distance in some cases.
---
NO! And I farmed that shit for ages in vanilla on my warrior/warlock, omg wtf?
---
I did 2 runs last night, dinged 54, got the key, no HoJ or shoulders drop. Awesome instance though, forgot its complexity. More farm tonight :D
---
You're glad you left an excellently balanced server with low prices on virtually everything because a spam invite guild sucks?  You're weird.  There's a spam invite guild on whatever server you joined full of bottom feeders just like the bigglesworth boys.
---
This is a ad
---
I would just ignore it like I ignore all the spam in general, world, lfg, people yelling, etc. If you are want to just see your guild, party, etc., You can create a window that only shows that... I mainly get laughs and have only had one person seem to be annoyed by it, but I guess I should've expected more people to take shit super seriously in this sub than your average casual.
---
I'm so sick of people posting about their dead relatives on this sub.
---
It's fucking tacky.
---
Whenever I see "BiS" lists etc, I never see them wearing a full set.
---
He's got a bone to pick with you.
---
Server's great, I don't know what you're talking about.  Spam invite guilds like that exist on every server.
---
Noob question but how are Enhance Shamans for wPvP? I'm playing a Priest and a Mage but I want something else that is not a caster haha
---
You learned nothing
---
Ok, seems like I should keep on smashing heads with the hammer.
---
Thanks for your opinions. I ll keep the mace :)
---
No, anything that ruins character identity is bad for an RPG. For the love of god,  no dual spec or something like that.
---
That would kill fun hybrid specs people use to both  tank  and DPS, or DPS and  Heal.
---
need an addon for drawing routes on my map
---
pls help
---
I feel like they could use some of the changes they made in TBC. I mean I dont feel like there is a wrong addition in tbc. ALl the class changes in tbc were great I think. Made more stuff viable. But with the 4 wide it could be interesting. What bothers me is that some characters are missing vital spells like prot pal the taunt so not sure how they would add that. Or some sort of mana regen while in fight.
---
It's a Blizzard add on call BFA
---
My gf tried the game and it became clear that levelling with her was NOT helping. She's pretty good at DOTA so I figured she'd get by...
---
Turns out I just couldn't sit by watching her playing with arrow keys in place of WASD, clicking every ability and not using strafe at all.
---
 It caused more problems than it averted!
---
Those are only against NPCs, doesn't stop players getting ganked
---
/guffaw for laugh
---
Sword of omen is a pretty fast sword and if you are sword specced you want swords on both hands for those sweet extra attacks.
---
It's called [ToDoChecklist](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/todochecklister)
---
/spit
---
If your specced into aoe mage isn‚Äôt the staff superior to dagger + orb
---
Yeh dual spec was good :D and definitely would make things more fun i think.
---
Lmao everyone else seems to shit on seal fate daggers so much I thought the dps is complete dogshit, but in the end there isn't concrete proof? That sucks.
---
Thabks though. I guess I won't switch.
---
Second attempt on hunting for Truefaith recipe and pattern dropped after passing on righteous orb! I am so lucky!
---
I did look it up. I saw it had a 1/100 drop rate which didn't look too bad and started to try it. Now I'm questioning if it's even in the game since I've never seen anyone else have it
---
I'll never run UD Strat without a mage ever again. Seems like every supply box in the instance is trapped except the few in the final area marked with the red cross. And most people dont realize you can use the holy water in them to aoe the mobs down anyways.
---
One time?
---
Holy shit what I wrong with you
---
You should not be complaining about anyone
---
5 hours a day is a full time job + playing wow when you get home, it's easily doable even while working, you'll even have an hour or two break for tea and an hour or two before sleep.
---
people are literally playing for 14-18 hours a day every day.
---
The ganker guilds from the private servers would beg to differ.
---
Oh, I didn't know that. At least they'll get less honor
---
That face just screams "Feed me!"
---
The title has "Enjoy, memers" in it, what were you expecting?
---
By default the quality is at 3 (Classic) and you can slide it up to 10
---
That was the joke
---
Can only remember being ganked 4 times as a Horde in 14.5 years of WoW.
---
Not sure if you made this, but if so, it should be legendary!
---
Depends
---
The nice way would be to have them roll 
---
But if it was some random dude no way in hell would he get a chance
---
I have over 10 keybinds for blessings alone. Sometimes you just fuck Up. Just tell the Paladin you want another Blessing than the one He gave you.

\#showtooltip Sinister Strike
---
/startattack

/cast Sinister Strike
---
Less misses/parries/blocks is more important than getting 10 more damage with each whirlwind.
---
Fucking cheese ball caught me right off guard hahaha
---
If you're worried about PvP pick rogue hands down
---
The person afk didn't assist with the kill so, fair enough they miss out.
---
Fuck me.. Why the fuck am i playing like I have a wooden pc?
---
No /gchat or /party either?
---
pretty tricky... but I'd say roll for it. when I'm duoing with a friend it's quite often that one of us goes afk, but still gets xp, quest items and rolls for any greens that drop... I guess the same should apply to an epic
---
If I was afk guy, I would pass on the item - unless it was an upgrade for me that he wouldn't use.
---
Can't stand it. I usually run around with a few stacks,  and never need more than one for obvious reasons, so I toss it out to priests who buff me when they run by, things like that. But just don't respond to people who ask me now. 
---
Earlier today a lock asked and I ended up running past him a few minutes later and he /spit on me. Like motherfucker I don't owe you a goddamn thing. I got my free regen, you got your free mount.
---
Guild mate
---
Do not mob grind at ant point after hitting 52. Just spam your prebis dungeons, that way when you hit lvl 60 you will be nearly full prebis and won't have to spam as many dungeons which then gives 0xp.
---
You weren't helping when it dropped. You weren't even there. 
---
It's the same as being nearby someone you're not grouped with and they get an epic boe and complaining that if you had tagged that mob then you would have got it and so that player should /roll with you.
---
Tbh mages also have to drink every 3 mobs
---
Well done :) 
---
Work full time, wife, only one kid though (1,5 years). I just hit 30 with 5 gold to my name :)
---
Logan Paul vs KSI 2 is coming up soon, that's the last I heard of him. Having said that, I don't watch him, but I'm assuming that he's doing the same as always (vlogs). He just hasn't been in the news lately because he hasn't been filming &amp; laughing at dead bodies.
---
[Here's](https://i.imgur.com/8p6B3Hp.png) my ele shaman at 42

Then I don‚Äôt really see the problem here? You got 2 days played time and you‚Äôre complaining people are completing end game with like 10+ days played?
---
What‚Äôs the end goal here? Looking for raid so you can catch up with 2 days played or something?
---
BoE epic worth a few hundred gold
---
WC was and always will be a group breaker... I never understood why Blizz put one of the longest and most confusing dungeons that early in the game
---
well its all on a timer. If they are there and present, then they should get to roll on the item. If the item expires, and they are still AFK, they'll know nothing about the item that dropped and the person killing the mob will win it once the timer runs out. 
---
Its purely upto the individual, if they want to tell said guildie that an epic dropped while they were away. 
---
if it was me, I'd not roll on the item if it was me who was AFK. I'd be gutted, but would believe the person I am grouped with deserved it as they were the one killing the mobs while I did nothing. Had they been soloing, they'd have gotten it anyway, as they were the one killing mobs.
---
Yeaaaaaaaaaaah! Good stuff
---
they might ask
---
why would i pay you those 2,5g for that portal?
---
and i try to explaine that the 3g they owe me arepurely for buying those reagents.
---
i dont want to spend 5g just so i can port someone from ogrimmar to undercity,
---
wich is why i hand the 10g bill straight to the user of the portal 
---
I even try to create a raid of people so the cost of 500g can be equaly distributed througout all the members and its not such a huge drag on my pocktes. 
---
and im barely covering my expenses by already including a 1K g discount becouse im such a nice guy.

[Forgot the dope SM cath shield and SM GY dagger](https://i.imgur.com/9jcj37V.png)
---
You could try Hello Kitty Online
---
Pulling info out of our asses here I see
---
as far as I know in 1.12 the poison application is standardized per minute and the weapon speed doesn't actually give you more poison procs. what you speak of was a thing in earlier vanilla patches.
---
and in any case even if you were right about the poison, it makes no sense to use a dagger in offhand if sword spec.
---
Though the others mention DPS drop, consider upgrades. You'll have much less competition for daggers, which might mean higher DPS faster, then picking up swords later.
---
I feel dumb for not considering this
---
Why do you have and wear the SM Amory shoulders they are trash on hunters. They basically only give you 15 stam, the strength on it is wasted. Reminds me when I ran Amory and a hunter asked if he could roll on them.
---
As a former hunter in vanilla/bc main plz don't enforce the bad rep hunters already have
---
I thinks it's a valid reason. I love retail but its biggest downside to me is the update every 2-3 months. I feel rushed into doing everything, don't have enough time to play my alts and I get the feeling I'm missing out when there's new content and I still haven't cleaned the previous patch. 
---
In the end it makes it way less enjoyable. I'm having a blast on classic now just chilling, fishing, exploring and stuff but it would be a downer if they changed it too soon.
---
Don‚Äôt forget to buy maverick merch guys

I'm slowly catching up but I'm still behind. I just hope phase 2 is far away.
---
You were lied to, bud. If you had optimized your playtime you too could have a rag and ony kill or two under your belt by now.
---
Yep he's definitely not
---
Hey guys, I'm a lvl 21 mage now, never played classic but having a ton of fun. I wanna get into aoe grinding, which spots do you recommend? Am i still too low? Im a gnome btw.
---
There's a bunch of factors that i'd take into consideration.
---
* You stated he's a guildie so that's one of them sorted (do i know them?)  
---
* How long have we been in a party together? (Have i been grinding this spot for ages and he simply joined a few minutes ago, or have we been grouped for ages helping each other)  
---
* Are they doing me a favour by being in my group (Higher level helping me, etc)
---
If they're a guildie, we've been grouped for awhile OR they're doing me a favour we'd just reroll.  Pretty much any other circumstances (just grouped and i've been here for ages, i'm helping them out, etc) and it's mine.
---
You didn‚Äôt even ask a question
---
I know its possible - but lets not talk about skill if someone ganks lowlvls.
---
Now were talking something killer guy needs. As afk guy, I would feel no entitlement to it.
---
SM is just huge and covers a huge range of levels where questing is hard and gives you good loot you're gonna keep until your BiS.
---
Of course people are going to run it ad nauseam. It doesn't mean it's good design.
---
bend over n cough if you want water
---
It'a the exact opposite for me. UC is so dense and organized, it's amazing! You can go from the bank in UC to the AH, to profession trainers, and make it to class trainers in a line in the time it takes you just to get from the bank to the profession trainers in Org.
---
And why it isn't in retail? World got so big and everyone got scattered around other big cities?
---
I was afk for a literal minute, one single mob was killed.
---
[Nope, I even posted on the forums to rub the salt in the wound](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/someone-please-tell-almost-famous/91476)
---
yep, me to man, me to. I wasn't going to relive this nightmare all over again, getting ganked while low health between fights, getting killed while talking to npc, etc, that all in the past
---
Make nurse lol. Unless you have a wife cause you are a lesbian than that‚Äôs ok I guess
---
 Luna Unit frames, Bartender, and Bagnon
---
I feel attacked
---
geniuuus
---
Raid leader says "I have zero idea about healer itemisation but I will talk about it anyway."
---
People should really be forming premades for loot reservations though.
---
I can't imagine someone so stupidly selfish that they demand something for nothing in return.
---
&gt;Raid leader says "Youre a healer wanting priority on a DPS trinket, we got 4 casters and you dropped an ultimatum right as we're ready to go. Go fuck yourself."
---
Raid leader is an idiot.
---
If you kill the mob on the chest people can't ninja it...
---
Is it a druid to the right? If so is it the Warden Staff I see?
---
Yeah but it has low dmg early on
---
They already screwed up many things in vanilla. The game isn‚Äôt perfect. It never has been. These imperfections should be ironed out. An immediate one that comes to mind is that **druids can not see their mana whilst shifted**, and requires an *addon* to fix. Another one is the debuff cap on mobs, which only serves to fuck up many classes. As a druid I can‚Äôt even use half of my ability set in raids. My rotation instead boils down to almost purely shred spam. Issues such as these need fixed.
---
i did :)
---
The exploit was a bug in vanilla and in classic
---
Hellfire has low chance of breaking roots, Blizzard can't crit, Arcane explosion has meh crits, roots usually broken before cast finishes.
---
Nothing worse than seeing a warlock too afraid to press hellfire instead uses his shitty rain of fire that does as much damage as blowing sand in the opponents face, use that hellfire and never stop warlocks
---
what dou you mean you havent learned it past rank 3?
---
22 in 3 days seems like a pretty normal pace. It only gets slower as you level up.
---
Not even using Egan's Blaster, for shame.
---
What gear did people use back in vanilla? I've been looking at the comments on the current BIS Fury Warrior items, and its so funny reading comments from people saying they got called a ninja for needing what is now known as the BIS items.
---
You can still heal dungeons as shadow until you get into the 50s.  Shadow on classic is a utility class that most tattoos just bring one of.
---
the auto dismount when doing something is pretty high on that list as well
---
Can also do it at lvl 60 without being a rogue, just jump down from the stairs up top and tap W to the lock and out again as you go through the mobs so you can be extra careful.
---
Druid would be dope because you have some versatility. I would suggest mage or warrior tho. If your looking for a big change of pace pally is good class some people just feel like they‚Äôre very slow which would be weird coming from a rogue.
---
It‚Äôs not. This gets posted every time there is a update to the Classic WoW time.
---
Ooooh I see. So we're basically "making use of" dying by walking to the dungeon while vanish is ticking down its cooldown.
---
Congratulations, you got played. Enjoy the reality TV that you think is real
---
At least we have addon for that.
---
Not only that. He used the hanging body as a prop. A young man had hung himself the same morning, and he just stood there laughing, filming and shotting pictures for his thumbnail.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel too. I can say with truth I‚Äôd let the guy roll on it or even better agree to split earnings 50/50. The guy is in my guild and we see a lot of each other so it will be a bit awkward now hah
---
&gt;ended up running past him a few minutes later and he /spit on me
---
that's hilarious
---
That's really strange, i wonder why that is different, maybe just server? I'm on Flamelash
---
Well done, fellow nurse, well done!!!
---
Upvote for spelling
---
There\`s a lvl 45 quest in Tanaris to kill pirates. as a reward, you get either good caster boots or a tank plate helmet. Another quest right there (return the rum that pirates stole) has a followup that gives you really good plate boots.
---
That's the classic spirit I like to see. Awesome :)
---
First, I follow this chart [https://nhi.no/familie/barn/nar-skal-barnet-legge-seg/](https://nhi.no/familie/barn/nar-skal-barnet-legge-seg/) to see when given age should go to bed, and if they should have a nap in the day.
---
Second I follow a philosophy. The more they sleep (up to whats suggested in the table), the more they get to play video games (up to whatever maximum is appropriate).
---
Also communicate with your children. If they feel like they are treated fairly, they will not be so frustrated. If your children dont know what is expected of them, and or think they are treated unfairly, they will only be son of a bitches because the parents are bitches.
---
The light thing, what helps is communicate why the light is up all night, get a globe and a lamp, good place to teach. And get light blocking curtains.
---
Also the trick to get them to eat vegetables, is to get them to help out making the food. Including picking vegies out, and cutting them, and if applicable, boil/steam them. Let them pick from a variaty of colors, and introduce some at a time if that helps. And no desert if they dont eat a healthy meal. (I was surprised how well this worked when watching over my nephew for over a month)
---
Lastly the mantra of Norwegian child rearing is no corporal punishment, no psychological terror. Only remove privileges. I find videogames and desert (both huge dopamine machines), highly effective. As long as you communicate to your children honestly.
---
it also helps that the only pieces of shaman t1 to be bis are gloves for elemental and helmet for restoration.
---
The guy is just collecting unwanted loot.
---
Grats on the +3% mount speed!
---
Yeah I will not stand for this slander of the best blue boy.
---
 Tiny thing, I noticed the buffs are greyed out at 10 min duration remaining and gradually gets lighter as the 10 mins goes by, instead of the intended opposite, I wish I knew how to fix this myself!! Hah.
---

But they are helping the grp the same as the other DPS.  Yes that class has the potential to fulfill other roles but so? That in no way means that the player using that class enjoys those roles and that has nothing to do with skill.  I dislike healing, so my druid was always feral or boom.  Sure I'd off heal if needed mid dung/raid but if you asked me to main heal the inst I'd refuse.  Doesn't reflect on my skill, just my preferred play style.  Same for tank/DPS classes.
---
Wutz
---
Ravager is a pre raid bis at lvl 60?! Or whats the pre raid bis from sm armory?
---
The irony is they moan about being ganked.
---
I learned this one today when one of my group members were crying about losing potential loot drops. /soothe .... /soothe
---
nice
---
So.. I play on an oceanic server. I have a business trip to Germany coming up next week. I plan to take my gaming laptop with me. Is it okay to log in the game from Germany ? I hear stories of people getting banned just for logging in from suspicious places.
---
Not going to forget the 28 dwarf warrior who went around fishing in wetlands/hillsbrad. He dressed himself super casually with a fisherman hat and all, and went up to these three hordies all fishing in peace, and said "Leave, now, or face me wrath, ya sacks o shite" and began punching at the 50 tauren and his two 30 something buddies. 
---
They got up and made space for him too. I was genuinely impressed. Must be hard for him to travel with such gigantic balls of steel...
---
Thanks!
---
Now for some fresh air!
---
I'm having trouble describing how dumb what you just said was.
---
If you're going to engage in pvp, or any kind of fight, you should do so with honor. If you suckerpunch someone, and then run away once its a real fight, you're a coward.
---
If you're okay with being a coward, then i guess there need not be said more here.
---
Just think once before you post please
---
I cleaned BRD yesterday. At the end , a trash agro Moira and we killed her (before taurisan was agro). Only one guy could loot the body, i heard that you have to do a quest before you can loot her, someone have the name of the quest ? (or the steps to do ?)  
---
Moira got agro by a trash, so we didn't really have a choice to kill or not kill her .. i don't really unerstand
---
Damn straight. And give me Wrath with the plague pre-event a couple years after that. I'd be just fine redoing all of it.
---
Wow that totally doesn't make you an arsehole.
---
what you have right now is Disengage, its basically a threat lowering strike. similar to rogue's feint. 
---
Feign Death is indeed level 30 :)
---
My friend is on his 4th sixty. He was helping me level on our mains while leveling two other characters in other windows at the same time. Dudes a beast.
---
A couple days ago had 2 ppl in the middle of BFD just say "damn have to go", dropped group and hearthed out.  No reason was given.
---
I couldn't even do this and I have loads of free time.
---
"Casual" indeed.
---
A lvl 34 spell?
---
I bought flurry axe for 145g and got thrash blade. I am, the destroyer
---
The main issue I feel for tanks is knowing the instance. You are basically leading the party, so need to know where you are going. This is classic, so there are countless numbers of videos on youtube of each instance. Also there are loads of addons for instance maps too. So I'd say have a wee view of a couple of vids before you head off into an instance. 
---
Once there, use all your abilities, you need to keep aggro, so use sunder, and demo shout, to grab the mobs. You can also switch targets and hit other mobs if there are more than 1 pull, you can tab between targets to gain aggro on all. 
---
in all honest, I'd tell the group you are new to wow and new to tanking, ask them for help or advice as you are playing. Tanks are hard to come by so they'll be happy to help (or at least 1-2 in the group will). Also tell them you've not run these instances, and not 100% sure where you are going.  There are so many helpful players, who'll be happy to help you. 
---
Also, get in a guild and ask the higher level players for advice.
---
Well, our personal experiences differ. Doesn't make either one of us right, or wrong. I believe 95% of wpvp are revenge kills, but against random members of the opposite faction, thus linking to the victim taking revenge on a random member of the opposite faction and so on.
---
Although yesterday I did get into a fight (and kill) a druid over a fadeleaf node ü§£.
---
Engineering for a hunter is a must

---
I heard mention somewhere that addons dont have access to 3D space and thus cannot float the numbers above the target. Only in 2D UI space. Thats why there is no addon that does this. 
---
I share your pain.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4363](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=4363)
---
Figured most people were at least in their 50s now.
---
you can definitely see this by the succes of games like rimworld, where most players actually NEVER reach the end-game (building their space ship and escaping), and still play again and again, always having their colonies die to a raid or catastrophic event, and this is know as "fun"
---
If it wasn't for the first weeks crashes and massive queues in general, i would have been even faster. This is not new content we're doing. During 4 weeks, i capped both professions and had gold for Warden Staff too. 
---
For a new player, yeah it'll take longer. My played was 135h spread to 4 weeks (Druid)
---
Im a warlock 270 skinning and tailoring, should i drop skinning for enginering or not?
---
Hammer isn't MUCH worse (esp. if you\`re going Fury) and being able to stand out might be worth it.
---
If you check out https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/50941/7
---
You can see that it even gives extra threat for buffing pets!
---
This might actually happen to one of our shamans, just because we have only had 1 for the past 3 reset :/ shamans are a rare sight these days.. oh well T1 for shamans is noice!
---
I literally had to server change from Grob to Deviate Delight (offered for free) because I was trying to get Broken Tooth and there would be 2-3 hunters sitting in Badlands at literally every hour of the day.
---
4 AM on a Wednesday. There were people. I couldn't take it anymore.
---
Deviate Delight has been a lot more relaxed and less drama, also I finally got the fucking stupid cat.
---
I'm a level 40 mage who hasn't replaced any of my gear in about 15-20 levels (still using emberstone staff and astral blouse)... Is there a list of gear I should try to have at each level?
---
I plan on making hunter my next toon. Can you provide more info?
---
The average player will needs 10 days /played to reach 60. If the halfway point is 44 that means by now you have already played around 4-5 days.
---
lets say 4,5
---
35 days from release= 840hr
---
4.5 /played x24=108hr
---
70hr work a week=350hr
---
6 hours of sleep=210hr
---
That leaves you 172 hours to cook, eat,shit, have a bath, spend time with family, spend time with friends, hobbies etc.
---
Yeah you are a casual player and I am just terrible at the game.
---
Manually ignoring half of the server‚Äôs population is a bit of a hassle.
---
I've got one level 30!
---
YUP
---
Yes, walk closer to target
---
You shouldn't be able to message someone on BNet unless they also add you, just ridiculous and a broken mechanic, how long till gold trade bots start doing this in throwaway BNet accounts?
---
I have to say I'm impressed by your leveling speed!
---
After playing for \~6days, my main is level 41 (a hunter as well), and I have one level 10 mage. I've been taking my time, leveling fishing, cooking, first aid, alchemy, herbalism. Quite at or over 225 with each of them.
---
Props to you. I'd like to level up my mage alt too, I guarantee you'll not see me aoe unless maybe I am alone and questing or something.
---
Have fun my dude!
---
Not any version that I've tried. Closest result was one were I got the icon around the minimap, but nothing else.
---
Mmm, you don‚Äôt even need a spec to level in retail. Try the same in a Classic.
---
I suggest trying pvp realm instead of licking each others balls about how smart it was to play on pve one repeating stereotypes ; - )
---
wouldnt risk it
---
Does /special work again?
---
I'd level your mining, anyway. Iron and mithril sell well, and you're about to start running into them frequently.
---
You don't even have to use [abilitynamehere] if the ability tooltip you want is named in the following function.
---
What a twist! haha
---
whell,there are no Sound folder anywhere in WoW folders.
---
I think that is the case, esp for weapons since it directly impacts their dmg and isn't just a stat stick. Even damage taken is probably more noticable since they're always taking damage in fights from being up close
---
Sluttiness can be fun...
---
I am on a PvP realm. Flamelash-EU represent baby!
---
How you get the camera so high up like this?
---
it lasts until some one accidentally aggros a mob too
---
Minimum level 39 for the vanq sword quest tho, dont waste your trip to sw!
---
Saudi Arabian intensifies
---
You respec TO prot at 60, not FROM it.
---
Idk if it‚Äôs just bigglesworth but a lot of people on that server are entitled af.
---
I don't know that one, but silver dragon works pretty good, along with unitscan just to be sure
---
To be honest it's quite some downtime for manaregen if you have to conjure water 10 times in a row because you can only conjure X amount of water per cast.
---
"Time is money, friend!"
---
Bro I'm lv53 and I have half your gold. 
---
I'm beginning to regret taking Mining/Engineering.
---
Its prolly in the 40s. I was by no measure a try hard nor hardcore player. I just knew what the fuck I'm doing. 
---
Getting real tired of all the casuals in this sub having no fucking clue what has actually happened in-game and what it takes to get there but they love to keep fucking talk about it. To those people: Don't limit others by your own standards. Just because you can't doesn't mean others can't.
---
Also: my mates who got into the game for their very first time 2 weeks ago, dinged 44 and 52 today. So maybe, you're just bad.
---
I completely forgot about "w00t" .. I remember seeing it alot
---
Dreadmist-EU is hit and miss, one druid might help you along with a mob, one might try to savage you.
---
Who cares about layering? I simply posted this for discussion. The amount of people who called this server dead through my last few posts a week ago, clearly it‚Äôs not. I understand how layering works and why Ironforge looks ‚Äúmore populated‚Äù on Heartseeker than other high/full pop servers. 
---
Also, the horde population is drastically increasing. It‚Äôs a really great server.
---
There's plenty of 50-51 mobs to grind for the quests, and a lot of item gathering like soil, petals or crystals. You should be alright :)
---
and a greater one at that
---
Kirtonos was very heavy on Horde
---
Unless you're on a low population server, someone is *always* running dungeons. Most people find groups in the City Trade chats or just /join lookingforgroup. I've been using [this](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d1tkrr/all_dungeons_by_minmax_mob_level_for_best_exp/) guide posted by another user to see what dungeons I have available at my level range and then I check the individual [Classic Wowhead](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/scarlet-monastery-classic-dungeon)dungeon guides, like this one for Scarlet Monastery. It'll tell you which boss drops what loot, which quests you can complete, where to go, etc. Can't recommend it enough!
---
Definitely populated though
---
I too work as an IT Specialist, have a girlfriend, no kids but a busy social life, and i just hit 60 last night with 750g to my name.  
---
I think the clear disadvantage here is the kids - those fuckers have got you behind on levelling and behind on gold! But hey, when you cap you've got some extra hands to help do you an hour of SM grinding!  
---
\*We're not so different you and i .jpg\*
---
bloodthirst is not where your damage comes from. Your main dmg from fury is autos and the higher you hit the more rage you get also
---
Get prowl and run instances with him on passive.
---
right? i mean everything is fun (at least to me)
---
but as a new player I get the most satisfaction/fun from finding new places, learning the world, doing intresting quests
---
for example rn Im following leveling guide and it was dope when the guide took me to darkshore where I didnt go at all on my previous toon
---
I'm a level 57 horde warlock and I was wondering: are there any more must do quests on my way to 60 (Bis, Attunement, novelty items, keys)? As in: quests i'll have to do anyway so might aswell get the xp.  
---
The ones I know of or i'm currently on/completed:  
---
\- The Royal Rescue  
---
\- Attunement to the Core  
---
\- Ony Attunement  
---
\- Linken chain
---
Depends what do you enjoy more, slow simple play style or harder fast more skill based one? If first choose classic if latter choose bfa.
---
It kinda is. People will be happy to be in group with you.
---
Do you hear that? Retail is calling for you...
---
Everyone cares because it's a bad choice to wear any green agi/stam combination would be better and ofc you can handle mobs 3/4 levels above you, buts not due to those shoulders. 
---
I guess what ppl triggers the most is probably that they assume you rolled them of a warrior/shaman who could have used them better. 
---
Tbh I thought maybe you didn't know that strength is worthless for a hunter, so I wanted to let you know. Maybe I should have put it in a nicer way.
---
It isn‚Äôt spam, it is not self promotion, I do not own winter, I am simply a part of it. There‚Äôs a difference. I won‚Äôt apologize for trying to find people to play with. If you see something you don‚Äôt like, it is quite possible to keep scrolling. And also, rules are set in place for a reason, and if you think these rules are hard to follow then winter isn‚Äôt something you should be apart of. Child like behavior isn‚Äôt tolerated. Have a good day.
---
great, thank you, will check it out next.
---
Yes, "missing buff" keep blinking even when AoE versions are up.
---
It's part of the DejaClassicStats Addon, it's a great addon but I dislike that part aswell.
---
Yeah I always really hated it
---
You only posts this to subreds and by reddits rules it's promotion.
---
Grats! Why did you grind rock dudes? Are the drops highly sellable? On my server, elemental earth sells for like 12 silver.
---
Yeah around lvl 30 I got a blue necklace and a 12 slot bag in one chest! It does happen, sometimes you just get some copper and some cheese tho
---
Quote: In addition, we‚Äôve also identified a fix for a separate issue that was causing Battle Shout and most healing spells, effects, and buffs to incorrectly split the threat they generate between enemies that had members of the buffed party on their threat list.
---
So they used to incorrectly split, but now what do they do?
---
It would be nice to get a warrior in to test this with a threat meter, or are threat meters not working on direct data from blizzard but on estimates? I never understood how they work.
---
Poor vegans
---
Classic. It‚Äôs like the dark souls version.
---
Whaa Whaa ninja looters fuck sake stop all the whinging.
---
Play whatever you want. If you would like to go back to the glory days of vanilla go to classic,its not that fast paced like Retail but you feel like youre getting better rewards Everytime a gear drops.
---
Thats not the case with retail. You'll get improvements over your gear quickly and leveling is easy and fast. While you get lvl 6 in classic with about one hour playing, while you get i think about lvl 20 or so in retail.
---
I‚Äôve played up until WotLK and again in MoP. Returned for Classic, tried to make a retail character as well, but didn‚Äôt even recognise the game.
---
I‚Äôm not sure I like it now. A lot of things have changed, and it‚Äôs way too easy. Almost can‚Äôt die even if you try, can‚Äôt run out of mana.
---
We are not OSRS, stop asking about this.
---
Not happening.
---
At level 40 you are able to get items with Spellpower, which is you best stat for leveling. Check out this list:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/items/min-req-level:38/max-req-level:60/class:8/group-by:slot?filter=123;2;1#items:0+3+19
---
The Dreamweave Chest/Gloves are very nice for example. If you got the cash (i.e. already bought your mount), you could also try to get "..of Frozen Wrath" items from the AH (I assume you are Frost spec for leveling). However, those can be very expensive.
---
However, in general there is no obligation to upgrade your stuff. Your leveling will be a bit slower, but if you're fine with that, save your money for epic mount and raid consumables. Once you hit level 55, start to look into your pre-raid BiS list (https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/mage-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow) to see what you want from dungeons.
---
Look at all that empty space in those bags :)))
---
.........theres like a million reasons linux will ask for your root pass to do shit.
---
Pretty much the same as UAC
---
Classic. But you asked on the Classic subreddit so what did you expect?
---
Missing /golfclap

Angerforge runs are usually arena-&gt;angerforge-&gt;golem  they take 12-15 minutes so you can just skim by the dungeon cap. Typically ran by 1 caster dps (for the belt/boots), 1 healer (for trinket/boots/pants), and 3 retards fighting for aggro and a Hand of Justice/Savage Gladiator Chain
---
1 - Yes, indeed I do. My backpack and a 14-slot bag are full of items for different purposes. So in addition to the items I'm wearing, I'm carrying around about 30 items.
---
2 - I'm currently level 51 but I started with that habit as soon as I got my first different greens at around level 12 or so. Back then with macros because ItemRack didn't work for Classic at that point.
---
3 - Yes, I actually do that. I know it's not always necessary but I really like the flexibility of being able to switch between pulls if the situation presents itself.
---
4 - Well, yes. I try to keep them well organized to make the remaining bag-slots as efficient as I can. Not more than 2 slots per type of consumables I might want to use. I know there's an addon that allows you to set a hotkey to press while you have your bags open to show what has the lowest vendor-price. I need to get that.
---
To sum it up: It is indeed a sacrifice I make in order to maximize my versatility. But that's what I picked druid for afterall so I'm willing to make that sacrifice.
---
At Level 38 I probably also already had at least my backpack full with additional gear but likely even a few slots of a 2nd bag tapped.
---
I‚Äôve been doing this for months and haven‚Äôt had one single issue. If Reddit‚Äôs deems my post not fit, it will be removed.
---
Will try this out later and report back!
---
NugEnergy
---
It was so obviously sarcasm. Guess it went above your wee head.
---
I saw something on the official forums about a bug where AoE textures were flickering.
---
They suggested to  set anti-Aliasing to MSAA 2x or lower.
---
I got my first 60 then went straight onto making a Warrior.. The lack of tanks at end game content forced my hand tbh, currently level 36 on my Warrior
---
"brb home on fire"
---
"I'm projecting feelings onto other people"
---
Just trying to make a statement that no server is good / bad. There are definitely assholes on RP servers but all we hear and get upvoted are these rainbow puppy stories.
---
So almost 16 hours per day?
---
Level a tank. They are always needed. Depending on faction and what you want to do at endgame either warrior or paladin. Warrior if you want to raid - paladin if you just want to do dungeons. Have fun bud!
---
In the day Zandalar Tribe is med pop and its really hard to find raid groups
---
F for anyone who rolls mage now that the Torch Room has been patched, I got from 55-59 in a single day doing that Torch room shit
---
I have been asking for full pvp server since 2014 - server where you can raid cities, where guards does not respawn out of thin air with sick rate, but rather respawn like regular mobs. Server where there is no safe place, where horde can kill every player and npc in Goldshire and block the town for hours, causing massive world pvp battle like in Alterac Mountains. Server where events like in EVE Online are possible. Just one server Blizz, one tiny change to guard respawn rates. (now it's so stupid that when you attack one NPC, 258 guards spawn). Give players freedom they deserve. Just one server to rule them all.
---
The real question on everyone's lips is what's a human doing riding a Jodi?
---
It may be but people always find the modt optimal way to play and there will always be a new meta, for me personally i love the aoe runs just because i want to reach 60 fast
---
People play this game to have fun. If they dont like tanking you're not entitled to them fulfilling that role.
---
Ah dude, we've all been there. You log in. You see the little envelope in the corner. You get excited, you run to the mailbox.... and find 1/100th of what you were expecting waiting for you.
---
It's just one of those things, sucks but shit happens.
---
If you're AFK, you're AFK....
---
You really feel like a master of the wilds. Someone who can traverse and survive out there better than anyone. I love that. 
---
I mainly play Warrior, but enjoy somewhat the same feeling. Just preparing to head out by getting the right consumables, seeing if I can find some upgrades to my equipment.
---
Look, I'm aware most people wait till 60 or dont do it at all, but I love low-key rping by myself. My character just going on this fantastic journey around the world, becoming more and more experienced and growing stronger and more capable. I sometimes just stop by inns to sit down, drink, eat, rest by the fire for a bit before heading back out again. I have him dress more comfortably at inns or as he works on his professions. Then armor up once it's time to hit the road.
---
I ALWAYS log out at some place I find it feasible for him to camp/sleep/rent a room for the night at. It's so cozy. So nice. I missed how large and alive the world of classic felt.
---
The beautiful thing about the AH cut as an inflation stopper is that it scales with inflation, so the higher inflation the more money it takes out.
---
No? It‚Äôs not a must have, it‚Äôs a nice and compliments it well, but it‚Äôs by no means a must unless you‚Äôre at an extremely high level of PVP, as you‚Äôre asking if you need engineering, no offence, but I‚Äôd imagine you‚Äôre not there yet
---
I‚Äôd recommend getting to grips with your character, practice the PvP and see where situations arise where engineering would have won you the fight, when you start seeing those situations and find you had a window to actually use it, then move to engineering, but don‚Äôt neglect understanding what your class can and can‚Äôt do if you‚Äôre newer to PvP I would say
---
Just my opinion though, ultimately, do what makes you happy! I hate feeling forced into a play style aha
---
Haha nice though. Yeh well I'm away this week on holiday so I can't play. It's doing my head in üòÇ glad you got to play ya bastad
---
*You feel normal.*
---
EZ water earned :)
---
Making three alts at the same time with only one other person to manage them is pretty hardcore.
---
If you‚Äôre mounted for example and try to use the flight master, does it dismount you automatically and fly off straight away, or do you need to click to dismount then click again to start flying?
---
Wow, there really is an addon for everything!
---
Now I've got my mount maybe it's time to get my tailoring up to craft some new gear
---
Actually i‚Äôd be all for it for one main reason - the more geared your raid team gets the less people you need to bring. 
---
Our guild is aiming to do MC 30 man by the end of month and pushing the limits, idk how far we can go but 25-manning the raids is probably the best way to get gear.
---
never expierenced your type of clipping, the only clipping I know is when you use something with cast time like multi oder aimed
---
You can just take the level of the enemy x5 to get the required skinning skill you need to have (except for enemies  under lvl 20)
---
This is the best site for gear upgrades. Also, you can filter out World Drops, because who cares if there's a 2x better item if its droprate is 0.04% from a bunch of mobs in Swamp of Sorrows or whatever.
---
Had a guy in a dungeon yesterday, he was new to the game and genuinely didn't know about the whole Need/Greed thing. Let's not stress out about it too much especially when it's just a green :)
---
I know that the druid isn't ideal in any role in PvE but decent in two of them with some unique capabilities that makes them worth to bring regardless.
---
But my long-term-goal is PvP anyways. And in this regard I feel there is no "fighting uphill" for the druid. Druid can do things in PvP that noone else can and is clearly the best in certain scenarios. A healer with stealth, that cannot be sheeped, that can get out of all snares and can basically escape from almost anyone with a long ranged instant-attack that can interrupt people from tapping, prevent rogues from stealthing, has an outdoor-CC. I think druids are totally amazing and super usefull in all three battlegrounds.
---
Not being the best in any particular kind of thing in PvE seems a small price to play for having such a potent PvP-class rich in amazing tools for survival and support.
---
How the hell you have 98? I am a mage 38lvl and I have about 3g. I train only the essential skills and I never buy weapons/armors from AH.
---
Awww! So wholesome
---
doesnt this have waay to much hit? If you have precision and weapon spec you dont need this much hit from gear
---
Garbage guild, i got harrased and left
---
You are a legend tysm I was foreal going crazy
---
I wish that guilds would recruit like this: Hold recruitment drives. The Guild Leader sets days of the week that are for recruitment. While out and about playing the game, everybody needs to be scoping out cool people. When said people are found, you ... you know... talk to them, and see if they want to join up. 
---
I've never, and never will be, a fan of joining a random guild that whispers me a paragraph. Like, every single guild that I joined that did that was terrible. Good guilds don't need to recruit random people. They find their members themselves. You know.... they actually put in some WORK for their guild. Then again... I don't think anybody does this. I just think its how it should be done.
---
Ugh. Sorry to be blunt but you are the greedy one. You want a reroll or split of sales for something that you weren't in attendence for. Not grouping with him again because he got something while you were afk is just spiteful as fuck.
---
And those drop from first bosses, why enduring the whole run?
---
On the other hand maybe he‚Äôs learned some manners. Being a dick to everyone doesn‚Äôt work well, neither in Azeroth nor in rl.
---
Ironically, adding honor system will make people less honorable.
---
HoJ could drop in the other city dungeon.
---
Just imagine if Gnomeregan would be the end game dungeon, and BRD the level up one.
---
Statements that generalize the entire faction are absolutely stupid.
---
I have met plenty of Pussies on both sides.
---
Just don't spend all the gold on the spells. Save for the mount now.
---
I will absolutely end up grinding that out when I get there.  Did it on my retail account, and have always loved that cat.
---
But it‚Äôs a whole week without wow otherwise
---
üòÇ he‚Äôs everywhere....
---
Hi, hehe was about to ask you why a different server. 
---
Well, I understand the feel. Also, why would you not start another char, if you don't feel you want to play with the old one (except maybe do some dungeons and raids).
---
Too bad it has to be on a different server though! Hope you make good friends and ejnoy the ride!
---
Omfg me with Dungeons. It's like nope I am not running back I rather just chill
---
&gt;addon
---
isnat that DejaClassicStats ?
---
Maybe if one of them is full deck in  shaman preBiS and specced BM,and his pet tanks
---
I just hit 52 and i have 850g in my bank , rdy for my 100% when i hit 60, you FILTHY yes thats right CASUALS
---
My friend had it the other way around - his parents used to farm him gold and mats so he could raid with all the best stuff
---
The one with the least customers at the time because i feel sorry for him. Don't want him to believe he is a worse auctioneer.
---
You can disable it.
---
Imagine smack talking rogues at their weakest.
---
This is why I refuse to take any mage water or food unless Mages agree to let me pay them in return, be it with money, a favor, some help, or some crafting/enchanting quid pro quo
---
&gt;if you don't have work
---
Depends on your life, really. I don't live with my girlfriend, and as a mid-20's guy, no pets, no other games that really hold my interests, and my friends and whatnot only have time in the weekends, typically. I work ~40 hours/week I have no real obligations outside of that. So 8 hours of sleep, 8 hours of work, and ~30 mins travel to and from work. That's a solid 7 hours and 30 mins of spare time every day, even more if you cut into your sleep schedule.
---
Not everyone considers their time as "nothing". If you do, you're just not taking opportunity costs into account.
---
As a mage player myself, I asked and tipped higher level mages for water, and bought some from the vendor when none were conveniently available. Usually 1 gold for 3-6 stacks of lvl 35/45. Even when you get a new rank a water, 2 per cast adds an insane amount of downtime. Crafting a few stacks for someone else? 
---
Sometimes, I hand out food/drink to low-level players. It's not much for me and it helps them.
---
But if they actively ask for it?
---
They gotta pay for my time. No, it's not a lot - 20 silver per stack of water is barely enough to cover mage's opportunity costs. Same for portals. Yes, a rune is 18 silver, and if you come to me, 40 silver is a fair portal price. I appreciate people who tip more than that, of course.
---
As a questing priest, I always offer to pay. Pure and simple. Just ask for cheaper than vendors because THAT'S the real rip off üòÇüòÇ
---
Haha, considering we live in a company apartment I think my wife would realize if I were fired because we would also be evicted. Also, she doesn't speak English so I'm not sure this post would even reach her.
---
dEd GaEm
---
Why is this making laugh so much.
---
I mean I tried justifying it by saying he could have died and got combat ressed by a Druid but it‚Äôs still hilarious lol.
---
Welp I know what to do when I need that money lol thanks &lt;3
---
I'm trying to turn on floating combat points through AIO. I've changed it in the last tab in the interface options but it doesn't appear to work. Do I need to console command it instead or set it up in the files before loading?  
---
AIO = Advanced Interface Options.  
---
TIA
---
Okay so, this reminded me of something weird that happened today. I play a Druid named Potatos. I was questing in the barrens when a troll hunter 5 levels below me ran by called "Potatosdad". Like, wtf? That had to be someone that saw my character name (knowingly misspelled) and made it like that on purpose. Really weird.
---
All the tissu and the staff from Shadowfang, then you got a staff upgrade at Blackfathom Depths and a pant.
---
After that there's some loots here and there but the next big upgrade is either the staff in the Library, or the dagger from library with the off hand from the graveyard. Then you got the hat and the necklace from cathedral.
---
After that the next step is to start grabbing pre BiS in BRD.
---
Many are leaving.
---
Because Mirahs song is better for tanking.
---
Part time job at a university+freelancer+company owner+writing on my second book+gf in parental leave+6month old baby+only playing with gf (except some mining) = Level 13 after 3 weeks
---
But feels great being in Westfall since one week :D
---
Well, yeah, but it's almost like a 10 minute hike on foot from IF center every time you go, where as they can just teleport from Orgrimmar once they have done the quest.
---
I'm conserving CDs as much as possible to make it a bit interesting, with the limited footage I had (1 hour of wpvp more or less) I thought that 1. Seeing a guy just CBing people to death would be even more boring, that's why I added the silly distracts too and 2. I would end up with less footage to chose from.  
---
Next one will have some quality content with proper dueling, 1v2s etc. Thanks for your input and support.
---
im using this but when i sometimes go from def stance to bstance it keeps shield on rather than equipping both 1h weps
---
Well, seeing as you run this dungeon with randoms, I guess your whole point is moot. However, everyone should be getting gear at the same rate; that will have them most impact on a group's performance.
---
it is an all or nothing set if you remove just one part it is no longer BiS.
---
He fucked up ever since he started casting a max rank frostbolt on someone that is mounted up and running towards them. Either r1 frostbolt or just poly the paladin and start blasting from a distance.
---
After that the paladin stuns him and he iceblocks?? He could've blinked out of the stun and gain some distance in the process. 
---
Then the paladin uses freedom aura and he tries to nova... 
---
Then he runs into a mob mindlessly.
---
He doesn't use CoC to get distance from the mob and paladin as his aura wore off.
---
He doesnt iceblock the paladins bubble (he could have used cold snap).
---
Basically he fucked up at every turn. Only thing he did right was to knpw how to press fireblast.
---
There's a reason for it, a damn good one.
---
Fun fact! I think its a girl. A warlock friend of mine got a debuff which turned  him (and his minion) into humanoids, and the void walker turned into a human female. Although this could be janky blizz coding at work.
---
So, you want to stop playing mage because of the downtimes... to play warrior? The _one_ class which is literally one big downtime from 1 to 60?
---
So 1.5 tier pieces each?
---
Hey man, can u please write in details how to do relog reset? I did like everyone do on streams but that did not work
---
It probably has way more stam, making it better for pvp
---
&gt; going oom after 2-3 kills 
---
cries in mage
---
U have 2 shamana? This guy games
---
This is so cool of you guys :)
---
Well, you can't win if they have any idea what they're doing. Just get used to it for now.
---
Later get some free action potions and maybe level engineering, that'll do the trick.
---
Literally full time nurse, both irl / in game !
---
40 hour work week and 8 hours of sleep leave you with 8 hours of free time to do whatever.
---
They're really annoying to fight as a Warrior, that's what. :p
---
Warrior has the most downtime and worst leveling speed of any class.
---
I mean, nothing really bad happened to the guy. Not really karma
---
Great name
---
And I oop!
---
Shit, you're right. I always get them mixed up.
---
I'm not going to ruin my vision straining to read a goddamned cell phone picture when you could upload a screenshot.
---
I'm curious about what bis list you're talking about since the ones I've seen have plenty of earthfury and even list it as bis if you have the full set.
---
I needed this, thank you.
---
It‚Äôs also other skills including frost bolt could there be a reason why? Is that how light is projected in this game?
---
Filthy casual that's why
---
I don't doubt ppl are doing that but it is not something trivial to spend all your non-work time on a game. I feel like I played way too much and I am only 50.
---
I think the client runs their anti cheat software
---
The seller of the computer provided me this picture, so sorry, let me transcribe it.
---
Dude get a spirit set and the add-on wardrobe to swap between sets. When you drink swap sets to spirit. Downtime is nil if you get enough spirit pieces.
---
Ah yeah, they block and heal all the time.
---
I feel like amorphous shadow demons probably don't have genders. Then again elementals apparently do so who knows.
---
Yes! I forgot about that!
---
Completely irrelevant. On our server. No one farms it solo here, or at all for that matter, aside from few top guilds.
---
I once used spell lock on an ape grinding mage that was channeling blizzard. Watching him stand there confused as he got mowed down was satisfying.
---
I should upload a timelapse of Retail Ironforge. I could just post a picture and nobody would be the wiser =)
---
Wouldn't know, never been in it. I just saw the name, thought it was pretty stupid, and left it at that. :)
---
??? Are you trying to claim that classic is hard because skill points exist? And because retail is also easy, but faster?
---
There is a huge difference between difficult and tedious. Classic is not difficult. At all.
---
So far I am only level 14 on my 2nd char(mage) but I am enjoying being able to kill mobs safely and quickly compared to my warrior. hopefully that negates the player issue
---
Mob grinding is your friend.
---
Idk man. Just feel like I‚Äôm missing out on so much of the fun without a guild.
---
Hi - did you work out how to do this? I cant figure it out either?
---
What‚Äôs that dwarf doing in there?
---
Do what you enjoy...
---
Dungeons for pre-raid bis, or kill mobs for end-game mats. Really isn't  that bad.
---
Nah, but I have 3 level 30's and a couple level 20's...
---
That is one way to look at it. Is it ok to expect the warlock to summon the whole group/party then? No different to the guy that quests/idles in cities expecting a summon rather than travelling like the rest of us.
---
The ones hurting the group is the ones refusing to pay for the better (nearly double) water / more mana over time causing more downtime and stopping me from being able to DPS imo. 
---
Just how its gonna be from the different POV's.
---
I'm using my 60 Druid to powerboost my multibox Shaman/Hunter/Mage through Dungeons. Works like a charm!
---
I don't think that's true. Some, of course, but not many. Queues are decreasing mostly from server transfers, evidence by the fact that low pop servers are rarely ever low pop anymore, when they always were the first couple weeks. The population is spreading out more between servers, but overall concurrent players I doubt has dropped more than 15%, and won't go much lower than that. 
---
Which is concerning, as without layers, it means 90% of servers will experience significant queue times, permanently.
---
there's literally no reason to roll greed on BoE epics
---
Fair enough!
---
Name of the bag addon?
---
I am claiming the leveling experience is more difficult. Try it and you‚Äôll see. Having played both I can attest to the ease of both.
---
If you hug the side of the boat it still carries you along while swimming
---
Lmao
---
On my realm(Tribe) it seems SW is for the below 60's and the rp'ers and IF is for the 60's both are busy as hell with multiple layers. when an ony head is about to be popped and a couple of raid teams are gathered in SW for the buff plus the normal crowd my pc begins to cry a lil bit.
---
In my experience people with many alts never last, they just dont know what the fuck they want and quit eventually
---
If by "15 bars" you mean "15 levels" then that's not how rested xp works. The max rested xp is 1.5 levels, or 30 mini bars. 
---
Mage downtime gets better at mid-40s, but you still have to drink. If no downtime is important to you then mage isn't for you. I agree it's annoying, but console myself with the fact mage kills everything so much faster then most classes, and can easily kill 10+ mobs at once. Overall mages are very fast levellers in spite of the downtime. 
---
Warrior would be the worst choice if you're trying to avoid downtime. You'll end up killing slower, being able to handle far less mobs at a time, whilst eating constantly. May as well stick with your druid, or roll warlock/shadow priest/hunter, all of which can chain pull without ever stopping.
---
As a Tauren, I do not know what you are talking about...
---
You didn't help killing the fucking mob who dropped it, so of course the loot is his. What are you on about?
---
Is it me or is there an abundance of healers in classic? I‚Äôve been struggling to find groups as one for dungeons. Part of the reason I rolled a priest was fast grouping, but I often find I have a quicker chance of getting grouped up if I advertise as a dps. Yesterday I was one of THREE priests in a SFK group lol.
---
I miss Ironforge so much. Horde this time...
---
Honest question to the people who say ‚Äúlayering is definitive gone in phase 2‚Äù
---
Why would blizzard remove layering if the servers are still full. Doesn‚Äôt layering go hand in hand with the server population?
---
Sounds more liken a confident guess on their part that phase 2 will drop in active players. 
---
But it the servers remain full it seems pretty dumb to actively make your server and gameplay worse , with no reason (besides them having said they would)
---
Searing Gorge and Un‚ÄôGoro for sure. Some of the Un‚ÄôGoro quests will show as high level but are very doable 51-52
---
I've been trying to start the Linken chain and I've read that you need to open the bag under the water right next to the wreck of the raft.
---
Problem is, I can't click on the bag. I've the search the whole area and I just can't interact with anything.
---
Is this a bug ?
---
If you use leatrix it's in an option there too
---
Guys like you make the community sick. If people need stuff for gearing up I‚Äôm happy to pass on BoE‚Äôs. You are in together and not a lone wolf.
---
I think he is saying that trusting blizzard 2019 to change anything about classic is a risk because blizzard doesn't understand classic. For example lets say they fix broken spex (ret paladin, oomkin etc). Congratz now you have homogenized classes with almost no individuality  because blizzard doesn't know what they are doing anymore. Just one example.
---
Probably an observation bias, but if not, it could also be that there are 3 times as many of them on most servers. Alliance are more likely to want to make friends because they don't have the numbers to back them up.
---
2H!
---
Killing mobs with sword and board is a giant time waster. 
---
You should reveal what faction you are playing as there are several 2H Staves, 2H axes and 2H swords that are easy to get and have huge dps upgrades. 
---
Like Staff of Westfall/ Crecent staff at around lvl 16-18.
---
I keep my quest-items in a separate bag. I totally should go over them and sort them out on whether I actually still intend on doing that quest. I guess half of them could be discarded right with the quests they belong to.
---
Using an Addon like Auctionator that tells you what items go for on the AH and the vendor is really usefull in sorting stuff out. I used to hate inventory management but getting better at that aspect is a skill in itself, I guess. And once you get better at it, it isn't that painfull anymore and you get quicker and smarter about it.
---
One thing I also think helped was to push for getting all of the cooking-recipes early and keep my cooking-skill up-to-date so I wouldn't have the burden of "will I eventually cook that?"
---
As I said, of course I miss the bag-space. But I'd miss the freedom of changing my role on the fly much more.
---
Not even close
---
Rogues level slow, dunno what planet you are on.  They are only slightly faster than warriors.
---
Dude, Mage is so lame. You have to spend 50% of your play time drinking, what is this, EverQuest? (meditating). Play the Druid bro. No down time at all. Best class in the game for solo play imo.
---
Hey, sure thing. There's nothing to be lost and everything to be gained by experimenting.
---
If you have any questions, just ask, I'll do my best to answer them.
---
It helps me to remember a word with an image. For ‚Äúguffaw‚Äù I always imagine a really fat man laughing. Like the cartoon character Pete from the Goofy cartoons, laughing at something stupid Goofy is doing.
---
Welcome to the club, let‚Äôs keep it going for another week
---
Yeah, I am not going to go grind mobs for 300 EXP per mob for 10 hours to make half a level.
---
Only tier 2 is BiS for Shaman. For other classes there are definitely BiS amongst T1, like T1 boots for druid.
---
Nug energy doesnt work for me :/ I tried everythin to mkae it work
---
Just seeing this screenshot gives me physical pain.
---
I‚Äôm level 33 on my mage atm and I have around 2700 intellect. If you feel your downtime is too long try to get a lot of spirit, and try to balance it out with stamina. A mage needs to drink a lot.. it is what it is I guess. Gl with whatever you decide to roll!
---
level 40 is the mid point.
---
I play at a very relaxed pace and levels after lvl 30 take me 4/5 hours each
---
The MT who ninja'd the helm after Roy screwed up might be the stupidest person I have ever heard.   He's such an idiot.  Saying he won it fair and square is just an outright lie from a brain that isn't working correctly.  All of these people are just so stupid.
---
Harsh but true.
---
I liked it. Not many classic pvp video at 60, even less against 60s. 
---
May I ask you which one of your addons displays the message of your sword talent proc? (and does it also alert you if your trash blade procs ?)
---
Many thanks, will pay attention to your next uploads
---
Fear is just so broken in classic lol.
---
you're not a ninja, just stupid
---
"Targets inventory is full" xD
---
 *‚ÄúBehold Ragnaros - the Busdriver! He who was in time when this day was young! Show your ticket to him, mortals! Show and find your seat!‚Äù*
---
Do we really need a new post literally every time someone hits 40?
---
So you're going to talent for Piercing Howl but then not have Hamstring on a hotkey?
---
Okay........
---
I‚Äôve been at work all night and fudged the math, I was thinking 1 lvl was 10 bars instead of 20 so 1.5 levels of rested would be 15 bars. I meant 30, you are correct
---
Set three hours aside and grind mobs 1-2 levels below you or even with you. Go back and try WPL again. Ideally, I would get 2 more levels before going back to a zone that was giving me trouble. Run some instances, grind mobs, etc.
---
I thought I'd tank this today.  I drew two hunters that growl on, only brought "900" arrows and left the pets out after making jumps. The healer, a level 16 shammy body-pulled every pack of mobs and complained that we weren't moving fast enough.  Mostly because the hunters kept multi-shotting, and placing a sting on the sheep.  I don't think I'm going to get my tank past level 21.  I don't need that kind of grief in my life.
---
...what? Not only is a Mage's time valuable, the resources they provide are likewise valuable. This is why I can't imagine someone demanding Mage water/food and then not compensating them in return. 
---
I make a point of always providing value (be it in the form of money, help, a favor, or crafting/enchanting quid pro quo) to players who do things like summon water/food or who go out of their way to bang out mobs for a quest with/for other players.
---
If you get banned it's a month without WoW.
---
Again, not the point. 
---
The point is that, and I'm going to say this one last time, 3rd party addons should not be a consideration when talking about difficulty. 
---
That's the player choosing to cut corners and make the game easier. 
---
In the case of boss mods, Blizzard now designs boss fights with boss mods in mind because everybody uses them. They didn't do that back then. 
---
The fact that addons were used in such a way is actually a decent indication that the game actually was difficult. Why would people feel the need for all that extra information and automation otherwise?
---
i‚Äôd try getting a weakaura for it then mate i got one on my rogue and it works great
---
Pretty much agree with the main thesis, and here is another data point: in classic the quests with elite mobs are marked \[Elite\], rather than \[Group\].  The easiest thing to do is to group up for them, but the game doesn't bother to point you in that direction.
---
One of my favorite moments in classic so far was soloing the Defeat Nek'rosh quest in Wetlands solo as a 27 Mage.  Just as I killed him and two adds via kiting, after painstakingly clearing the camp with careful pulls and polys, a full group of 5 toons my level rolled up to the area.  I guess that's another way to do it. ;)
---
This is also the main reason I love playing on a PvP server even though I personally never initiate combat when reds are minding their manners.  Soloing a green/yellow quest in a contested zone and I am still always looking over my shoulder.
---
But, that's what it takes.
---
/kiss thanks for the list!
---
Didn‚Äôt they open like 13 years ago? The game hadn‚Äôt even been released 15 years ago.
---
why not just use steam link on your iphone?
---
Im wearing a green robe too. Its so embarrasing. Orbs are not the problem, mooncloth it is
---
Try what? 
---
I said this game is not difficult. It isnt. The end?
---
If you want to compare classic to retail, how about comparing the most difficult aspect of each game? Retail has MUCH harder instanced pve. Try it and you'll see.
---
Something Something Cake Day
---
From my unpruned guild of 150 players, about 40% have been offline for over 10 days. Anecdotal but still.
---
If you don't respec you will miss stuff. But probably goblin and skip death ray, buy the rest of the gnome stuff.
---
I might recall wrong but I think I had to click the crashed boat at the lake first, might be another quest though
---
Guess I am rolling a new character.
---
How do you abuse raid markers?
---
Once you hit 55-56 it‚Äôs mostly better to start farming pre raid bis and such, leveling speed doesn‚Äôt really matter at that stage.
---
Interesting, I work over nights and my wife works normal day hours, sometimes in the morning battle net says she's playing.
---
We weren't sure how it happened but it's a bit of a relief to know it's happening to others as well.
---
Invest every penny in 14 slot bags. Get gathering profession. Sell when shit is expensive.
---
I dinged 40 with 100g, made it on iron and Bloodstone ore, then immidiatelly went to Swamp of Sorrows, to gather Blindweed, that earned me Execusioner ¬¥s Cleaver, and now Im one happy Orc, smashing faces
---
I am an Operations Manager for a large domestic shipping company. Pregnant wife due end of this month and I just hit 40 last night, too with 106g in the bank! 
---
Hit 40 in the Badlands as well! Can't wait to teach my newborn son this game, LOL
---
Tonight I'll have one in Gallow's End.
---
What a beautiful poem.
---
yes. Class trainers having no purpose anymore (you automatically learn new skills, class quests doesn't exist anymore, you unlock double spec at level 20) is especially sad
---
So useless outside of raid heal bitch spec
---
Is Grobb as packed as everyone makes it seem?
---
Ooh thats meta
---
Do you have Floating Combat Text enabled? I don't think any of the individual options like Combo Points will work without it
---
Everyone clearing MC right now has played too much.
---
The Horde stands victorious once again!
---
Not sure why this is being downvoted.  ?
---
Making such a long comment about how difficult to understand the quests and it makes classic  harder than retail.. guess what there is an addon called questie which does the same as retail questhelper. The mobs are tougher because at lvl 30 the meele classes still only have auto attack. Mages can aoe farm and kill 2-3 mobs at low levels too Im not gonna say anything about the last part since you are trying way too hard to be edgy. so your whole comment was pointless.
---
&gt; Just feels like kicking puppies to me honestly.
---
I know, isn't it awesome?
---
Sad that we already know whats behind the gate :/
---
Well... Better than the Succubus that gets sacrificed
---
No its fine to switch to master loot when there reservation on items, most people expect it
---
I was in the same boat. Make it to 29 and you can goto SM
---
What nursing do you do?
---
Still works that way now on Win10
---
The fact that the item is an upgrade for you is not really enough as it is much, much more suited for casters. In that sence, you may soon get a rogue dagger with agi or on-hit effect, and the dagger from SM will be simply wasted. 
---
Also, if you still have a sword from DM maybe you should consider visiting gnomeregan or buying it at ah.
---
You should re-roll Warrior. By level 40 you'll realize the struggles warriors have with solo leveling and you'll consider re-rolling again. This time (3:rd time's the charm) you'll realize that all classes, no matter what you pick, will have upsides and downsides. Now you can finally pick and main from your 3 level 40's, stick with it and finally start playing the game :D

No it's not auctioneer its auctionator found [here].(https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionator)

Wait, is she the one that dicked over Van Cleef?
---
Someone has a bad day :(
---
Reserving at all is "BM" whatever that means. Lay out some gold for boosts if you want others to do your work for you.
---
Well, 200g now has different value then 200g after 6 months. There will be massive inflation of gold value.
---
You should try directly asking people of appropriate level at /who
---
I don't mind farming for hours for just 1 thing. Just need to know that it actually exists. So thanks!
---
Reminds me when I was [having fun In deadwind pass](https://i.imgur.com/1Go8kVK.png) in WotLK I think
---
Mate I took a week off at launch, play pretty much every day for a few hours and multiple weekends have been WoW binges. I'm still only 53. Most of my friends are around 30/40s. 
---
The game has been out just over a month. It's expected most people will take multiple months to hit 60. If you bum rush to max level you don't get to complain there is no content. Phase 2 hopefully will be longer than Phase 1. I'm betting 2-3 months of phase 1.
---
Vox.
---
those enchants are sick too
---
That's because you're drinking your own conjured water.
---
You want to drink level-appropriate water. And if you're conjuring only 2 or 4 bottles at a time, it's not even worth the added downtime of casts and mana expenditure. 
---
When levelling a mage, it's most ideal to ask other, higher level mages for level-appropriate water. If not possible, buy some from a vendor. Your own conjured water is acceptable sometimes; when you craft 6 or more at a time(and not at the level x5 for next water yet), or crafting them before taking a flight path to save the time on mana recovery.
---
It'll get better later on - water will somewhat catch up to your mana pool.
---
Is there a cooldown on purge?
---
Just play until the other character has max rested and switch and repeat. I struggle with altoholicsm myself but when you hit 60 its so worth it!
---
Probably jank code. Everyone knows that the imp is a boy, the voidwalker is a boy, the succubus is a girl and the felhunter is a girl.
---
I guess the voidwalker could be genderless, but it is definitely a male voice.
---
Ohhh he's going to be addicted. Classic has many rocks, he's in for a good time.
---
Get him the pet rock to blow his mind.
---
Thanks man it works :D
---
I saw the same thing today. I find it hard to believe honestly. Those sites gotta have some fine print that says ‚Äúoh btw if we get caught your account is totally permabanned, gl hf‚Äù
---
You dont even use rank 1 frostbolt lol. You also try to get them out of Stealth with frost nova instead of rank 1 arcane explosion do you even mage bro?
---
C coz its closser
---
Its not optimal when everyone fucks it up
---
So glad I don't play on PvP servers.
---
Then again this could still happen in RP servers, so I'll continue to pull to safe distances so I can run when I need to.
---
Oh, I thought something from armory is pre bis. Anyway thanks.
---
&gt; F the people that complain about reserving items.
---
"My time is worth more than your time."
---
IDK what these are so.... cool!!!!
---
Man the other day i saw hunter in full scarlet set with ravager and almost flipped my ballsack. So much wasted loot
---
its pretty weird to not evenly distribute loot tbh. especially when next raid content is more than one phase away. If bwl was just around teh corenr id understand optimzing for the guild but at this releaserate they are most likely gonna have all the gear they need anyway by the time it hits.
---
Let's say someone else would also do that... How would you find out if he didn't tell you. :o
---
Nope you are correct.
---
Priests are like a dime a dozen.  I rolled Druid to heal and I don't ever get to in PUGs.. only when my guild does a run since they know I want to heal.  I'm so lucky that Druids can tank (and dps quite well) otherwise I'd be SoL and forced to create my own groups every time.
---
&gt;warriors  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt; are the easiest class to level to 60, are the easiest to farm with 
---
i see
---
Currently leveling a lot in Azshara. Zandalar Tribe.
---
I do pvp, and I expect it at all times. It's a rppvp server after all. But I'm usually quite passive or tend to do silly stuff, like walk up to hordies and do /silly or just /flirt (the latter getting me a female orc following me and protecting me quite a lot in feralas... not sure when the wedding is, but somewhere between "zug" and "kaz")
---
Since when is month 6 days
---
He said he mentions the reserve when posting in LFM
---
I'll not join the winter y'all clearly have child like behaviour
---
Ah, finally he's almost dead... Oh, bubble and heal to full. Drat. Fine, guess I've got to kill him again...
---
Finally, now you're mine... Oh, Lay On Hands. Aww, shit... Here we go again...
---
Everyone hearing this: Layer invite please
---
How is it getting fucked up?
---
Next time you got some time, look up "druid deep dive with skarm tank" on youtube, he goes really in depth into druid rank builds and talks about the different builds he uses for raiding, I believe this build is one of the main ones he uses but leans towards the tank talents instead of the cat talents. 
---
This is a good build for raids because some fights you may heal and some fights you may tank or dps (which every your guild needs) and this build allows you to do both (not all 3 though).
---
If you're aiming to dps make sure you look into power shifting and plan on getting some manual crowd pummelers, you dont necessarily have to but you will boost your dps a lot by taking advantage of these 2 things.
---
He sure did. My bad then that is not even remotely bm you did it perfectly
---
don't try to argue with him, seems like all people here a saints considering their arguing about how you are an asshole as a person and comparing all sorts of crimes with it and what not.
---
You shouldn't have posted in this subreddit tho, a lot of people here are fanatics and hypocrites, they praise classic and its community and shit talk you to death as soon as you ask a noob question or are complaining about some mechanics and so on.
---
Yeah i only been getting multi shot, hunters mark, aspect of the hawk.
---
- free food and drinks
---
- high DPS/ needed in raid
---
- portals
---
- best cc in the game
---
- good for goldfarming
---
- just spam frostbolds in raids while watching Netflix
---
I can see why many people are attracted to mages, including bad players.
---
No dailies/ weeklys (I don't include raids lock outs in that statement), I just hate them with a passion. I want to log in and do whatever I want when I want to, not be herded every day in to a mandatory or heavily encouraged repeatable quest. My other things are small compared to this I really hate dailies. I actually enjoyed leveling and exploring in gw2 but can't push myself to log in knowing I'd be forced into the same daily quest routine. 
---
Archeage was my favourite mmo until I got tired of daily farming in the ayanad library, not to mention the MTX problems.
---
As for dungeon finder I think it's efficient and you are right it is. But I always find the experience poor and often the players much worse. I try to avoid matchmaking because I would rather network with other players or go with friends/ guildies.
---
No quest marker/ arrow, It's so fun reading the quest and exploring to find where to go. Say what you will about RuneScape's MTX or whatever but it has some really great quests (I love questing and lore in the games I play)
---
I'm looking forward to Pantheon rise of the fallen.
---
Thanks for answering.   
---
The white and yellow hit points (numbers) float up but I never see any words. Is that the setting I'm missing in the game settings?
---
I don't know what lists you're looking up, but none of those are bis.
---
Sure there's assholes everywhere, but that guy was sharing his personal experiences. Mine have been similar. More than 8 days played total and I've run into two assholes, neither of which were particularly egregious...
---
Showmemyheal will show you it in a 2d scrolling text
---
Doesn't your keyboard have a shift key on the left?
---
Unless the mage is elemental specced! Having shatter and casting flamestrike + blastwave on nova'd mobs has to be one of the best feelings, instant 2k burst aoe damage + a 800 damage dot on everything plus you only pay 70% of the mana for both spells.
---
I disagree. If he is the one forming the group, and lets people know it‚Äôs completely fine. There‚Äôs other gear from rend people need; offhand, eye patch, healing helm. Hell, people probably still need their attuned and quests too. As long as OP lets them know ahead of time. Also, BM means ‚Äúbad mannered‚Äù
---
Hard to say. Demand will be its highest in phase 1, true, but it's important to realize that since we're only a month in, there are relatively very people at a high enough level to even need it. The supply of mats will stay the same because they're already being farmed, but demand will increase, so prices will go up mid-phase.
---
And what's more is inflation. The game is handing out more gold every second, so eventually the price of everything will rise. So while 70g now might be worth as much as 110g or 130g in a month, it's better to spend the 70g now in my opinion because the time it takes to make *that same relative amount* is smaller.
---
I wanted to link to something that was more easily digestible and free to read. If you really want to go into it you can check out [this research paper](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2019-45337-001)
---
WE‚ÄôRE MUGGERS, WHAT DO MUGGERS DO?
---
Are you from Olympus?
---
20s per stack is an amazing deal at higher levels.
---
I found that switching to Battle stance at the end of each pull helps alot. This way you can pop sweeping strikes at the next pull and Switch back to Defensive stance.
---
DM is the 8sp dmg or healing
---
You could, but if you are in a guild that REQUIRES you to prepot because reasons, it's definitely something they can check after and call you out on it.
---
&gt;copied a private server
---
What? They found old backups on an old backup afaik
---
Good info for the OP. Thanks. I knew it was boe, which is why there is an opportunity to use it and make money crafting. Unlike the chests. I guess that is probably why it is worth more. Chance at long term income.
---
100% completely incorrect
---
Is there a working Lootlink addon such as Telos Lootlink to Classic ? An addon where u can search for items and then for example link them in chats or to equip them in dressing room.
---
I think my pupils dilated..
---
Aaah yes when a proud guild rp walks to the gong only to be delayed 2days by 3 pvp guilds paid by the biggest pve guild on the horde side so they can get the last stuff and ring it before them. Good times!!
---
I meant over 9000 needles my bad
---
Loktar warrior
---
Is there a version of wardrobe working now for classic? Where can i get it?
---
No you can't. Blizzard changed it to 20 yrd.
---
This keeps happening to me too!!! I have no idea what‚Äôs up I‚Äôm not logged into my phone app
---
Luckily I've run Maraudon so often from 46 to 51 that most of the quests in the zones you mention are still available to me! ^^;
---
41 lock, 29 druid, 18 shaman, 15 warrior.. help

I installed luna unit frames and can't set it up. I just starts in config mode and none of the chat commands work. How do you get out of config mode? Am I missing something?

https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/silver-dragon
---
It has a nice popup once you find them. I think you have to have them in view or something.
---
I can't recommend it yet, since I've only had it used once. 
---
But hey, 100% success right?
---
He's right though. Account sharing has been against every TOS for the past decade. Even Runescape had it back in 2005. Common sense really
---
I agree, however I do support it if its an internal guild thing. "were running SM so BillTheOrc can get his Ravenger Axe can anyone in the guild help?" is perfectly fine I think.
---
I fixed it. Check below or the edited post!
---
Majority of the time people join the groups because they either don't need the item or have it. You could say the same thing about tanks who only go if they get paid. Just make your own groups
---
You need to manually log out and close the game for it to save. If you are just exiting game it will not save settings and macros.
---
i dont care if people do this, i pity them actually because it takes those group 5x as long to fill roles because of it.
---
im guilty of reserving an item for myself, to be fair it was a guild group and everyone was cool with it
---
Depends on server and time. I've applied AOE farming strategy effectively to ZF graves - skip everything to the boss, clear out 2 patrol mobs, then do the graves. Me and my friend started doing it at level 44(2 mages), after being dissatisfied with over-full pirate camp. I've done it solo from level 48 to 52, 'cause my friend was offline! It is remarkably more challenging, but the XP gain and loot are great. I think many level 60 players come back there to farm gold as well.
---
After doing that, I've found Western Plaguelands farm spots to be less contested. That's probably because there are quite a few farm spots available, and not a whole lot of players are there in the first place yet.
---
Also try the discord server for ZT they have a looking for group channel on there too!
---
I think it might be, if you've got the list up in AIO it's named 'enableFloatingCombatText'
---
This. I love VW cause I can sac the damn thing, then insta-summon whichever other pet I want (still usually another VW). I've taken on elite world mobs because the VW is just so powerful utility-wise.
---
It is true, sorry if it offends people round here.
---
Yeah their was definitely locked shit in vanilla.
---
Do you mean sfk? Those are level 19 items.
---
Quality work :D
---
Sold one yesterday for 350g (German server).
---
Was so happy as it dropped from a random mob in Tanaris.  
---
Now I'm lvl 48 and already have half the gold for my epic mount   :)
---
Do what normal people do, don't run dungeons with them and blacklist them. Eventually no one will want to run with them.
---
This might not be worth it, depends on your server. If you're lucky and get it from vendor then it's the best but paying like 50g on AH for it is not worth.
---
In winterspring in the demon zone is also this weird instance thing any clue what that might have been intended for?
---
Dude, GW2 is nothing like WoW. It's really 2 very different games :p Out of all games you could bash on being a WoW copy, you picked the one that isn't.
---
How is that even possible? Even silver from quest rewards would add up to more than that, add vendor trash to that and you should be much higher. You should be sitting at 3g probably around level 17.  It goes up pretty exponentially after that.
---
Its 37 for horde
---
As mentioned we didnt know that much back in the days. I did craft Lionheart Helm and Titanic Leggings for my prot warrior to pimp stats. Dont think the leggings are up in phase 1, not sure. Regarding the bis list its annoying now when playing a rogue to loose leather stuff to a warrior. But i can understand it. Dam bis lists, when Dal'Rends drop in UBRS theres like 5 people rolling on it if its a 10-man group :/
---
Nah. Remember that we don't even have clue when P2 will come. And new raid comes in P3. We could easily talk more than 6 months of time until next raid comes. So you have plenty of time to get to 60 and clear raids.
---
Wow should I just quit? I've been 42 for 4 days now with no motivation to grind.
---
Do NOT use the orc racial blood fury while tanking, it reduces your healing taken by 50% and could get you killed and wipe your group.
---
Yeah, I agree. It seems the label of ‚Äúgreedy type‚Äù belongs to OP
---
8 piece T1 is BIS for the set bonus until DM gear is available. It was probably funneled to this guy specifically for the set bonus.
---
The only change the game needs, and still does, is a bigger quest log. make it like 50 idc
---
I saw this plenty of times back when wow launched.

If you find chests with some moldy cheese or some arathi blue left... it just means i was there earlier... i love building someone up just to see them crash after opening
---
EA sells for about 50s each on my server, but they also drop course stone which sells for about 2g per stack of 20, and rough stone sells for about 1g per stack of 20.  Farming just the EA's you can nit a few gold's worth of by-products.
---
Next.
---
I don't. It's a fun idea in this little pocket of time that is classic. But retail dungeon design is in general really great, especially with mythic plus.
---
I love the way dungeons feel like their own adventure in Classic, and fits well with the simple mechanics of Classic. But I wouldn't trade that for the harder, more punishing mechanics of retail's dungeons and raids.
---
Maybe they could pull it off. They could release a gargantuan dungeon that wasn't designed for mythic plus, but how many times would people run that and still think it's fun? And how many times will people run BRD and Blackrock Spire before they aren't fun anymore? I'm glad I've had the experience of BRD in the past, and I'm excited to do both that and Blackrock Spire for real. But how many times? After running Armory and Cath for over a combined 30 times trying to get the legs, I never wanna see Scarlet Monastery again, and those are short dungeons.
---
No that larger dungeon design works better as raids, which is essentially what BRD is anyway.
---
How is that karma?
---
They migjt have just reroll on other server/faction as I did
---
R/TIHI
---
I'd love an uncapped debuff limit, then feral gets a tasty DPS boost, purists gonna be purists though.
---
I'm working full time so I took 2 weeks off during the launch to make sure I'd hit 60 before I had to go back to work.
---
Farming my pre-raid BiS went pretty fast as I tanked every dungeon, and we had a set guild group so we could just keep running targetted bosses for loot.
---
We did 8/10 MC on our first try (had no douses) and then next reset we did 10/10 MC + Onyxia.
---
Now I'm back at work and playing at most 3-4 hours every other day or so, and it's not required to play any more than that if you have the raids on farm
---
Does turning Glow off impove performance? My laptop could need it...
---
Classic
---
&gt;She'll seduce Private Rocknut
---
Oh boy. Appropriate phrasing.
---
If your always Duo, I would just quest and aoe pull the quests.
---
It's a 15 yr old game. There is no such thing as a good aoe spot which nobody knows of
---
Larger block list. Blacklist addon doesn't work :(
---
Very much enjoy that most people don't just run over each other, but around.
---
I have just checked if I could login into both retail and classic from the desktop with the client completely closed using both of my accounts and didn't have an issue with each.
---
Sorry for you‚Äôre loss, mate. Me, and the boys, will be going to Gallows End to get rightly wasted in memory of your brother!
---
I don't see how helping everyone gear up faster can be a dick move but okay.
---
What if someone said
---
    /4 LF tank + dps for scholo, no caster.
---
Would you refuse to join that as well?
---
On a pvp server your choices are: share the spawns, kill the other player farming the same mobs, don‚Äôt play.
---
On a pie server your choices are: share the spawns, don‚Äôt play.
---
I'll fix it in the AM and dm you to let you know the new string is up! 
---
It's not needy I appreciate all the feedback.
---
Ah ok interesting! Do think I remember something about ppm on poisons now that you mention it.
---
And yes I agree with the sword sword for sword spec
---
This is a core mechanic which would completely and utterly change the whole raiding if altered. Absolutely **NO**, even on Classic+ or so.
---
Depends what you buy.. from the AH, sure! But an epic mount will always cost the same.
---
The most important talent is improved blizzard.
---
You're 22 so you don't have Cone of Cold which helps a whole hell of a lot. 
---
Here's what I did pre-mount.
---
1. Run around wanding/body pulling. I did this without mana shield because who has money to pay for that? Also mana is your main constraint from not dying a lot of the time.
---
2. Frost nova duh
---
3. Blink
---
4. Blizzard twice (if somebody doesn't get slowed this is your cue to run away.)
---
5. Cone of cold, while retreating, Though with improved frost nova it's probably up (yes strafing is faster, but I don't want to get that far away, just far enough away not to get whacked).
---
6. Frost nova again
---
7. Generally their close enough to dead to just blizzard once more, then CoC/Arcane explosion. If not blink and blizzard hoping there's enough mana for two more rounds.
---
95% of the time when you you pvp you just hold right click and a/d strafe. Freeing your keyboard hand a bit so its easier to move around is helping a lot more than the clicking precision with the mouse. This is not CS:GO lol.
---
Damn i did my first run ubrs with my hunter yesterday and i already dont like the instance to much. Positioning is really next lvl in there if you wanna contribute to the grp outside of bossfights.
---
You are dealt 100 frost damage.
---
70 goes to you as frost. 30 goes to your pet as frost.
---
Apply that to everything.
---
Fun tip, if your short on funds and an enchanter you can just save some mats you were gonna waste on yourself to level and offer an enchant for water. Never had a mage reject +5 Stam on bracers for 3 stacks of water
---
It's 30 damage, yes that's more important.
---
&gt; So far I've read just charge into shout, then switch into defensive stance and lay sunder. Is this alright?
---
Yes, that's pretty much it. Using sunder instead of whatever else you could spend your rage on will already make you a better tank than 50% of other low-level warriors.
---
20 is more than enoth (with a new char while in the starting zone)
---
It's still a dick move imo. And borderline immoral by anyone who joins just because they aren't affected by the reserved item personally.
---
I'd say use whatever you like for raiding, but I'd focus more on damage oriented pets. 
---
Wind serpent, raptor, cat, owl, pretty much. 
---
If we're talking about the tank using gift of arthas, then you want your pet to attack as fast as possible, so broken tooth might be the better choice. 
---
I'll probably go for another cat, since I really don't like the skin of broken tooth. (Rak'shiri comes to mind).
---
Is there a druid version anywhere?
---
Mad bitch?
---
you die, THEN flame chat
---
Only sell itemd in the cross faction AH that the other faction cant get (vanity pets) or that are in higher demand on the other faction.
---
Generic greens, blues or even purples are definitely not going there.
---
Don‚Äôt worry, people on this sub are always helpful and will usually give tips and tricks :)
---
But yes wowhead/googling/YouTube can be a great resource. 
---
I‚Äôve recently watched some videos of a guy named Skarm on YouTube, his tanking tips are pretty solid and he also plays a warrior and can recommend everything from talents to gear and weapons and how to generate, maintain and hold threat etc. He also adds a some interesting and great alternative ways to tank and some in depth stuff! Go check him out!
---
Some people aren‚Äôt downloading questie, specifically because they enjoy the part of the game where they figure out what‚Äôs going on, as opposed to just running to a spot, kill, run back, turn in, do it again, all while watching Netflix.  Some people are enjoying the added difficulty, which is specifically mentioned in the post.  Some people aren‚Äôt trying to get to 60 as fast as possible.
---
Other people see these posts, and comment just to shit on the first people.  Those other people have a different way of playing the game, which is fine.  Just stop shitting on the first group.  Just go away.  You knew what he meant; your comment wasn‚Äôt sincere.  You need to be called out, because it‚Äôs anti-social behavior.
---
How do you see the Auction value of it?
---
Much appreciated. I'll have another look through when I get home.
---
I'm full time student and hit 33 :(
---
Is there a way to have that not dismount you when you stance change tho? Cuz otherwise as a warr it's ass to use
---
With warlock T2 your pet gains resistances, can he resist that 30 frost damage?
---
TSM really helps enchanters since just by mouseovering an item it shows the value at vendor as well as estimated values of both selling on ah and disenchanting.
---
I change pretty much everytime
---
I don't remember seeing a lot of fury warriors in vanilla, especially not in the beginning when the usual pre raid bis dungeon loot would be relevant. You wanted to do damange as a warrior, you went arms. You did some tanking in between, you maybe went for the 31/5/15 spec.
---
But then it's ironic
---
I thought the dragon knocked him off the ledge for a moment there :p
---
Right now at 22 I have to basically rest after every farm but is ok if I get at least 4.
---
What you said that strafing is faster is just running? or what do you mean, I don't get how strafing is faster :S
---
Thanks man.
---
Well when I see a high lvl horde I know he will gank me. Or just try to grief as much as possible.
---
2hrs and the guy is pissed off? Maybe he should return playing BFA.
---
Back in the days, it was quite usual to take 2+hrs in high level instance, and great and fun.
---
If you need you need, DPS &gt; all.
---
As it should be.
---
Ehhhh.
---
wow its the same "rogue distracts guy into water" post we see every day but this time it is recorded in the most shitty method possible
---
While I wouldn't really care about the debuff Limit being removed I would care about how much easier that would make the raids.
---
It is not like MC, ZG, BWL and AQ20 is hard with the debuff Limit.
---
But if there was no debuff Limit to it then it would be way too easy.
---
Therefore I'll say #nochanges :D
---
What the other guy said.
---
&gt;You have all the work finding people
---
Completely ignoring the fact that if he wasn't being greedy and reserving items he'd have a group ready in a matter of minutes because everybody and their grandmother are chain running UBRS right now.
---
100% agree! If its a pug, nothing should be reserved. You dont deserve anything over others. If it is a guild run, then you can all agree prior to the run, and sometimes folk just run to help others.
---
Don‚Äôt gotta join his group if you don‚Äôt like, lol. And trust me, when you farm a piece of gear for 40+ runs and lose it to a roll, you‚Äôll find yourself reserving items too.
---
Thank you very much, u are a lifesaver
---
You can grab rocks from the ground and use them to distract people. Look outside the paths.
---
What is autoclick? üßê
---
Should I invest in bigger bags to sell more things? I'm level 31 and only have 12 gold. Am I behind?
---
Strafing is better than backpedaling. There's a penalty to going straight backwards but none to strafing. You drink after every pull in my experience because that's what blizzarding a bunch requires. 
---
Personally I enjoy AOE farming, but would recommend questing until cone of cold. Even then I mostly like it in conjunction with questing. It's very useful though.
---
Not for nothing but isn't just the pure fact of mentioning it in a Reddit post advertising it? It's 2019 people don't need a direct link to a product that they might want. If there idea is put in their mind, and theyre the type of person who would, they'll find it with ease
---
It's times like this i'm happy i have two screens, one for dungeon maps and one for WoW classic.
---
^(Or just get the atlas addon, works to.)
---
I was invited by a guild called "Dreadmist" yesterday.
---
Guess what realm I play on.
---
Hasn't been in the news because hes now been doing genuinely good things..
---
I am doing a nursing education and have 2 jobs. I just hit 49 and am super proud. I think we are taking our time really good so no worries! Am proud of you OP!
---
Hah I literally almost only auto walk unless I‚Äôm killing stuff or need to avoid terrain. Otherwise I auto walk and just use my move to change my heading. Usually tabbed out while doing so and coming back 10 seconds later to find myself dead or stuck on a teeny tiny pebble on the ground running in the same spot :)
---
Your talents are fine. It depends what faction you are as to where you should farm. Level 22 is a good time to start aoe farming. 
---
Just a heads up, I started at level 22 and died a lot of times before I got the hang of it (be prepared to fuck up and die over and over again). Start by pulling mobs of 3-4 before you get the groove. 
---
To answer your questions: 1. Yes, using mana shield is OK. I will get back to this point. 
---
2. You should try group them, pull them away from other spawns/patrols so you don‚Äôt pull Agro from other mobs while you‚Äôre aoe‚Äôing. You want to get them close, frost nova, then blink to max distance and cast 2 blizzards before they get to you (You shouldn‚Äôt need to move in between these 2 blizzards. After the second blizzard; kite for a few seconds before frost nova is back up, frost nova them and then use your last blizzard/arcane explosion to finish them off. That should cover number 3 aswell. 
---
Going to back to the mana shield, if you‚Äôre face tanking you will need to pop it. Otherwise, you should be ok to run into one dude and then wand/fire blast 2 more. 
---
A tip: purchase mana potions from the AH or find someone who can craft them and you give mats.
---
Well it‚Äôs not garbage. 
---
It‚Äôs just not better than blue prebis.

Dragon's Call (EU)
---
There is no safe data on faction Distribution currently (and probably forever).
---
I won't look it up just to have wrong data and make wrong assumptions upon it :D
---
If you would like to know you could search reddit for "faction Distribution" you should find it very easy
---
Delaware River, c. 1940
---
Gehennas EU still gets 2-3 hour queues in prime time.
---
Im actually running into the opposite problem. I'm only 51, but I'm running dungeons for gear so much, I keep pushing my quests into grey.
---
At 58, you are high enough to run every dungeon in the game. So do it. You'll likely run them all at least half a dozen times to get all your pre-raid BiS, if you're lucky, and if you aren't 60 by then, you still have friends and guildies to gear up.
---
If you truly want to hit 60 by questing alone, which is not the intended path, you have to be very careful about where to quest when. Only do green quests, go in a specific order of zones, etc. That being said, here are a list of zones which will have at least green quests at your level:
---
Searing Gorge
---
Burning Steppes
---
Western Plaguelands
---
Eastern Plaguelands
---
Un'Goro Crater
---
Silithus
---
Felwood
---
Winterspring
---
And then there's a few random quests sprinkled throughout the capital cities. If you've done every single quest in all of those zones, welp, it's to the dungeons with you!
---
Warlock is probably one of the classes with least downtime, and incredibly easy to solo with.
---
This site seems really handy. It would be handy to be able to limit the quest rewards so that it doesn't show rewards from quests that are much higher level than the character, because I'm not going to be doing quests 10 levels above me despite being technically able to do them.
---
I would at least get 4x12 slots bags, there probably only about 1g each now, mageweave bags
---
[EU][N/A][Zandalar Tribe (but am happy to start anew)]
---
I have a 30 Horde Warrior currently on Zandalar Tribe... but I'm looking for a good guild to join, for leveling and eventually raiding. I'm a relaxed friendly and helpful player - and I'd like a friendly relaxed environment. Bonus points for other exhausted parents ;)
---
I was an old school Vanilla player who quit before TBC, and came back for WOTLK, quitting before the next exp again... Most of my high end raiding is Lich King, where my guild (and was core (tree) healer) did every raid.
---
I play a fair amount, and am pretty committed to getting back to raid-quality.... but I'd like to find a good group of people first. Don't mind server or side, I'd likely be rolling a new dude for it.
---
&gt; your fault you went ~~swimming not mine~~ *extinct*.
---
Horde used to be the mature faction. Times have changed I guess.
---
Not really sure what autoclick is but you can make a macro to Target what you please and attack it and spam the crap out of that without worry
---
Well I killed about 30-40 level 20s in Hillsbrad last week on my level 40 paladin and started a fucking war. It was wonderful. Don't play on a PVP server if you're gonna cry about dying.
---
One key hit has to result in only one action.
---
Everything which breaks this rule is basically a TOS infraction. No exceptions.
---
I love doing this with my int buff, cracks me up every time.
---
But on a pesty imp? fuck no.
---
Auctionator does it. Probably other auction addons too.
---
No that's fine, I would assume they need melee dps because of group comp. You need meele for jandice, or, should have at least. And if not, at least this way they are only limiting their competition, not eliminating it fully by some grand self superimposed importance over the rest of the group that reserving usually represents.
---
I needed on it as a warrior, and the druid assumed me ninja. I just cannot understand how people are learning ignoring it just because it's a staff?? Served me greatly until i got whirlwind axe
---
well done but sexy map plz   [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sexymap](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/sexymap)
---
Don't forget unlimited mana battery if you get dark pact!
---
are you automating something, if yes then it's bannable.
---
**Good** tanks are more valuable than anything in any MMO.  
---
if you find one hold on to him and if a dps annoys him by ruining his threat, ignoring marks, pulling when noone is ready.   
---
Kick the dps and keep the tank happy.
---
If I weren't new to WoW I would roll tank.  
---
I genuinly enjoy tanking, the only reason I didn't make tank is because I don't know the game and I don't know the dungeons/when &amp; where to pull/...
---
They are good for battlegrounds when they come out.
---
Cost to value ratio: if 10 slots+ is relatively cheap on your server, the extra slots will generate more money so most likely yes.
---
&gt; Am I behind?
---
You may not get it at 40 but you'll be close. Even if you don't, sell quest greens and you'll get there quickly.
---
I stopped my warrior to play mage... dude mages have far less downtimes than war (but if it's still too much for you you can go hunter, you just never have to regen)
---
Like using the logitech, razer or steelseries software to make you mouse/keyboard click really fast for you.
---
I took times off work when Classic came out. 10 days off work, and I did nothing else except playing WoW, between 10 to 18 hours a day.
---
I was level 52 at the end of the 10 days. And then after that I played more casually for 10 more days and finally ding 60.
---
Total /played time of 10 days and 6 hours.
---
No offense but anyone can have a deep voice. Now let's assume you are an Interdimensional void demon summoned to the mortal plain that doesn't have a voice box or even a mouth. Are you going to have a feminine human voice? Or are you going to have a unique voice that in your people's terms is feminine. Open your mind brother.
---
I don't follow how you have trouble manipulating your strafe keys while hitting abilities.  And even in WoW you still need precision mouse movements for ground targeted abilities, mouseover casts, and precise character piloting.
---
This is my second go around with classic (the first being 2004). The first time I power leveled, did the raid scene, did the PvP grind. This time I am smelling the roses, chilling out and just enjoying the leveling process. Each way of playing is it's own thing, with it's own rewarding experience.
---
Yep,
---
Horde: 50 Hunter 33 warrior 30 mage 15 rogue
---
Alliance : 20 Druid.
---
Planning on ditching my horde rogue and making one on the alliance side.
---
My hunter and warrior get prefernce. But I do planning on leveling them with rested xp, I might push hunter to 60 first so he can farm gold for other alts.
---
Impossible. I'm sensing the use of child labour here.
---
Definitely not, I see a lot of 30s on cities
---
For those out of the loop

I rerolled from lvl 31 mage to hunter(lvl 37).

The grass is so green on this side, i havent had to bring water along since level 1, endless killing power with just average mana regen.
---
On a medium pop server you shouldn't struggle to find 4 other people that want to run Scarlet Monastery. Maybe it's a bit harder as a DPS, but I usually took less than 20 minutes during the day at medium pop on my server.
---
My best advise is get a ranged weapon, learn to line of sight pull mobs. Set a skull marker on a cloth or a weak mob to die first, don't waste your time building threat on it, maybe just an early taunt, it will likely be stunned and killed real fast. If you build threat on said mob you are wasting rage. While skull dies apply sunders to other mobs. Remember if you and the healer survive the party survives, if you run around chasing aggro off dps and the healer dies the party wipes.  People here speaking about demoralising shout as a threat tool, ignore this completely, the threat generated by demo shout is garbage, it is a mitigation tool only. One more nugget of advise is to pool rage up between fights, by this I mean dont waste all your rage spamming sunder when there is one mob left, save the rage for the next pack so you can establish threat instantly. This being said, your healers mana is more important than your rage momentum. I know the pain of building a full rage bar for the next pack just to see it dissipate while the party drinks, but it is far less painful than death runs and parties falling apart because of wipes. Talk with your party, remind your group to utilize their tools, get a health stone, eat between fights to save healers mana, ask for crowd control to be used on bigger packs. An engaged tank is a good tank. Most importantly of all though is to have fun! Good luck young orc!
---
That's not what a circlejerk is, though? Circlejerk would be if we were willfully ignorant to the bad shit, which at least for me is not the case
---
You use cone of cold usually.
---
I  was on the other side of things - I wanted to tank RFK as Shaman and my other party members were not happy about it to say the least. The run went very, very smoothly and they all added me in the end.
---
It was a technical limitation *that they doubled halfway through Vanilla*.
---
Its really silly to say that its a "core mechanic" when they were happy to change it once already so drastically. 
---
The problem with changing it now is it will affect the balance of upcoming raids. However I don't see a remotely good argument why the no longer necessary technical limitation shouldn't be removed and balanced for if they did Classic+ and I really don't understand why you are so adamant that it must never be changed for new content.
---
An ancient hatred that began as a war between Ner'zhul and Medivh that has continued to this day, causing many tragedies and animosity, all to determine who the greater DPSer is.
---
But what bad happened to him? Something good happened to you which is nice, like balancing out the karma of having something bad having happened.
---
Would you please care to explain why is it bad?
---
People are using autoclicks since launch and still not a single ban about it, i'm starting to think they just dont care about something that small
---
More than likely the phone app looking for friends list update every now and then. If you got authenticator you're pretty much immune to an account breach.
---
Alliance druid on Kurinaxx here. Sorry to hear that. I abide by the code, and do everything I can to help horde druids out in the wild. I've crossed paths with a handful of horde druids who haven't gotten the memo either though, unfortunately (if you see Octomoose, tell him his honorless hide is mine). I'll try to pass on the word on this side, brother. We can keep the pact alive and well!
---
Me too, RP servers are great for classic.
---
5hrs per day is nothing !
---
Ew you didn't disable the weird tacky ROG logo projection. What's wrong with you?!
---
Vanas KoS works perfectly in terms of a blacklist.
---
It's expecting people to play with you and get jack shit for their time. 
---
The "I can pay you in exposure and experience" of WoW.
---
You don't need to reserve anything if you can put together a group that won't need on your items but these greedy players know that will never happen because their class is the most thirsty for that same loot so they basicaly expect other warriors and rogues joining for nothing.
---
And if it's just a Jed/Rend run it's pretty clearly just a rush clear and reset without Welp boss, Beast or Drakkisath so nobody is getting anything done except helping that guy get his loot and then be done with farming.
---
Thanks, I'll have to look into it when I get home
---
Item reservation is, indeed, BM.
---
But well, as long as everybody in the group is aware of the group' leader bad manners, everything is fine I guess.
---
Your ability to hold aggro is proportional to the ability for DPS to wait before attacking. After that, no it does not matter if you lose some aggro, let the mob run, taunt later, donc bother if they are CC'd things like that. Your job is to not let your group die, not to be taking 100% of the damage all the time.
---
How do I get trough the sloggy thierties?
---
I am a lvl 33 priest, where should i level as an alliance palyer. I play on a PvP server and i enjoy it , but i am not great and it is interrupting my progress.
---
Thanks for any help.
---
Dude we get it, you play wow 18 hours a day while watching asmongold. Why don‚Äôt you be a good little boy and go play retail for a while since you‚Äôre just so incredibly bored.
---
I'm currently at 14days over 3chars. I just skipped sleep a bunch of nights ^^
---
What are the two servers ?
---
To be fair, if he's a frost mage he may have been waiting there to freeze other players in the lava for easy kills (looking at it, if that was his plan, I'm a huge fan).
---
Honestly if you have a mage and a Druid, you‚Äôll probably kill him as a 3
---
Most don't level in tank spec.
---
You‚Äôre not, go do something else. You‚Äôre addicted.
---
The ultimate PvP kill?
---
Strafing is faster than walking backwards.  He walks backwards to gain a small amount of distance from melee but not too far to lose range for CoC.  The alternative is to strafe run away and jump spin to face while using CoC at mobs.  Takes practice but a v useful skill
---
I think its fine to advertise this run like this. I 100% wouldnt group with you, and I dont with anyone reserving loot, but thats my opinion.  
---
As long as you state it up front, then everyone knows and can make their own decision whether to run or not.
---
Desolace, Thousand Needles (specifically Shimmering Flats) and Stranglethorn Vale are the viable zones at that level. Partner up with someone to get kill quests done if you can.
---
I don't get why people say this. Like, this ain't a party, it's a discussion about ToS lul
---
Imagine having 15 years of more or less continuous play with the game like some of us do, and looking down on people who maybe haven't even played 60 hours of this shit yet. 
---
Try thinking back to how you were when you first played this game or were new at video games in general. I know it's hard to accept, but you weren't born good at this. You used to be shit too.
---
Im not paying a mage sitting around in IF tho. The whole time/mana thing goes out the window at that point.
---
‚Äú... then goes to murder my priest friend.‚Äù Idk why but I found this hilarious man
---
Feels good to have been levelling with fire spec now to break the mould a bit.
---
Haven't even trained blizzard past rank 2.
---
Close to 60 now though, so I'll line up with the rest soon =(
---
haha aye that is good!  
---
I might try to instance a bit right now, even if its running ZF again a few times just for the XP.
---
Need is wear, Greed is sell. The item does not matter. Don't make up rules as you go.
---
Short answer - portals.
---
You can still use COC if a warlock is using hellfire
---
I recommend questing while doing some aoe pulls on quest mobs. We have to many people end game that have no idea how to play their class because they leveled only spamming one or 2 skills. Don't be that person.
---
I've seen only 2 mages in my hundreds of dungeon runs that:
---
a) Always sheep their designated target and don't break it
---
b) Don't sheep pull
---
b) Wait for tank aggro
---
c) Use single target abilities (i know it's insane right) until tank has enough threat on all the mobs
---
It's a PVP server, there's nothing wrong with ganking.
---
As for why Horde ganks more - there's many reasons. One of them being the faction design. People who play Alliance are more often trying to play in a "civilized, righteous" way of their faction. Horde is the same, only that the faction design screams "kill them all".
---
It's also mostly true that Horde attracts tryhards(who also love to PvP). Every race on their side brings something useful to PvP. Alliance? Most of the Alliance plays Humans and Night Elves, and neither have a single useful PvP racial. Gnomes and Dwarfs bring some quality racials as well, with some race/class combinations being arguably better than those available to Horde, but they only make up a minority of the alliance players overall - majority plays humans and night elves.
---
&gt; But you sound like you're doing mental gymnastics to justify being selfish
---
I'm not a rogue, and if one in my group wants to take a locked chest for himself I'm happy for him to do that. Lots of them still let the group roll for it, which is great too. But it's their choice.
---
&gt; you know how the general community feels about it
---
The upvotes/downvotes on these comments tell me otherwise.
---
There are no mental gymnastics required here. If only one player in the group has skinning, the group does not greed-roll on every single beast.
---
What is the advantage of autoclicking? Pls explain to me I'm a noob.
---
Go back to retail
---
This, aoe farming for the sake of aoe farming is boring. It might be a bit slower but its more fun.
---
its the very first line of the thread, you can enter more than 5 instancers per hour as long as its not the same character, I currently to do it to farm more brd arenas for friends for example, but I am wondering if its supposed to be this way or an oversight.
---
nost had more
---
Yeah it's got a great damage bracket ! Definitely a good warrior weapon.
---
Desolace has a few quests, and the ones in the shimmering flats (Thousand Needles) may get you 2/3 of a level. A few are there in Arathi, too. All of this probably gets you to 35-36.
---
But no matter what you do - if you don't want to grind your way through dungeons, there is no way around STV.
---
I mean of you're gonna run brd and the last two guys that got invited were questing in un'goro, then yes he's absolutely expected to summon. It's absolutely pointless to start flying when you know you're too far away to make it in time and get summoned anyway.
---
There is a fine line between efficiency and lazyness though(just as there is with with running after a wipe).
---
The time frame in which a mage can't provide the most efficient water is incredibly small though, that argument is bullshit.
---
It's not a matter of perspective, it's a matter of nuance
---
PvP servers have more to them than just coming out on top in an altercation. It is a greater challenge, the world feels more alive as well.
---
You know what is common in kids of 90s and any others? Short attention span. Turbo fads lost their popularity after 2 years and Chupa caps Pogs replaced them. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milk_caps_(game)
---
Then there was a year long yo-yo mass obsession.
---
Then PC arrived and DOOM took us by storm. Then girls became very interesting) and we threw out most of our hobbies.
---
Desolace or Dustwallow Marsh. You can also try parts of Ashenvale, as there are level 30 demons in the eastern corner. Your best bet would be to group up and do some Hillsbrad or Arathi; I'm 100% certain there are a few warriors and rogues that would kill their own mothers to have a healer to quest with and keep each other safe.
---
You're looking too deep into this :P imagine a bully. They get joy out of bullying you. Now let's say they bullied you and two seconds later the bullied kid gets a million dollars. Suddenly the bully feels bad cause he's jaelous. That's sorta the scenario where I would use karma. He did write to me after this and was lowkey salty that I got it.
---
becausee they said from the start that it will be gone for phase 2 and sooner if possible. 
---
The whole reason for layering was so we didnt have 4k people in a starting area trying to kill the same mob. but now everybody is higher level and more spread out around the world they can remove it.
---
"AOE erection" is something that makes me laugh !
---
I‚Äòm a little bit too old for that youtube stuff but I read about this in the news. Without a doubt I can say: fuck logan paul
---
Depends on what you‚Äôre doing.
---
That'd be the hunter, but a druid can handle itself well too.
---
Play what you enjoy, is the important thing.
---
Um, wait, does your character survive the landing if he falls on the rocks?
---
To be fair, if you‚Äôre right and there are a ton of people who haven‚Äôt hit 60 yet who plan to raid, releasing another raid/BWL shouldn‚Äôt really matter that much to you, since you‚Äôll have a bunch of people in your cohort who haven‚Äôt done MC regardless of whether or not BWL is out.
---
Not OP, but I imagine that by "it" they mean "fighting off the boredom".
---
If a level 60 is running a dungeon and theres only 1 thing (either quest or item) they need out of the place then its perfectly reasonable for them to reserve a single item. People who need that item can just not join
---
Stuff that bothers me is people forming groups reserving most or all the valuable items (unless its a geared tank selling smooth runs in exchange for BoEs or something like that) or saying "LF tank/healer, tank/healer gear reserved"
---
I just form my own group and add my guildies or friends first when able. One of the luxuries of playing a tank I suppose
---
Rigging implies the group OP is running is unaware. He says the reserve is mentioned in his LFM post. He doesn‚Äôt just swap to masterlooter right before the boss pulls. The group knows the deal and are there cause they need other gear. 100% completely fine
---
It's a good weapon for Warrior = Enh &gt; Hunter &gt; Druid
---
Warrior and Enhancement actually use the weapon, where as Hunter's and Druids pertty much just have it for STV questing.
---
That can actually be quite profitable if you run with it. That damn city is so far away most people are willing to throw some gold to get there.
---
It will say thst you are making strange gestures.
---
You really thought you could cheat the system that easily?
---
I‚Äòm lvl 23 now and have 16G. Am I on track for lvl 40 mount?
---
Beautiful :‚Äô)
---
Were you dropped-d?
---
Multibox is summoning their master.
---
How so fast?? :/
---
Daddy's back!
---
Bought this for my level 30 druid. will last me a while i think :)
---
Lots of places where you can grind mobs and other stuff. Like Winterspring or the Argent Dawn. Its not a giant loss.
---
Disgusting. Attack the opposite faction. Murder them till they give up.
---
hillsbrad, Nd scarlet monastry
---
It's not remotely the same. Paladins in classic have an amazing base skill set and fairly mediocre talent trees (except holy which is god tier). Retail made every class have a very barebones skill set and made the "talent" Choices extremely powerful so there are hard definitions of what each spec does as opposed to the grey area that pallies tread so well in classic.
---
Yeah and if I'm going to buy a weapon I prefer having STR+AGI
---
Why would you put an item on reserve if noone in your party needs it anyway?
---
2700 intellect = 40500 mana and something like 54 % spell crit at level 60!
---
Lol... Is this for real. 
---
Just pretend you are at max level and go run some dungeons lol
---
Are you dense? 
---
How the fuck would you know they don't need it before you invite them?
---
Upvoted for the great editing. 11/10 would recommend.
---
Is anyone else concerned about the Mass Transfers of alliance from Stalagg and Skeram to other realms like Heartseeker?
---
Not sure how unbalanced the faction levels will be and how it will affect gameplay
---
Isn't up to 50?
---
I'mma be honest I give blessing of might to mages and blessing of wisdom to warriors way to often. Then I feel stupid afterward but am too lazy to fix it
---
Is that the barrens one from the quest?
---
This is the reason we can't have nice things. Fucking Rogues.
---
Initially I never mentioned it but slurs and stuff would just come up in chat naturally. Eventually I started asking if guilds were LGBT friendly when I joined and people would crawl out of the woodwork to whisper me and it'd devolve from there
---
Maybe sort your life out if playing WoW on the phone is something you actually do.
---
Deliberately picking a race that lacks certain pvp tools in order to handicap yourself or make it harder on you is one thing. But again, and again and again, to act like there is no benefit to 99% of the playerbase by having a race that has good pvp racials is downright dishonest.
---
Tell me more, that sounds interesting
---
As a vegan I disavow him.
---
I play a mage with my Druid friend, the downtime doesnt feel as bad when he's running around killing things inbetween my Aoe pulls
---
"You are wrong"...laughed the fat controller
---
Layering has to be removed because of the introduction of world bosses.  This would be exploitable.

Only grind with rested experience and play your alt while you wait for rested xp to build. After a week you‚Äôll have a full level of rested xp.

That‚Äôs what happens when ur the healing officer

The secret troll village was my favourite
---
The former, although I wouldn't be as harsh in saying they "fucked up so hard". The stones were added late in vanilla, traveling and warlocks already had almost two years of encouragement. The meeting stones were a beginning to quality of life additions.
---
I know we weren't talking about modem classic, I was making an analogy. You apparently think coding is easy. Also, vanilla wasn't this magical "encourage the players to do this" age. Meeting stones with the ability to summon was going to be a thing in vanilla, but didn't until BC due to unspecified dev reasons, and there's nothing you can say to change that fact.
---
Stats don't work the same, talents became pick 6, PVP specific talents, talents for your weapon? (glyphs for your weapon??), first aid is now rolled into tailoring, LFG, crossrealm sharding, guild changes, dual spec, no ranged slot and ammunition, zone scaling. It feels like a completely different game, like how runescape 3 became if you are familiar with runescape 2.
---
I'm sure there's more changes but that is what I found in the little I plaed of retail after coming back.
---
Wut
---
See I've read this a lot about the lack of quests and always took it as fact as I'd never capped in classic.  Only making it to high 40s before BC prepatch.  Now I've called classic though and did so barely scratching the surface of epl/wpl quests.  Unless you only kill q mobs and only run each dungeon once you shouldn't rly struggle I think.  I didn't even run strath/scholo/ lbrs before capping this char and never farmed mobs for hours either.

I have 16 people on my kos list. I rerolled 2 weeks ago and just dinged 60. They are on it for good reasons and i hunt them down until they leave the server. Most are still 50 and stv campers. They will have soooo much fun in the coming days.
---
Not in classic.
---
Hunter in classic has just SO MANY more tools to use than in retail

Soon as i got it i was eyes of the beast pulling elites, using frost trap to aoe slow and kiting things to death

It just feels better in every way

I mean
---
I need same guild !
---
Posts like these make me feel bad, but I'm a single-target frost mage :( Decked my man out with spell/frost damage to roll through single mobs! 
---
Also did get the 3 points in blizzard just for when it's useful..
---
I am a rogue. In RFD we found a locked chest, the priest told us to roll for it, he won. Asked me to unlock it for him. I said that lockpicking is my profession, and since no one else can access the contents of this chest, I will just take it for myself. He started raging, calling me names I didn‚Äôt even know existed as insults. We were 15 mins in dungeon he stopped healing me altogether (not that I needed it). But what hurts the most - the final boss dropped a dagger that I really needed, he, a priest, rolled need, won, called me a greedy ninja looter and other stuff and just left. 
---
What I wanted to know - am I the asshole? Is it etiquette to unlock chests for others? Or was he in the wrong here? 
---
I ended up a loser in this scenario anyway, but I would like to know for future reference.
---
Anyone who says there's not enough quests to get to 60 is flat-out lying unless they've done absolutely no dungeons. I did NO grinding, only did each dungeon once, sometimes twice, barely ever had rested XP, and still had quests left over at 60.
---
People just skip quests they can't be bothered to do or don't think are worth doing, even though they might take you on a massive chain which is worth tons of XP. The more you skip at lower levels, the more you'll rely on doing higher level quests early, and the earlier you'll run out. That's the key - don't skip them at any level if you want to get to 60 via quests.
---
Look at all these alliance players trying to swindle more horde to transfer over. The imbalance has spiralled out of control, and these fake news about horde pop ‚Äúincreasing‚Äù is absolute bullshit. The sheer number of alliance players are drowning out the voices of actual horde players complaining about getting 1vs5 camped and filling it with lies of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù or ‚Äúmore horde have been joining‚Äù. 
---
All the horde seeing this post know thats not true, anything at 3-4hrs before or after peak hours show horde cant even fill a /who of a class at the upper levels. Disgusting alliance players are tricking more horde to come over while even MORE alliance are transferring to exaggerate the imbalance even more.
---
Dont kid yourselves, 90% of the positive talk about balance is alliance players. Lol.
---
Thanks! I also forgot to tell you I enjoyed your editing. Simple and yet fluid. I dislike all the PvP videos with loud music and constant camera rotations that forbid you to watch it before bed. Oh and continue with the touch of humour.
---
&gt; I thought it was basic politeness to not fish in a pool somebody else is fishing in.
---
Well it's not.
---
Your group, your rules. But propably would be best if you had core from guild (tank and heal covered) and only filled few spots from lfg. If people dont like it they can make their own groups (with blackjack and bitches).
---
tfw no AG
---
Enjoy. The only suggestion that I would give is seek out a few beginner YouTube videos on pet control in relation to dungeons. But don't let that stop you from entering into them. You would be selling yourself short. Just learn what to do, or more specifically what not to do and you are golden.
---
I have heard about this.
---
I have not watched this.
---
There is no way that I am going to watch this.
---
Or get the Spy addon - which I really think should't be allowed.
---
Opposite faction? Check. Thinking you own a pool because you put your rod in it? Check.
---
If it was same faction, I might have some empathy.
---
I have 12.5 days played and work 40 hours a week. It is not that hard but it have been the vast majority of my life after it went live.
---
That would be perfect
---
Your friend was alliance and got killed by a horde? Why would he need to make a second alliance tool if he already has his to take revenge with?
---
And blink, cone of cold and even snap. Honestly they deserve to die its natural selection.
---
People seem miffed about the title of the video. Look, why is it up for such a debate :P? The rogue did something dickish and responded with a tauntly " :)" after stealing a chest. Then a second later an epic drops and we told him right away it dropped, ruining his little moment of  gratification through theft. It's basically if a bully bullies you cause it makes him feel good but then you get a million dollars, that would surely make the bully feel jaelous and that, is karma, no? If not then shush, enjoy instead :P

Don't lower ranks get full effect from added healing power?

Important question as tank paladin in classic: Does reckoning work with /sit macros, and if so how? I've seen people claim it doesn't and people claim it does, even people claiming that it works only if you stand up just as you get hit.
---
Could any kind paladin explain me how to do it if possible? If not, is it still worth to level it up, or should I go for consecration instead first for aoe pulling? (lvl 30 human paladin). Thanks for the time &lt;3
---
Healing.
---
Well... Between Alliance and Horde there is no etiquette really...
---
You are lucky he isn't killing you (if you are on a PVP Server)
---
You will just have to deal with it.
---
But generally I'd say it is etiquette to let someone have his pool when he is already fishin in it
---
With the launcher closed you can play retail and classic at the same time?
---
Very one dimensional.
---
and tanking isnt actually required until BRD :)

Depending on your profession you may want to grind reputation for the furbolgs in felwood, if you want any of their recipes.
---
Mc doesn't have Long encounters
---
Not sure that's a healthy attitude to play.
---
If the others play badly, I usually give some hints in a non-confrontative friendly way and when people don't listen, I just play to the best of my ability.
---
If it means I have to drink every pull I'll do that.
---
I tend to get some "I'm playing on a higher difficulty this run"-mentality.
---
The only way to maximize your aoe threat in vanilla is to use engineering shield/oil of immolation + engi grenades
---
Last evening I was mining iron nodes as a 52lvl warrior. Went to hillsbrad and to the yeti cave, saw 3 alliance teasing 1 horde player at time. I killed them them and became hero of said yeti cavern.

Are you fishing up the delights in barrens?

"**One of his friends" is a bit of a drama queen.**
---
I'd buy it for 4-5 gold for leveling purposes, but you'd be better off selling it to someone who wants a twink in the 39 bracket.
---
It seems you lack the necessary logic to understand the concept of reserving items.  
---
Either you join a group where you can roll on anything you might need except &lt;insert item&gt; or you don't join and find another group that offers terms you can agree with.   
---
Not that hard of a concept to understand is it? Nobody is making you join this group so you are free to join another one instead of complaining and judging people who have no issue in joining these types of run.
---
Your bags are so tidy o:
---
Just repeating what others have said, but it's important:
---
Revenge only costs 5 rage, and it has the highest threat value of any skill in your book. Make sure you have it bound and prioritize it every time it procs. It helps so much when you're low on rage.
---
every single ganking  guild on every server is horde? That‚Äôs some startling news.

Yes it‚Äôs echeyakee and he was my pet all through retail. Decided to get the Rake on clsssic tho for the increased attack speed.
---
Sure, you're a rogue and without you they couldn't unlock the Chest - But it is in a Group Dungeon, and without them you wouldn't get to the Chest either. Roll for it, and Honor the Roll.
---
He's a raging one, you're a minor one. Just because you're the only one that can unlock it doesn't automatically make it yours, it's one of the few utilities besides pressing sinister strike that you bring (as a fellow rogue player, trust me on this.) You pick locks and stab butts.
---
Happy cake day you menace
---
Gratz on getting Echeyakee....but you do know it doesnt spawn like a normal mob? it is a quest, where the horde have a horn to summon Echeyakee?   So a friendly horde must have summoned it for you.
---
It's BM to reserve anything.
---
Everyone I know thought Blizzard was under-estimating how many people would play and how long they‚Äôd stick around for.  The only real disagreement was whether it was going to be ‚Äúcatastrophically bad‚Äù (basically, what we got,) or just ‚Äúpretty bad.‚Äù
---
To be fair to Blizzard, however, it can be extremely hard to estimate how something you‚Äôve invested so much in is going to be received by the public.  You become so engrossed in it that making anything resembling an objective or unbiased assessment is impossible.
---
If you stack loads of +heal you can downrank alot, my brother often uses rank 1 heals even and barely even loses mana at +650 bonus heal
---
I think the addons aren't allowed to access the data to clear auras however you can make do with /clearaura macros.
---
For example, Healing Touch.
---
 #showtooltip Healing Touch
---
/cancelaura Bear Form(Shapeshift)
---
/cancelaura Cat Form(Shapeshift)
---
/cast Healing Touch
---
This would take you out of the form, cast Healing Touch with one single press.
---
back in the early days of shakes and fidget this was how you made shrooms.
---
had an account with over 100Mill shrooms and stopped playing coz this is basicly an i win everything button.
---
when i checked it out again last year the bets where a % of your "cashpool"
---
In my case I can work and play at the same time !
---
If you still get ZF xp I'd run that a few times, it's fun and good to farm. Then go to Searing Gorge, it won't take long to do all the things there but it's easy xp. Then go to Ungoro and grind grind grind (theres mobs every 5 feet so have fun)
---
\+ healing is flat across all ranks. So you can spam low rank spells for very little mana and get a ton of +healing on it.
---
Definatelly yes, you have to say that before inviting people to group.
---
I'm a newish player (wotlk) but I think that you were in the wrong here. It's common courtesy to unlock locked boxes like that. Can't you even do it in the trade thing without even trading?
---
Spell batching doesnt affect this at all?
---
That‚Äôs not what the original comment I replied to said at all. I don‚Äôt understand why people keep debating me on WoW is bad, as if I even said it was good/better than classic. The guy said he quit because there was too many spells, then you go and give me 100 reasons why you quit when I said that quitting because of too many spells is stupid.
---
I'm a herber/skinner. So might grind on stuff in Ferelas to get the last 5 bars and ding 52, then head to ungoro.
---
Yep, that's the joke alright. You nailed it...
---
If you rolled for the chest, lost and took it anyway, you are an asshole. If you didn't but said nothing about it kind of an asshole too. He was right to be mad but ninja looting because of a precedent ninja looting is assholish too. He should have just kicked you out instead of ninjaing.
---
Jeez, luckily I'm just having a good time and not playing in a competitive guild.
---
Even recently?
---
AFAIK they limited range to 20 yards for the cvar or console command (don't remember which).
---
In my opinion a locked chest is not the Rogues by default. Each class brings something to the dungeon and you complete it as a team of 5. All chests should be rolled for, locked or not. This is just how I see it and I wouldn't react at all if a Rogue decided that locked chests were his/hers to loot - even though I do not agree with it
---
people early on went from 54ish to 60 in couple hours there, maximum of 2 hours per level.
---
You just can't see them because they're in stealth.
---
Tbh you should fish in the river instead. Raw Greater Sagefish sells for more than Oily Blackmouth and Firefin Snapper, not too sure about Stonescale Eel though.
---
Use perception dog
---
If you really don't want to do quests and are in duo you can just do AoE farming in dungeons alone, Elite mobs give quite a few XP, you can reset etc...  
---
starting around 20-ish+ you can do Stockades AoE farming where they're pretty much all melee, then later on go to SM, then ZF, then BRD then you're 55-58 gg
---
Classic is easy lol
---
I too am on Ashbringer, Horde
---
Did you misspell thrash or am I old af?
---
There are no quests in Silithus in phase 1.
---
I see enough rogues. I think the overwhelming amount of people playing warriors and mages makes every other class  look underpopulated though.
---
Id say theres a lot of rogues, but you will probably never see more then 1 in a group, maybe 2, we don't like sharing loot
---
&gt; you don't join and find another group that offers terms you can agree with.
---
This is what I do. I get it, you're just greedy and it's a completely different playstyle.
---
poker need the monetary aspect to work. without anything tangable the betting raising and bluffing is meningless.
---
People who need the trinket
---
People who already have the MH weapon but not the OH (like me).
---
No I mean the guy who's trying to Steal the chest while, oi are killing mpbs
---
It puts him in combat whi h means he can't loot it
---
Oh man leveling these bastards takes so long, good luck.
---
Are you sure about that, son?
---
ZF is a little low by now. But Maraudon-Princess-Runs and Temple should be on the menu.
---
Back in the day on my rogue, I'd unlock for whoever won; my mage would  make water for everyone; my warlock would summon anyone (as long as they're more than like 2 mins away). It's up to you, but I always tend to think dungeon groups are about the group sharing skills and helping each other through a run. It's no big deal to open something for someone.
---
&lt;screams in Trixie Mattel&gt;
---
Debatable as a dick move, however you really made the situation the worst you possibly could for yourself for a few reason
---
1. Lockpicking is part of your utility, all other classes are expected to provide their utility to benefit the dungeon as a whole. I don't charge for Summons as a Warlock.
---
2. You waited until after everyone had decided to roll on the contents of the chest to declare you wouldn't open it, essentially making it you vs the 4 of them. If you had an issue opening the chest you should have said so beforehand.
---
3. You then proceeded to make it worse by telling them that you would just take it for yourself. There was a clear consensus on the roll system established and you decided not to participate, it's no wonder you were immediately ostracized. You chose not to play by the party rules.
---
imo you got what you deserved, let this be a lesson not to intentionally piss off teammates like that.
---
That's pretty much every conflict ever
---
Lol! Seems like classic is not for you haha
---
Sorry to say that in this instance you were in the wrong, you are correct that you were the only one with the ability to open the chest, however you wouldn't have gotten to the chest without the help of the team. It was a group effort get to that chest, therefore everyone deserves a chance at the reward.
---
I asked for food while farming felcloth and the mage said 50s. I said ok and payed it, I got my 3 stacks of food as the mage asked me to help him at the quest he was doing in northwest felwood at these satyrs. He said he wasn‚Äôt interested in any loot. I said 2g because helping another one questing is certainly more work than just conjuring some food.
---
Suddenly I was an asshole for charging money for helping someone questing...
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cFj6T9lOtM
---
Having 4 wow subscriptions is in your opinion the biggest waste of money and time? That‚Äôs sad if you actually think that.
---
Resistance works the same player or pet.
---
Preaaaachhh!
---
I mean, every pool yields more than one fish usually, so I don't really care if somebody fishes out their share, too.
---
You have fire ward also
---
ITT: im a galmbling addict but take it out on softcore gambling
---
You're both assholes. You couldn't/wouldn't get that chest without the help of the 4 other people in the group, they couldn't/wouldn't get that chest open without you (or a blacksmith key or an engineering bomb).
---
As a rogue, you bring two things to the party: damage (which literally every class can do, so you're easily replaced there) and lockpicking.  
---
In short, the group earned that chest, and you failed to do the one thing that makes you uniquely valuable.
---
Chests virtually never have more than 1g worth of items in there. All you did was piss off your party over a few pieces of low level food and maybe a couple potions.
---
In the future, either claim you don't have lockpicking trained up, then go loot the chest after the last boss is dead and everyone leaves, or just roll for the chest.
---
Well , in first place y all rolled for the chest and he won , so yes you should open his chest , i mean roques have the lockpicking skill doesnt mean y will take all the lockboxes . That skill makes y usefull in parties . But in the end rolling need foe the dagger was very mean ...He wasnt cool , but y made the mistake in the first place ...too greedy .
---
The spooky sound of terror in STV
---
Also more shamans than in classic
---
Yea, I should have mentioned that I didn‚Äôt see the chest was locked, he just told to roll.
---
But thanks, I genuinely did not know the rules on this one!
---
Some zones it looks pretty good. Others it can really blow out. I love Ashenvale type zones with the effect. 
---
Tanaris is often quite eye piercing with it on.
---
Rogues are great, but the internet has popularized mages and warriors into oblivion. On most servers they comprise of at least 40% of the server population which is quite significant considering there's 9 classes in total.
---
All the children growing up to playing the cool class has now aged and chose something else.
---
Yeah, you are in the wrong. Your class can unlock chests just as others can rezz or tank. Unless it's specified that you can take it for yourself it's always a group roll
---
Well...
---
I have not done any dungeon tbh. I kill a lot more than all the quest Mobs but I wanted to get to 60 fast and didn't bother with dungeons.
---
If you do a lot of dungeons (I.E. grinding before you hit 58-60) then you cancel out the grind at Level 58-60 pretty much.
---
It doesn't matter when you grind EXP. It just has to happen.
---
All that is needed from you is to get certain amounts of EXP outside of questing.
---
Doesn't matter when or where you get it really. As Long as you don't grind 15 Levels in the beginning and skipping all those quests :d
---
you are actually a fucking loser.
---
And I'm still 35 &gt;.&gt;
---
Kinda, happened to me on pservers. I wish i never played on them. Although i had a frickin blast i rather would experience it now with classic.
---
I think most of the people on my pve server realize rogues won't be super strong until AQ, so they're waiting to raid with them.
---
Not pvp server and it‚Äôs obviously intentional when he is emoting /lol at me every time he does it
---
Probably because a lot of people are riding the spell/melee cleave train.
---
no was in alterc
---
never heard of that at all.  there are limited pools, so if you are after the same fish, then its fair game to be honest.
---
Not sure if it is in classic, but it worked in vanilla wow while mind controlling another player as a priest.
---
Learning is half the fun of the game! Shame the Priest was a bit foul mouthed, but better to learn the hard way than not at all I guess lol
---
Somehow it disappeared every time he fished in it though then he would /lol at me and do it again
---
Needs a Strawpoll.  But A.  As others have said its the straight line for autorunning.
---
Don't think they're treating it like it's new necessarily... just since the option to turn it off disappeared many years ago, people assume it was simply baked into the game.
---
thank you, good plan :D
---
This is bis twink stuff.  May be worth saving for later phases
---
What about the 20-ish for horde? cause i think it'll be quite hard for us to get to stockades as horde
---
Yeah, like kick for rogues. I will never waste my money on upgrading that skill.
---
In addition to that: no raid group needs additional tanks
---
We've done well over 1,200 summons now, we've only had four instances that without a doubt they were intentionally not paying us. Half of those instances have been from one very small toxic guild, that we've blacklisted.  
---
 In general, people are good. With disconnects, lag, other issues, we give the benefit of the doubt.
---
It‚Äôs a huge stretch of river enough for everyone so when he is intentionally doing it and then emoting at me.. if I see someone fishing I go find my own pool?
---
What they mean by tauren getting extra range is on male tauren, their character model is so big that they have more range in melee. They can hit someone in melee while staying out of melee range with them.
---
Your so far ahead money wise that you might as well. Gold starts to ramp up with higher levels too, so I don't see a reason not to invest to money....to make more money.
---
...what?
---
Why are you being an asshole? What's your problem anyway? It's his time and he chooses his time however he wants, you want him be your slave and live his life however you want or what? Who are you to tell him what is an accomplishment to him and what is not. We are all individuals and while to you this may seem like nothing, to him it's a lot and vice versa. You have issues.
---
Everything but Night Elf for both factions is viable. Dwarf gets Fear Ward which many would argue is the best but the Human's racial can be situationally valuable in the caster matchup. For Horde it is a harder argument and while Undead WotF and devouring plague will do quite well it is worth considering the troll. Troll gives a heal debuff with Hex and the shadowguard has a chance to prove blackout so you get the occasional free stun when struck.
---
For trash pulls you have to do (early two packs with the double dogs and 4 elites, triple ogres, packs on the way to Wyrm) it's one of the few places I actually want CC as a tank. The only other place I think I ask for CC is one mob per pull on Draki trash. 
---
I'd the group is bad I'll maybe ask for cc for some later strat living packs or early scholo packs. 
---
Also Voone hits, along with Golem Lord and Emp, insanely hard for no seeming reason given the rest of the dungeon. Not quite Krastinov damage but not far off.
---
I don't think the dungeon is super tough but it's one of the more difficult dungeons to run fast and has a few mechanics to make note of.
---
There's also a really good blue quest necklace in hinterlands if you're horde. I don't know of its alliance.
---
Suggest you don't ask Mages for food or portals in a dungeon with that attitude.
---
Hilarious isn't it I'm in hysterics
---
Wait 15 seconds and it should say 4 minutes?
---
I rolled one now because my guild has 6, me being one of three above 30 with the rest starting rogue day 1. The last census I saw on Westfall had them just above druids on the alliance.
---
Ye, every talent tree has 21/30 disc/holy with that reduced mana cost for instant spells... but I advice every priest should go  26/25  disc/holy for fresh 60 for that sweet +10% INt bonus, which is scaling with +Int items.. Healing power talents are raw.
---
Funny enough most of the hunters I've run with been well aware of the meme and try extra hard to not be that guy. The mages seem oblivious
---
&gt;Hunter traps not being usable in combat, terrible design
---
If only there was a way for hunters to drop out of combat
---
No, no multiboxing here, otherwise we wouldn't have one location added at a time, we would have had all at once.  
---
Also, a lot of money, for those ten different accounts.
---
Makes me more sick he has item level turned on; misinformation of the century
---
im lvl 26 with one alt lvl 18 how the fuck you guys have time for 3 60s?!?!
---
What a shitty excuse x)
---
So has rooftop ganking.
---
Gw2 mechanics time.
---
Morally? No. Is it in line with the factions at war? Absolutely.
---
Clear your schedule because it‚Äôs gonna be a busy ride.
---
I wish this was IF in retail bc I love going there for AH shenanigans.
---
Dont really need any, just press fire ward off cd. I personally use the onyxia amulet for 10stam15FR because i dont have strat live neck yet. And the alternatives would give me no dps increase
---
Literally nobody in my group thought the same as you. It almost seemed like they had a ¬´rogues are dicks¬ª mentality from before.
---
Id say if you are still under +200 healing, int is better, after that just go with +healing. Obviously int, spirit, mp5 and STAMINA are still valuable, but not as much (on a druid) compared to +healing.
---
Healing touch r5 should be your go to spell after +200 healing, it gives 1:1 from +healing gear. So each +heal will heal 1hp more. Obviously there are times when you have to spam heal to keep targets up, but this is when the incoming damage is relatively slow/low.
---
They're not shabby but mage is FOTM and possibly FOTY until some new raids drop.
---
Dude the opposite faction literally exists to murder you. Stealing your fish is well within their domain, even if it‚Äôs A) not stealing and B) Not your fish. I don‚Äôt think anyone here is shocked that an opposite faction player trolled you in one of the few ways they could on your care bear server
---
Salute to fellow hunter! Appreciate the patience.
---
&gt; so far ahead money
---
am I tho?
---
My dad plays a druid atm (forget what level he is now) and lemme tell ya that if you play them right, you can seriously dominate with them. I know you already decided to go back to druid, so I'd suggest trying playing around with different attack methods and see of you can spice up play a bit to make it more interesting
---
Real questions
---
wtf does bm mean?
---
Wrong. +power is cast time or duration over 3.5 seconds, maxing at 100%
---
Rejuv would gain 100% at r1 because it lasts like 15 seconds
---
A 1.5s healing touch cast would only receive 1.5/3.5 (less than half)
---
Poisons per minute wasn't a think until 3.1. Right now there's not limit to how many times it can proc so a faster offhand will proc poisons more. Not to mention when you're completing the SM quest you're probably not going to have Sword spec unlocked yet (the assassination tree has far more useful talents at a lower level and I've always filled it out first) and Black menace is technically more dps than Sword of Serenity because of its 30 shadow damage proc. Even if you don't take Black Menace you should never take Sword of Serenity because you can very easily replace it at level 39 with a much better sword so take Bonebitter for the extra gold it vendors for at least

He said she kept zigzagging. He bugged her intentionally to kill her easily. It is the prime example of an exploit.
---
Ghost. Mushrooms.
---
Go play on a pve server.
---
Imagine this dude jumping on to Reddit as soon as he sees "5m" over his key bind lmfao
---
He was Horde, got killed by Alliance, made an Alliance account and added his killer as a friend so he would know what zone the guy was in, go to that zone on his high level Horde character, and kill/camp the Alliance guy.
---
Makes perfect sense.
---
For me is was more about spending my time doing what I want.  For example I'm currently farming elementals in Silithus for mats for my robe....  I've been there for 5-6 hours total, and I've farmed for that whole time.  On a PvP realm I would probably have about 3-4 hours of actual farming.  The other 2-3 would surely have been spent on corpse runs, or otherwise getting dead to wpvp.
---
Oh that makes sense then why I don't have any at 57! Lol
---
Your opinion is invalid. 
---
Aoe farming always existed.
---
We have been full clearing since week 2 and I got one piece of raid loot
---
Your flare already is one of the best PvP classes and literally the best solo PvE class.
---
You can just sic your pet on something and autoshoot to victory, no need to cast any spells.
---
"The way is shut" , love these kind of stories
---
He don't worry these people are the no lifers, they make up a small percentage of wow. The avg lvl right now is somewhere in the 40s someone pointed out. You will be fine.
---
Very interesting with the different frost bolt rank because he is mounted - thanks.
---
You won the roll, it's your loot. EOD
---
Has any other rogue.. or anyone for that matter encountered not getting buffs? I don‚Äôt get battle shout, wind fury, and trueshot aura.. its been going on for 4 days now, and everything the GMs have told me to do hasn‚Äôt helped at all lol.
---
A shitty deal, I've got to work my ass off as Healpriest to make some Money, while Mages just doing their ae grind and swim in gold. The least they can do is, to spent their potential healer 5 seconds to make some water.
---
Even on a PvE server there‚Äôs no incentive to not screw over the opposite faction. Even on PvE servers you can still flag PvP and start some shit, so maybe bait him out for a quick death match.
---
Is it any good? because I deleted it because it looked like vendor trash.
---
I guess Mage would suit your needs
---
Are you sure your macro is exactly the same as mine? Can you provide a screenshot?
---
Galvadon, the last
---
I leveled my mage to 19 thinking I finally stick to maining it. After I read and hear all the hate for mages I started leveling Warlock üòÇ
---
&gt; What‚Äôs the proper way not to go oom? Consumables and lower ranks of lighting bolt?
---
Simply put yes. There's tons of homework on your part to adjust your gear with the proper rank, boss kill time, buffs, etc...
---
I need a warlock macro that casts one of my dots and tells my follower to attack my target. How would I do that?
---
I thought so, too! But as far as PvP goes, I‚Äôll always have to worry about kiting. I mean, I‚Äôm not going pro or anything but always having to worry about distance in (w)PvP sounds like a bit of a hassle to me ;c. I‚Äôm sorry for being so nitpicky, I appreciate the help so much!
---
How can they dispel mage snares? Sorry, never played a paladin
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19159/woven-ivy-necklace](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=19159/woven-ivy-necklace) great neck to get before pre raid bis pieces, horde only
---
Are you /pvp flagged in horde territory/dungeons? Non flagged members cant buff you
---
Admittedly FD + trap is a little broken at present
---
But i have used it with varying degrees of success throughout levelling
---
But the rest of his arguments are baseless
---
Ring runs usually sell for 20-25g afaik, good for you.
---
Up y go !!! I travelled the other day from arathi to badlands and i killed every single npc or low lvl alliance i meet in my way ...i end up dying from an unknown gnome mage but it was fun ...
---
Note 1 . Kill them when y can 
---
Note 2 . Why is always a gnome mage;;;
---
Warlock does just about everything, caster dps with pets, wild utility and resource manipulation. PvE rotation is essentially Shadow Bolt and corruption so if you can keep those up you're doing well. Not only that, but your existence justifies itself in a raid because of your Curse, so you just show up and slap curses on stuff. Good at what it does.
---
Good PvP, can go for drain tanky affliction, pet juggling demonologist or Seduce Soul Fire one shot Destro memes. Great at controlling fights, basically impossible to fight 1v1 in WPvP after you get Death Coil.
---
Farming is easy, DoT up some mobs and let your pet draw a bit of aggro, fear one and let the DoTs grind them down while you deal with the others. Pretty straightforward. 
---
Out of all the classes I alt-aholiced on I settled on warlock eventually because it has just the right amount of diversity while still being a dedicated DPS class. And a strong one at that. Also, Warlock is currently underrepresented, especially on Alliance side. Pick a little gnome lock and terrorise Tarren Mill today!
---
So are you unable to level this pet up if you‚Äôre at 60?
---
Hnnngh I just got my Crescent Staff, and now my sub is out for the month
---
Damn I‚Äôm not sure, won‚Äôt be able to check for a few hours. Does it have to be on, or off?
---
I level both a hunter and a rogue in vanilla and back then both classes were so much fun. Having to buy ammo and tend to your pet and on the rogue having to make poisons and level lock picking. Classic/vanilla classes were so much more immersive
---
Bro, I think he did more than just keyboard turning wrong, no? Obviously keyboard turning is a mistake, so obvious in fact is it worth mentioning? Maybe I should have been more specific.
---
It would be like me crashing my car and asking someone what I could have done better and you replying "dont crash your car"
---
&gt;I mean, in RFC, nobody really cares if the tank actually has all the threat, since the mobs die incredibly fast anyways. Don't worry too much.
---
To build off this,  don't feel bad if you cant maintain aggro on every mob all the time. AoE is very common and things pull occasionally. Just stay calm, consider your comp (ex if a warrior pulls threat that's a 2 on concern scale,  healer it's an 8+ depending on how dangerous the mob is) and try to get it back under control. Your job isnt to make everyone take 0 damage,  it's to mitigate as much as possible while making sure your healer is safe
---
sadly much higher level than me so I wouldn‚Äôt have stood a chance lol. Ended up leaving- I can go back later when he is gone I hope.
---
/cast Curse of Agony  
---
/petattack
---
Why? Phase 2 won't introduce any noticable progression related stuff. The only real goal is to get as close to 60 as possible before the open world pvp raids start forming. 
---
Just take a look at this:
---
Phase 2 
---
&gt;Dire Maul  
---
&gt;Azuregos  
---
&gt;Kazzak  
---
&gt;Honor System (including Dishonorable Kills)  
---
&gt;PvP Rank Rewards 
---
In Phase 1 for many the main goal is getting to 60. 
---
In Phase 2 the main goal is getting to PvP rank 3 for the Epic mount discount and slowly working your way towards it (Dire Maul is a farming spot for many classes) while you acquire your attunements, end-game quest rewards and pre-raid dungeon gear.
---
We love you too &lt;3
---
Thats why I"ll only do dungeons, I wont be a n***er for some wow nerds so they can get their shiny items, gonna make gold on these suckers flipping raid mats on AH.
---
^ This. Save money for the mount, you can farm later more effectively to train any gathering past 225 while still being able to gather.
---
I doubt thats why.
---
If I didnt downvote you, surely others didnt.
---
If you can open it the normal is to just roll on it like a normal chest. or say your skill isn't high enough, and go get it for yourself when nobody is around.
---
at 59, all my quests are for dungeons but i don't have time for them during the weekends, so right now im grinding scarlet warders in plaguelands
---
Yeah priest vs priest the ud wins. But my thought was that the dwarven kit is a bit more versatile. It has a measure against fear, although worse than wotf, but it also has a measure against blind other poisons and bleed
---
What level can I do Maraudon as a melee dps? Thrash blade quest requires 45, but I have seen several groups only inviting 50+
---
I actually prefer it the way how I can configure Mik's to show it. Makes it much easier to find then if it was above the head of someone I might or might not even see in the moment.
---
However, the default font of Mik's is super-terrible and I suggest any sane person to change it to something were letters and numbers actually are not randomly turned by some degrees. :o
---
worth watching: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM)
---
I believe it‚Äôs just that the Boomy is kiting her around the rock and the mob changes pathing each time the player strafes too far one side making the pathing distance shorter and so the boss changes direction and so on. This seems completely legitimate to me as it‚Äôs a game mechanic.
---
Probably just make a macro that presses your Dot button + your pets attack command (Default is ctrl+1 I believe)
---
it's not a dick move at all if they announce it clearly beforehand. That is how a free  market works, you have choices.  If I am a warlock and wouldn't care a bit for that sword, I might gladly join that group if I needed something else. As it will probably a fast run.
---
If I need it myself, I would find another group or start my own run.
---
More choice is always better.  
---
Now, if every rogue and warrior starts their own reserve runs, they will quickly notice that that doesn't work, because there would not be enough players in other classes interested in such runs, so they would never fill up. Forcing the rogues/warriors to change tactics.  so it's self correcting.
---
Do note that, if still applied, there is a coefficient for how much % of +healing power a spell rank receives.
---
Can't remember the exact details for all, but the concept goes as follows:
---
A max rank receives 100% bonus of +healing power.
---
A rank 1 receives 0% bonus of healing power.
---
So you wanna use the rank which optimizes mana efficiency, while maintaining highest possible output.
---
Same goes for +spell power btw.
---
Good video on healing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLyXin7jpqM)
---
My current goals at a noobish level 40 is to get my mount (65g at the moment), tame broken tooth and to get to 60.
---
And then theres me sitting on that lv 30 sham x)
---
Except people still blunder into fake ones while fighting. lol
---
3-4 people, logging in and out for each location.
---
&gt; I'm willing to bet whenever you sign on there are same-level players everywhere in your zone right? These are our people!
---
Yeah, that's true. 
---
I guess it's not that bad, but I felt like ranting (not very seriously) anyway :D
---
I appreciate your reply so much. This was truly written in the most genuine way! Thank you so much for that!!
---
Doesn‚Äôt a lock suffer from a LOT of abilities though? Wouldn‚Äôt that scare a new player like me away? Thank you so much once again!
---
I knew there'd be a comment like this. Wp sir
---
Thanks, I'll try taking him on again tonight! I'd actually forgotten that wands are very highly recommended (and a must) for priests.
---
Nah classic hunter is pure trash in comparison to MoP or WotLK hunter design. I know you guys like to circlejerk a lot around here but let's be real.
---
Someone made a post about the whelps in the badlands being around 18s/kill when accounting for the pet you may want go check there
---
Damn Welsh
---
I am not sure if it's necessary, but I use a macro like /cast [pet:succubus] Seduction. It works for me.
---
same here, same here.
---
Does that work well for you? I heard the 26% stun chance is split out onto the entire 15 seconds channel time, and it therefore is very low and sucks major ass
---
I used to have EU and US accounts as the more active twinking scene was US server based.  
---
It will require two separate subscriptions and IIRC you also have 2 separate installs, just think it them as two separate 'games' and that'll answer most of the questions you'd have.
---
Strange, I thought it might be the server you are on but we are on the same server. I see a ton of rogues, one of the most popular classes besides mages/warriors.
---
I am not sure what I am doing wrong. I level up Tailoring/Enchanting/Fishing/Cooking/First Aid but I don't think that I spend much for leveling them up. If I sum it up I don't think that I have spent more than 10-20g for the professions.
---
excuse me. this should  be level 44 and sell for 44s 44c. they clearly made a mistake right there.
---
Can't help with VuhDoper se, but Grid has this function built-in. Long time Grid user here, that's all the unit frame stuff I need to do my healing - coupled with mouseover macros, should also be fine with click-to-heal addons.
---
clearly feral and enhancement are the kings for this. both of us would use ALL stat. thats unique!
---
Clearly
---
I never attack opposite faction while they‚Äôre fishing. It‚Äôs lame and quite frankly, cowardly.
---
Let me put my shit on and we can go at it, you gutless loser.
---
That‚Äôs my policy, anyway.
---
I play literally like 12-15 hours a day and I just hit lvl 58 on my warrior, I must play like x2 x3 times slower than some other unemployed nerds here lol
---
To avoid this argument in every thread
---
Imagine being AFK for longer than 2 minutes to let the roll timer wear off, coming back to PC to see what has transpired while someone in your party has been dutifully grinding away while you were off being useless, then coming to Reddit to try to get justification that you should have had a fair chance at the item - completely disregarding all of the above.

2/3 vs 3/3 is the pserver vs classic specifics. Things work bit differently in Classic than what people trained on pservers.
---
Just bind it to your abilities.
---
This is real
---
MOP and wotlk were the beginning of the homogenisation and where the diluting of the class began
---
TBC was the classes golden time, and vanilla was the start of that

Soon as they added the "ROFLHELICOPTER" melee spec i was done, devs have lost the plot with class design and balance

Ah thanks, do you have any preference in music? I would use some more chill tracks but I'm at a conflict, chill music is overused by every content maker (mostly cause it's easier to find royalty free music), on the other hand rock music is overused by WoW community.  
---
Thanks for the editing feedback, I'm still trying to figure it out. I wanna keep it simple, we ain't teenagers anymore to stomach the camera rotation backflips. 
---
Nice, someone who appreciates a good distract kill. There are many silly ways to kill someone or have fun with them so there's more to come for sure.
---
That's not bad, they're great healers! You also need more healers than tanks in a raid.
---
Sharing your bnet account information is a good way to lose everything. So I don't fear of this.
---
Buying new account with fresh lvl 60 toon could be, but I highly doubt it will have a big market.
---
why do people pretend this is funny
---
The bit about not having rage
---
Well - no.
---
The pathing is a game mechanic and it is used to play the game. Using it is no exploit. It is clever use.
---
Just like running out of line of sight to stop the casters casting... no you could run in and out of the casters vision to let him stay there indefinitely. This is no exploit.
---
If it was we would have seen a lot of band already because this same kind of pathing exploit is also used to farm DME as a mage (and other classes) 
---
There is so many things that could count as both. But this is confirmed not an exploit
---
I've seen fewer than 5 in dungeons. That's impressive
---
You weren‚Äôt afk 1-2 mob kills if the roll timer wore off.

I have never asked which one is the best. I asked what playstyle does it equal, so basically, what I was asking was whether this or that spec rely more on combo point/stealts/yellow dmg/white dmg/stunning etc. 
---
In no point I asked about what is better, all I asked was a playstyle behind these specs. 
---
An answer I did not get yet.

so far STV was my favourite zone

From what i know, Vuhdo's built in incoming healing display does not work.   
---
What you need is an addon called HealComm, pair with another healing unit frames, I used Luna and Healbot and both work.
---
I liked Luna but it doesn't show when players are out of range which made healing a pain because i couldn't tell who i could heal and who i couldn't.
---
I now use healbot with healcomm and it shows incoming healing, but i've used vuhdo for many years and prefer it. According to someone else who replied on the thread, the newest version of vuhdo shows incoming healing so i'll have to check it out.

Doesn't affect it at all

Humanoid mobs or mobs that drop weapons. I like to recommend the dragons in Dustwallow.

Honestly, you should just quest and level. You're on track to get your mount at 40/41.

If you're really desperate for it, grind SM.

I have heard that the buff limit is bugged. I haven't heard about them fixing it. Every piece of equipment that says something like Equip: +28 Attack Power or such counts as an Aura and a buff. You can only have 32 buffs, so if you have like 25 such effects from gear, you don't get effected by actual buffs if you get more than 7 buffs.

No his is not greedy, just pragmatic.   He is using the free market as it is intended.  If not enough people like his 'wares' (the group he is forming)  he will fail, but if his terms and conditions are ok to (a subset of) the audience he will succeed.

It really is that simple.

Alex my man
---
&gt; It's 2019 people don't need a direct link to get a product that they might want. If the idea is put in their mind
---
It's 2019 and power leveling services have existed forever in many game, like selling gold. This reddit post is not adding anything to common knowledge.
---
It's not an exploit that you may not know exists.
---
Honestly if I was with someone who went afk and while they were afk dropped a purple boe,  it should be my loot, period. 
---
If the person came back just in in time to roll (but didn't touch the mob), they had better pass or that would become an issue.
---
If you afk while someone else kills mobs, sure you can get the free xp and free drops from the mobs bodies,  but you have no right to any green or higher items. 
---
No work no reward, pretty standard
---
There is no best.
---
You either know you have a long encounter where you need more total mana to be able to heal sufficient or you know this encounter is like Lucifron and you kill it in 40 seconds so better have more BANG on your heals because its very likely that the find is over and you have 2k mana left you didnt use anyway.
---
BIS Lists focus on calculating the Healing Equivalence Points and to burst everyones bubble, the exact value derived from each stat will vary from one week to the next, even on the same boss -&gt; because the "fight" changes the further you progress.
---
Do your first lucifron kill, probably takes 2 or 3 minutes.
---
Do your 10th luci kill, probably takes less than a minute.
---
So gear you used with certain stats for this encounter which were BIS might not even be BIS anymore because now the bosskilltime is much lower.
---
You always want to consider frontloaded healing and backloaded healing depending on the boss.
---
BIS lists are no good representation of the best gear for every situation, they are just telling you which gear has the overall best potential, still a Trinket with 500 bonus healing might be worse compared to a Trinket with 2500 extra mana for a specific fight.
---
There is no easy answer and there is no "this item is better", this item is better only affects items which just share the same stats but one item has higher numbers.
---
Oke buddy.
---
mate I am just posting that the addon is saying (35-40)
---
And jesus again if you are 52 as a new player that has no idea about the game then you are A playing 16 hours a day  B following a leveling guide  C spamming nothing but dungeons D you are using aUt0PIl0t ClasSiC

You are not even close to being the "Standart" wow classic player  if you are 50 plus atm  especially with borderlands 3 releasing 2 weeks after classic

Shimmering flats basilisks next to path do Gadgetzan. They drop up to two grey items which vendor for 11s. Fill your bags with everything, go sell to Gadgetzan, repeat. Also you can just play bit more and get income from 40+ instances and rapidly increasing vendor value of things like weapons.
---
It‚Äôs my opinion that since your pet will die constantly while raiding if you auto attack with it from melee range, that using the wolf to buff and auto attack occasionally is better because the pet doesn‚Äôt die, and has 100% uptime on its abilities vs. a cat that will only deal good damage consistently on 20% of bosses because they rest will destroy with debuffs, aoe, and puddles within 30 seconds of fights start
---
Get back on your Druid and be the innervate bot you were always destined to be.
---
My favourite is basically changing with my mood, but I always generally liked the idea of Stratholme.
---
My least favourite? BFT. Go fuck yourself, Twilight Hammer. Every mob can either disarm, stun or slow you. It's the definition of tank nightmare.
---
People on Shazzrah want world chat to be purely an lfg channel and nothing else, even tho theres already the official global /LookingForGroup so /world could technically be used for everything else. Trading has always been the second biggest reason to even use /world on private servers, since /trade is restricted to the main hubs only and you dont want to sit around half-afk in towns when trying to make money.

It's different glow still due too different lightning engine or w/e. It wasn't as bad on 1.12 client

In Ashenvale there is an escort quest where you save a polar bear druid. I'm slightly over leveled for this entire area as lvl 26. I enter the area where the polar bear is held captive and see these 3 dudes RUSH towards the cage to start the event.
---
Me, with EZquest addon, simply snagged the quest and auto started the event within 0.01 seconds of right clicking the bear.
---
No words where said, they now knew that I knew that they suspected I didn't know.
---
&gt; own boosting service and it will be a thing on classic
---
Do you have a source for Blizzard saying they will add boosts to Classic?
---
Off hand deals 50% less damage then main hand
---
The off-hand weapon does 50% less damage than the main hand weapon unless you have the talent.
---
So no, off-hand does not do more damage.
---
Not sure on favourite but worst in gnomeragen
---
Your offhand inherently only does 50% weapondamage. So your offhand with that talent will only do 75% weapondamage while your mainhand does 100%. You also have a chance on every ability to use to proc your mainhand.
---
From my observings in my server (i Play rogue myself) is that there are many rogues just Not as much as mages or warris i woud say that from 100% ally players it is sth like 20% mage 20% warri 15% rogues 10% warlock 10% priest 8% hunter 8% 5% pala and 4% druid
---
nobody should have need prio on a high value item in my opinion
---
Is that a guess? Or do you have any stats to provide?
---
Nice monitor, got same one
---
Thank you. This was helpful.
---
Yes, I was thinking that too but some VPNs advertise with a better connection.
---
VPNs have lots of options these days. Even if I use a dedicated/static IP they'll find out I use a VPN? No matter what, they'll find out I use a VPN?
---
I unironically love how this conversation has derailed into theories of self correcting free markets. Should we discuss the invisible hand next?
---
Horde paladins should never exist. Not even with Classic+. Sorry to bust your bubble, but the faction populations are already whack.

Depending on how fast new content is released. That would make it or break it for me and probably a few of my friends who are all new to wow aswell. We will not able to keep up with the content with our real lives conflicting. We are already finding it hard to find groups in our respected levels for dungeons. (38-50+). We left osrs because we didn‚Äôt like the direction and the updates it was bringing. Rs3 was just too barren.  We might try out eve or go back to variety gaming. 
---
We came to wow classic because it was something new and after finding out we can just be steamrolled with P2,it‚Äôs unsettling. We barely survived with our sanity at STVietnam. 
---
None of use are close to lvl 60 except a friend and me at 50,53. If P2 comes out next year then we will be fine with the progressive updates but if it comes to fast like most veterans want. It will just be a whole lot to take in when we are still understanding mechanics, game knowledge, etc.
---
Offhands are always weaker than Mainhands. The 50% just brings the damage closer together, still inferior though.
---
&gt; But when I looked more carefully it seems nothing in goblin that you "use" is bop.
---
Nothing you use is bop, but the best consumable explosives are crafted via goblin engineering, so people tend to go with them second.
---
Yup
---
Any somewhat serious player already has epic mount or spent money on bis items and should now be very close.

I have and nothing I'm finding means anything to me but thanks a bunch.
---
I have been using Splashtop Remote Desktop because I have always paid for that. I started using it to play hearthstone when it first came out on my phone until the app came out. I also use it for work now. I wonder how it compares to google rd. It is 17 dollars a year to stream off network and free on network.
---
In a group absolutely. But out in the world I'd say no, mages choice.
---
That's not how offhand weapon attacks work. By default they deal 50% LESS damage - so the talent only mitigates that.  
---
Furthermore your abilities all use the mainhand weapon, that's why a Thrash Blade (and any other on hit weapon for that matter) will procc more often in the mainhand than if it was in the offhand
---
I‚Äôm Smalls :)
---
He's a showoff.
---
*vaguely funny thing gets said in Barrens chat.*
---
Reddit will fucking love this1
---
Ok but what if we still have over population?
---
Just wait til he finds out about the blackrock.
---
And even then it still does 25% less damage than the Mainhand.
---
Whats the addon that shows the auction price? That would be really useful to have

I got my last 30 gold from fishing [Floating Wreckage](https://classic.wowhead.com/object=180662/floating-wreckage) (for [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21228/mithril-bound-trunk](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21228/mithril-bound-trunk) you get tons of different types of cloth and leathers from the trunks) and [Raw Greater Sagefish](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21153/raw-greater-sagefish). I fished the coast from Grom Gol base camp all the way down to BB for the wreckages and also Greater Sagefish in Alterac Valley, lots of pools there along the river north. I did this with a skill of +200.
---
I made my 30 gold in like 3-4 hours, AH trade time included.
---
oh well i understand now tnx :D
---
I wanted roll Warlock but being a magelet with nothing to offer to people except some small bonuses like one fee hp potion and some wipe saver doesnt cut for me.
---
The whelps are level 41-43 so probably too high to farm efficiently for a 38
---
What server are you on? I do tons of ud strat runs and don't mind taking new players every now and again.
---
Wah wah wah. Some people are playing to have fun rather than an unpaid 2nd job.
---
do Hinterlands for a very good neck.
---
I haven‚Äôt unlocked pet yet on my hunter alt. But i know that pets don‚Äôt gain xp for a level up until your that level. So when u hit 60, your pet will stay 59 until u get enough ‚Äúxp‚Äù for the pet to catch up.
---
My server is about 55:45 and, as such, the camping is more often Horde but is often enough Alliance too, making for interesting trips into BRM.
---
Is there a twitch add-on that shows how long Cheap Shot, frost trap and other abilities last? I used to have one for my rogue back in the day to time cc
---
And you just stand up?
---
wow 10/10 story telling i was on the edge of my seat half the time.
---
They will eventually find out which IP ranges are used by VPN, yes. This is basically how Netflix (for example) detects it. By literally checking the IP you are connecting to Netflix with (which is provided by the VPN) to a list of known VPN IPs. 
---
But a VPN is not illegal, and not against the Blizzard TOS, so don't worry. A good VPN provider will simply open a new end point with new IPs
---
I don't get it. What about Strawberry Canada Dry makes them a sell out?
---
So mabye better to just give up on the open world aoe and go do spell cleaves instead, at least untill solo runs of mauradon opens up.  what lvl do you need to be to get invited SM GY spell cleaves?
---
Yup exactly. You're a few gold away from the goal !
---
I really love the atmosphere of the old wow zones :) Would thay have made it as dark and sinister if they had made it today? I doubt it tbh...
---
It's very easy to detect if someone is using a VPN, but either way, it's fine. 
---
As for speeding up connection with a VPN, it's basically hit or miss. Sometimes the automatic routing is fine, sometimes using a VPN can speed things up.
---
Well these are the people who complain not finding any tanks because running certain dungeons simply not worth for them without any compensation in a PUG.
---
Also they are the common, lone dpsers who feel abused by this system.
---
They're gorgeous! What breed is that?
---
The new hunters.
---
What's the point of this reply? I'm not talking about serious players, I'm replying a post to somebody who is worried about being 37 and telling him it isn't a problem if he gets an epic mount in phase 2.
---
So its like playing Orks in warhammer 40k then?
---
According to the TOS, any third party program can be illegal and blizzard entertainment are the judge of what they do and do not allow.
---
I believe it comes down to how those programs are used.
---
I farmed raw gold on the rock elementals. They drop stones and rocks worth like 3-6s per and sometimes drop 4 at a time.
---
Please use the print screen button on your keyboard then open paint and press paste then save. You now have a screen shot of your screen rather than potatoe quality phone picture.

---
You've met with a terrible fate, haven't you?
---
You‚Äôll be grinding more dungeons at 55+ why not spend that time on BRD or Strat instead of wasting it on a item you‚Äôll eventually replace in the next few levels? It‚Äôs like saving up to buy a iPhone 9 when you‚Äôre getting the 11 next week. 
---
 The first MC raid was cleared with quest greens and blues. It‚Äôs really not necessary to get bis 40 or 50 items.
---
I play a classic meme tank. I level as arms, I tank in dungeons, I need time to get rage, I put marks, I give instructions before pull, I discuss strategies before pulls, sometimes even for certain trash packs.
---
Yes it takes long, yes we could pull moar. 
---
End result:
---
Newbies learn strategies, dungeons layouts, how to use their least used abilities, and what their talent tree is about (not copy pasting a guide) and weigh themselves each talent point pick. Occasionally get an idea of what class their reroll will be.
---
Veterans share strat and memories and lore, refresh their knowledge and get new friends.
---
Overall progression is steady, safe, and basically enjoyable, as it should...
---
It's not how it always roll though. In those times I just weigh the HS move and the loot/reward. No blue gear is worth losing my sanity.
---
Roll pve
---
So close !
---
Hey der.
---
Nice. Next I have to level my tailoring and cooking.
---
you shouldn't vendor Wicked Claws, store them and they gonna be valuable in AH soon
---
Or get light shot for faster saving.
---
I really liked the last one I tanked the most (I'm level 51): Maraudon
---
Can't fathom how someone can like tanking SM. All the mobs look the same and are just regular small humanoids. In Maraudon you get to tank so many different kinds of mobs. I especially like tanking mobs that are much bigger than myself and Maraudon has plenty of these.
---
ahhhh
---
There are no paid transfers in Classic yet.
---
Ill let you in on a secret. Blizzard forums for your specific realm. Actually decent organic guild ads there, zergers avoid this type of recruiment cos they just dont care about that lol and would rather use a autoinvite addon. Hope you find your home this way i know i did!
---
It's a screenshot of a picture taken with a phone. So techincally it is a screenshot.
---
Thanks that will save me me money/time and only reroll one engineer   and other can stay gnomish
---
Here's a different thing you can do, using the same examples as above. You're a level 38 druid, looking for new pants. You go to sixty upgrades, you make a 38 druid, you select feral talents and feral EP. You can make some changes like adding int, spirit and stam to the EP. You create the set and auto fill. Now suddenly you see in descending order the best items you can get per slot. The best is Basilisk Hide Pants, but since they are BoE and you are still saving for a mount, you opt for 2nd best, some legs from Gnomeregan called "Triprunner Dungaress"!
---
When you're a 39 druid, just press the "Level Up" button and you get shown what new upgrades are available.
---
Smolderweb - PVP, Horde, My wife and I (Feral Bear Druid and Resto Shaman respectively) are seeking a guild full of foul mouthed wretches to raze the land with. We both just hit 31 and every guild we've joined so far has like 4 people in it and dies in a week. Looking for people to do semi regular dungeons with and progress to raiding in the future.
---
Yeah deeprock salt also sells well. But sometimes the dudes drop 4 Grey's which net like 17s a kill.
---
Could be! I'm at work at the moment so I'm going from memory.
---
Literally no reason to take a rogue other than it's a warm body with a pulse, then.
---
Your comment is the first one in which I'm inclined to agree that it's a win-win, if said criterias are met.
---
Who? My fatass?
---
Yeah now the grind to 1000. This one won't be fun.
---
STV is more or less a horde territory, 
---
they have the easiest why getting there (zepelin form og and uc, also a ship from rachet)
---
and the horde has a teleporter there to gnomeregan which is nice
---
If that's true then why do people spend money for advertisements on it?
---
my dad use to tell me about how MMOs use to make you figure out where quests where and they tell you only in the log but not on your map and i always wanted to try that so for 25 lvls i did just that with classic and it was fun/frustrating trying to figure out where to go getting lost dieing and resetting. challenge is fun that's why i think its fun
---
Maraudon is cool to tank. I think for me SM is a nostalgia thing
---
It's unironically bis riding gear.
---
I‚Äôm sorry for all the questions mate! Would you say a warlock is basically an ‚Äòevil‚Äô paladin, regarding its survivability etc? And excuse me for the rudeness, but could you tell me about what keybinds you use? Along with 1-4 I‚Äôve also gotten comfortable with W, E, T, F, G
---
It's nice filtering it back on for when you reach the AH. Some of the items are dirt cheap there, because at max level or twinking they do not hold any value.
---
I'd be 40 by now, but I've been fishing to try and the gold for my mount. Started off lvl 39 with 56g now I'm sitting at 80g.  Just a little further.
---
yeah, super unoptimal warrior gameplay in this video. Needs better macros for this to work.
---
Just quest and kill everything on your way.
---
What a cute baer
---
I use Luna and the range indicator (frame fade) works just fine.
---
Amen
---
feel normal. lol
---
Myup same..... got 3 Maine coons walking everwhere xd
---
Until ST, I\`d say. Friggin green drakes.
---
Tanking isn‚Äôt the problem there, it‚Äôs the 35 minutes for an alliance group to get there and not get lost on the way.
---
If advertised beforehand people know what they are joining for, so that would be acceptable in my eyes - might be good to reiterate the point once the group is full and before the run starts, just for absolute clarity.
---
What's not OK is to just form a regular group (no reservation mentions) and change to ML just before / mid battle.
---
as a shaman you will be busy ressing your party, not looking around awkwardly.
---
Look like longhair siamese
---
&gt; The avg lvl right now is somewhere in the 40s someone pointed o
---
If you count bank alts maybe.
---
Why don't you start making good posts to improve it then?
---
I have 0 kids, do studies about 3 hours a day, social life about once a month. I'm lvl 41 with about 50g. You all fucking rushers. Bet you're not even saying "hi" in a dungeon group.
---
a big GRATZ to you! 
---
Full time job here, wife and two kids, barely reached 25 with 15g in my pocket.
---
And i thought that was impressive :D :D 
---
Gratz man and enjoy your adventures ;)
---
To be fair, it's not *that* short (though obviously I'd still rather take it than the long way).
---
I leveled solo 1-60 as disc/holy so it's perfectly viable. That being said Shadow will be faster.
---
Thank you so much for your input! You guys are amazing. What keys do you use for all abilities etc?
---
I enjoyed it and thought it would be fun to share. Move along and don‚Äôt comment if you don‚Äôt.
---
i've read your comment in Sylvanas voice.
---
Who in the world would tell a complete newbie such a thing? The races have very little impact on gameplay and that's only noticable in very competitive high end content. Don't worry about it. The most important thing in classic is to play a character you LIKE!
---
It‚Äôs pretty good since it‚Äôs the only mount speed trinket in the game. Quite nifty when you have an Epic Mount. It‚Äôs pretty useful for gathering/PvP and traveling to raids. Time is money, friend.
---
Nope, you can pretty much spam it with its low mana cost as well
---
If you are looking to avoid downtime there's no better class then hunter.
---
Have pet pull 4 mobbs, gather them up and down them. Mend pet, and when you start do drink for mana you send the pet out to get the next pack. Combine this with skinning and the right beats you make illegal ammount of golds.
---
yeaap!  Every ally sigh every time they go down there! even tho the fun starts around 30+ haha
---
Congrats.
---
I started WoW for the first time about 3 weeks ago. Did plenty of research before jumping into the world.
---
I had mount gold at 40 as well. Was a good feeling getting that right at 40.
---
seeing gearscore makes ME sick though...
---
nevertheless gz, little me not even 60 yet
---
According to the TOS, they can ban you at any point for no reason at all. Theoretically, at least. Practically, this is a condition which allows them to make mistakes in banwaves and prevents you to drag them to court for it.
---
But this isn't about any third party software, so I really don't know what you are trying to say?
---
I don't mind making a new one to level. I want a tryhard realm and a relaxed one both at times I think. :)
---
AtlasLoot will let you do this for dungeon and raid drops.
---
There's also a guild "Dreadmist" on Dreadmist.
---
it doesn't work on Roulette because the odds are skewed by the 00 house outcome. There's a net expected loss even if you had the funds to keep infinitely doubling
---
That cat on your lap had no face üò±
---
Or maybe my brightness is way too low.
---
In Classic Ragnaros world first kill was after 5 days, so you're kinda just proving the point that things are moving much, much faster this time around.
---
However I agree that OP has nothing to worry about, I too hope that P3 is at least another few months away.
---
Thats maybe the difference then because Gehennas is literally Swedish as the main (un?)official language at this point.
---
Maybe you shouldn't keep them in your basement.
---
I know, played it for several years!
---
‚ÄúCan you plz open 20 [lockboxes]??‚Äù
---
Does every class have a struggle like this?
---
If you are doing certain parts of onyxia attunement on horde ?
---
Yep same, but it's mageblade so I can't complain! Had to all in for dkp bid though
---
They'll come back for phase 2
---
Human on Westfall pve, nice try though.
---
New to WoW Classic - Played for a long time but returned for the classic feeling- what realm should I go for? Going for some alliance hunter for some questing / exploring, and a alliance rogue for pvp.
---
Does leveling via dungeons give a decent amount of XP? I've been thinking of leveling this way but I'm concerned the going will be slow.
---
\&gt;IT specialist  
---
\&gt;Doesn't have a bot farm yet  
---
Are you some kind of QA guy?
---
Well it is. But politeness is optional.
---
Dude don't be so toxic. People play at different rates, not everyone can keep up with guys like you and there's nothing wrong with that.
---
The uphill battle I meant was PvE, but PvP the strength of the class being its ability to run away says something similar.
---
Having some poor encounters with some poorly playing mages wich i‚Äôm guesing is the most popular class? All mages are now morons!
---
Exactly, everything is being cleared much faster and by the time we reach 60 it will be pretty easy to get MC group and get some gear/experience.
---
Oh yeah i can imagine that would be annoying. I can recommend Noggenfoger Horde to alliance ratio is 60/40 according to wowpop. Wich isnt great but also not bad. And in my experience i encounter alot of allies who are wililng to pvp. So yeah good realm :)
---
Take your time, friend of mine didn't and he hit 60 2-3 days before me and insta quit.
---
Now a week or so later he's still not back. Imagine all the people who would LOVE to play his 60 mage!
---
It sure is. I was looking stuff up on wowhead every 10 seconds so I thought I might as well use it.
---
Well if they do, they tank that mob they charge :p
---
Marmalade is basically restricted to citrus, and has pieces of fruit, including peel in it. Jam is made from whole or cut up fruit, and is chunky and softer than jelly, which is strained of fruit solids, and is firmer. And then there's preserves, conserves, compotes, and coulises...
---
I haven't played in a while so I might be wrong but I think /yw works as "You're welcome."
---
\*Laughs in Druid\*
---
you still get ganked by a rogue with 2 salmons
---
By looking for and inviting classes who don't need the Dal'Rend? What is so hard to understand here?
---
Because the only reason you do Jed/Rend runs is a very specific set of loot for just a few classes. So it's very obvious that these kind of players want their cake and eat it too. They could get Feral tanks, Shamans and the rest of the casters in the group but it's hard to be so picky and it's easier to just reserve stuff for yourself.
---
That is why they reserve this loot because these runs are done by healers and some dps casters followed by a myriad of rogues and warriors. An undergeared tank might join but that's about it. The rest are looking for the same loot.
---
People clearing MC right now are the top tier of nolifers/pros/speed levellers/however nicely or cruelly you want to describe them.
---
Pretty sure "the pack" on most servers is still 40s and 50s.
---
Guess it's not as much of an inside joke in this sub that I thought it was. I've been seeing a lot of people saying "Where's Rexxar?"
---
You should run deadmines and get gear with INT and STAM in every slot. 
---
Your gear really matters for aoe farming.
---
I mean to hear those 30 people faster, sure, but as I stated before it's unnecessary with how easy MC is and how long it will be until BWL is available.
---
I totally agree about split raids being more efficient in terms of gearing people, but I'm still not sure the argument can be made that it's more efficient to rush someone's t1 (other than tanks) to accomplish this goal faster. Shaman t1 is pretty decent but most other tier sets are marginal  most of the big upgrades for dps are the pieces like rings weapons trinkets that aren't class specific , and that's where split raiding can really come in handy.
---
Your point is definitely the most valid and reasonable, I would just say that it may not be necessary to accomplish the same feat
---
Most people are thirties to forties. People like this have probably played for 5-10 hours a day on average if not more for raiding. I don't have time to raid at 60 so I'll probably start another alt.
---
If that‚Äôs the case then don‚Äôt loot them completely so they can‚Äôt skin your mobs, or skin faster than them.
---
Third level 60? It must be nice to play wow whole day and not work.
---
I usually use Flamestrike followed by an instant CoC. Unless you want to save time/mana (while doing less dps) I don't see a reason not to.
---
&gt;Now that I think about it.. it's just the mages. They're so obsessed with AoE that nothing else matters.
---
I did the redridge elite quests yesterday with 3 people and eventually we got another lvl 30 mage to help us out which should have really made things a lot easier with his level...
---
He did help us out eventually... , but not before he wiped us 2 times right at the start because we were already somewhere in between, and he just blindly ran through everything towards us, pulling 20+ elite mobs along the way to greet us with, and randomly blinking in random directions right into the next packs. Both the mage and myself as heal had to drink between every single pull, but when I asked him to just use sheep and focus mobs instead of aoe'ing 2-3 mobpacks, he just responded "its easier how we do it now, sheep = no aoe" ...   ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Mining/engi will be extremely useful later on, alchemy is good if no one you know has it and will always be good, skinning/lw for gear (probably the least useful if anyone you know has it) or any gathering/enchanting is also okay.
---
If they remove layering with P2 it won't matter because we all will not be able to get in to play.
---
No way man! I have a druid pet and my own pet, i'll autoshoot and watch the cats struggle!
---
1 got sharded
---
My warrior is 51. Unfortunately I can only play for six hours a day not 8
---
Wait but how did you record this? From up top?
---
They drop gray items that vendor for quite a bit of gold. Made a decent chunk there. Go and have a try, atleast as a rogue it was easy money while watching a movie
---
Who said it had to be done unironically?
---
Correct. Pet movement commands (attack, hold, follow) and stances (aggressive, defensive, passive) are toggles and do not invoke a GCD for the pet or the pet owner.
---
People rushed to 60 by abusing mechanics and essentially cheating. These people are the vocal complainers, nobody wants wow at their own pace. This shaman will be in the best gear for a while and there is nothing wrong with that, especially when battle grounds start and you are either at the top getting gear or at the bottom getting discounts.
---
Don‚Äôt get a new one.  I just did And haven‚Äôt been able to login in a week. He will be useful in a few years though.
---
It doesn't bring in any new models or assets, it just boosts some simple effects a little bit.
---
Huh, isn‚Äôt that spot pretty close to the entrance?
---
That‚Äôs ok. You don‚Äôt have to be good. That‚Äôs the point of the post.
---
I had around 6.5 days /played to 60, so 156 hours. If you've played 12-15 hours a day since launch (35 days) you've played 420-525 hours now - for most people, that is enough time to get several 60s and/or full pre raid bis + epic mount.
---
I'm NOT saying you're doing anything wrong, the most important part is to have fun, I'm just saying that people with a focus on leveling speed got there in a fraction of the time (AFAIK the players in APES, who got Raggy/Ony WF in the launch week, had mostly 3 days and less /played to 60).
---
i don't mind being the underdogs on the server!  But the absurd amount of horde in STV is just hilarious and annoying at the same time xD
---
Under two months is technically the truth, but just over a month is even more impressive! :)
---
&gt;my tailoring is still 75.
---
\*laughs in star belt\*
---
Eh, just really rubbed me the wrong way to put me on ignore after asking why I left.
---
and you still make up the the small %.
---
Full time job, wife and two kids. I'm level 53,5 on my pally. I usually work home two days a week... Since launch I've been busting my ass off on the office days so I've been able to grind levels on the side when working home. Also been following a guide the whole way. (I could not care less about 'smelling the flowers').
---
Check out joanasworld. Scroll down to see recommended zones for your faction.
---
You skip the trash by jumping into the safe corner in the graveyard after riding through to drop the aggro, you only need to solo the 2 patrols. This is all easily doable, the real challenge is the AOE pull itself, because of how much health they have. I went in prepared with good gear, goblin mortar and gnomish net(to save pulls which had 1 mob resisting), mana pots and an occasional grenade. Some pulls required a nova + evocation(you can get 2-3 ticks of evocation), and using mage armor so you have enough mana also helps.
---
Aye, Hellfire definitely has uses once you reach level 60. It's only the solo-usage that's rather iffy to use (unless you are using it to suicide for some reason I guess).
---
ya wtf lol seriously
---
Guess it says a lot about you commenting then lol
---
It's can connect to twitter too, IIRC
---
Yet this magelet wrecks mages easy mode

---
Achievements were actually the thing that killed the game the most for me.  Before that, my goals were intrinsic, I want to explore because I want to see everything, I want this pet because it's cool, etc.  Then they added achievements, and suddenly it made my motivation extrinsic, I want to explore because it will give me a title, I want this pet because it will help me reach 100, etc.  I guess the way to deal should be to not care about those awards, but it's hard to keep your own personal motivations when the game is telling you "here's a list of things worth doing", and the thing I thought worthwhile wasn't on their approved list.
---
You're thinking from a FFXIV perspective.
---
Why use an addon? It‚Äôs an easy macro you can write up to any of your most common abilities
---
She is level 1? What a fuckin Scrub!
---
Thanks for the advice. You really think grinding SM is a good money maker? I think that's why I've fallen behind. I kept grinding that for Ravager, which I just got last night (SO excited). I know the humanoids drop silver but it seemed to me that since I started grinding SM a couple levels go my cash flow diminished.
---
what the font is that?
---
Since feral is very gear independent, you destroy everything at levels 20-40. Then you can get LotP so it tides you over until 45. At 45 you start seeing that your gear upgrades don't really increase killing speed and the last 15 levels you feel increasingly weaker when killing mobs. Especially compared to pure dps classes.
---
Your ability to have no downtime is balanced out by slow killing speed and it becomes a struggle compared to earlier levels.
---
Im currently levelling a paladin, Im at 51.
---
Paladin tanking is viable if you pick up consecration first, your AoE threat is too minimal without it.
---
Make sure to buff all your DPS with salvation and to use ret aura.
---
Mark a skull target, judge righteousness on it, consecration and seal of righteousness, auto attack for the rest of the fight and you shouldn't lose aggro.
---
Kill it now!
---
Not needed unless you have to farm for raid. 
---
I have a 14 slot to swap out with, i generally don't go above 7 when i'm solo.
---
Might take a look there, we'll see.
---
I have atlas loot but doesnt really solve my problem. Not all stuffs that needs to be linked is a dungeon drop and going through those menus takes to long compared to when using something like Telos Lootlink
---
Good luck finding a group for RFD as alliance though, might as well not exist.
---
Mining/Engineering will be good for late game pvp if that's your thing.
---
Fr, the dungeon at most should take a hour.
---
I would ask for your stuff but you already gave it away. Bye.
---
You get your wish for one boss in TBC
---
you have no idea what you're talking about. 8/8 t1 is bis until aq
---
The item is not pre determined carried by a mob. When you kill it its calculates the chances for the drop. One guy got lucky the other one would not have.
---
Lmao... unfortunately some shamans will still be like that. 
---
"Just run"
---
Hahah that‚Äôs awesome! That freakin yeti cave man, I‚Äôve never gone there and not found a ?? Horde just having open season on all the questers.
---
Imagine playing Classic with this many addons.
---
Try not giving a fuck about gear &amp; gold and just enjoy playing, it's how I get by and itll be even easier once honor hits. I know it's easier said than done but ive had much more fun doing dungeons and playing with others when I didnt care if they ninja'd a lvl 19 twink item or if I ran a dungeon and my loot didnt drop. If you make the experience about interacting with the other players rather than getting loot you'll ultimately be more satisfied since the loot will always come eventually.
---
I dont think they are so few
---
they always been kinda in the middle of popularity
---
slightly above priests but below war mage hunter
---
there is a free transfer
---
Honestly I can understand that. I guess not everyone works the same. 
---
But actually, now that you know well the game, would the achievement system (w/o rewards) still kill the game for you?
---
That‚Äôs all correct for endgame pve. But we weren‚Äôt talking about endgame pve. We were talking about levelling and for levelling speed and efficiency - spirit is arguably the best stat before you get access to decent amount of spell/shadow power.
---
Private server shenanigans?
---
everyone can see which is fake and which is not if you just walk up to them slowly while mousing over them, show in tooltip popup.
---
Bro its 2 months in, wait it out a little, maybe take a few weeks off and more people will catch up.
---
Grtz bud, say goodbye to 8 bag slots cuz that ain't leaving your side till t3
---
Meh, if you consistently need 30 minutes to have one drop, they'll just end up being priced for whatever 30 minutes of the best gold farm is.
---
Thorns, Flame Shield, Ret Aura damage counts as damage/threat coming from the person being hit, not the person who applied the buff.
---
Yes, you get the holy damage threat boost.
---
Go die
---
Suicide to avoid repair costs! First thing the warlocks in my good in vanilla did after something went sideways in the raid was life tap to hellfire :)
---
You forgot about Caps Lock
---
Beast mode
---
On [X]
---
Off [   ]
---
Not sure what you mean by "work", but Martingale is a method most commonly used in roulette. 
---
&gt;There's a net expected loss even if you had the funds to keep infinitely doubling
---
I know, that's literally what I said :p "But just like regular gambling, the casino always has the positive EV."
---
I pretty sure it would have the same negative impact.  I'm not sure what the difference my pre-existing knowledge would make to that.  It still replaces "do what's fun" with "fill out this checklist", whether or not there's any tangible reward beyond finishing the checklist.
---
‚ÄúRemeber to take everything in moderation - Even World of Warcraft‚Äù. He did certenly not read the tips in the loading screen.. Lol
---
And btw, i dont know why he thought it was only for healers.. As a healer, i used the dagger, and not this staff up till BRD content. Was i not supposed to need on that? Rofl
---
If mages don't give me 2 stack of water xhen i give them a healthstone,they just deserve to be /spit
---
Did you? Oh, that's too bad. Hope it gets better.
---
Well his reply is pretty accurate to what he read. It's pretty clear he stopped after the first 4 words lol.
---
Alternative: sell and split the proceeds.  No one ends up with nothing, and both of you get a hefty $ windfall
---
ClassicAuraDurations shows the time remaining on buffs and debuffs, give that one a go
---
Yeah Same, I am on a med to high pop server too and no one on my server has even done MC yet. we have like maybe 30 horde 60s.
---
Why do you make useless comments?
---
Undead priest, hit level 30 in 1000 needles, where do I go next?
---
Tired of 30+ minute queues.  I didn't want to guess when I'd be ready to play and queue watch or afk hop until I could.  I had been dealing with that for a week or so and that was too much.
---
Same here with my british short hair and sphynx. Both fuss goblins
---
I expect phase 1,2,4 to be 3-4 months
---
3-5-6 will likely be longer
---
Yes! I can confirm. I've been in raids with people use healcomm-based addons (Luna, grid2, Vuhdo) and it works great.
---
Here's the official changelog from the the Vuhdo classic repos:
---
[https://gitlab.vuhdo.io/vuhdo/vuhdo/blob/classic/changelog.txt](https://gitlab.vuhdo.io/vuhdo/vuhdo/blob/classic/changelog.txt)
---
Note Version 3.107-classic:
---
\-- Fixed incoming heal display   
---
\--   Note: Only works with others players using LibHealComm   
---
As of this moment, download: [v3.107-classic-beta-6](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vuhdo/files/2792046)
---
from: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vuhdo/files](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/vuhdo/files)
---
since the "recent/official files" on curse/twitch are still tagged with 3.102. I guess the developers doesn't feel confident in releasing an "official" 3.107 yet. But the beta version works great for me. No problems what so ever.
---

---
May he never be forgotten!
---
Definitely hunter loot
---
My guild has actually been growing due to people quitting bfa, and some people coming back who haven't played for years.
---
 We still have a steady trickle of people returning and creating their first characters on classic even now. Had 4 friends i hadnt seen since tbc join today.
---
I started spamming BRD as a mage at level 54. Did this til 58 and by then i had a bunch of BiS (all available Mage gear from BRD) and then went to Winterspring and the Plaguelands for the last two levels. Was refreshing and honestly i felt really strong for the last two levels of questing.
---
One thing i didn‚Äôt do but would recommend is sorting out the Onyxia questling when you‚Äôve reached the high 50‚Äôs as you‚Äôll get a bunch of XP and will need to go into BRD for it a few times
---
Start with multiboxing and run your own dungeons, join a casual guild with no Level 60 yet, and enjoy the game.
---
&gt;or is this a thing i could make a ticket for? I
---
No, it's considered world pvp.  there are items that will cause you damage that will break sheep, you should look into those.  As there is no dispel trinket at the moment, you need to be creative.
---
Don't need to have good rolls when your loot council decides to gear you up and give you every Shaman drop because you're a healer.
---
I don't know if kreuzi is joking or not but classic is 15 years old it will run on most toasters you definitely do not need a 1050, most integrated graphics cards that just come with a cpu will run the game at medium high settings, if you have the money and intend on playing more than just classic wow then go for a graphics card
---
60 40 split in favour of horde on my server and I've been having an awesome time in STV. PvP game on point on Noggenfogger.
---
Illusionary rod (15 int, 7 stam, 10 spirit) or hypnotic blade and orb of the forgotten seer? (combined 8 int, 3 spirit, 21 spellpower/heal)
---
I have a level 35 priest, 21 disc, 5 in spirit tap, about to start on holy tree. Leveling with 2 warriors and doing a fair few dungeons. Finding conflicting opinions elsewhere.
---
I had a level 34 shaman ask me for water when we were on a zeppelin together. I gave him one bottle of level 35 water. He laughed at it and was a good sport so I gave him a stack of water he actually could drink. Was a fun interaction.
---
Don¬¥t worry, WOW is like RL. Good and Bad days happen. Next you will get a random epic and a dungeon run, so smooth, that you get 1.5 more levels than expected in that session.
---
Cheers
---
Best Tank EU
---
i dont care what you say and i hope i never met your ass in the game.
---
Yes, I put a shortcut to the WoW.exe on my desktop, and just use that.
---
I'd argue, that while it might not be polite, what can anyone do, other than badmouth someone in chat if anyone steals anything from you, regardless of faction. If you grouped up your kills, so you could skin when you were done killing say 5 tigers in stv, and someone just runs up and skins em, it might not be nice, but you are just shit out of luck...
---
They do this to confuse their predators
---
How so? Is it not a DPS trinket? Did the healer not drop an ultimatum?
---
What are you talking about? Warlocks are always being weird!
---
Incendius is pretty even on faction balance. Slight lead to the horde IIRC but one of the more balanced servers.
---
I played for 10 hours a day for almost three weeks to hit 60 and thats leveling as a hunter, if you‚Äôre on your third 60 you should probably reevaluate the amount of time u spend on this game
---
Yeesh. I'm at 45 and I have 12.5 days played, and I spend a ton of time afk as I play periodically throughout the day at work(I'm in IT) I couldn't imagine actually playing the game for more time than this as I play quite a bit when at home as well.
---
ok
---
Majority of those guilds that cleared in the first 2-3 weeks were premade private server guilds. Wowhead was talking about it like 80% plus were premade from the years on the private servers.
---
Seconded!
---
My current favorite is RFD, just love the look of the skeletons and the bone pile, also the long spiraling fight up the last boss.  Just like the look &amp; feel
---
Dont understand the high level req, you can easily do razorfen downs as level 36, 37. Last boss is 41 iirc.
---
Play on a pve server
---
He needs to use searing pain
---
Like a warlock could actually tank this a lot easier but drain life and shadow bolt are not going to cut it
---
Yah I‚Äôm hoping to have a classic master priest inform me it‚Äôs intending to slash XP rates cause of not I‚Äôll be testing it tonight lol
---
is that really worth losing a shitload of +healing?
---
And if you are buying a card make sure you have a PSU to support it I.e 500watts+ with a 6/8pin to support it, I made that mistake when I was a teen and blew my new graphics card trying to plug it in to an underpowered PSU with a molex splitter
---
Ahhh, thanks.
---
Next time, aggro a mob to break sheep, or blood rage and intercept a critter to escape. Sheep should have diminishing returns, so there will come a point where he isn't sheeping you in order to reset the cc timer, or you'll be breaking sheep quickly and able to intercept/aggro something.
---
GET YER FEET ON DA GROUND ! (says the flight master once you took of)... 
---
Wait...
---
Awesome to hear thank you!!
---
I love Maine Coons but come to find out it's like the one cat breed I'm allergic to.
---
There are 2, 3 interesting quest lines in every zone, the problem is that these quest zones are way overcrowded. Tried to do some quests in arathi last night but left after 10 minutes. No chance in doing a quest in under half an hour
---
Yeah enjoying the game is bad, peak efficiency or gtfo. (Please this is a joke comment, I do not believe there is a right or wrong way to play)
---
It‚Äôs clearly a female from what we can see on the clip
---
This. Granted, I have a pretty high /played to hit 60 (9 days) but it's still somewhat of an average and I did pretty much every zone and dungeon in the last month. I sure wouldn't say I'm a casual considering out of the last 32 days I've been online 10 days. That's like an 8h average per day which is more than a full time job. They should wait atleast until end of November with P2.
---
I copied it from a thread I tried to post, it was supposed to be a ‚Äòwhat should I pick?‚Äô
---
i would say second option. You lose on some int and spirit, but you can downgrade your heals in instances anyway
---
What in the name of Christ is going on in OPs profile history? I can‚Äôt tell if I‚Äôm aroused or not.
---
Stuff like this has always happened and not only that but those are considered the good players? What does a good tank do in BRD on the final boss? Every time the boss enrages jump down the stairs and do exactly this
---
I mean, her original model.was 14 years ago. Art directions change and also characters change over 14 years.
---
Ret Aura's damage (and so it's threat - which is super minimal btw) counts to who receives the damage. No sure about righteous fury, I'd say a quiet yes, but don't quote me on that.
---
For a second I didn't read the title and thought it was just the usual Horde gank squad
---
Hello, EU servers here. Last night I had a ideea about a guild that specialize in trading/crafting/gathering. For players who are interested in a more pve/rp approach of this game. Feel free to private message me anytime. It's just an ideea in my head, nothing on the paper.
---
I dont know, if you are not speed lvling what you claim is not possible. You have to be playing at least 3-4 hours daily 7 days a week to have a main 39 and a 21 toon. Personally I dedicate almost half that time and I will skip a day every now and then. Maybe casual play has a different interpretation for every player.
---
Oh man, definitely had a moment last night in IF, surprise wave of nostalgia crashed on me hard. City was absolutely buzzing, some bridge e-peen flexing, some lowbie gawkers, some side alley hustlers slanging enchants and greens, etc.  
---
Not sure what % of my playtime across all of WoW has been spent in IF, but it‚Äôs a big chunk.
---
*Gay bald server with drooling money giver going straight for the loots they will surely give away for  being named on a stream*
---
Interesting perspective. We haven't had people taking days off and are clearing MC right now.
---
name your pets you philistines
---
Bitching and moaning is easier.
---
I mean you can mage cleave and hit 60 in a week semi-hard core, you don't have to abuse mechanics.
---
Thats fixed with the last hotfix
---
Mage farming is like 25% better than any other class farming. Go farm elites in EPL with mind control. The fact that a mage could have 125g when you have 100g for the same time input is not a mage "swimming in gold".
---
I do have cooking/fishing. I learned that sagefish delight sells for about 1 gold per stack on Grobbulus so I've made at least 10 gold using that method.
---
This is in depth and thorough. I really appreciate the advice. Thank you!
---
You double your gold on the ah?
---
I spend ALOT of time fishing. If someone rolls up and joins in then that's fine, it's a SHARED loot pool for a reason.
---
Tanking Zf and St SUCKS so much.  Fucking hate stun and polymorph
---
when im bored i go to duskwood or redridge and troll lowbies (polymorph and rank 1 spells)
---
Let me put it this way:
---
\- You can play whatever you like and keep the game interesting and progress at 0.05% slower rate than the ULTIMATE META TOP PICK FOR X CLASS
---
or
---
\- You can play the boring meta and get sick of the game in a few weeks and progress with 100% slower rate than anyone, as you would have stopped playing.
---
This is what I explain to my "elitist" guildmates. So /spit on the haters and do what you like. For the Horde!
---
Why would he? I hate getting ganked and camped and I love world pvp
---
I used to love going around to get all the different pets to get all the skills. I'm so glad it's back. It gets you all over the world and can give a real sense of accomplishment.
---
Fuck yeaaahhhh
---
To quote an experience I wrote about previously:
---
&gt;Yesterday I was doing a run with a warrior almost infamous for his HoJ runs. Fully 60, great pre-raid gear, but no HoJ and he'd been running it for a week or something. Kicker, he'd never even seen it drop for 50 runs. 0.9650 = 12.9% chance to not see it drop once during that time so it's perfectly plausible.
---
&gt;We got the drop and a rogue doing BRD for the first time was with us. We all offered to pay him to let the warrior (who I'd never met before) get his HoJ but he refused our money and passed the roll anyway.
---
I know gold grubbers who try to screw you over exist, but myself and my entire guild have only met 1-2 over the course of 30-40 pug dungeon runs between us.
---
&gt;Main thing driving me away from this game, is friends, guilds, randoms
---
No offense? Get new friends and a new guild.
---
&gt;Joined the strongest guild on my server and from then on it was easy groups/dungeons but on every chance they got they would take for there own good not for the guild.
---
You don't join the strongest guild if you want to find good people. Good people are much easier to find in the semi-hardcore scene.
---
~
---
Your problem seems to stem largely from a shitty guild. I've had better experiences pugging than you've had with your guild... that's saying a lot.
---
A small loan of 30% dmg reduction
---
The trick to playing warlock is using your abilities
---
In a pug group boe epics generally get need rolled because of value. You cant force someone to equip.
---
As a warrior, is it worth it to downgrade from a mace with higher damage to a slightly weaker axe because of axe specialization in arms spec? Specifically asking about Princess Theradras sceptre Vs gatorbite axe. Is the extra crit worth it?
---
Just tell him what area you're leveling in bro
---
Haha horde are the same lol
---
Don't. Only asses kill low lvl, atleast gank ppl your own lvl.
---
If I‚Äôm running back to a hub, I‚Äôll throw a fort on everyone I see until I‚Äôm out of mana.  I hit a warlock the other day, and obviously didn‚Äôt expect anything back.  Then I got hit with a buff...underwater breathing.  I‚Äôm undead.  I had a good, solid chuckle at it.
---
You're correct, but that's only for leveling and the MCP is still powerful stats without the charges for leveling. Once you get to 60, if you are feral dps it is bis. No other class has access to their bis weapon at such a low level.
---
This question is asked 1 in every 5 posts in these Daily Question threads. Scroll down.
---
It is a big deal when you combine it with mithril spurs which puts your mounted movement speed at 109%. There is a very noticeable difference ingame between a standard epic mount and a 109% speed mount.
---
Lots of Wrath babies think that
---
:)
---
I'd love to see those stats.
---
Good gear has brain troll &gt; Good gear no brain orc.
---
Slowly!
---
minion names are like half the reason to even play a warlock tho
---
Stonetalon mountain and Thousand Needles are the best you've got. Horde has far better lowbie ganking potential in Redridge and Duskwood tbh.
---
Been looking for something like this for awhile, havnt been able to find anything that works. WA magicians plz help :)
---
Alcaz island in dustwallow marsh.
---
This is what's going on during the loading screen when the multiboxer is arriving LMAO
---
http://wowpop.appspot.com/realms/ashbringer
---
This website when it was possible to run searches showed a percentage of 0.02% of players as level 60. That wasn't long ago
---
It‚Äôs barely been a month. Chill lmao
---
Just layer hop *shrug*
---
Weird. Another cunty aoe mage.
---
This had definitely not been my classic experience, played out again and again.
---
By the articulation levels the OP presents I do assume he lacks the skill to fight others on equal level.
---
Your guild would have to be over-the-top tryhard to care. If the DPS players in your raid are all outputting \~70% of their theoretical max, you can steamroll the first several tiers of raid content.
---
300 to 305 weapon skill is pretty strong. Going higher does very little.  
---
Edgemaster's are expensive, but worth it. The stat loss (crit/str/whatever) is relatively small.
---
Remember that orcs only gain weapon skill for Axes, it's not a universal skillboost - so with an orc you can end up with an awkward choice between sticking with an axe, or taking a non-axe upgrade.
---
Also, troll Berserking definitely has it's moments. If you're running fury and pair it up with Death Wish, that's some serious damage.
---
No Unfast the stay at home dad is our best healert
---
I didn‚Äôt need to rush, because I cleared it 15 years ago.
---
&gt;Undead bones show through the gear (which I don't mind as much but still would prefer to be able to turn it off).
---
There is a way to turn that off, it requires switching to chinese graphics, I don't remember exactly how it was done though
---
What's the ninja loot?
---
I have one for Ice Barrier i've made but i have no idea how i'd make it work for PW:S. There's no way for the game to read shield data, so you have to create a string that reads absorbed amounts out of your combat log and tie it in to the estimated shield value from the tooltip + coefficients + talents.
---
I tried that but i was mind controlled with the engineering helm into one of the cracks in epl with the oozes but there were no mobs present there. But its a good tip thanks :)
---
I would greed roll
---
No because the server I'm on is 70% Horde and they kill every low level they can find.
---
Looks kinda pathetic tbh. It's so small.
---
https://i.imgur.com/ISTm4MX.jpg
---
Literally just an ingame screenshot machine with the selfie twist.
---
SM grind for 11 levels then go to STV.
---
/clap
---
Extreme luck not just good luck. Obviously set feeding helped here but I'm willing to bet a majority everyone reading this will not have that situation.
---
Wrath babies? Nice try, hunters didnt start shining until late tbc, you saying hunters are great in vanilla shows the ignorance and lack of experience.
---
The most crucial abilities are even bugged lmao
---
you can continue tanking in arms until at least the latter half of brd, but even emperor is doable in arms. lbrs onwards though you'll want to be in prot, but make sure you've done all the open world quest chains before you spec prot because soloing stuff in prot is so tedious.
---
Huge shame they often made the capitals redundant in expansions.
---
Go to SM entrance, friend :)
---
Yeah I was thinking about Stonetalon mountains
---
Well, ofc there are going to be kids who gank lowbies, but I don't do it, so I speak for myself
---
"Fixed", it's still shit.
---
Meanwhile, the warlock pattern is a BoE epic so every group I talk to has a "all need" rule, I'm lucky to see it drop at all and when it does it goes to a warrior so it can sit on the AH for 600G that I'll never have :(
---
Yeeesh. I feel like I was luckiest, 5 kills for the tuyere and one for the glass.
---
Thanks
---
1.12 classes make rag much easier, vanilla first clear would have been sooner if they had the same updated skills and talents
---
There‚Äôs a person named Conjurewater in my guild and they gave me 120 water. They said they always keep 300 in their inventory!
---
I've been alliance for the last 11 years but I don't support this. Respect your opponent and grow up.
---
That's pretty neat. Thanks for sharing.
---
I hit 60 this morning and much respect goes out to you being already 40 with that many responsibilities. And just 2g shy of the mount. Very well done. Enjoy the last 20 levels.
---
You are using this in classic?  
---
Maybe I can just try to change the spell from Ice Barrier to PW:S.  
---
C
---
Is that the exchange rate between healthstone and water stacks?
---
Seriously though, does Blizzard ban multiboxers? Why is this even allowed?
---
dont start a witch hunt on reddit.
---
It's the complete opposite. If all your party are Mages/Warlocks/Druids/Shamans/Priests there is nobody who needs Dal'Rends so there is no need to reserve.
---
People who reserve know they aren't getting a perfect group so they're waiting for people dumb enough to run it who need the loot (hence master looter) or get people who don't need it to carry them.
---
Yeah back then we didn't had PC only NES SNES, Genesis and some other consoles at the Arcades.
---
The ! commands you to do it, even if you already are. Without it, it will toggle auto attacks on and off. With it, it only turns it on.
---
Not sure how it works for OP, but typically a ! is used in a priority list. If the ! ability is on cooldown it goes to the next one without using it.
---
tanks are tanking, mages deal dmg, healers are healing. thats their responsibility. water and food are optional since they could buy it from a vendor for money, mages arent the only source in the game. i have to create it, it takes time, just say "pls" and "thx" thats all. basic human interaction.
---
dont have time to type a simple "thx"? cmon
---
That's not true. Some of them are not trapped, but are still fake. And it doesn't matter much, because usally at least one person rushes to the chest before I can tell them that they are fake.
---
I always pay 50s for 3 stack of water.
---
I always start with: Hey pretty mage, you got some water for me for a small fee? and thank him/her afterwards.
---
If you're tanking dungeons, I'd recommend carrying around a board'n'sword. Much easier for everyone in the group than two-hand tanking.
---
You really tempted me to use that worthless EU code I have laying around as a EU player
---
If only WoW worked like Monster Hunter.
---
All this gnome mocking needs to end.
---
Bought it for 2po on my warrior at the beginning of the second week. Kept it till the necklace of the hinterlands elite quest. 10/10 would buy again.
---
Yeah, don't you usually have those out if you're in a dangerous area?
---
Rogue are the easiest to kill. Rend for them not to go stealth, then disarm so they cant do anything. Then he will use Evasion as they always do and with the 50% crit chance Overpower you just win
---
Thought the exact same thing on my way to scarlet monastery üòÖ
---
Assuming you have tactical mastery, charge, zerker, battle rage, blood rage, spam sunders until 5 sunders/mob at 40%/overpower procs. If overpower procs and you have 25 or less rage, hop to battle stance for the overpower, then back to zerker. If you have over 25 rage, dump some with whirlwind and/or heroic strike before swapping over for the overpower.
---
This. I spend about 20h per week playing wow classic.
---
Any normally functioning person would call that an addiction or at least a very serious hobby.
---
In wow terms I'm a casual player.
---
4 out of 4 times paired with odd punctuation habits? I think y are giving him too much credit.

Sell it for 4g
---
Make a thread on this sub asking for even the smallest of QoL changes and watch the rabid cults of 2006 come out of the woodwork.
---
Push:/
---
Apparentely lmfao
---
Can still be better than what the player was wearing, even without the +heal calculated in.
---
It‚Äôs not ninja looting because you lost the need roll. Don‚Äôt be a sore loser and don‚Äôt use Reddit to start witch hunts.
---
But I already bought a pitchfork, what now
---
This is why you gotta be aware of what you say online

Suggestion: Disenchant this item

I don't think you do.

Last rank Rain of Fire does 904 over 8 seconds, that's 113 dps.

Last rank hellfire does 213 damage a second.

Why do people spread false information when it takes 10 seconds to google the correct ones?
---
did you learn every possible thing from the tailoring trainer?
---
i've done that in vanilla
---
Lack of experience? after 15 years SUUURE
---
Hunters were great until they started stripping out abilities and pruning them
---
And yes hunters were great in tbc something we can agree on
---

Look at base healing wave. Now multiple it by .8. Then multiple that by .8. Add the final 2 numbers together.

Is that number bigger than 256? If yes, then yes it's better.

I had a really strong experience in the barrens, I was bored of the area and the quests were all over the place so I went to Ashenvale and quested at Zoram Strand, but after 1 quest the cold, dark atmosphere and Nelf aesthetic made me miss the hit sun over the barrens, I went back and enjoyed the zone a lot until I left it for good.

Then on my reroll alliance char, Redridge mountains is such a beautiful, idyllic zone, gives me oblivion vibes

It doesn't matter much. Past level 40 you will get +1-2 gold from quests. I get money for mount at level 43, and after buying it had 12 silver coins in wallet. 5 hours later I was already with 30 gold.

Asked a priest while taking the boat from Ratchet to BB just how many times he fucked someone over with MC at the boat.

He estimated the ammount to about 200-250 MC's and proceeded to MC the gnome hiding in the backroom. And dropping him off just as we got to the very edge.

The only profession that directly affects your character is engineering, it creates lots of equipment and other gadgets that require engineering to use and is incredibly useful in pvp, with some pve uses as well. With small exceptions like Tailoring for epic priest/mage/warlock chest pieces and Alchemy for druid tanking trinket, everything else other professions make can be used by anybody. So it's all about what you like and what is more profitable at the moment - i.e. many people think a warrior should be a blacksmith because it makes sense, etc.
---
For leveling it's great to have one or even two gathering professions. Skinning is always nice as it adds minimal overhead to leveling, while herbalism/alchemy tend to distract you more. It's never too late to switch to crafting professions once you feel you aren't getting much from gathering anymore.
---
* Crafting professions (Tailoring/LW/BS) are currently hard to profit from except for devilsaur set which is in high demand by all the hunters/rogues/warriors.
---
* Alchemy won't be in high demand until BWL since current raids don't require consumables and there are no battlegrounds.
---
* Enchanting is always a great money maker but you need to grind out the rare formulas, many of which only drop in raids.

You don't have to hit the same content. Each level range has a few different zones appropriate for questing. Just hit up a zone you haven't done before, and you'll have a whole new experience.
---
Alts are good to avoid burnout, and rested xp can help you get over a hump. Honestly, you're in the worst level range, 30-40 sucks unless you like STV and grinding. If you break through to 40, you get a lot more options and some iconic class abilities for most classes.
---
Stay feral to quest and grind; keep healing gear in your bag, and spam LFG for dungeons. Maybe try tanking, as you haven't mentioned that at all.

Well kill them back then. Become the bigger fish

Armor value and increased level on high level targets leads dps not to scale as you‚Äôd imagine it would - passable dps as a fresh 60 starts at like 250 though.  Warrior was probably dpsing as prot, which yeah, 80 dps sounds about right.

I really don¬¥t think wow is relaxing at all.
---
Like when I play some random mmo I usually fall asleep during lvling because all you do is spam buttons and have flashy effects and nothing matters and it¬¥s just boring.
---
Wow feels so different. Everything is so slow, but then you misstep and suddenly you pulled 3 mobs more than you wanted and are dead. You constantly have to be aware of what you are doing, something that you usually don¬¥t have to do in any other mmo. So I¬¥m usually pretty tense while playing wow and even need time to cool down after playing or else I can¬¥t fall asleep.

Even if he was, and even if it wasn't a boe..... (He wasnt and it isnt) Go look at blizzards definition of ninja looting.  Youve failed to provide proof that loot rules were stated or discussed prior to this event in in-game chat. And from your cropped screen, no one can tell its a mage or what happened other than two people rolling for a drop.

Try again.

You are not getting full exp from green quests. So it's recommended to do them when whey are yellow.  
---
Also level doesn't matter, skilled players in party will kill you even if you 5-6 levels higher.  
---
Starting questing in STV is around 32-33, second part is 35-36 and last bunch of quests is 40-41.
---
It's like an old woman clutching her pearls because girls today wear skirts.

atleast one of the dungeons I actually like (if we are not doing the stupid escord quest that noone is able to do right)

Definitely! At 88g now and just hit 39, with maybe 7g worth of stuff on auction house :D
---
I highly recommend Incendious. Its one of the most balanced high pop pvp servers.

When you redefine failure to be doing something slower than you possibly could, rather than the binary outcome of it happening or not happening, that changes the dynamic considerably.
---
Heya, No I did not record any videos of my runs but I can give you a brief summary because it's pretty basic. Zone in and start clearing directly in front of you with the 2 elites. Then clear the 4 patrols (3 triple dogs, and 1 single elite with 2 dogs) as they come near. Clear left side of the main room as you work your way toward arena tunnel, which is directly across from the entrance to the instance. There is one more group of 4 before the arena gate and that's it. Rinse and repeat. Should take about 12-15 min once you get used to it. You can reset 5 times in an hour.
---
Im actually getting force reactive disk, cuz that thing is just pure beastmode with holy shield.

Hey now it's macrohub.io :)
---
I gave it to the druid, he's my brother. He has more uses for it, whether to sell or not. He helped me get money for my Flurry Axe so he gets this one.
---
There's a lot of circumstances where AoE speeds up questing. I think it's a safe bet. Later on if you're super efficiency oriented, you can run spellcleave groups in SM and ZF.
---
Worst dungeons are Uldaman and BFD.
---
Ouch, that is the stuff of nightmares.

Probably because they thought it was right?  If you want to argue the Google case about 70% of this sub cld have been answered with the same, including ops question.

It's cool to hate gnomes, but they make the coolest things.

Back in MoP while waiting for people to show up to raid we did another version of this.
---
Whoever did the /roll set the bet with whatever they wanted as the initial amount. I.e. if I wanted to bet 250, I do "/roll 250"
---
Then roll down, one on one, until a 1 is rolled. Whoever gets 1 loses and pays the initial bet amount to the winner.
---
Brd was better than bfa war campaign. 100-0.
---
Follow up question....why do you need to know when you'll auto attack next?
---
You'll need to check a mage BIS list for specific quest rewards, but now you'll want to get started on your keys and attunements. Pretty sure the Onyxia chain has something on almost every class list.
---
He was waiting for the streamer to tag the mob so he could steal chest.  That's why its karma.
---
Well i think you hated it when jaguars have been hugely nerfed for their grays drop rate in Classic. Now you have better gold / h with mobs in Dustwallow Marsh
---
All the min maxers went warrior or mage cos thats what everyone said was "best"
---
Rogues were definitely the most popular the first time around, this time they are way down the list
---
searing gorge and ungoro are the two best zones in the game for quest exp.
---
Man, people are a trip lol
---
For the most part it's just gnomish death ray/battle chicken vs being able to craft sapper charges. The latter is pretty much mandatory for large scale PVP so it's nice to be able to craft them for yourself. If you want, you can go gnomish, make those two trinkets and reroll goblin. It's not *that* much of a loss, should be doable in under 100g "wasted".
---
As I said- I haven't been grinding at all.  I have run dungeons max of twice for Q's or drops bar brd which I did 4 times- 2 were not comp runs tho and I didn't touch wpl at all for Q's.  Grinding isn't needed imo
---
I played on pve exclusively back when i used to play from 06'-10'. I tried a pvp server this time round being really nervous i had made the wrong decision but i love it. The world feels so much more dangerous and alive and it really feels like two factions at war. Will be great once BG's kick in too to further that feeling, but the day to day questing and killing between factions is just fantastic. Makes levelling in contested areas really nervewracking!
---
Amusingly, pretty sure the crowd pummeler is BiS for feral dps in raids. As long as you farm enough of them
---
One of the two most easily griefed fights in Classic, possibly period. He shoots AOE shadowbolts and heals for some stupidly high amount per target he kills. So if you want to stop somebod from killing him, just strip your gear off and run at him. Boom dead a lot of healing for Kazzak, 2 or three of those and the main raid starts to run out of juice and die.
---
In classic as an enh sham am I to prioritize ap and str over agi since agility doesnt give attack power?
---
There are lucrative ways for every class to make money.  If you want to sell rings from Mara clears that is certainly one way to do it, but that‚Äôll phase out very quickly as more and more people get their rings. 
---
I‚Äôm only a lvl 50 hunter and I‚Äôve already made 500 gold from alchemy and playing the auction house. 
---
I‚Äôm loving hunter so far, it‚Äôs competitive and complex in a way that must other classes aren‚Äôt. We have very neat interactions with feign death, and the skill difference between a great hunter and subpar one is very noticeable. 
---
Timing your auto attacks and using abilities correctly in between them is crucial to having success with the class. Utilizing your pet correctly also makes a world of a difference. Having the right abilities for your pet, ranking them up, and putting the effort in shows.
---
Look how many people are just idling.
---
So factions at war don't fight, they just go around pettily stealing each others skins?
---
Sounds really fun actually
---
Who doesn't
---
That doesnt make sense. There clearly is an audience for "Classic TBC", so now that we have established that Classic servers are possible, it would be dumb to not do them. Whether or not you personally have interest in them doesnt matter.   
---
Classic+ however is a clusterfuck of expectations. Everyone wants something completely different - not even talking about the guys that dont want Classic+ at all.
---
I think it's almost only been when I'm a couple of levels *above* what you would usually be for the instance.. You know, so that you would be more efficient than a mage at their level, while getting shit XP and basically only helping them out.
---
Because being handed out free stuff by bunch of followers is really note worthy
---
I see lovely stars.. some of which are the dust on my screen.
---
When‚Äôs the apology video coming out? Lmao
---
The key ingredient you're missing is that humans get an intrinsic reward from interaction with other humans, so while the difficulty may be artificial (Although all difficulty is kind of artificial in an MMO), the solution to deal with it requires human interaction, something which is it's own reward.
---
Personally I don't really care about the loot as a progression curve, I just want some good weapons so I can participate in PvP with my friends, and interact in a different way with actual humans on the opposite faction.
---
I see a lot of people are saying Hillsbrad but unless you are lvl 50+ your vacation will probably be pretty short because revenge squads (for both Alliance and Horde) build up really fast there.
---
Instructions unclear, dick stuck in a crater.
---
On a normal server there is.
---
The funny thing is hunters counter rogues. Good hunters are great in pvp but require a lot of player side skill. Your dps may never beat a rogues but you'll always have a raid niche.
---
Play what you enjoy, classic wow is rock paper scissors, rogues are horrible in a lot of situations too.
---
Looks like XLoot Classic
---
I love how quickly the community changed from the friendly "Buff every one", "help every one", "we hare the wholesome classic community" to "pay me or gtfo".
---
I'm not mad about it, I just think it's funny.
---
lol u mad as fuq
---
It just reduces your threat on the targeted mob
---
hes the demon world boss (giant doom guard) in the blasted lands, south of swamp of sorrows.
---
Never fight mobs at or above your level. That is super inefficient with all classes. Also Shamans are more in the middle of questing speed, so that is to be expected.
---
Does it shoot you back? If so then you can use it to kite and shoot yourself back to the tank, so he can taunt it off you.
---
Sincerely was.
---
As long as you collect a set of int/spi cloth+leather you can heal everything just fine as whatever spec you desire up until mid 50's. I'm a bit like you only I'm a Shaman, so I leveled as Enh while healing until 52 when I respecced Resto. Actually find healing almost more enjoyable than the solo DPSing/leveling - but I loaded up my playlist with awesome music or audiobooks during dungeons and (especially) for questing and grinding. Also tried to focus more on lore and getting into that aspect when questing, and sometimes just took a level when I went out into some empty spot to grind beasts for grays, greens and skinning. Pretty chill, that!
---
 What surprised me was that after respeccing Resto, kill speed and damage are still OK (not as good, obviously) and healing feels a lot less shaky with some cooldowns at hand. So just stick with it, don't be fooled into making alt after alt. The grass is always greener on the other side.
---
Kinda getting burned out with my rogue right now at lvl 39. I rolled a rogue because I think it would be awesome in lategame, but now I'm missing my warrior. 
---
Will it get better from 40-60? The rogue 31 talent I can only use every 5 Minutes, which is a bit underwhelming honestly (not from an effect point of view, but it just feels less cool dann speccing to Mortalstrike or whatever and using it all the time).
---
Getting out of dangerous zones and repositioning and Ofc kiting.
---
You can't mark enemy players. If you try it via keybinds/macros, it will display an error saying enemy players can't be marked.
---
Imagine having sex with an air elemental, the room would end up looking like a Jackson Pollock painting.
---
You probably can 
---
You‚Äôll just die a lot but there‚Äôs no red sickness below a certain level 
---
You still get xp even if you‚Äôve discovered sth on a different character if that‚Äôs what you meant
---
My only thought is maybe after becoming friendly through MC, the system logged them as new party member and did some weird xp splitting algorithm that then got fucky? Idk, sounds weird man
---
That still wouldn't make him an asshole at all. You're in a leveling dungeon, you have to expect the healer to roll on gear to aid in leveling. Otherwise there would be a lot less healers. Once you get into your 50's and are dealing with pre-raid BiS items, that's when you start to tell the healer they can't roll on a dps item.
---
Im playing lock too. It's my first time ever playing lock. No , I dont know how raiding spec works. Im also leveling right now and have no reason to care.
---
Yep. The data is a few weeks old, but it's the best we currently have. You should of course draw your own conclusions based on the data we have available.
---
i used this on my rogue till i got the one from emp in BRD....
---
It's used to mitigate threat. When you're in groups or raids and pulling mobs off of the tank, you can use the ability to give them back to the tank.
---
As some one who totally has there mount I know exactly what your talking about it. Boy does it stink.
---
50 druid here, yet to find an upgrade for this awesome neck.
---
Lol its not bullshit at all - while levelling you could be waiting for 15-20 levels before you can get the previous tiers rank so we buy the better stuff and need to provide the lower level stuff for free (when the player could/should be buying their current level water, ergo waiting twice as long per drink). 
---
We are stuck until DM North with level 45 water so the most efficient is the AD rep water which even then I usually buy a lot and will give this to our group healer to keep us going.
---
The nuance here being you are trying to justify not spending on being self sufficient and by doing so you are doing the opposite imo.
---
    /cancelform
---
    /cast [noform:3] Travel Form  
---
IIRC form:3 is Travel Form, so it will cancel any form and then try to cast Travel Form if you are not in the Travel form.
---
I think you may need a life outside of wow
---
I imagine you would hit at least level 2 from discovery xp alone. But I don't see why not
---
Go Horde, no good players go Alliance. You will be all alone if you have any semblance of skill
---
*hears the laugh* "He's speaking the language of the Gods."
---
I haven't noticed, but seeing as you can heal as any spec while leveling it makes some sense.
---
Didn‚Äôt you just say that you‚Äôve played 10hrs a day for 3 weeks straight? Maybe you should reevaluate your time spent on this?
---
It doesn‚Äôt change your position 
---
It‚Äôs a melee Range ability that reduces your threat on the target
---
&gt; Your comment was ambigious, and easily misunderstood.
---
It certainly was neither of those.
---
Highly unlikely unless you got real lucky.  Mobs way higher level than you have insane aggro radiuses.
---
Ok so you read ‚Äúwarrior that goes full ape‚Äù but you somehow consider dual wielding an impossibility?
---
My point stands. A warrior can reach TPS thresholds far above a druid‚Äôs at the expense or defenses.
---
So hyper is actually a legitimate use of the word here. I like it.
---
i dont get it
---
&gt;Your Healing Wave will now jump to additional nearby targets. **Each jump reduces the effectiveness of the heal by 80%**, and the spell will jump to up to two additional targets.
---
Am I missing something? It‚Äôs reduced *by* 80%, right? Not *to* 80%.
---
Mirage Raceway -&gt; Desolace -&gt; STV (northern part)
---
You already are a great melter group healer with chain heal. Earthfury makes you a great tank healer.
---
Im guessing the aggro range would make it extremely difficult? lke halfway through the map haha
---
Nice with out the phasing  cheet too  !! Gz
---
Every monster I kite does this windfury proc thing, it's so weird
---
Your dps is limited by your threat in groups so with this you can get rid of Aggro so your tank can save you easier 
---
Rather niche use I guess since it‚Äôs only melee
---
I am a level 39 paladin. As paladin you need to go ret early on to level or it feels way too slow. The leveling was still kinda slow solo but I was fine with the pace. I kept intellect gear and healed in dungeons whenever I played them (didn't play them a lot). I reset my talents back at level 37 to go tank and currently I am able to tank dungeons at my level but just barely hold aggro, but it's good for AOE clearing SM Cath. I am enjoying paladin due to the fact you can heal and tank. Everyone seems to be saying paladins can't tank raids but i'm not there yet to tell you myself.
---
To sum it up paladin can't DPS and tank without spending gold to reset your talents. They can do either one and heal though. Warriors are better/easier tanks from what I gather (everyone says it, didn't play one yet).
---
With not that much practice you can develop the skill to reflexively hit the stance buttons before you use a skill in another stance.  This cleans up your keybindings considerably and is more flexible than hard coding macros for each ability.
---
"...Vocal emotes"" clearly I must practice my close reading skills, thanks!
---
Honestly, playing classic only to want them to release the shit that destroyed the game in the first place is what doesn't make sense to me.
---
But you so you, bud.
---
Go farm brd. Or play lbrs for all the juicy quest rewards.
---
In worst case, go farm humanoids for gold and exp.
---
I got to searing gorge last night and was surprised to find the area full of alliance since my server is around 60/40 horde. Luckily only a couple people tried to gank me and it's easy to win fights as lock but wouldn't have surprised me if it had turned into a gank fest. I think horde ganks more than alliance though, so it didn't surprise me they weren't that aggressive.

Only healing wave, and you‚Äôre already a fantastic melee group healing with your chain heal. Which you are gimping (along with lesser healing wave) by wearing this set and losing a ton of +healing.

Wrong.

It is only when the quest turns grey that the completion XP amount decreases.

I don't know every class but in general, almost everyone starts opening their good builds at 40+ (Mortal Strike, Shadow form, rogues branching for energy/CP regen, etc.). 
---
Casters also start getting their spell power around ZF, melee spike in +AP, possibly crit items. 
---
As feral, your biggest DPS talents are the 6% crit, 150% of level as AP and FF, all of which you get latest at lvl 30. Sure, HotW is nice but only starts really paying off with really big stat items. And after LotP, you branch out for mostly utility stuff like Furor or Natural Shapeshifter (because, as you said, you heal after almost every mob - this is also where keeping up with First Aid pays off for ferals).
---
Keep in mind that biggest feral DPS comes from excessive shifting with Wolfshead and that's not really viable while levelling.
---
My 5 cents, it's druids as class.
---
I don't understand how kill speed is low? I obliterate mobs and I never stop for drinking / eating
---
I remember a test a random guy made by starting on level 1 and discovering all places in both kingdoms. Ended being approximately lvl 20 if I remember well
---
‚ÄúI am totally just posting this to get a reaction and you fell for it lol‚Äù
---
Sure, keep telling yourself that.
---
Woven Ivy Necklace from Hinterlands elite quests
---
The whole map? More like lvl 8-10 I guess
---
Nice even with out the phasing cheet gratz
---
The fact that you couldn't interpret that sentence both ways speaks for itself.
---
Incoming heals aren't in the classic API which is why you need lib healcomm which other healers also need so that their incoming heals can be seen by you and vice versa
---
Check the latest version to see if it includes this library
---
q.q phaggot lewl
---
Nice repost, this was done the first day of classic.
---
I dont think thats true at all...reaching level 19 purely from discovery xp? Lmao
---
Yea, i worked overtime on launch week and got two weeks off after that, spent all of that time plus another week to to 60 and since then ive only logged in for MC twice, this guy is on his third 60, selfexplainatory.
---
Horde don't have low level zones, we create characters at level 40.
---
Use Shift/ctrl + Scroll wheel down/up/middle mouse click.
---
 night elf ~~hunter~~ **mohawk** master race! 
---
The one change they should have made, mohawks for male Nelfs.
---
healers and casters only care about jed.
---
And hunters will probboly come for truestrike alone. 
---
Not sure what tanks will be after thou.
---
I really enjoy Scholomance. Some range mobs are pain, but bosses are cool, not so much thresh and usually fast pace is a thing.
---
See this is why I want classes to feel like one cohesive class again. Specs should only have a few unique spells, let's bring some of that crossover back. But have the specs *excel* at different things. Let me use Chain Lightning as enh again. Let me use Death and Decay as Frost again. Let me be an actual jack of *all* trades Druid again. It would probably help make stats relevant again and not just something we sigh about and use a website to figure out which item is an actual dps increase. While you're at it, bring Holy Power back across every Paladin spec, cuz I loved that as Holy. 
---
One of the major highlights of classic has been stance dancing while playing warrior, especially as tank. There are abilities from all three specs I want to consistently use and it's been glorious. I'm a *Warrior*, not just Fury or Arms. Same with Mages, I love the fantasy of basically having frost in one hand and fire in the other. Warlocks having a million tricks up their sleeve that reward skilled players.
---
Southshore, ashenvale, thousand needles.
---
All great contested zones with high populations of horde...
---
Or make a friend and have him go into the Barrens with a low level Alt and sit outside wc, when horde attack him you one shot them...
---
I did this with my rogue while running my friend through wc, it was great  I would stay as a stealthed body guard and one shot anyone who decided to gank him.
---
I use Inventorian.
---
Looking for someone to level Double mage with dont care about server although i do have gold on Kromcrush alaready but not to worried about it would like to rush 20 then AoE grind spots as double mage! split all profits each time and level quickly!! PM me here for Btag if anyone is intrested
---
&gt; for every quest 40+, go out and do them and reap a few hundred gold for it.
---
honestly just doing EPL and WPL at 60 is a cpl hundred gold. if you saved winterspring thats even more 
---
i hit 60 just over a week ago. i had under 200 gold, 
---
i have 1200+ now
---
Incorrect, some coding uses the command "print" in order to display text, or in the case of screenshots, images.
---
Yup thats the one, the worst part is if you miss by a hair you fall all the way down and have to run all the way back up again.
---
I have played every expansion so far. Encounters like in classic doesnt happen. There are no camped zones, droprates are way higher for everything, means you dont spent more than a few minutes at a spot, and every class has some form of CC or escape so you can easily get away. Open PVP in retails feels generic. You wont come in touch with people above your level (atleast not in the 1-100 zones), and if you do they pretty much one shot you. If you have a few mid 40s or 50s you can take down someone at level 60 in classic. 
---
If you cant or dont want to level at a specific location in retail you just swap location since basically every zone is scaled, means you can level at any zone you want.
---
1) You're on your 3rd 60 so what the fuck is wrong with YOU 
---
2) Yeah, most of the Mages I've met are idiots. They're the new hunters apparently
---
nope just the GCD
---
Yes my apologies, meant to say multiple by .2.
---
My point still stands, with each healing wave doing about 2k, this bonus will give you ~500 extra healing every time you cast it. Double the healing that your gear gives.
---
See in my eyes doing dungeons is grinding already :D I know you can do dungeon quests - but the majority of dungeon EXP still Comes from the Mobs. 
---
But yeah I guess that is just what you Count in and what not... 
---
Lets rephrase it: It is not possible to reach 60 just from quests alone.
---
Dont give a fuck about some blue post. In the communitys eyes its ninja looting.
---
Posting about it here wont change shit though.
---
I came across an undead priest soloing King Bangalash, as a Human Rogue, and tried to help him. 
---
Then again I also Garroted a warlock 12 levels under me and ran away just for fun. Pretty sure he lived, he was at full health when I started.
---
Its complicated.
---
Don't know if you're trolling in a weird kind of way or if I'm too dum to understand what you're saying, but a hyperlapse involves camera movement between each individual shot taken, which is not the case here.
---
I'd find a whelp spot, skinning, experience, and maybe you'll get a whelp drop?
---
There was a post earlier about it, guy made about 60ish gold total? Wowhead it brother.
---
Not to be a Debbie downer but if you hate horde so much why not just kill all horde instead of just low levels? The term "if it's red it's dead" should be your motto if you hate the horde.
---
Funny, I just picked up a quest in Moonglade that directs you down to Silithus.
---
Youre welcome to try and slay our lowbies. But when a epic geared lvl 60 comea your way and camps you until you log off. Are you ready to log off with a smile? Or will you make a new post here, colplaining about high lvl characters ruining your ganking experience..
---
I‚Äôve never been to hinterlands yet- this is my first time playing wow- what am I looking to hunt there?
---
Yeah, that I understand the sentence given the context. The fact you couldn't interpret the sentence properly speaks for itself.
---
It‚Äôs a smaller problem than you think.
---
Have you checked your server population? If not, it's possible that you're playing on servers with a low Alliance population. 
---
That would explain why you're getting ganked more as Alliance, and not getting ganked as Horde(although I find it very hard to believe that you never get ganked when you play on the Horde.)
---
As someone currently playing on the Horde, it's definitely not just us doing the ganking. There are always high level Ally hanging out and ganking/camping in level 20-30 Horde questing areas. Some areas i've just given up on for now because I get ganked every few minutes.

Haha, what a noobhead...
---
Unless your min/maxing, all are viable really. I always thought Ancient Bone Bow was underrated.
---
I really miss having both Dark Pact and Master Summoner talents towards the end of my leveling. You can summon a voidwalker in 6 seconds and drain his mana for a net gain right before every pull, sacrificing him for your Hellfire. If you really want to mitigate damage, you can create a Spellstone to absorb more damage. It takes 30 seconds before you can use it though, you may only be able to use it every other pull in really efficient groups.  It also strips all of your buffs. You will also need to 2 soul shards each pull to keep this up!
---
&gt; Boosts your speed by around 5% overall despite saying 3% iirc
---
The mount movement speed increases are multiplicative with one another. If you use carrot on a stick with an epic mount you get 206% movement (i.e. +106%).
---
Im not looking forward to it either
---
Both are going to have gnomish that is the fact.  The question was if there was any point to reroll both to goblin or one could stay gnomish.
---
&gt;Idk how many streamers I‚Äôve watched
---
Too many. Don't watch people play games.
---
i found out abouth that shortcut a week ago and it blew my mind. someone showed it to me at my last quest there. all the running i couldve saved...
---
Or everyone can roll greed properly and punish the looters publicly so nobody will play with them.
---
I get what you are saying but this just reinforces everyone to do it wrong.
---
And while 4 days played is the world record
---
Too much of a blanket statement. If a company makes money by offering unlicensed services in another company's product, that can be illegal. But not criminal, so it would lead to a civil suit. 
---
Similarly, breaking the Terms of Service \_can\_ be illegal, and be sued as a breach of contract.

Yea I think aq was a about 12-18 months after launch. But the comment I was replying to was saying the game wasn't even out 15 years ago. Launch was Nov 23rd 2004.
---
Lol... You will have to deal with it I guess. If People wanted faction war they could turn on /pvp as well. No Need to roll pvp Server. Also BG's exist on a PVE Server. 
---
People on PVE just don't like being ganked outside when they opt-in to pvp.
---
I think it is very OK to do what he is doing. I mean it is not like he wrote his Name on the fishpool.

My bank alt is level 5 :(
---
My level is 60, my average character level isn't, but that's a stupid metric to use in this context.
---
They were talking about the level the average *PLAYER* has achieved, not the level of the average *CHARACTER*, talking about the average character is irrelevant in this context as the number will be filled with lowlevel and/or abandoned alts.

Your friend is doing it right. I wish I could be one with rock as well.

Spellcleave is spammed constantly, and while begging for water my replies are almost always met with silence or asking for 1g. Sometimes I'm lucky and they think my name is funny, they make sure to tell me that's why I'm getting water. I think they see that as a compliment but it kinda points out a sore spot for me.
---
I'm in the second wave of servers, the ones that still have 1hr queues on weekends.
---
What happens if I log out mid flight? Does it keep flying?
---
Rly? Oh boy. This is dump
---
I'm not sure they drop anything special, was more thinking about appropriate level skinning mobs. Tanaris turtles/scorpions are also possible.
---
On Ten Storms i've seen and also witness a few, so no, it's not only a NA thing.
---
Sadly the spell cleave cancer reached Gandling EU but at least it's not as rampant.
---
Min-maxing? Nobody really gives a shit there. I even found a guild that will take me raiding as arms warrior :).
---
Short answer: Yes
---
Jokes aside, that 8 piece is really beneficial to the raid.  It turns our healing wave into a chain heal, and that shaman is now permanently a tank healer, who happens to spillover heal the melee.  It's kind of a good idea to build out the set on 1 shaman first.  We have people ahead of me, and in the meantime I'm saving dkp and trying to get the +heal non set items.
---
Just popping in to say that at lvl 46 (or is it 47) warlocks get their next rank of Rain of Fire which puts the dmg on par with Hellfire until it's next rank... tldr there is a weird phase after lvl 46 where rain of fire is actually much better until hellfires next rankup
---
Yes and yes.
---
Shadow form is a buff you can toggle on and off. You can't cast heals while in shadow form, but that's easily fixed by not turning on shadow form. You can heal any and all dungeons as any spec.
---
Beautiful!
---
Also for paladin. Bought this necklace on lvl 30 for 3g and wore it till lvl 60.
---
I guess I got lucky. I killed those whelps for my last 3.5 bars to hit 45 last night and got the whelpling a few kills from leveling.
---
I would seriously love to know if the game was coded to not "rumble" when they were behind you.
---
Blizzard making so much bank that they can't process payments fast enough

What‚Äôs the point of people posting this stuff? Are people looking for pats on the back or attention? Like cool dude? And are you using some lame lowbie epic dagger with shit stats just to look cooler? Because that looks awfully like a shadowblade.
---
ah ok thanks^^
---
lolwat?
---
thx^^
---
This is wholesome and also rip to that printer's ink.
---
I would've done the exact same. Charge in when I think someone is being ganked, but stop attacking as tge enemy is not putting up a fight.
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/classic-wow-stats-and-attributes-overview#attack-power

many guilds finish a t1 set on one person first. very common on shaman / hunter as their tier sets are amazing
---
150g on mine. This seems like a ridiculous steal.
---
I‚Äôm up to 50g at level 42, still working it out. However, I only had 15g when I hit 40.  I‚Äôm not great with money, okay? Anyway, I‚Äôve just been killing shit in badlands and vendoring everything. Some stacks of the gray junk off of those mobs will sell for 60s+ per stack, and I‚Äôm getting about 25-30k xp/hr as a rogue.
---
Thank you so much!
---
No, when you lof back in, you will resume flight.
---
Well you cant be in the dungeon dead. Respawn on entrance. You can sit outside until friend clear wveeything except lord cobrahn for instance then you go in for that one kill. Might be able to manipulate the 60s outside group mechanic by tagging it and having him do 99% damage but i havent tried.

I too noticed this behavior in Darkshore. Furbolg and the white Moonkin's both do it (its early and I haven't had my caffeine so forgive the inability to name the mob). Just one of the many reasons I hate Darkshore. Mobs are linked that have no business being linked.

Not much. As only few classes can make use out of more than 2-3 stats, they'll usually only go for 3-5g.

Let me introduce you to my friend Block.

*Riley leaves the guild*
---
If he was CONFIRMED to be like that then sure, I'd be a little pissed, but what can you do? That's just how life is.
---
Most likely a phone app imo.
---
Was playing with a friend a while ago and said I gotta go sleep now and went offline.
---
Like an hour later when I was already lying in bed he was like "why you still online, I thought you wanted to sleep?".
---
Turns out the bnet app on my phone still showed me as online. I didn¬¥t even use the app in months but it still managed to show me online, so I¬¥d assume that some app automatically logs you in when you hit the work wifi for example.
---
Remote from work and AH
---
Clearly a hunter weapon
---
I've bin trying to tell my friend leveling 1-60 in the open world is a perfect opportunity to learn you class. Learn every different role it can fill, learn how to pvp against specific classes etc etc.
---
If you leveled 10 mages to 60 on a private server already i get you might want to speed things up. But playing the class for the first time, take the longer route.
---
Ok, keep us posted, because we care.
---
Ima take this as a joke, and pretend to laugh for you ü§°üò∏.
---
Functionally what is the difference except no one can get ninjad. Why would we purposefully do it the risky way.
---
terrible excuse. just play dps if you are going to roll dps gear as tank/healer. tank healers already get fully geared faster than dps.
---
why ban?
---
Agree completely, worse thing they did was make so many base spells spec specific
---
BUILD THE NET! BUILD THE NET!
---
Which was my exact point all along :)
---
We simply do not have access to any relevant data to draw conclusions from.
---
You need to have a mount in the first place, which is not likely in the near future, at least for Caprice (my toon)
---
Not sure when they operate, but there's a Horde RP guild on Zandalar that patrols STV and sends out squads to deal with alliance as needed.
---
Beginning to think this is what butthurt players post on reddit after being denied a portal to darnassus
---
I agree anyone can sound like anything, especially if we're talking about a different entity entirely. That said, the lines that the void walker characters use in-game is definitely one a human would consider to be male.
---
As a Druid you can solo the MCP Boss (stealth to boss, boss in bearform, kiting when you need to heal/reg mana). I did it at Lvl 36. With good equip you can probably do it sooner.
---
Because twitchkids do the cool dungeoncleave thing, hence why half the population is mages and warriors with a bunch of warlocks too.
---
Plus they steal devilsaur leather
---
C is my go to guy
---
Yes. You can stop a flight early by clicking the "request a stop" button as well. It looks like a down arrow (leave vehicle arrow from retail) and is above your hotbar by default.
---
When someone actively writes "lets all greed okey" you know that fucker is up to something.
---
If you want everyone to roll for it, everyone press need. Simple as that.
---
Simple minds come up with simple ideas.
---
Thanks buddy I feel like I‚Äôm coming off of meth or something not getting home and playing wow haha jk.
---
It's an incredible power spike and unless you plan to do dungeons almost exclusively, it is the way to go. Your single target damage is very powerful and you look and feel powerful as well. I didn't spec heal for quite a while even after I hit 60.
---
Aw, I am only 31, still trying to get as much out of Duskwood as possible.
---
Deep disc now. Been farming mara as Holy too.
---
Tactic is to run run run. Then tank Princess "windfury" a couple of times per fight so i dont get one shot. Tinkerer will require better camera mobility and overall smoother movement.
---
Did you not even read the set bonus or something?  No shaman should be using lesser healing wave anyway unless there's a serious emergency healing need.  You're gimping our entire kit, and substantially lowering your healing potential with it.
---
Just another reason why I've been loving classic more than retail.
---
how does one become this big of an asshole? is it genetic or learned behavior?
---
Gimme a fucking break oh my lord
---
stop needing offspecs... if you want that gear just come as that role. nobody's fault you decided to roll tank/healer.
---
if you want shit reserved join a guild that will let you.
---
Listen, I'm of the opinion that mages are the new huntards, but not all mages are like this. I can definitely agree that the quality of players have dropped off as I've been getting more and more behind the initial wave. People constantly praise my tanking even though I feel like I'm only doing an OK job.
---
Plenty of 60s want to do maraudon princess runs though
---
No I want a regular calendar. Like showing days of the week. And with a big picture of onyxias stupid face on different days saying "I reset today_ whether it be a Thursday or a Sunday. Whatever. Id like to physically see the days of the week it resets on. Instead of every day logging in . Going to the raid tab and doing the math.
---
Lowest level quest is I think the panther chain for big game hunter, so what some people do is go there in early 30s, get some big game quests done (and perhaps northwestern troll area), then do other areas until 40+.

Correct. It'll just look like your normal sinister strike icon if you hover over it to see the spell details.

now this is how you multibox
---
Honestly even though you don‚Äôt particularly like dungeons I‚Äôd suffer through and do some ZF. It‚Äôs what I did to get several of those in between levels. Also Mara (Princess) has an incredible ring you‚Äôre going to want to get as a rogue.

If you ever want to get better gear later on you‚Äôll have to dungeon anyway.
---
I read somewhere that blizzard was thinking about not giving out the black aq drone. Is there any source for that?
---
I enjoy Druid much more in Classic than Retail. Granted the class balance is terrible, the Classic playstyle is truly how druid should have been, you shift in and out of various form all the time. In retail, most of the time you can stay in one form forever because there is almost no advantage in switching.
---
As a Healer it‚Äôs doable in most cases but it does put an extra strain on us.
---
Thanks man!
---
Thanks, mate!
---
Well when you put it that way...
---
Lol

The 5 int/9 stam wand? Mages have a wand from their quest that adds frost damage and don't need to hit with their wand as much.
---
Blink, one of the main reasons I have several mages on retail.
---
yeah, the 'reserver'  needs to sell his case.  I have seen many good ones in the past so I am ok with the idea.  
---
But if some random schmuck runs a single run and thinks he can reserve premium items without doing any work, just because he started the group I agree , screw him..   I usually join reserve runs from people I have seen advertising the same group for days, because I will know they are serious about it.  (and probably good at it)
---
priest pattern is the same way anyone can get it and sell on the AH sounds like you have been in shitty groups.
---
Most people? No.
---
I see a lot more people in 50s and 40s and 60s are no longer a rarity, but looking at my guild and looking closely to city toons I would say most people are in their 30s early 40s.
---
I mean if you look at the amount of played days needed to get to 60 and the average amount a player plays, i would say it will take 3 months at least for most people to hit 60 or be 55+.
---
Why would I need a portal to Darnasus?
---
I specifically went out of my way to mention good mages are good things. Specifically it's the DPS meter whores that are the problem.
---
I've never. Actually ran aq40 and never went in.
---
as a warlock you lifetap to even out health and mana and then eat and drink to be done faster.
---
Not that it matters. You can roll on dps items while healing or tanking before the max level. There's no "main spec."
---
Shoot for late 30s early 40s imo, you will still get decent xp from green mobs and quests and people will be less inclined to mess with you.
---
Not really, generally implies something bad happened to the other person. Rogue got a chest he otherwise wouldn't, nothing else.
---
Downranking your spells is really Important.
---
Use Heal Rank 4 and Greater Heal Rank 3.
---
If whole grp gets a lot dmg, cast inner focus + prayer or healing. If needed cast another on after.
---
There are alot more things, you should look for guides. Cant write everything with my phone üòÅ
---
Woth a sheild you can get revenge procs what are cheaper then sunder to allow faster threat gain on groups.
---
For me its like sunder, tab, revenge, tab sunder and repeat.   Ypu dont have to have sunder on everything to hold it.
---
God damn Horde.

Seen it everywhere since day 1 on Mograine. You'll see it more on day 1/2 servers where private realm folk settled such as Firemaw, Gehennas, Mograine 'n' the likes.

Almost 20 years of mmo gaming and I've never considered binding modifiers to the scrollwheel.
---
I think there's something wrong with my brain. Thanks anyway.

Yeah I noticed that with ESO it seems like it would be challenging but after a while it‚Äôs just not infact it‚Äôs pretty dull to play
---
99% of people will see the UAC prompt and just accept it to get to their game quicker because as per their experience the UAC always comes up for everything so they probably will think it's amongst the other false positives.
---
It is about common sense because you still need some if you are to use it correctly. 
---
Personally these super rare one off chance things possibly happening aren't worth the lifetime of clicking accept thru millions of false positive prompts that come up. Are you sure this word document from your friend should be opened? Are you sure this modding program should be opened? Are you sure are you sure are you sure? It's enough to drive a person mad.
---
Definitely not a thing on RP servers, thank God.
---
This is when you make an alt and go level it.  If you can't log out because you're constantly in combat, just exit the game and open a new one.  Don't waste time getting ganked/camped - make them waste their time by waiting for you.  Meanwhile you're knee-deep in dead harvest reapers on your alt.
---
I'm excited to be here for all of it. Most of all I'm looking forward to Zul'Gurub.

If you aren't planning to raid much you could shift some things around  to enhance your PvP abilities further.

Oh, you mean SFK not SM

It doesn't work. mc resets Tuesday. Onyxia resets Wednesday this week whereas this calendar is saying it resets October 6th.
---
Dude i know that feeling, it really sucks but i  guess can't control people with different backgrounds and education, however the editing made me laugh, and the karma was really nice, good for you :))
---
You didn't need to, but it still is a massive achievement to do it so fast.
---
It's hilarious. I've done this a lot with my guildies
---
"phew! Good job I managed to vanish out of that sticky spot, lads."
---
"STFU"
---
intresting, so when the bar is "white" you should micro (/kite)?
---
The addon mentions smth about hunters skills which should be cast between the shots, so I assume its also ment when the bar is "white" ? what about wand users? I dont think I can cast anything in between wand attacks
---
You got tiny pp :/
---
If players come back they will have to sit in queue or choose a different realm. The ultimate realm size will be fixed and approximately that of one layer now. The reason why there are queues still is because layering is being phased out already, possibly proportionately to player drop-off.
---
Not sure where you're getting that from.  2 of the 8 are boe.  And shamans are not the lowest played by a long shot.  It's pretty beneficial to have 6-8 in your raid, since totems are group only.  And their most useful spec is resto, which this set benefits, unless you're in a guild with meme speccing totem twisters.
---
Because you're looking at one part rather than also including the 5 set bonus of reducing mana costs. That makes it so downranking isn't needed as much, this basically turns into your chain heal (Just more single target with the tradeoff of a weaker heal on the third person.) , and LHW isn't as gimped because of the 5 set.
---
Yeah for some reason this really ticks off the classic community, sorry about the downvotes. You're totally right though; you're better off rolling /need and figuring it out from there. If someone actually needs, let them have it, if someone tries to ninja, then they can't. It's a win-win if you are playing with more people who are cool than ninjas, which should be 90% of the time unless you're in asmon's guild.
---
If there's 5 people in a group and 1 is a ninja, a BoE drops and 1 person actually needs:
---
* If everyone else greeds: 50% chance that the person who would actually use the loot gets it
---
* If everyone else rolls need and is willing to trade afterwards: 80% chance that the person who would use it gets it
---
* If no one actually needs and everyone greeds: 100% chance that the ninja gets it
---
* If there are no ninjas in the group at all and everyone needs: 100% chance the person who deserves the item gets it
---
Like, am I crazy? It seems really obvious to me that all need prevents ninjas and lets people still get the loot they actually need.
---
That's a relief.  I felt like I was doing well with gold.  then I had a bunch of training I wanted, and I bought a bunch of mats from the AH to level up some skills.
---
I tend to prefer the one from Strat UD as there are many ways to hit that 9% without Blackcrow. Not a fan of the bow but that is personal!
---
is that Adam Smith?   my college days are around the time of original vanilla, so I am a bit rusty
---
Sure but for a priest it has nothing at 60
---
Why you checking peoples pps?
---
Shouldn't be an issue.  I fully expect there to be casual pug MCs going on full time before too long.  We even have them on my server already.  Now getting on a consistent raiding team, with dkp and all that, might be a little challenging.  But I think you'd be able to do it jumping in the raiding guilds and running with alts or whatever.  It's honestly a decent way to do it too, because you know you'll be with people that know what they're doing.
---
I feel like it's literally the only thing that works on 5+ mobs. How else can you generate threat effectively on 5+ mobs as 1h?
---
I'd advise doing  stv (finish your last quests there), feralas, tanaris, searing gorge, felwood, western plaguelands. Pretty much in this order, but you can vary it if you wish. 
---
It's quite nice to do yellow/green quests. The mobs seem to die very fast if they're 2-3 levels under you. The xp penalty is not that huge, 20-30%.
---
So if you wanted to mob grind with a hunter 10-60 what path would you take?
---
of course the alliance are rehearsing their synchronized horse riding.
---
Same. Im currently lvl 34 priest and its been really fun so far. Running holy spec even and its been a blast
---
seems very simple indeed, much appreciated, thank you &lt;3
---
Might try it. My brother play priest, but maybe just the two of us can get all the way inside, even with backdoor.
---
When the server is big enough, he just flys under the radar.  Even when you call him out in world chat.
---
I forgot about this macro, bless.
---
Well that's pretty damn evil, I didn't think of that!
---
I am planning to create a hunter alt character to help with my main character, which is a mage, get better. The profession of my mage is tailoring and engineering. Which professions should I choose for my alt? I was thinking of a combination of mining and enchanting, or herbalism and alchemy. Let me know your thoughts.
---
I am ONLY talking about high value BoE items, like rares and epics that sell for a lot of gold in the AH. For BoP items you obviously won't do that.
---
Actually, weapon attack is normalized in patch 1.8. It's a common misconception that slow weapons of the same class are better than others. In other words the speed of your bow doesn't matter for your skills.
---
From the wiki:
---
All weapons will contribute attack power as if they were 2.8 speed. Weapons slower than 2.8 speed will do slightly less damage than previously; weapons faster than 2.8 speed will do slightly more damage.
---
Kiting however is easier with slower weapons, but for the damage it does not matter.
---
Only thing that's annoying is we didn't get pre-1.8 Silithus. :(
---
I agree it‚Äôs doable for the majority of the content, probably all leveling content. 
---
Just don‚Äôt get in bad habits if you plan on raiding.
---
*BFD :)
---
Why would you? Personal loot was created exactly because the WoW community has always been dogshit when it comes to loot.
---
Really? I've never heard of such a build, care to link one? Sound interesting.
---
I mean, it would be nice to be able to do this. But, punishing them after they do it, it's not like it will get spread to everyone on the server and they cant find a guild or groups ro run dungeons. So if it's a large enough drop they dont care getting booted from your group then they already won.
---
Your stat priority for damage is
---
1. Hit chance (make sure you can hit the enemy as much as possible)
---
2. Raw critical chance (the ones that says increase chance to crit)
---
3. Agility (because it gives you more crit chance)
---
4. Strength (because it lets you hit harder)
---
Make sure to get that talent that give you attack speed on a crit.
---
Never DP your imp! Succubus does just as much damage and doesn't rely on mana.
---
Oh wow dr. Phil came to the post lol jk. 
---
Nah not really mad at all, was actually having a lot of fun before I trashed my character. I think at most it‚Äôs a little frustrating but boring for sure when it domes down to it. 
---
I just got bored for the most part fella no need to make accusations to strangers on the internet. Have a good one buddy, take it easy.
---
It got taken down so you're correct
---
Just to be clear here, Blizzard broke the API that allows people to parse census data.  So I don't know how these are being calculated, but it's literally not possible for them to be accurate.
---
FD + trap macro has been working for me too since the hotfix.
---
This is heresiy !

stop dying

Just say "okay, you first" and watch them squirm.

Not a real grinder. F
---
‚ÄúConsistently‚Äù lose to mage is a big miss. Stay out of nova range and the match up is pretty easy. Save your scatter and stun for when the blink and don‚Äôt be afraid to use free action potions. 
---
Mages melt to your burst and get so shit about casting against your pet. 
---
Soullink locks on the other hand.... godspeed enjoy your death.
---
what addon do you use for the vendor/ah sale price?
---
Can confirm, 57 almost 58 and still using it because nothing better has dropped. Only other item under consideration between SM Lib and Pre-Raid would be Inventor's Focal Sword from Tinkerer in Maraudon.
---
I've debated running shadow now that I'm 40. The big d heals in dungeons is a life saver. Some else commented if you are dungeon running to level to leave holy and I would agree. If your questing solo and plan to until 60 then go shadow. That being said as a holy priest I have still melted horde who try to tank.
---
Gem. Absolute gem.
---
What's unfair about Multi-boxing?
---
Not really, you have zero downtime (as ret), can solo hard quests, don't die if you mess up, can heal group quests (or dungeons) with +int set. Later on you can spec into protholy with bos, holy shield and consec and AoE farm almost like mage
---
And also Meth
---
Apologies, in my early morning delirium I may have spoken too soon, I don't think I had the chest piece when I was using Wraith Scythe, so I'll test it a bit later and get back to you. I posted then didn't have a chance to edit til now and you responded by then lol
---
alliance can get ony attuned before 59?!?!? horde you have to be 59 to even pick up the quest to kill Drak.
---
i honestly don't pay super close attention to the colors of it, but you should be kiting after you shoot, at least as a hunter.  Wand shots come out quite a bit faster than arrow shooting so you may only be taking a few steps if any.  It does work for wands as well but i don't see that being as helpful again due to wands shooting so fast.
---
You don't need to excel at the game to level a character to 60 mate.
---
I got a lot of feels when I saw that bone pile again this time around. Lots of memories in RFD back in the way.
---
You guys are beautiful
---
This is me !  No matter how much i wait aoe always pulls many ..but hey it tops the dps charts and kills aoe packs fast just not as effective as with mage. 
---
Thankfully there is always priest to shield me and stop some of interuptions
---
Yeah, not really the public shaming part, but it was never the norm, nor should be, to ‚Äòeveryone need high value BoE items.‚Äô The protocol is to hit the need button only when it‚Äôs an upgrade for your character. Greed/pass all else.

Reasoning behind my perception is that i'm lvling an alt as well.

29 Agility = 29 Attack Power, 1% Crit Chance, 2% Dodge

---
The level 1 is probably her level 1 alt.
---
You can respec using gold. You can farm gold or gear 2 characters.
---
Reducing healing by 80% per jump does not sound like a way better chain heal to me. It sounds like a front-loaded tank heal that also happens to heal the two closest melee for a bit.
---
I'm horde and I don't support this - even among my own. Dishonorable and unhealthy.
---
No, you can respec, but you cant have 2 specs you swap freely between.
---
Just respec right before each raid, costs gold
---
Has no one said fuck you yet?
---
Fuck you
---
Trying to avoid dismounting is a bit of a fun minigame.
---
Rumor is this is how you summon the boss that drops the Ashbringer

It never came out

Grab your guildie warlock doing Staysafe's farm and wait for the ring to drop.
---
Keep the game time consuming and challenging, but don't introduce ways to buy-pass the game progression. Microtransactions have slowly killed every other MMO I have enjoyed since I quit wow back in cata. It is especially important that microtransactions don't influence the way the game plays to motivate their purchase, nor are cheap enough they are more cost effective than playing the game. (GTAO is probably the best example of how not to do this, as that games online is entirely built around motivating transactions and is always 2-3x more efficient than grinding)
---
And don't over complicate it. If you have a working model, don't fuck it up trying to keep it fresh; having a strong base game is most important. My favorite game of all time was GW2, but they ruined that game's near perfect base game by haphazardly changing things to be fresh. 
---
Focus on world building. World building is how  you will tell your story, the small details can communicate so much to the player base, and is a wonderful way to keep people invested. Your world building should give the player a sense they play a role in the story, but without eliminating the group dynamic of the journey. Using gw2 again, it had wonderful world building at the start and did a decent job keeping up the quality as it progressed, but in the last year or two they shifted their focus to smaller and smaller involvements for the main story, opting to tell it through personal missions and small/short raid encounters. With that, the new maps added were lacking in personal touches and small details that gave the other zones so much character and replayability. 
---
Lastly, keep your game optimized. Your game needs to be stable enough that it runs comparatively as well 5 years down the road as it did when you started. 
---
Bonus: Hire people who are technically skilled as you need them. Don't triple your staff after a windfall of success, and don't hire bloggers and cosplayers who contribute nothing to the **gameplay**, only to have to fire half of them when you undoubtable start losing money.
---
It lets you pay for an in game advantage?
---
Since you are playing the Horde.

#Trolls
---
Ôøº¬†Beast Slaying: Damage dealt versus Beasts increased by 5%.
---
Ôøº¬†Berserking: Increases your casting and attack speed by 10% to 30%. At full health the speed increase is 10% with a greater effect up to 30% if you are badly hurt when you activate Berserking. Lasts 10 sec.
---
Ôøº¬†Bow Specialization: Skill with Bow Weapons increased by 5.
---
Ôøº¬†Regeneration: Health regeneration rate increased by 10%. 10% of total Health regeneration may continue during combat.
---
Ôøº¬†Throwing Specialization: Skill with Throwing Weapons increased by 5.
---
*Overall best PvE hunter race*
---
#Orcs
---
Ôøº¬†Command¬†is strong for Hunters and Warlocks in PvP and solo situations, but pets are usually sacrificed or die easily in raid situations.
---
Ôøº¬†Blood Fury¬†is very strong for melee DPS such as Warriors, Rogues and Enhancement shaman.
---
Ôøº¬†Axe Specialization¬†is very attractive for Warriors, opening up alternate DPS gearing options and builds.
---
[Ôøº¬†Hardiness¬†is a strong PvP racial
---
*Best beast master and PvP hunter race*

#Tauren
---
Ôøº¬†Cultivation: Herbalism skill increased by 15.

Ôøº¬†Endurance: Total Health increased by 5%.
---
Ôøº¬†Nature Resistance: Nature Resistance increased by 10.
---
Ôøº¬†War Stomp: Stuns up to 5 enemies within 8 yds for 2 sec.
---
*Tauren have no dps racial for hunters. War stomp is a mass stun that is short and has a wind up animation, that can be interrupted. It only works for Proto warriors as well as 5% more stamina.*
---
While tauren may be not the best hunter race, lore really sets their society around great hunt. And you can really enjoying it. 
---
But so do Trolls)
---
You're right.  I think hunters get 2 ap for 1 agi.  Played both in vanilla, but haven't messed around with them in classic so my knowledge is a bit rusty.
---
No, that is a cat.
---
Most of the warriors aren't tanking. That should be obvious to everyone by now.
---
Seek help.
---
Yes and no. There are some specs that are okay in either pve or PvP. You could also respec but it'll get very expensive. If you plan to play competitively in both, you'd definitely be best off with one character specific for each pve and PvP
---
Just macro it into your mount and equip your normal trinket once you enter a dungeon or raid. That small amount of movement speed adds up over time.
---
I mean, if the Rogue wouldn't have taken the chest, you would have gotten an Epic + the chest.
---
It's fine.
---
I've ran into a lot of lower level horde In STV. When they are own there own they wave away. 2 mins later there is 5 and they are attacking away.

Beautiful reason!

I tell the warlocks they can lifetap more if they see there's no danger. E.g. me as a healer wanding at 80%+ mana. And then I prefer they lifetap a lot more so my big heal is efficient.

&gt; You are not getting full exp from green quests.
---
I was having this discussion with a friend of mine a few days ago.
---
Turns out you DO get full exp from green quests in Classic. It's only when they start getting grey that you get less.
---
Of course generally speaking, green will give you less than a different quest that's yellow.
---
Where do you think he got the salt from?
---
Some situations rain of fire is much safer option.Like in Ulduman where there are mobs that aoe stun in close proximity but you are safe on range.Or mobs that do close aoe attacks like "flame blasts" etc etc
---
Farmed fire elementals in arathi highlands from 38 to close to 41 to get my mount, getting as much XP as a solo warrior can get as questing/dungeon, prices are still going up on my server since more people need them, so it's even easier to get mount now (they were 75s and going 1.5g now)
---
lucky you. 3 MC clears + 2 Onyxias and 0 loot so far
---
I think there‚Äôs no point playing Classic if you‚Äôre just gonna grind your way to 60, there‚Äôs nothing waiting for you there. But if grinding your thing then there‚Äôs no better spot than the yetis in Feralas. Decent respawn rate, not particularly tough, they drop coin and are skinnable. There‚Äôs a 43-44 camp to the south-west near the ogres, and another 47-49 on the right side of the road going to Desolace.
---
At the end of that post it actually says that green quest give less xp if there is a 6 level difference of the intended level when you are at or past level 40.
---
I'm betting you'll see a lot more Rogues once the Honor system is in place.
---
I looked through my screenshots and I saw I literally took 1 year in real time getting to level 60, which is fun as I have no memory of taking that long.
---
Edgemaster‚Äôs Handguards dropped Mara.  I am an enhancement shaman and was running without any fury warriors in the group.  My guild was kind enough to let me have them!  As an orc this puts my axe skill at 312.  How much hit% will I need to hit cap with axes?  I also have a talent that gives me 3% hit.  Before everyone says I should of sold them... I didn‚Äôt so forget about it.

That's why I listen to gnome mage dying sounds at least 30 times per day and it warms my heart

Your auction addon says it‚Äôs 800g because someone put it up for 800g. That doesn‚Äôt mean anyone bought it for that price. From looking at the stats, it seems like quite a useless item but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd be able to sell it for slightly more than you got it for.

The game, which took 3 years to reach TBC, has only been out for 5 weeks. More people are starting each week.  Claiming that if you want endgame, you have to rush is gatekeeping.

Damn grats!  MC is boring AF, hope you have an alt to bring or something, clearing it for no loot for weeks is going to suck ass.

Eh, first heals for 100%, second for 20% third for 4%. 
---
I'd rather use Chain heal for 100%, 50% 25% with +256 healing power.
---
I (on my alliance pally) did the same last week with an orc warrior. Neither of us wanted that shit and it's a pain in the ass quest.

It's the internet though, ya know?

Much appreciated input

I'm not sure about the maths.

First heals for 100%, second for 20% third for 4%.

Hehe, well. Might not be that obvious for some. I can take a screenshot later on my UI. I havent played around to much with it this time, focused more on making gold and levels because i dont have alot of time to play nowadays. It can take a good time to set up everything, i just made the basic ones that i always played with. 
---
Havent really played for 3-4 years. Took it up again when classic launched, so my macros is still in need for some work. But its coming back to me now :)
---
Thought about it, but I'm pretty sure there were no weirdos buffing the entire raid with it and then every dungeon I did that evening. I think I also tested just healing myself in IF.

I'll prolly go shadow again after this week's raids so might get a chance to test it again closer to next week.

Learning how to kite is useful in PvE and PvP.  My first class was hunter in Vanilla and I was mostly still clicking abilities well into 60.  But got the items for Rhok'delar and I needed to learn how to kite properly.  Setting up camera views and learning new bindings was difficult at first, but after a few failed attempts I had a new shiny epic.
---
I can't blame you for being cautious, but I'd have probably been banned 10 years ago if I were in the practice of posting malicious links lol

Found that list from this subreddit
---
&gt; That 8 piece will be used until nax in some situations.
---
It basically turns Healing Wave in a less effective Chain Heal. Big deal.
---
Blink is 20 yds. Aimed shot is 35 yds. Letting the mage get on top of you into dead zone is the first mistake. I always kite back the second I see a mage, using cheetah and concussive to keep a range advantage. 
---
Fight at max range and don‚Äôt let them close the gap. You have FD and scatter to interrupt a poly. If you haven‚Äôt significantly weakened them or killed them by then with your burst, then you‚Äôve fucked up.

I‚Äôm not insinuating mages are an easy matchup, but it certainly isn‚Äôt a downright lost fight 100% of the time either.

As a hunter main from mop to bfa, I absolutely love vanilla hunter. The rotation and pacing is very Zen. In retail BM is nothing but screaming, growling, spamming abilities, it just doesn't have any flow to it.

Veteran of 19 twinking in Vanilla here. You can't get the whole map, but you can get everything that matters. Like others suggested, get areas that matter.
---
In classic, we would regularly wPvP in the Barrens, Stonetalon Mountains, Ashenvale, Thousand Needles, Southshore, and Silverpine. If you have a buddy that can help out, I'd suggest getting those mostly explored along with Stranglethorn Vale. Then quest as normal. Do your dungeon loot runs starting at 10 (yes, you can zone in to WC and DM at 10). Die before mobs are killed, get resurrected, repeat. Ideally you want all of your dungeon drops BEFORE 15.

go look up some articles on how the internet works.
---
Basically it's like a road system, if there is an accident on one part of it then the traffic is diverted around about and it causes chaos, same deal with internet.
---
It should not take you 40 levels to realize how slow and painful warrior solo leveling is.
---
Besides that, pretty much the best advice
---
Orc hunters have a 5% damage boost to pets, which is underrated and does help in PVP if you manage to keep the enemy at distance. Tauren's extra health + stomp allow you to get away from enemies more efficiently if they have managed to close the gap. I have played both and have to say there is something more appealing about the Hordes passives over alliances. Plus, your more of a wild man/woman on the horde side, which fits the theme of hunter well - adding to immersion.
---
This guy gets it
---
Lol but isn't every hunter's pet attacking when you fight other players? It sure works better in pvp but I often still in combat and can't use traps
---
it's never too late.
---
Too late for what ? The game is here to stay, why would you be "late" for something?
---
Get sweeping strikes and ravager
---
Charge - sweeping strikes - whirlwind ez
---
I feel you on that. My kids don't go to bed until around 9:30PM. I play until about 12:30-1 and then back up at 6:30 for work... lol
---
Obviously not a warlock!
---
Spirit tap is life!
---
There there mr. wiggles. You'll summon el pollo grande yet.
---
ZXCVB as well as some shift and alt variants will do you well.  You can also use F1-F8 for lesser used, but useful abilities.
---
I got so much needed help for the alliances warriors chest at level 24 against the chimeras in Stonelaton. Then I got to grinding for the 20 bloods in Darkshire for the helm and those 29 worgens made it very challenging.
---
Menethil is a better HS in my opinion :)
---
Life is the most precious thing you can lose.
---
I'm loving my hunter. Buying ammo and feeding my pet doesn't bother me at all. Having mana kind of sucks though.
---
Veterans gatekeeping how noobs play is the most meta thing on this sub.
---
"You should have fun and play how you want at your own speed, but only if you play exactly how I want you to".
---
When out questing I always offer to pay when I initially ask. Only 1 out of maybe 10 times did someone actually make me pay. And even then it was 20s for 2 stacks of water. Would've been about a gold had I bought 1 stack from a vendor.
---
The selfie camera was a disaster. Not because it was a crappy toy, but because it was an entire content patch. Blizzard had so many issues with wod‚Äôs development, people were saying ‚Äòhey there‚Äôs nothing to do and people just collect daily stuff on their garrisons.‚Äô So the major content patch that would have been the chance to turn WoD around with new endgame content, was pretty much just a selfie camera.
---
So it seems. Will have to look this up in-game to confirm, but can't say I've noticed anything like it thus far.
---
Still, saying that all green quests give reduced XP is blatantly wrong, even if the 6 levels below things is actual that's quite a lenient number.
---
Nah, frost nova can be purged if you were Gnome
---
Cloth users - run Dungeons and get some awesome Dungeon quest rewards. Too lazy? Craft some awesome rare gear.
---
Leather users? Go do some quests, pleb. Also go to some most overloaded location in game like STV or Arathi. Crafting? Here some green ones too. 
---
&gt; Look in this list and we spot Triprunner Dungarees a nice lvl 37 blue quest reward
---
Yeah and it will be with you it till endgame, because there is no other decent item till past 50 i think. Great example!
---
Noob warlocks AoE only. 
---
Real warlocks dot then AoE. 
---
More damage then a mage you say?
---
To shreds you say?
---
Go to Tirisfal. Scarlet Monastery. Horde always outnumber alliance. They gank em when they try to open the door to cath/arm. Get those cheap bastards.
---
You either need to manually hit pet passive before hitting fd, or make a macro that puts pet on passive then fd's
---
This so much this
---
I'm not saying I agree. But it could be argued the 'product' which is 'vanilla wow in the year 2019' is something that blizzard did not invent. Their idea of 'wow in 2019' is bfa. They looked at private servers and saw that there is a massive demand for this sort of thing today, they didn't think it uo on their own.
---
No such thing. The game isn't going anywhere.
---
What do you want from me? Just trying to be a dick?
---
MY OPINION: Just don't
---
GENERALLY: It is his choice so I say "either way you choose to Level. Have fun" 
---
It is not contradicting itself you are just trying to be a jerk xD And no actually succeeding at it xD 
---
Learn2Reddit :)
---
Tbh if he rushed to 60 you could easily log in do raids then log right off.
---
Probably not what is happening but it is possible at this point to just show up for raids.
---
Take care what you say. Blizzard will use this to justify Sylvanas' actions.
---
I wouldn't say hunters are a counter to rogues. Once you get in their deadzone they struggle.
---
Nobody wants that item? Far as I can tell Mooncloth Circlet ain‚Äôt even good. Personally would much rather have Dreamweave Circlet as a caster rather than that.
---
Sold mine for 225 on Arcanite Reaper and I think I could have gotten more but I need that mount money
---
 demo lock levelling ftw. I seriously can't lose a 1v1 in pvp, killed a 60 rogue at 50, and having 2 VW pets lets me handle so much in pve as well.
---
Is that the MP5 shield from Mara? Do you like it over Thaurisan's Royal Scepter? Currently using the shield myself (Paladin) and I'm not sure if I want to farm for the Scepter or not.
---
If a mage gets to open on you and your pet with a nova, you already done goofed. You're a hunter, almost nothing should get the jump on you. Ofc right now most people don't attack everything on sight, so mages currently have the possibility to get the jump on you if you're a peaceful guy, but that's on you then. I accept my death if I didn't attack a mage and he abused my trust, but god knows I'll get my revenge unless they are heavily protected.
---
Same speed as Travel Form, so just look at that.
---
Well.. The price for the mats is around the same price as Cassandras grace on my server. Cassandras grace is like 30xbetter. I would consider this more or less a useless item, considering the mats costs. (Holy priest speaking) :)
---
Take picture. Press share. Click reddit icon add title. Press send. Done.  Sounds easier than
---
Prt scr. Open web browser. Go to reddit. Open new post. Ctrl v. Add title. Press send.
---
And then I assume you have a bookmark for reddit and not have to manually type in the whole site. Wich then results in a search on google because it also is a searchbar nowadays. So you have to click the first result again. And going to the correct subreddit. No thank you. I got my phone to do this, and play diablo on my pc.
---
So basically meta game your way to an end game with nothing in it and skip 90% of the content currently in game in the process then whine because you have nothing to do?
---
Exactly my thoughts! And the wind blows "you guys not have phones" ...
---
Haha why do you think they‚Äôre big streamers?
---
Crowd pummeler is Bis for feral dps and bis for threat gen on feral tank. Warden Staff is your bis tank mitigation item (due to the armor scaling). On bosses where you want the threat you open with crowd pummeler activation and switch to staff after
---

I'm using a macro. The problem is that pet is kinda slowpoke and needs 1 sec. longer. But it's already being looked upon by blizzard
---
When I was a kid playing WoW I thought when I was an adult I‚Äôd have the best gear. 
---
Now as an adult playing WoW I realized I have a job. Nice to see how the other side lives at least.
---
Is this a rare mount joke that im too epic to understand?
---
It doesnt work this way in classic, there is no jump-back.
---
Not going over all of them but the ones I have on my numbers are: immolate, CoA, corruption, siphon soul. 
---
Then I have fear, drain life, drain soul and life tap on different keys as well and lastly I have mouse scroll up for pet attack and mouse scroll down for pet follow. 
---
I think these are the most important ones, could be I'm forgetting one. The scrolling thing for your pet is really useful if you don't have it like that yet.
---
can you tell your huntard to give his companion a fucking name?
---
I *THINK* the closer your lvl is to the average lvl of the group the more XP you get, or the less XP you lose from w.e it is that makes you get less XP with a higher lvl in the group.   
---
I actually think it gets better as you get higher lvl but again not 100% sure and hopefully someone knows this so I can make the most optimal grp tonight :) haha.
---
You enter the dungeon and then die.
---
As a level 44 rogue with no mount and 51g, I don't know what this is about :(.
---
Can a level 60 rogue do this?
---
Uhhh, which communities?  Clearly not this one...  everyone is pretty much in agreement here. 
---
The blue post gives you a standard of rules and a burden of proof to follow.  If you dont care about those kinds of things then you really dont care about ninja looting very much.  Coming up with your own vauge definitions of ninja looting isnt how it works.
---
Same with tanking spell-cleaves. My job is to gather a bunch of mobs, then let the mages do their thing. They seem to have a different imagination, so I get comments like "you should spec prot","why cant you hold aggro", and "maybe you'll hold aggro better in beserker stance".
---
Running instances in the normal way is just great though, and can go fast as hell (depending on how mana-efficient the healer is).
---
I just use it when going back to my corpse is difficult or I got to leave right away.  Still it happens often enough
---
It's much more tricky.  
---
For example quest is level 33, become green at 36 and gray at 42.  
---
It will give full exp until level 38, but for 39-41 it will give less and less exp, while still been green.  
---
Also it will still give exp at 42-46, even if it's gray. But just 10% or something.
---
If your pet dies, you just FD and revive them. You shouldn't be killing more than 1 mob at a time without your pet because they died, anything more just reset and try again.
---
All those defensive abilities are kinda useless in open world grinding compared to better pet tankiness/damage/threat, and traps aren't really good for sustained killing. AoE isn't really what hunters do, their solo target damage is so much higher and they don't have enough AoE to actually AoE grind like mages/locks.
---
MM is you want to have the easiest time levelling
---
I have killed mobs 6+ levels above me no issue 
---
Lots of things can be killed with creative thinking too, kiting opens a lot of doors for elite quests, for example kiting elites to town guards so you can solo elite quests, or kiting mor ladim in circles till he dies
---
Nope, I have no faith in the playerbase decisions.
---
I do have faith in Blizzards game designers tho and Classic+ sounds way more intresring than TBC.
---
Lot of people, like myself, will run some sort of compromise-build... Or PvE in their PvP-build and hope noone cares enough.
---
Running 2 characters, however seems like a huge waste of time and effort. There's no stats like resilience in classic so PvE gear can be used for doing PvP without any disadvantages.
---
A lot of people considere PvE as means of gearing up for PvP. I know that APES, who were the first to clear MC have that mindset.
---
A Priest of them, who has a Youtube channel, I think "Hydramist" or so even said himself in his PvP-Talent-Guide stuff like "this build is okay to use in raids".
---
Woa you got so lucky with the whelps. Been grinding 13h and nothing! Amazing
---
Leveling from 1-10 as a rogue felt like it is a godsend class. I did not even lose more than 20% of HP in 1vs1 mob. I dodged everything and my burst damage was quite high lol.
---
I‚Äôm sure some do but as long as the Alliance seems friendly (which is a big if), then it‚Äôs super funny to us. But usually if they‚Äôre going to attack they just spit anyways lol.
---
Yeah, I was thinking that too. Until I started asking around. Others confirmed what I was experiencing, and that there is a lot of idiot (to put it mildly) out there.  
---
So no, I don't think its me.
---
Absolutely I think it started there, especially wotlk.
---
This exactly. I don't even get where the question is coming from.
---
There was a supposed dome of energy-stuff blocking them (IIRC)
---
I only bring a rogue to avoid competing with more cloth for my priest‚Äôs dungeon drops
---
Classic is more fun than retail. Well no shit, the sky is also blue. Are you simple or what?
---
All I get is ?? Alliance dismounting and fucking my orc ass.
---
Yeah, true. The difference is that you just have one guy behind that can decide alone to hate you and ruin your life. The commitment necessary/odds to have a full party camping you is quite lower I think.
---
You know he's joking right?
---
badlands is where i'm struggling to do anything besides the coyotes because everything is so overcamped, lol.  nice zone otherwise.  I thought I was a little low for tanaris so maybe i'll check that out.  i've really been looking forward to getting back into that zone and doing ZF in a few levels.  It's my favorite zone/dungeon!
---
Even still, not many better necklaces at 39 for Druids or shaman
---
If you need both on a nameplate you are out of luck. The target frame itself however has no range restiction and can show both. Luna unit frames for example shows you the castbar right under the manabar of the target if you want.
---
Some changes wouldn‚Äôt be so bad.... it was so incredibly depressing having to abandon my starter pet today because they only give you 3 pet slots for some ungodly reason.  Would making it 6 really destroy the classic experience lol?
---
Yeah, that's why I'm using expressions such as "in my opinion" and "to me".
---
You calm the fuck down.
---
Just respec into it when you can reach the good talents
---
I swear all the bigglesworth server is is bigglesworth boys guild. I also really want to join adults with jobs but I have a guild for fun with friends so I can't just drop. Employed is always posting for new members.
---
I have never had this happen, and I'm close to 60 following it. Probably different kinds of the same mob with different levels drop stuff for the quest, and you didn't find the lower level ones.
---
\^no attention given to this post\^
---
I agree, but that's all situational. More commonly, the rogue gets the opener. Crippling Poison is rough for a hunters to deal with.
---
The only true counter to rogue is warrior, and we just avoid those.
---
With 60% mount you shouldn't mount up if the travel distance is lower than 60 yards, or 2x cast-ranges (frostbolt, shadowbolt or shoot range). 
---
I also measured how much Carrot on a stick affects the results, but made the choice to exclude the values from the graphs. If interests, look at the [full table](https://imgur.com/a/GPFbUfj). Spoiler:&gt;!its crap!&lt;
---
Calculated with a running velocity of [8 yards/s (source)](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Movement) and cast time of [3 seconds (source)](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=5784/summon-felsteed) to mount up.
---
I see a lot about the WW axe. Should it be used by prot spec warriors for tanking? Or should a shield be used?
---
What's so wrong about it? A 500g item is worth 500g of value no matter whether you equip it immediately or not.
---
..... Blink range 20 yards, nova range 10 yards.... Can close the gap by 30 yards.... Hunters max range 35 yards (without talents)..... Hunters dead zone 11 yards....
---
Soo a mage only needs to walk 4 yards into your max range in order to blink and be in your deadzone. They only have to walk one additional yard to be able to nova you from blink.
---
In the time it takes to line up an aimed shot to shoot a mage can be in your deadzone.
---
So you don't use aimed shot... Well most good hunter weapons have a 3 second auto attack let's say 2.5 after talents.... So you can auto attack 2 times and cast a multishot and arcane shot before a mage can close the gap to be able to nova you in place... That might get rid of their shield, if your lucky concussion shot will stun and that might be enough to tip the tide in your favor.
---
No, a good mage will destroy a hunter every time. A really good hunter will have bombs to stun the mage, but then a mage of the same skill will probably have one of his own and/or something to help with the gap closing.
---
The only chance a hunter has against a mage is getting the jump on them with a good aimed shot/multi combo and drop the mage to no hp.
---
But remember a mage if they really wanted to can double blink to you, freeze you,  and be in your deadzone.
---
The 5 piece gives very high mana regen if you're chain casting healing waves and the 8 piece makes those healing waves chain, making you the only tank healer who can also heal other targets without interrupting the healing he's doing on the tank.  Also, if I recall vanilla correctly, the 8 piece chain healing waves have a chance to proc the 5 piece bonus as well, which is an additional powerful interaction.
---
Forgetting that ilevel is basically irrelevant in classic, it's just an eyesore imo
---
I healed RFD last night with a Druid tank (he was fine) a fury warrior who put the group together, didn't have great English and didn't seem to know much of what was going on. Gonna put it down to the language barrier. 
---
Y'know how RFD is full of undead and Paladins are great there? Well. I guess this warrior didn't want any competition on mail/plate loot because even though I had two Paladins ready to go, my man decides to invite two warlocks instead. What the fuck. The run itself was relatively smooth (wiped twice) but it could have been so much easier. 
---
Nice bunch of people though.
---
pants off rend, belt off drak, shield off drak

Petition to rename this sub /r/classiccirclejerk

I have the natural weapons talent on my druid which should apparently increase all physical damage done by 10% in all forms. Sometimes on my character screen it shows the dps as green (modified) with a 110% on mouseover. Sometimes it doesn't. Is this a bug?
---
how is that relevant?
---
you know you don't need to be prot to tank?
---
*Gasp*
---
I reckon if you are doing well and getting maybe 50g per hour, it takes how long to hit lvl 60? 100 hours? More? Then to gear your alt as well, get lucky with drops? 400 hours or more? At 50g an hour that's like 20k gold, which is 40 respecs, up to you really
---
I dunno, I see plenty of it. Very large percentage of LFG messages are for spellcleaving, I constantly see groups asking specifically for mages, and getting water out of mages is like getting water out of a desert. 
---
I haven't personally seen any ninja looting but almost every non-recruiting thread on my server forum is about it. 
---
I see plenty of people in full pre-raid BiS. Hell, a warlock buddy of mine was in full pre-BiS 2.5 weeks after release somehow. I myself have 3 pieces of raid gear and I see plenty of people more decked out than I am.
---
Honestly this really is a "play what u want" question. All 3 hunter specs level perfectly fine and better than basically any other class except maybe mage/lock
---
Ah nice, played like 13k batlles but I plateaued at around 950 wn8 and I wasn't having as much fun anymore.  I might start again one day we'll see.
---
Tried PoE once with a friend but it didn't really click.  I did play UO for 2 months this year, that's what led me to Wow :-)
---
I would personally prioritize money for your mount over an enchant - although if i had the choice i'd go firey especially if you're fishing for procs with Sunder/HS
---
So youre not referring to spectral form just laying as a corpse?
---
You know *he's* joking too, right?
---
Playing a warrior myself, i always aim to be at least 1-2 lvls above the trash mobs in a dungeon, since bosses usually are 2-3 lvls higher. But if you really want to, I bet you can tank RFK at 28-29 if you find a patient group that understands that you are low level and require more time until they unleash hell (good luck on that one).  
---
Alternatively just join as dps.
---
Like you said its hard because most hunters will sit on a trap, and if you disarm that its visible and a flare is soon to be coming
---
Depends on the player i guess :P
---
skurri font best font
---
I hit 40 with 35g.  What am I doing wrong???
---
Honestly, every time I try to do something fun or exciting, you make it not that.
---
Right both are written by the community but one has a link from a blue post and is found more across the board than that 1 agil=2ap info. 
---
https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-rogue/
---
Another that states 1 Agil=1AP
---
I did see 1 agil= 2  Ranged AP which is where that wiki may have got that info from.
---
29 Agility = 29 Attack Power, 1% Crit Chance, 2% Dodge seems to be correct.
---
i swear to god if you need on an expensive BoE you better equip that shit right away or you probably can start working on your next character
---
Human Accountant
---
My bad, give me a second
---
*Casts Blessing of Light*
---
This also applies to Shamans who, every once in a while, might want to use fire nova or magma totem. In case people didn't know, fire nova has a hidden taunt when you drop it. So you drop it, and any mob within range will immediately destroy it. How dumb is that? Magma as well, will immediately get destroyed. So pathetically weak as they are a tiny blip of effectiveness compared to other aoe options. But I could go on all day about how shamans could have been better balanced and that would derail the thread. Carry on!
---
You never greed BoE epics. That is a rule. It removes the chances of anyone ninjaing it.
---
Unless it‚Äôs me and I leterall hit greed then say all greed. Ninja in my runs and I‚Äôll just ignore you and never tank for you.
---
Dude right lmao I‚Äôm lvl 40 and have a 20 alt üòÇ
---
So much this! These people are completely illogical in their support and I personally have zero interest in playing with players who do clearly abuse the system. 
---
If you need on anything to sell you have ninja‚Äôd that item. Period.
---
Can do the same with wands. But all the dungeons I joined wanted to kill me
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; "My time is worth more than your time." I see I upset some gear reservers in here, good. You should be upset that you think you're more important than anyone else in the game.
---
No one is making you go to the run. Make your own run if you want to, and don't put any items on reserve.
---
You know he was joking back too right?
---
I saw it happen once! Daze applies on aoe?
---
There's absolute minimum called "Rule of 5" - tank/dps should be no more than 5 level lower than last boss.  
---
Last boss of RFK is level 33, so it put us at level 28, minimum.  
---
But for more comfortable play you should follow "Rule of 3", and be level 31 for RFK.
---
That fire shield is dope doe..
---
Me as a 37 hunter waiting for Broken tooth
---
Hes trash so he can't
---
It's only good on a low pop server. But normally you either won't get an asshole in your group because they either know to behave or will not join since their experience is being kicked from groups. Simply because the team will insta kick an asshat and 4 man it. Or spend a bit looking for a replacement (which on a normal pop server is quick).
---
And then there are cases where you get a shit group and it falls apart. But those are so rare and far between that it's generally better for the game feel to not have LFD.
---
The only thing I would prefer to have back is the summoning stone. But the LFD thing I tried and absolutely hated because it makes people anonymous. I want to meet people from my server so that I can ask them to group later on.
---
And the being locked out of content? Who cares if you skip a single dungoen while leveling.
---
There is also a sense of adventure when having to get to BFD from Duskwood as a gnome. Have to talk to a mage to port me (an interaction) and then run some more while talking to people either forming a group or just asking for directions or lending them a hand.
---
Obviously - somehow - you managed to have nice interactions with LFD, but most other people seem to not be able to have them.
---
And then there's the LFG channel, still, in which you can find groups super quick. Just without the port.
---
If you need on anything you don‚Äôt need that is a textbook ninja.
---
If you are hunting down a horde in PvP this is enough to catch them.
---
You can easily snipe any limited stock vendor item before anyone else using legitimate in-game means.  Don't be salty.
---
I love the names in the group
---
The miss formula is 5% + (Defense Skill - Weapon Skill)*.1%
---
Raid bosses are considered to be level 63, thus a defense skill of 315
---
I'm not too sure Edgemaster's affects 2hand axe skill, so you might not get a lot of use out of them.
---
It's just not worth it to use hellfire in a PUG, even after waiting for 15 seconds and waiting on the mage to use 2-3 abilities you still get aggro after a few seconds and having to be close to mobs to actually castit . Ye most of the time its not worth it unless its a guild run and ppl know what they are doing
---
A lot of BC raids kept somewhat of the same feel. Or maybe they were really just linear without feeling quite like it. I'm hoping someday I get to go through live Karazhan again. Oh how many runs I put through that place back in the day.
---
Idk about you but a giant stabby chicken that shoot lazer is the way I want to be in life.
---
If it were horde shitting on allies this sub would react like it was a kitten licking a babies toes
---
Yea idk, maybe it's NA. It was the only thing in chat for the first week of launch. Now it's probably 1/3 of the LFG chat.
---
You‚Äôre missing the best one.  /train
---
they should develop the launcher for the right audience.
---
BFA event ads shouldnt show up if I dont play BFA. Like the brewfest notification.
---
instead of /welcome you can also use /yw for the same response :)
---
i think you need buy a new screen :)
---
that's cool but how did you bind your shield wall to the 1/2 key
---
Can I macro it without having to hit the macro twice?
---
I think BM is the way to go since you can get the pet to hold aggro better and use intimidate. In this time, you autoshot and use serpent sting and aimed shot if you have it.
---
I for one went 2/31/18. It's true that my pet can't always keep aggro so I need to feign once every battle or so, but sometimes I also get a nice 700 crit with aimed shot (lv 41 now).
---
Spec how you like! I'll be going for that trueshot aura and the hit, to be ready for raiding at 60 :) The pet is just there to keep aggro while I kill mobs or pick up flowers.
---
Also hit 40 with 98g last night. NJ.
---
Kick, Gouge, Expose Armor. I use Kick to interrupt and Gouge to bandage or set up a Backstab. Expose Armor pretty much shouldn‚Äôt even be on the bar. I‚Äôve stopped upgrading Rupture because I spend all my combo points refreshing Slice n Dice, with the occasional Kidney Shot or Eviscerate. I didn‚Äôt bother with any poisons except Instant and Crippling; Wound and Mind-numbing are pointless because I don‚Äôt PvP and Deadly breaks my Gouge.
---
Quite a few places you can save as a Rogue.
---
They changed it from old classic cause it was abusable to stack. 
---
If you have combat text addons that show all damage you cause, you'll notice reckonings jusy gives you an instant extra attack and resets your auto attack timer.
---
I like auctioneer thathung. Cause im also that-hung.
---
I have Atlas, are there maps in it? That would be ridiculously helpful.
---
Imagine being in 2019 and still trying to convince yourself enhance isn‚Äôt just a trash tier slot machine
---
Commenting to save
---
That's actually kind of clever. Nice job little bro!
---
Can someone please explain macros to me? Sorry, a noob question, but I don't understand how to go about making them. I think I understand what they do, but I don't know which ones I should have as a lock.
---
Haha Podling face
---
Beweglichkeit is agility.
---
Yea I know.. that why is said remotely
---
Be me Night Elf Huntard, in Southshore doing Dowm the Coast. 28 Shaman runs behind me; starts killing the mob I‚Äôm auto shooting. I left click him to check him out not realizing my macro is still on. He gets dinged a couple times before I realize what I‚Äôm doing. I apologize 3 times and /me ‚ÄúMY BAD!!!!!!!‚Äù. He laughs and we get away from each other

I bought mine for 125 on Whitemane. Got sick of strat live and just bit the bullet since I had the mats ready to make the robe.
---
For how much did you sell that melon juice lol
---
2 VW? You can have two demons out as a lock?
---
That's interesting. It implies the damage counters on the mob are reset after a MC. I wonder if you can use this to reset tag on a mob?
---
As a horde, helping alliance low lvl kill the elemental is always a pleasure. Yes sometime I kill them right after they equiped the axe, but at least they‚Äôll remember this happy event. Also, mind controlling alliance to buff/renew them is so much fun.
---
That is a pretty embarrassing attempt at a threat.

Inaugural Azerothion Dressage World Champions
---
what do you exactly do when you PvP against Warlocks and Spriests? i just end up getting feared for an entire year, then i die to DoT's before i even regain control of my character.
---
It's definitely alive and active but it's not like overly packed.  When I'm put questing most areas have 1 or 2 other horde and then 1 or 2 alliance. Only occasionally I'll run into a questing area with like a dozen of each faction.

SoR doesnt proc anything, its extra dmg on top of a normal attack, if the normal hit did not proc, then the SoR dmg will not proc either.

JoR can proc stuff though.

---

---
Neat blog post bro.
---
Slower weapon in your pictures has 1 more damage on either end of the damage range, that 1 damage is augmented by your 150 power to produce that 4 damage difference you are seeing on the tooltip.
---
Unfortunately edgemaster's on orcs (with axes) and humans (with swords) is a big waste. Getting to 305 is really really good as it gives you 3% hit and greatly reduces glancing blow damage penalty, but going from 305 to 312 does almost nothing - you still need 6% hit to cap (5.3% technically) and you get a bit of crit and reduced glancing penalty, but it's not enough to warrant dropping a glove slot.
---
Sounds like a fun guild! Are you on EU?
---
&gt; But thats okay for me, ill just switch zone or quest and come back later.
---
But not all zones have decent quest rewards. Actually most have trash ones, but that's Classic for you. And some zones doesn't even have quests (and quest chains) that are worth it, aside from lore. But zones like STV showers you with quests, rewards, exp and mod drops.
---
On Grobb I can't make it through IF without getting sucked into some mass Dwarf RP raid, its glorious.
---
The monetary value is equal to the upgrade rights
---
The best way to rush a class is to not rush it. Meaning you maximize the use of rested for the alt, which would mean your /played will be lower, but the process would take months. If goal was to make several alts, then leveling them simultaneously, each played only when rested was on, would be optimal.
---
Paladins are pretty good when you have Blessing of Salv, but I‚Äôm not at 60 yet so there probably isn‚Äôt much due to them having no taunt.
---
MC was cleared in 5 days, with half the raid as level 55's and the majority of people in quest greens.
---
You should replace that trinket with a nifty stop watch or something lol
---
Had a 24 rogue, 13 lock started a shaman but deleted my rogue to prevent me from going back. Gonna get to 60 now. My original was a shammy but he only got to lv 40 something
---
Autopilot add on.
---
It maximises appropriate time saving details, and priority quests to pick up or ignore.
---
Is this how I always get dismounted on flight paths?
---
Impressive, i think this is gonna be a good month.
---
Why does everyone hate the glow? The graphics are cartoonish and bright that's the whole idea behind the design.
---
You will level some, just going to all 3 newbie zones and the travel paths between will get you to level 3, (2 if you use the Rezz portals)
---
However discovery xp is capped according to your level, so you'll get the same xp discovering booty bay with a level 1 as you would discovering WInterspring.
---
However it's not really important to discover "All the places", just the capitals, travel paths between 1- 30 zones, + STV arena and surrounding areas and the areas where you intend to farm BoP twink gear. (nothing worse than getting feared into a new discovery on your way to the arena)
---
That should keep your level 19 twink safe from discoveries. then just grab new zones you might visit before you begin leveling when you move up a bracket.
---
If its boe i could sell and buy an same rarity upgrade for me, gold = item upgrade. so its an upgrade for everyone despite the class.

Noob. It's been in the same spot on the shore after you take the purple light thingie under the shack behind the banktree for the past 15 years.

You asked the damn question.
---
Since I haven‚Äôt heard anything either way about this, do you have any links confirming this? I‚Äôm curious
---
Impossible, THEY are the dicks. WE are the good side, its THEM who are wrong.
---
Go forth and slay horde scum, they are snakes that won't engage unless they have a few buddies to back them up.
---
Saw it drop last night during a run. Think that was the first time i saw it in 7 runs
---
If they're not doing anything about it maybe he's not actually exploiting. IIRC the server metadata shows pretty much everything to a degree that it'd be very obvious to tell if he was exploiting and not just layer hopping.
---
I already bought some blue BoE and enchant and still have 40g, i'm not too worried about the mount.
---
Thanks for the answer, will go with fiery :)
---
I did find a whelp spot and grinded it EXCLUSIVELY from lvl 39-44, I‚Äôm over grinding whelps is what I‚Äôm saying
---
You can get talents that reduce the summoning time, and then a cool down which lowers it even further to 0.5s. It‚Äôs really quite strong for survivability, because it allows you to double sacrifice a void walker for a massive health pool
---
look at the chat in the screenshot mate
---
Speed is the same so you can mentally move the line by 1 second if 1 pt, 2 seconds if 2 points, 3 seconds if no points.
---
Cheat the language system is a bit much..
---
"watch your back"
---
It was a quick turnaround. I think it was as soon as they realized they could get away with it that everyone flipped
---
that one point to take it stops you from taking Ruin or Demonic Sac though
---
Thats the huge differnce compared to retail. Once you are done you can just raid log and are nearly as useful as someone who plays 24/7
---
in all seriousness if you see any change in currency/items, contact blizzard and let them know someone is accessing ur account without ur permission. Change ur password. If this goes on and they think u are allowing this behavior you could end up with a ban on ur hands
---
That‚Äôs true you usually don‚Äôt. I‚Äôm a 56 warlock and it‚Äôs been nothing but helpful ever since I specced into it. 
---
Mainly, DP is just there to increase efficiency. Out of mana and low HP after pulling one too many mobs? DP mana from your succ and drain life away. It has a lot of usefulness for being 1 point.
---
I had the same reservations as you, but I've found Dark Pact great in the following situations:
---
1. When you don't have any spare health to tap but need some more mana to finish off a kill
---
2. Walking between quest mobs, I just spam Dark Pact which helps you to keep moving without stopping.
---
For 1 talent point I personally recommend it - 52 warlock
---
Just get skinning while leveling.  At 40 when you get a mount you can drop it for mining engineering or wait longer.  Don‚Äôt bother with fishing or cooking yet, and do first aid as you level.
---
Way easier to do the optional ogre boss event with more than 5, too.
---
Ya fucked. Literally only killed whelps from 39-44 and it hasn‚Äôt dropped üòÇ
---
Those yetis must be the most over farmed enemy I experienced in the game. I went to that cave several times add very off peak hours and every time all the yetis were dead.
---
Ye, he should totally just be waiting until he outnumbers the enemy and then oneshotting them like 99% of people on either side RN lol. 
---
Let him have his fun.
---
I like how the barbershop was somehow the first thing on your list before the ones that would actually hurt the game.
---
Is there a macro to put a raid target on an enemy? Or at least an easier/faster way?
---
&gt;I am enraged seething in my boiling blood at requests for barbers, level boosts, wowtokens, flying, and nerfing horde racials... 99% of the requests seem to come from alliance too.
---
Where are you going that you're getting to the point of seething anger over this stuff? I haven't seen a single person request anything like this in weeks. It seems like you might be actively seeking it out to get butthurt over it.
---
On the General tab put a tick in the 'Lock' option. This will take it out of config mode and leave you with the settings you have selected.
---
Can you please describe the exploit?  Because all you've described here is just someone being quicker than you to buy a limited vendor pattern.  What makes you think it's an exploit?
---
I agree all rolling need should always be the answer no matter who you want to give the item to. I don't know why some people can't see that it is better no matter if you all roll for money or the people that actually will equip it should get it.
---
the kebab with everything
---
&gt;About 10% of mages will give me water, ai, and decurse without me asking them to.
---
Our smooth-brain, *"Why are we only pulling one group at a time? Here, I'll get the next two pulls"* Mage in RFD removed the curse from the spider boss from only himself.  When asked if he cold take off everyone's, he suggested the bear tank could shift out and do it, as he was busy conjuring more water for himself.
---
Where are those requests? People seriously ask for flying mounts and tokens? Why those retards don‚Äôt just leave and play retail?
---
Dw lol got my 20 g saved for a blackstone run already- just want to get 45 first so I can get thrash Blade at the same time

1. Yes, you can easily heal dungeons up into the upper level brackets (don't bother trying to dd in the spellcleave meta)
---
2. there are enough guides for that
---
3. Get wand upgrades ASAP
---
4. No. There will be max 1 Spriest spot per raid, you would have to be an excepional player to get that spot but since you dont have so much time be prepared to respec into healing or don't raid at 60
---
5. no
---
6. yes
---
7. Spriest is a top tier pvp class, especially in 1v1 situations
---
I personally take the photo as post to discord so if I feel like uploading later  when I'm not at my pc, I can in quality. Look you can make all the excuses you want like not being properly set up before hand to make it easier for yourself to do it correctly but it's an objectively worse outcome and for you to purposely do it to troll just says a lot about you as a person.
---
50 Rogue here. I have 150G saved up and curious what I should spend cash on. If I can get a Krol blade for 200g would it be worth it or would I be better off saving up for a Devilsaur set or keep saving for eventual epic mount? Thanks!
---
First aid requires you to stand still and use mats while DP lets you regen mana for free while running between mobs. IMO its worth it over ruin while leveling with a low crit chance.
---
Can this guy be banned already? Like wtf mods, he spams threads with retarded troll responses, spams this sub with useless topics and is legit retarded.
---
I‚Äôm for no change. But also don‚Äôt like you very much for the jabs at alliance. 
---
Blizzard throws you a bone in BC to balance population and never does the same for alliance later. 
---
Ever since, horde is the ‚Äúcool kid club‚Äù. Well I‚Äôm proud that I was always alliance and never will switch.
---
even if someone selects need over greed, as a BoE, the group can just /roll after - if it's a cool group. 
---
since vanilla was out for a long time, many players had a couple Years to get familiar with these types of small but important nuances - so, i find that explaining it in /p at the start of a long run is helpful.  run down markings, "house" rules (need/greed for OS) etc. 
---
most people dont care until they realize some of those BoE blues sell for a Ton - then they get all "wait, what happened!?"
---
Imo a little split damage is better than worrying about having to burst heal the tank
---
"Heeeeee-Heeeeee intensifies"
---
This is a bizzare fatalist comment. Medium realms on Classic have bigger populations than the most populated realms Vanilla ever had, and it was no problem finding people there for raiding. We‚Äôre talking about thousands of people, who have virtually no other way of gearing than raiding. You‚Äôll find raid groups without any issues.
---
By the way, there is already a 10 man raid : UBRS. Anecdotically, I believe Scholomance and Stratholme were 10 men raids back in early Vanilla too, though they‚Äôre 5 mans now.
---
I bet it's a cool story mate byt can't read any of it cuz gotta play lmao

Yes the aggro range is insane. I've been discovering places on my 19 + 29 twinks at level 1 so I don't over level. Running STV to DM was a pain close to Booty Bay where the 4* gorillas are.

So helpful!! Thank you.

There's plenty to do at 60.
---
Dark Pact doesn't scale with spellpower. Life Tap does though.
---
&gt; At some point it's just unhealthy. If you can do it without sacrificing anything else and making justifications for yourself, great. But most people playing 12+ hrs per day will begin to have negative impacts whether they recognize it or not.

Hey remember that thing that guy just said?

Looking for a great spot for a 38 frost mage to grind mobs until 40 for gold for mount? I don‚Äôt even particularly enjoy AOE but prefer mowing down single targets. Planning on using food buffs (nightfin soup?) to keep mana regen going while grinding. I also have skinning.
---
I‚Äôm 36 now but planning ahead a little. I know it‚Äôs a good idea to grind mobs a few levels below you for efficiency. I mainly play early morning too so not anticipating many areas being too packed.
---
Thanks so much!
---
Oh shit lol
---
Buy Low, Sell High
---
Why are you listening to other‚Äôs opinions? Get over it lol
---
You‚Äôre actually intolerable
---
That should be higher than minimum wage at the time. Not to mention that would be worth \~$23k in today's market. Still not much, but I believe higher than minimum wage for most places.
---
Not really. It's literally what can and does happen. There's no rule, or etiquette police in the game.
---
When I started in Vanilla, I leveled pretty high without adding any abilities. It was more ignorance. I didn't know until someone mentioned it to me lol
---
lies, not even my horse likes water!
---
Priest here.
---
1) You can level just in dungeons but it won't be the fastest. I do them for a fun xp chunk when I am bored of solo. Take shadow spec, but bring healing gear too. Being flexible with your role will help you get more groups. You can heal as shadow no problem.
---
2) 1k needles, stonetalon, hillsbrad 
---
3) Wand spec. Spirit tap. Keep plenty of drinks but you shouldn't need to be drinking often. Only when oom. Mind Blast, Pain, Wand. Use extra mind blasts when you got the mana. Kill lots and be efficient. Get big bags so you run less to go vend.
---
4) You can but its hard mode if you want to competitive with mages warlocks. You are there to provide shadow weaving and dispels and do as much dps as you can. You wont be top dps. You will need lots of consumes (pots, demonic runes) and as much Mp5 and shadow damage as you can manage. Its also hard to find a raid spot but not impossible.
---
5) No, do what you enjoy and pimp your character.
---
6) Yes but you have to farm a lot or get rank 11 in PVP
---
7) You will melt faces as a shadow priest in PvP
---
Theres not an over saturation at 60. Tanks are always wanted and plenty of 40mans want 8+ wars in a raid
---
it doesnt reset your auto attack timer
---
that's 60 dollars a month and like how do you even get all 4 accounts to actually do anything useful? it just seems like you are playing 1/4 a player not playing 4. but like i said it's just my opinion no need to get all butt hurt over it

---
there's a bit more to it than that.
---
my problem is that i dont want to let my friends down just because there are leveling slower than me. 
---
they will get to 60 eventually, but until then i think im gonna have to fight through these pugs.
---
I love that the need everything crowd is so adamant about this issue and angrily insists that this is the only way to play. 
---
And every time they make a new thread, there are always more down votes.
---
Accept that the need everything lifestyle isn't how the game is played or intended to be played.  You aren't going to convince people and just look like you are trying to defend your need roll after the group rolled greed without hesitation.
---
devilsaur is a better value because Krol blade is only slightly better than thrash blade.
---
ooof, pretty unforgiving eh?  Well I guess it is what it is. Thanks.
---
See I like the map markers. I get that its a little less immersive because you dont have to read the quest as much, however, if someone gave me a task to walk halfway across a continent you bet your ass id have them circle where tf im going on a map.

I wish questie gave more of a "general area" how it was in TBC than actual individual spawn markers but I have liked it! I still make sure to explore the area once I arrive and ill even take detours along the way

Hey guys !

I'm strictly duo leveling on my first character and my partner might need to lower his play time next week. So here I am contemplating my first reroll ...
---
I'm not here to ask about class/race (I already fudged the first char by rolling war UD and missing on the sweet orc axe skill) but to ask about leveling addon / guides ?
---
When we started duo leveling we turned on zygor but were quickly put off by the numerous times the guide asked us to grind.
---
I understand that grinding is an integral part of the classic leveling experience, and I'm ready to grind, my younger brother was not really into it ...
---
Should I stick to zygor ? any better alternatives ?
---

After the 4th reply from.the hive mind I guess agree to disagree. Again if you read my first message never played wow before absolutely loving my time having came from GW2 with over 150 days played. I just feel like a lot of guild.wars content was used from WOW. If you disagree that's okay. I wasnt even shitting on gw as a game. I'll just keep enjoying Wow Classic and stay off the subreddit. Reddit does not = wow classic community for sure
---
The part I‚Äôm confused on is the hard server caps. I was under the impression, as I‚Äôm sure others here are, that layering was used to help disperse the player group so that when everyone is in the same zones, it wouldn‚Äôt be impossible to tag mobs. 
---
Layering would drop once the playerbase is more distributed, battlegrounds are up, more dungeons, etc, so that even with a larger player pool in one layer, they are spread enough to make it work.
---
Maybe I don‚Äôt have common sense, but if that‚Äôs the case I‚Äôll need you to spell it out for me.
---
Oh my lord i posted in LFG in the mid 40s i want to say looking for RFC/RFD, i forget which, got a party invite and a whisper saying YOU WILL HEAL OUR RFC group. I just sent him a quick ? and he never replied.
---
I think he's referring to the main differences in classic vs retail. Characters in retail feel too OP. Class design you either love or hate, not saying classic is perfect but the spells and abilities mean more to me in classic and I think learning your class is more difficult in classic.
---
The SEVERE lack of rpg elements in retail are what kills it for me, professions don't mean anything, class trainers aren't a thing, leveling doesn't mean anything till max lvl, I don't enjoy flying in the game because the world feels small. All the little things about needing soul shards/arrows, being able to train your ability in weapons, needing items to work your professions, everything adds up to give you an experience that feels like your character is real and you're growing with it.
---
I understand this isn't for everyone and alot of people see it as tedious, but this is the shit I love. So yes, grinding mobs hasn't changed, escorts have not changed, but don't say the core gameplay is the same because it simply isn't.
---
That order is a tall one.
---
Ah, I suppose I didn't realize world bosses and DM were Phase 2, for some reason I thought they were Phase 3 alongside BG's.
---
Well, still, I don't think we'll see Phase 2 until December at the earliest.
---
Double D is a great server with a great community! Glad to have ya
---
&gt; There's no rule, or etiquette police in the game.
---
Thanks for saying exactly what I said, dummy.
---
You‚Äôre fine bro. Dire Maul has tons of catchup gear, as long as you‚Äôre 60 when that drops you‚Äôll be close enough to keep up.
---
Sheeple gonna sheep.
---
At this point, a guild that is ahead of the rest of the server in gear. Typically due to nolifing the game since launch.

I see tons of rogues Horde side, maybe it's an Alliance shortage?
---
No, he means that if you discover everywhere then getting all the quests that reward twink gear done will put you over level 19.
---
Yeah, this is kinda important when it comes to getting to the root of why people dislike the Selfie cam so much, aside from it being inane. Afaik, they were promising raid tier level content to offset WoD's development focus on cloning facebook games down to the hip. As easy as it is to hate on Activision, this was Blizzard's fuck up, among many they made that year.

By no means I tried to give him the credit for the idea althought I can understand why you would think so, I did phrase that poorly.
---
You need to do some research, find out the quicksellers and their prices, then buy low sell high or farm.

On a private server I used to be able to buy all the mats requires to make hide of the wild on the AH for about 60g, make the Cape and sell it for between 150-210g. Epic mount? Completed it mate!

---
Yeah.... 95% of the people in my guild are 60 already. But a lot of us do have alts in the 20-50 range.
---
I have the full time and the wife, but no kids and still only 36! 
---
You‚Äôre crushing it!
---
You‚Äôve kinda missed the window.  If you weren‚Äôt hustling the market in the first couple weeks, you already missed out on some of the best deals while there weren‚Äôt many bots stroking their sniper addons all day at the auction house.  Prices on valuable items are pretty well established now and just keep going up.
---
Well you are already 10 levels higher than them, and you can never have too many friends, the more the merrier, find people that level at your pace, then you can boost your lowbie pals if they ever need help
---
Lol, it can be interrupted. People just roll gnomes for the same reason as rolling a panda in retail. To humiliate people. I get mad if I get camped by a gnome more so than other races
---
That‚Äôs awful, breaks immersion just seeing that
---
Op sounds more like the bitch boy in this situation
---
First off, it's not "my strategy", its the way the non-retail game is normally played.
---
Kill skull, Then X,  Moon means sheep/sap, square means hunter trap. 
---
DPS, gives the tanks a slight head start before opening up.

Secondly, I do communicate.  However it doesn't do any good.  They are always seem to be under the impression that they are "rescueing" the group from "bad tank" , "slow tank", "bad pulls". In their world they are the hero's making the group better.  You can never explain to them that they are the reason, we have slowed down, and getting "bad pulls".
---
When that doesn't work, I get the healer to stop healing them.  Now that the healer has plenty of mana again, I go back to chain pulling and ignoring the mages cries to wait for mana.  Eventually the mage will refill their mana, and we will have a crappy pull while the mage "saves us from the scary mobs", then the rest of the group goes back to chain killing.

I need this druid at 60 asap for alt raids
---
Everytime it becomes 'night time' on my server I get mad/annoyed at how not dark everything is &gt;.&gt;. The clock says it's late, the ambience changes to reflect how late it is YET everything is still bright as shit and for some reason it really bugs me.
---
I have Ffxglow 0 helps a little but not anywhere near what it needs to be.
---
Ah so thats how it works, been reading conflicting information that the holy damage itself is considered an extra attack for the sake of triggering on-hit effects and it's rather hard to find solid data from vanilla. So it's the judgement that can trigger procs
---
Shouldn't even need a game design textbook. If they'd have played the game at 3 different points, sometime between Vanilla-Wrath, Cata-WOD, Legion/Bfa it feels like a different game, imo.
---
Claw in dungeons, bite outside

I play on the same server and ive seen it in LFG channel. Not super often but more than a few times.
---

---
Because of this I would fully support them removing some of the travel conveniences that killed community in the game as a deviation from "how it was."
---
I have only played Classic WoW and BFA. I gave up on BFA because it ended up being a lonely grind as the entire rest of the game's playerbase was in the new expansion zones only. It's like a different game just because there are actually people in all the zones.
---
lol noob confirmed.
---
But you are blazing a trail.... WITH EACH OTHER.
---
We're months away from P2, and MANY months before next raid tier. Enjoy the journey.
---
There's no multibox fee, these people aren't paying extra nor are they gaining some kind of unfair advantage over everyone else, the means to do so are available to anyone and everyone.
---
If anything, it's a disadvantage. Any multiboxers would tell you that they would rather have 4 other actual players of equal skill to them than operate a solo 5man group.
---
This is appearently know that obvious of a realization. We should all learn from that.
---
I love it how the things you do in this game really have consequences. Achievements are so much more worth if you really have to try for it!
---
The point he's making is that multi boxing sound be as well. So I don't think he needs to try again.
---
Just use autocarrot classic addon

I hope you're right, I'm loving my warrior but I don't wanna be constantly left out cuz I picked the fotm class.

There is a way to appear offline to your battle net friends.  Scroll down all of your friends list and see if they are there, just offline. Then you can remove them.

Auctionator is a great addon imo. It just makes deciding how much to sell something a little easier (like auto-undercutting 5% of the current sale rate others are asking for which makes your item more likely to be bought). Always make sure you look at what the vendor cost is in addition to the AH cut and sell it for more. Once you play the game a little more you'll start to understand the value of items. A major one I learned the hard way because I didn't have anyone to tell me about it was that item titles that are greyed out should be sold to a vendor because players can't make use of them in-game. Nobody will buy them in AH. Only items that have colored titles are worth anything and at that point you just have to pay attention to what other similar things in AH are going for.
---
When they say ranged dps only they actually mean mages and warlocks because the warriors don't want to share any gear.
---
That's going to end well.

If you're not 60 by now and claiming to be good....

An MMO mouse with 12 thumb buttons is definitely worthwhile.  I could never go back to a regular mouse after using one for so many years.  However, I much prefer the g600 to the naga.  It's pretty cheap these days too.  You can get one for like $40.

Allll of this. I got to the barrens on a mage in retail just before Classic was officially released and it was just BORING. Call me crazy, but I did not like feeling super OP in retail! Mana bar? LOL what‚Äôs that? Maybe I played the wrong class. But I felt like I was waltzing through the game as this OP hero already instead of just a lowly adventurer slowly carving out a place and trying to become more powerful. It‚Äôs fun to be challenged! It doesn‚Äôt have to be a walk in the park.
---
Being lethargic and ordering take out every night cause your too busy gaming isn't pro in anyone's book lol. You need to gitgud

That's not true.  The farclip is set by default to 350, and your view distance is not automatically at max either.  I believe I gave the wrong cvar for view distance.  It should be horizonFarClip instead, I believe.

Hunter item

I mean that probably takes at least 2 days /played. That‚Äôs over an hour a day since release.

Clear sarcasm
---
They are absolutely terrible and anyone screaming "nO cHaNgEs" is just fine with the fact that there are absolutely 100% dead wasted specs in game and that's pretty retarded.  Wasn't good when vanilla was live and isn't good now.
---
i know that feel. By that time, respawn must have been behind you so a corpse run would likely lead to breaking of the group.
---
Auctioneer would show almost exactly as his does when I used it. I use TSM now though, so it could show differently.

In dreams is the worst designed quest in the entirety of vanilla change my mind. The devs who worked on it obviously only playtested it on an empty testserver without any competition/enemy factions.
---
Hunter is literally 1 talent point away from being perfect. If you had just 1 more talent point, you could do Intimidation/Scatter Shot/Beast Wrath. I respeccd a few times and the class just feels totally incomplete without both intimidation and scatter shot. You don't survive with just one in-combat stun.
---
I feel like the engineering net should be a hunter skill. All the mobs that are hunters use a net. It just makes sense.

2 it seems to be an add-on/macro that sends "welcome to the party [player name] [class] whenever someone joins, although idk y U would want that on a NA? server
---
Oh yes.. I had a similar thing in SM Cath. 1 Warri, 1 Mage, 1 Druid Heal (me), 1 Rouge and 1 Hunter.  
---
Our warri did the same whirlwind crap everytime pulling 2 groups together.  
---
I had to heal the warrior continuously with my best healing spell so he wouldn't die.   
---
Sometimes the mage got aggro and I wasn't able to heal both because the warrior did to much damage.  
---
The Warrior and the Mage always said I am to stupid to heal. Idk if this was a joke or these 2 guys are just stupid.  
---
I mean yes.. This is a good thing if you have an AOE-farm group with 3 mages 1 heal and the warrior but this was actually crap..  
---
In the end of the day I run the same dungeon with an usual Paladin Tank and we were 2x faster through.
---
The cvar for farclip actually doesn't have a cap, but it's recommended not to go above 1300 because it could cause the game to crash.
---
The very first expansion is what wrecked the community. There were multiple features but the stand out feature was an all new full service capitol. Shat should have been an overblown quest hub with expansion specific profession trainers at most. 
---
Instead it was a complete replacement with trainers, auction houses, portals, and more. Hence the community fragmented between those with access to it and those who did not have it.  Since you had bank, auction house, and profession trainers, you did not need to go back among the people still working their way up.
---
   
---
This was further cemented with each following expansion which obsoleted the previous capitols. LFD/LFG came along later because Blizzard had so fractured the community there was no agreed upon place to meet up.  So they had to step in.
---
to be frank, if Blizzard merely replays each expansion going forward there is no reason for many to continue playing beyond classic

---
So I just recently got Sweeping Strikes and I've been playing around with it, can someone explain to me the general mechanics of it?
---
In general the idea seems to be that the extra hit does the same damage as my normal attack (even if it's an ability that triggers it), but it's treated as a *special* attack.  I've noticed the latter because while fighting higher level mobs my normal attack damage was reduced as a glancing hit but my SS hit seemed to do normal damage without any kind of glancing hit penalty.

Hi. I'm a lvl38 tank warrior, and have a question regarding gear. I've been prioritizing items that give stamina + strength/agility bonuses so far, and had good results with them. However, when I get to lv40 and learn to wear plate armor, I have the optin to change some of those gear pieces with the ones I can craft via blacksmithing, mainly the heavy mithril ones. Now, these items would give me a huge armor and stamina bonus over my current ones, but none of them give me any stat that is not stamina. No strength, no agility.
---
So, my question is: is it worth it to lose all strength and agility in favor of more armor and stamina? Would I lose too much damage/blocking by doing so? Not that I mind doing big damage, but I need some to hold aggro easier, so a bit hesitant on this one.
---
Can link my items for comparison if needed.

I think it‚Äôs approx 360 hours

Friday night I was questing in STV and just ran around helping any horde I saw (I'm alliance to be clear).  
---
Well, I was fighting basilisks and one stunned me...a rogue and I that became friendly in our travels came over and just auto attacked me once to try and break me out of it.
---
It was the most tender thing I've ever seen an undead rogue do.
---
I mean, they could have an RPing paladin? Also I was very tired when I wrote that have
---
It only counts as trolling if someone other than OP is laughing.
---
Tough but fair.
---
‚Äîan alliance player
---
I mean I play my main as a warlock and do AoE runs with mages and other warlocks. So I‚Äôm sorry, but you‚Äôre wrong. The DPS the dots generate is very high, Dot first, then AoE. And your damage will always outweigh a mages.
---
You don‚Äôt have to do the full dot cycle. 
---
Sometimes even just throwing only corruptions if things are moving quickly will still net more damage gains.
---
If they end up needing to combine layeirng and sharding so the world is layered and world bosses are sharded to a single server I'm going to love the forum drama.
---
Claiming that anything doesn't have any potential to be improved is some mega boomer shit.
---
What are you talking about? When did I say PVP guilds cant be serious at PVP? You're strawmanning pretty hard. I've only said that the majority of players on PVE servers are Alliance. Why are you so mad about that?
---
I always assumed they were different people who did that
---
I updated the post.
---
Im not asking if you think its an exploit or not (it is and blizzard has taken action against other players for using similar exploits).
---
Im just asking how to submit screenshots.

Been running dungeons and it seems like the only tanks we can find are druids. Literally told the healer to just heal me because none of the druid tanks would be able to hold aggro. Not even their fault :(

OP I'm gonna help you out, everyone here is steering you in the wrong direction

[Try this spec](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/mage/250005030003--053532030022503), it won't work fantastic until higher levels but I guarantee you won't be drinking as much because youll crit all the time.
---
Yes you don't get Ice Block or Ice barrier, but this is the damage dealing spec. You will crit so often it will feel like the norm. Up to you, but if you want less downtime this is the spec. I only had to drink once every 4 minutes, and you can use evocation every 8 min.
---
&gt;But remember a mage if they really wanted to can **double blink** to you
---
Pretty much every hunter has the +6 max range talent, it's mandatory for pvp and for pve its quite handy too. So an agressive hunter can attack you from way further than you can even attack him. With the talent, scatter shot has a 21 yard range, so as soon as you get close enough you will eat that scatter, and you won't get another opportunity to get this close again. 
---
Sure, bombs/rng stuns can turn the tide of this battle, but that's the gist of it in my experience.
---
If I really wanna fuck with a mage I'll simply outrange him at 41 yards and just viper sting him until he's too low on mana to even do anything. Hunters are a mage's worst nightmare my friend.
---
They definitely have people reading reddit, though perhaps not the questions megathread.
---
Human Archmage, starts with mount and long beard
---
Why do people get so worked up about this? I was leveling my alt the other day and a group of alliance 60s came through Southshore and killed me and my hordie buddies on sight. For 20 minutes it was rez, die, rez, die, rez, die. You know what I did? I just logged over to my other character and played him for a while. It's just a game. Let them have their power trip and move on.
---
isnt there a melee cleave group that actually uses cleave? Probably just built from that.   
---
Its like how everything is a WTF(gate) so annoying.
---
Why use WSM over what im using now, Auctioneer?

Or maybe they are entitled shits and someone who owes good things for the community shouldn‚Äôt be held responsible for their behavior.

https://classicwow.live/guides/670/ozgar-s-downranking-guide-tool
---
Casting a spell that is below level 20 incurs a significant penalty to the coefficient of the spell. This was introduced during Vanilla WoW in order to counter the unforeseen power of downranking spells a lot. The formula for this is:
---
That might be the problem then, most of the Alterac Mountains stuff is higher than 32. What other zones have you done ? Desolace, STV, Arathi, and Thousand Needles if you're horde will all have a lot of quests around your level.
---
Lmao, half of the comments you leave on this subreddit are you calling it a circlejerk
---
japanese has loopy/swirly/circular looking characters interspersed, chinese is all blocky and mostly straight lines
---
Yeah but Improved health 2/2 and Improved Healthstone 1/2 and Healthstone all count as different itesm (because they are) so tanks and at risk classes can have 2 or more healthstones in case of emergencies.
---
Go to Hillsbrad ;) you surely won‚Äôt get counter ganked by the bored high levels chilling there
---
Jesus, what a bunch of bitter ass people in this thread.
---
Warriors were always popular, it's just that hardly any of them tank. Same again now. Druids are absolutely the least played class, mostly because everyone knows they're the worst healers/ranged and melee requires crazy dedication to be any good. You'll probably see a lot more come WSG though.
---
At level 60 I feel like I should have named my cat ‚Äúbankrupt‚Äù
---
Filthy.
---
I love it.
---
In thousand needles all horde were 28-34
---
Probably not a big enough upgrade to go through the quest chain for. We carried a 55 mage through BRD with a full 60 group and he misread the Scepter and rolled need, hopefully you have a literate group when you get it.
---
It also took a while after the Bloodthirst rework in 1.4? or so for Fury's meme reputation to fade, for the first few patches pretty much every Warrior was specced Arms or Prot.
---
Could you level his character for him?
---
What server are you on my dude?

it's very much against the rules and you'll get your account banned.

---
r/lostredditors
---
Hey, thanks for answering! I was wondering if you had any keyboard layout for priest to suggest... I am struggling to figure out an efficient way to do down-rank healing. 
---
I was thinking about doing something like: 
---
1: GHeal - Rank 5
---
Shift-1: GHeal - Rank 2
---
Alt-1: Gheal - Rank 1
---
etc...
---
It's too late for us, we're so far behind now.

In January of 2018 jake Paul went into a forest in japan that‚Äôs a common place for people to kill them selves. Then he filmed a dead body hanging from a tree and uploaded it to YouTube as part of his vlog.

Throw me the name in a PM when you've done it and i'll do it. I'm just sat at my desk @work lol.
---
its still basically all hunters
---
Bruh wait till you see 4K needles

I find warlocks so easy to kill as a hunter, ofc the ones I've killed might have just been bad, but as BM my pet almost does it solo.
---
Hey guys, this is the third of many weapons I have been testing for proc rates and other fun stuff. With a 1.4 PPM (7% chance-on-hit), the Meteor Shard's unique proc is a relatively rare sight on the battlefield, but consistent nonetheless.
---
If anyone comes up with proc data on the various unique weapons and armor throughout WoW Classic, feel free to pitch in a screenshot or two so we can finally learn the true capabilities of these rare items! I'll be making many more of these videos to come.
---
My goal has always been to get to 60, completing quests as I go, and then to grind out the final instances for all gear I want. Not this BiS bullshit, but the dungeon set and other items that are good. After that, I‚Äôll level maybe an alt or just do PvP. I‚Äôm waiting for the people who are okay taking their time to get to 60. It‚Äôs far more sustainable - especially since anyone hopping guilds to 60 won‚Äôt stay around anyway.
---
My wife picked Human Warrior too but she never even listened to the rest of the options the first thing I said was you can be a human and they can be warriors and they ahe said yeah that 1 lo good for you guys! Gratzl

So you're saying that you and your five friends are an equal match for a multi boxer and the multi boxer's five friends totalling 30 accounts? I get what you're saying but they're really not comparable.

I didn't know an mmo could look worse than runescape
---
If your plan is just to tank, strength isn't hugely important. You don't get all that much extra threat from strength.
---
And you have a nice day too sir. 
---
Also sorry for insults - I get very personal in discussions xD Don't take offense please
---
Not saying I aint doing it again :p
---
*not playing wow after all the best stuff was added*
---
10 million people would like to have a word with you.
---
I just hit 60. I am unable to do so now as my job starts back up essentially in mid October and I have substantially less time now.
---
You picked the class, you picked the repercussions. 
---
I give my group healers 120 waters and 40 food. Unprompted. But if you're a random messaging me? Idgaf how tough your leveling situation is as x-class,  that was a choice you made.
---
I thought the trinket was just a free voidwalker summon, not instant? I could be wrong, not too sure myself but if it‚Äôs the one I‚Äôm thinking of I‚Äôm pretty sure I read the comments on the item and people basically said it‚Äôs essentially just good if you run out of shards because it‚Äôs just a free casted summon
---
It was only changed once and it was long before flying mounts.
---
Unless you have patch notes for your version or even a credible source.. your mistaken.
---
Looks nice! How does this work? can you start the game while home, then play the game on the buss? I mean, is this on wifi only, or can it use 4g?
---
I am still currently using a 2014 razor naga. Perfect condition. When/if this one breaks I‚Äôll buy a new one.
---
Really central position. Way closer to all the endgame content than SW. Really close to menethil and so to a connection to kalimdore.
---
City layout is probably the best of all city with the inner ring especially after you notice one side is for secondary professions and the other one for primary professions
---
oh
---
But....you‚Äôre literally in horde territory lol if anything that‚Äôs where you should be getting ganked in sight.
---
It is Blizzard‚Äôs fault for making horde so cool
---
RMT so against the ToS
---
But yea there are probably gold selling site that offer leveling services, probably expensive to pay for and possibility of getting banned.

the fucking bloom is obscene in night elf areas and even in retail it makes it so that night elf faces look wonky because all the detail is obscured by the blinding light of their eyes
---
&gt; +125 Healing spells.
---
&gt; +20 mp5
---
&gt; +2% spell crit.
---
Crit is borderline useless, you can't rely on crit when healing, so it'll most go into overhealing, unless you're a paladin and this is not the case.
---
The alternatives come with the following as green text on the pieces:
---
+Healing: 388
---
mp5: 9
---
more than 3 times the bonus healing. It's silly.
---
I love that as a paladin :D
---
Well Blizzard admitted their mistake and OP got unbanned. So, good job internet detective.
---
Having to stop to auto makes it feel so much more technical and rewards positioning. I think it‚Äôs a great design decision to make you stop for a ranged auto attack, same thing in mobas.
---
Well in this case they're not sheeping /s

I'm going to play Alliance and am looking for a balanced Horde / Alliance PVP server on NA.

Last I checked, Anathema is an anomaly of a PvP server with heavier alliance pop atm, could try there since it'll likely even out over time.

Thunderfury seems pretty balanced, it's high pop but there isn't ever a queue.

Biggest issue with it for me, is that it came out during WoD as a major content patch. Even tho there really was no content
---
We hadn't played together before and all my friends from vanilla and retail are on other servers but I talk to these people every day. Make the best of it!
---
make the plate gear, but keep your mail stuff too.  Your Str/Agi, as you understand, is imperative to producing threat.  Your armor/stam is important for your survivability.  You're going to need to adjust which gear you're wearing based on your groups capabilities.  If your healer isnt great, and your DPS isnt either, put on your plate with stam only.  If your healer is fantastic, use your higher str/agi stuff.  Chances are great that you're going to wear a mish-mash set until 55+ and even then there might still be a piece or two of mail armor in there.  It's also nice to have spare gear as a tank if some of your stuff breaks.  Warriors are always running around with a DPS set and a tank set in their bags anyways.
---
And what about the bonus it gives to the amount of damage I can block? Is it meaningful?
---
It's very much against the rules and you'll be banned if caught, but yeah, there are tons of services out there you can pay for. No idea how cheap they are but I imagine a lawyer won't care. 
---
If you wanted to do it totally legit you could pay tanks of his level in-game money to stay with him and dungeon farm, I guess.
---
Bigglesworth ist pretty good imo
---
They're not going in opposite directions? They're all doing the exact same turns. The software (AHK or specialized one) simply replicates keypresses to all windows, which is specifically allowed by their terms (one keypress = one action per client).

The hyperbole is strong in you. Please show me a screenshot of 5 people multi-boxing 5 accounts each. Shit if you can find a screenshot of 4 multi-boxers equaling 20 accounts I'll be impressed.
---
I kinda highly doubt that's even close to true.  At some point your close buttons on the keyboard and modifiers are all filled up, having a few thumb buttons is very useful.
---
In blizzard gamed it usually does which is absurd btw. In hots for instance every time i reported someone i had to unblock them. Thanks for trying to make decision for me blizzard but just because i reported someone doesnt mean i want them blocked. Im not 12.
---
I just hit lvl 32.
---
I'm the healer so they generally have to.
---
I've seen one tank bail but most are just like "oh, yeah, sure".
---
Im level 52 i work 40 hr weeks , if you feel like you are having slow progress just look up a leveling guide for your class. Personally i ran sm from 30-42 and zf 44-50.
---
If you also don't manually logout that's another 30~ mins every single time you log in. I have probably 2-3 days play time of me not even sitting at my computer.
---
This is a hilarious post. Dogshit? I play druid and i get invites as rank or healer - whichever i prefer at the time. Get compliments all the time for my healing. Try not playing with bad druids.
---
&gt; Everyone wanted to be uber famous like Vurtne/Cachexic/Saerdna/Faxmonkey/Unknown (Pathologist)/Pigvomit/Gegon/Clazzi/etc.
---
I mean if you look at every single "WHAT CLASS TO PICK" it's one if not the most talked about, it's also concidered one of the better class for leveling / Raiding
---
Because you all automatically assume that gold is a greater need than the item itself. It is an incorrect assumption (as most assumptions are based on incomplete information). 
---
I will always stand by this is an incorrect usage of the system. Because well, it absolutely is.
---
Warriors generate threat every time they generate rage, so it's very important that you use Bloodrage *after* you've pulledm that'll make everything stick to you better. 
---
You can also make mouseover macros for stuff like taunt, so you don't have to target switch to taunt.
---
I tried to do a full run of ZF for days but before I could find a group I‚Äôd be invited to aoe farm. Sorry to burst your bubble.
---
Ohh, so if you "block" some damage still goes through? 
---
I always thought that if you "blocked" then you block 100% of the damage....the more you know.
---
Very counterintuitive, and I suggest OP redo the graphs with proper axis.
---
That's only if you get a block. What you're describing is more similar to armor, which gives a static damage decrease to damage you take. It's the real reason tanks are "tanky", because we all have 6k-7k armor, so the damage we take is reduced by a pretty decent amount. 
---
I don't remember exact armor numbers, but I'm right around 6k armor at level 54, which reduces my damage taken from level 54 enemies by 54.1%.
---
You cant force to equip but if you needed and didnt equip bet your ass I wouldnt roll a dungeon with you again.   
---
Unless everyone agrees to roll the need - if you are rolling need on something youre just gonna sell its effectively ninja looting. Why not just roll need on everything all the time why's it gotta be an epic?
---
It's a great game but it's not perfect. That said, I've never seen anyone asking for level boosts, tokens, or flying. Like, literally nobody, and I spend way too much time on this subreddit.
---
No problems on my Hunter :)
---
Yes. I was clearly kidding with the rp paladin line üôÑ
---
Yeah, I definitely understand now. I‚Äôve played this game for years, and I always thought that kiting to cities only worked on world bosses, for some reason. Like they had some mechanic that would keep you from just running away when you pull them. Didn‚Äôt know any mob in the game can be kited forever. Never played hunter much, lol.
---
We've had 2 or 3 go off and as long as people are at full HP there are maybe 1 or 2 deaths tops.
---
Can agree with this as a hunter. Just got to 60 a few days ago. I know its early and a lot of peeps still arent 60 but its nearly impossible to find a group cause these greedy ass warriors wont take anyone that can compete for gear. Bout to reroll a priest.
---
Nice hint here guys, don't play while drunk, seriously
---
I took it (3/3) and I still have it, so it can't be the difference maker.
---
Improved raptor strike + mongoose bite! Idk if those talents would carry far enough for hunter to stay viable in melee. But then again, those locks were tanking with just drain life spam pretty much.
---
Yea that‚Äôs prob the best way I went 10 runs without getting one before giving up to try again later.
---
Benediction, it feels perfectly balanced. Check the wow classic forums to the many people saying the same. Good luck
---
Do you get your lovin on the run?
---
Hunter would need to be (preferably orc for 5% damage pet racial) full blown beast mastery and stack Resto shammy gear for spamming mend pet.
---
A shaman would just need really good gear and 5/5 shield spec. Preferably a lot of points in elemental instead of enhance for more threat so dps can actually nuke to kill the boss as soon as possible.
---
How are mages broken?
---
see THAT is a logical argument but it should probably be discussed before hand. I would treat it like any other loot and assume people needing it were ninjaing it unless stated otherwise.
---
Imagine thinking I said accepting a party invite means you‚Äôll get hacked. Good try, but you just look like a tool.
---
I was thinking Axe too.... just because I like to see those big crit numbers!
---
Literally all the locks in our raid including myself do SM/Ruin. The stam buff is just worth more than 5% additional individual lock damage for us. Also open world stuff is easier since were not at the gear point of 2 sbolting all mobs.
---
One thing you have to keep in mind is that without transmog, a lot of those "cool" looking items that aren't really useful outside of how they look won't necessarily be big money makers. You're really going to have to depend on finding one of those collectors. It'll have an inflated value sure, but it might take a long time for that specific buyer who really wants it. Better if you're on an RP server.
---
imagine not only paying for a video game but then paying again to have someone play it for you lol
---
Does the mount require Darnassus exalted as well? Or just Wintersaber Exalted?
---
Seems like you learned something. You can call today a good day.
---
Because there are more healer specific trinkets than DPS specific trinkets.
---
I was 55 last night doing it and can report that it did not give me XP
---
You could just save a ton of time/gold and skip it, go grab Corpsemaker from RFK and then replace that with Ravager from Herod. There‚Äôs no point in spending something like 10+ gold just to have a weapon that‚Äôll last you seven levels.
---
Revenge is the bread and butter of keeping aggro. Sunder is only second to that.
---
I have a few questions:
---
- Is multiboxing against terms of service?
---
- Does it require multiple accounts?
---
- What program is used?
---
The AH is in a screwy place in Classic. It's not impossible to make money off of it, but it's substantially more difficult than it was in Vanilla because the prices are really depressed for the most part.
---
I have similar retail xp. I think a key factor in all this is graveyard distance. Having a long run back really adds to the danger. Wiping is very punishing time wise.  In m+ not only is there no ghost run, sometimes there are checkpoints where you spawn halfway through the dungeon. Imagine the m+ scene if there was none of that, and you had to run from the 1 graveyard in the zone like 7 minutes away. I would love that.
---
Ah, just saw the black dragons and assumed
---
warcraft taverns horde leveling guide is the tops. Typically killing things 1-2 levels lower, but the xp dropoff is minimal. Very efficient guide, but you have to follow it to a T
---
Once again, your ganking a mage if your engaging at 41 yards. And you don't want to engage at 41 yards anyway. 
---
Double blink, they have an ability to reset cooldowns. And if they are in your dead zone their is literally nothing you can do. 
---
Vipersting doesn't really have the intended affect with mages as it does with other casters. This fight isn't a long drawn out fight, it's a burst fight. Would take 5 viper stings or 40 seconds to drain a mages mana. Assuming they don't have a mana gem to use. Your better of with serpent sting trying to kill him before he takes control of the fight in your deadzone.
---
Unless your a hunter actively hunting for pvp no fight is going to start at 41 yards unless you engage. And even if you do at that range, a smart mage will blink out of your range, mount up run, then come back at you closing the range distance very fast. Remember shots take time to hit and at max range that's half the time it takes to mount up.... 
---
They will come back at high speeds, Blink into your dead zone and nova you and your pet. Sure scatter shot the mage, which immediately gets countered by iceblock. Then they will either polly you, if you have fd'd already or your pet. With your pet out of the picture they can just keep you slowed and run around laughing as they kill you..... If they polly you, they kill your pet then reapply sheep and drink/eat to full. Then kill you in your dead zone.
---
Mate if your killing mages its cause your taking them by surprise at 35 yards and dealing massive damage while your pet closed the distance with sprint as you aimed shot.  Otherwise mage will either blink to you and kill you, or blink away and come back on his terms and kill you.
---
Only way a hunter beats a mage is by ganking Or a big skill difference. On equal playing fields, a hunter should not kill a mage. Rare cases of hunter wins are things like lucky concussion shots or resists of ice nova.
---
There are 2 items hunters can have equipped to break sheep/root, that will turn the tide but that means having 2 pieces of gear equipped at all times just to fight mages. And unless your in a BG or know your going to be engaging a mage, your not going to have them equipped.
---
Yeah, I know what the word means. But /u/Wiplazh seems to be noticing how the word "hyper" is particular fitting here. And I am not aware of any particular definition of "hyper" that fits this word well.
---
logged in from my boomer 40hr/week office job just to downvote this :)
---
Yes in both cases, unless you have the epic mount.
---
Not sure about the distance thing, can't seem to find any maps or anything showing that. I would say pick a long-range spell and see how far away from a mob you can stand, that should give you some sense of how far  you can run without bothering to mount up.
---
Imagine thinking that leveling is monotonous, time consuming, and not nearly as fun as raiding lol.
---
Then imagine being on a lawyer salary and $500 doesn't matter much to be able to play with your buddies.
---
If you don‚Äôt jump into an instance you‚Äôre a bot
---
Just because of all the others? You can still go a non aoe high crit frost spec in classic
---
I'm on Benediction, last time I checked a census website we were something like 51/49 in favor of the Alliance. However, at the time, the average level was higher for Horde players than Alliance, so if you were 30+ it would feel skewed towards the Horde. I believe that's still true, but since we're all higher level it would really only affect you if you're 50+. The huge wave of players levelling up in the 30s/40s right now are pretty even between the factions.
---
Hunter pet tank withstacking stacking resto sham gear for mend pet.
---
There is a great staff in there that never drops so it's quite possible to still be farming it at 50.  Also it can be hard to find groups as dps or perhaps he missed the ST hakkar chain tablet part and was trying to get it done(I ran ST like 4 times and then finally started questing in Feralas at like 52 and was like whoops...)
---
We've been in our new place for 2 months, now. If we don't know where we want it, into the basement it goes.
---
The chance to get dazed while mounted is about 100% ...
---
I get the feeling they don‚Äôt learn, they just find out who can be their heal bitch
---
Unless you want to super min max your character. You'll be fine.
---
Yup.
---
ty for actually answering the question
---
I'm on pagle and it's pve but it's 75/25 alliance to horde. I'm horde üò¨
---
1. Avoid them
---
2. Gank them when they're busy
---
3. Party up with a Dwarf Priest (or any Priest or Paladin)
---
4. Kick the Warlock's fear, or try to anticipate the aoe fear and juke it
---
5. Reroll on a PvE server
---
don't make a mage if ur not ok with being spammed for food/portals
---
only gets worse when dire maul comes out
---
How about undead rogues?
---
i got one and decided to hold on to it till phase 3 cause the AH fees will just eat away your profit if you put it up and no one bids. I have seen a handful of them from other players. no real market for twinks right now. everyone is saving for mounts
---
oh yeah that'll do it
---
Yeah its quite good. I get pretty damn annoyed by people who don't understand itemization for hunter. They see something with int and spirit and str and say "O thats good for me!" Or a high dps two hander. Literally all by you gotta prioritize for hunter is agi and then stam.
---
&gt;The worst thing about retail aside from the lack of story
---
WTF?!
---
lack of story are you fucking kidding me?
---
BfA have more story than classic + tbc had combined.
---
&gt; mobile/gacha style mechanics
---
yea if you play like the biggest casual and don't raid, rbg, myth+ and so on.
---
&gt; On top of that you have to rely on sheer luck to get a titanforge and socket. Didn't win? Insert 13‚Ç¨ and try again next month! 
---
I can say the exact same to classic loot system.
---
40 ppl and only \~3 items per boss makes perfectly sense! /s
---
I remember in Cata when my raid would /roll 50000 and the lowest roll would pay the highest the difference
---
Fun times
---
&gt; Suddenly I was an asshole for charging money for helping someone questing...
---
yeah
---
Exactly, my issue is dropping an ultimatum and trying to reserve loot as the raids about to start.  I dont care if he rolled.  The Raid leader was just pissed off all around at the guy for dropping an ultimatum at the last minute.
---
So what is, say, the distance mailbox - auction house in OG for reference?
---
BRD still more fun than the entirety of the War Campaign in retail.
---
I am a druid with cooking/fishing. Every time a mage gives me water I give him or her a couple food buffs in return.
---
Start with simple macros, and over time you'll get better at making them.
---
upgrades arent noticeable at all. if you actually look at how your stats change with gear, its basically nothing. getting a new item with 10 more strength then your old one barely increases your damage. you can look at your stats page and it might go up by like 1 dps. if you get something with 10 more stam, thats only 100 health which is nothing when you have 4000. getting 10 extra spirit increases your mana regen by like 0.2 per second. you will never notice any of these stat changes
---
Shaman lacks the beefy healthpool of the bear, and significantly lacks protection compared to warrior (no crush protection, no platemail). The lack of taunt is pretty crippling for dungeon tanking, but matters less in raids since so many bosses are taunt immune.
---
It's not impossible, it's just significantly less viable.
---
Better to have skepticism that be a typical gullible reddit droid that believes everything they see.
---
People are trying to help you not waste your time, it would've been quicker if you just responded in the first place.
---
So he's abusing one of the goblin safe spots presumably? Then it's definitely an exploit and you don't need a screenshot. Blizz will be able to tell if he was in that spot, they record *a lot* of data. Just get more people to report him. It's probably gonna take a while because they cut back GM staff for Classic.
---
The ultimatum was the problem.
---
Does your roll in that dungeon matter though? Like if you are specced ENH DPS but a group invites you to heal them cuz they can't find a healer that doesnt suddenly mean you're only looking for healer gear?  
---
I feel like it should go against your current build / gear as reference.
---
Entrepreneur vs grunt
---
One man values time, one man values money.
---
Recklessness will only make the priest impossible to kill, unless the shield bug was fixed.
---
Blink just shifts the run line over 20 yards so I think you just add the distance you blink (20y) to that number.  So now it's 68/85 yards.  Maybe?
---
disturbing, to say the least
---
Because we can make sweeping statements about people's playstyles based on whether they clicked the red button or the blue button in the character creation screen.
---
Because the addon simply takes the errors as an input and outputs what needs to happen. Mounted? Unmounts you. Sitting? Makes you stand. Includes talking to flight masters, and is one easy install.
---
Don't get me wrong I gladly take a rogue or two, especially as I usually have a shaman healer with me. Rogues bring good damage and little downtime.
---
Well you aren't getting ruin or demonic sac at level 40. I wouldn't run dark pact at 60, but it's extremely good in my opinion while leveling. It's essentially a free ~100 Mana per 5, even while casting, as I used it once or twice while moving between mobs. Drain tank has very high efficiency, but you do eventually have to eat or bandage, and dark pact reduces that even further for the cost of a single point while leveling. I rarely shadow bolt, so destro tree is not very good in general, and most of the other single points in affliction or demo aren't as good at that point.
---
&gt;re-release the shit that destroyed the game in the first place is what doesn't make sense to me
---
i mean, you didn't
---
Interesting observation.
---
&gt; Because well, it absolutely is.
---
In your opinion, which carries no greater weight then anyone elses.
---
It‚Äôs wing clip, not hamstring.
---
I've tried reckoning but it's underwhelming when people hardly have any crit chance. I've also noticed most people avoid fights anyway so I went full tank spec.
---
I did respec out of consecration into blessing of sanctuary, but it felt very lacking in terms of threat.
---
DnB to get hyped up and the kill train rolling
---
Searing Pain for Warlocks "generates a large amount of threat."
---
Hunters have Distracting Shot, which you can use less often, and only at range.
---
The real issue is that once the target closes to melee range, a Hunter's melee DPS is just so bad that it won't hold aggro over anything, ever.
---
Ok, great.
---
Ah dude 4 strength 4 agility 4 stam 4 intellect 4 spirit neck? Level 30?... ahhh uhhh
---
That was definitely not how it used to be, there are either less rogues or more priests, or both.
---
It was probably something like 5:3 or 3:2 on Rogues:Priests in Vanilla originally.
---
There are definitely less Rogues, more Mages, more Warlocks (I think!), less Hunters and although they are still the most popular class, probably less Warriors too.
---
You have to type ‚Äú/carepackage appear‚Äù
---
The post is only for vocal sounds :) should've generalized to all audible sounds cuz /golfclap is a favorite of mine.
---
There are a lot more than bwl onyx and mc. You have ZG, both AQs, battlegrounds, gear from reps. Naxx was the last raid to come out in vanilla.
---
was that the same case for org? i cant recall
---
READY THE ROHIRRIM!
---
do you think - whenever it may be, be it half a year or a year- when a servers populations drop drastically and was already low and just gets lower, those in them will get a free transfer to one of the more populated servers? Or will they eventually just add paid transfers to the store?
---
You might want to check out stormx, he's probably the streamer that has been running that build and it's variations the longest.  His discord, has links for resources you want.
---
Basically, you stat priority changes to Int being most important stat followed by stam, Your going to shift a ton, your going to hot and run, It's super mana intensive, you need a big mana pool to spam your travel form dust macro, to  cross mid while ditching all the novas, frost bolts, ham strings, etc.
---
Don't lvl in STV?
---
alliance or horde
---
Sure but you're probably looking at something in phase 3 or 4. Which at that point you have full Dire maul gear and are starting to get BWL stuff. 
---
The pre raid BIS is exactly for pre raid and if you can get a full set in MC in phase 1 youre gonna go full earth fury. 
---
Plus good resto shaman are gonna carry lots of mp5/healing gear and swap it around based on fights
---
Weapons are not normalized, attack power is.
---
Lets compare the aimed shot for 2 hypothetical 40 dps weapons, one with 2.0 attack speed and one with 3.0 while having 1000 ap.
---
For the first one the damage average formula would be
---
(40 + 13) * 2.0 + 1000 / 14 * 2.8 + 600 = 906
---
For the second one the average damage would be:
---
(40 + 13) * 3.0 + 1000 / 14 * 2.8 + 600 = 969
---
So the slower weapon will deal more damage and that's ignoring the fact the faster weapon will lose more auto shot damage due to clipping than the slower one will.
---
Heartseekers Ironforge the past few days have been INSANE. Like Nost numbers insane.
---
Can the OP or someone who has actually completed this grind in classic confirm whether this also requires darnassus exalted rep? Because according to wowhead comments it required darn rep in vanilla, did not require darn rep in tbc, but there are zero comments on the matter from 1.12 so I'm not sure if the change came in 1.12 or tbc. And regardless if it was changed in 1.12 it might still require the rep in classic... please confirm!
---
Damn, nice job!! I also work full time, have no kids, fiance who also plays games so we play A LOT, had a full week off last week, just hit level 47 last night with 85g. You put me to shame!
---
The failure of reading comprehension in this thread is appalling. This is what the brain looks like on 4 hours of sleep for a month.
---
Do good posts remove the god awful camera videos and pictures?
---
Do you have the talent that turns spirit into spell power?
---
4. You lose less damage from movement.
---
I am loving Classic. It's the game I fell in love with 15 years ago. I couldn't really get into the modern game and I assumed it was because "I'm getting older, I don't care about games anymore."
---
To an extent that's true, but I've been playing Classic relatively hardcore for weeks now and I'm still itching for more.
---
Never too late! :)
---
Holy fuck who would upvote this abomination of a graph.
---
Please delete this and consult your math teacher.
---
&gt;the highest available at the moment
---
You mean the fastest. I consider high attack speed as slow.
---
I too love the in-game music, it adds to the nostalgia for me. I had it on loop for the first few hours, but that does become a tad boring sometimes.
---
Now do it with 100% mounts
---
This graph is unreadable. Awful data presentation
---
And this is where another advantage of a night elf comes in, ride the boat and just hide with shadowmeld. (but in my defense I am planning to build the engi mind control cap to troll lolz).
---
Why would I care how big my country is?  
---
I prefer the metric system because it is logic.
---
Casters tend to like whale, owl or eagle, melee bear and monkey. Rest is mostly junk.
---
I'm 33 on my rogue and just bought my max herb and skinning skills. and now I'm at 29g or so.
---
For some reason compaired how I did when I played in old WoW back in the day I'm sucking at making money.
---
I'm thinking skinning was a mistake and I should have don't minning/herb
---
It's pretty common for someone to ask that question because they have someone interested in tanking if the group isn't waiting on another tank to join.
---
&gt;welcome to being blocked!
---
Blocking someone for pointing out that you're behaving childishly is, well, even more childish.
---
How is this different from rolling need on a BoE then equipping it? If it was something you genuinely *need* then why hadn't you already bought it off the AH?
---
No, and it's not close. In retail, threat is exclusively the tanks job because it's especially easy to hold unless you're not making any effort to, and the challenge comes instead from mitigation.
---
In classic, threat management is everyone's role, the tank makes as much as they can, while dps ride the line of maintaining as high dps as they can without overstepping the line and pulling.
---
I don‚Äôt think they will ever get it. None have ever presented a decent argument for their support and hell the meaning of the two words even prove they are wrong. But holy hell they‚Äôll never give up being wrong.
---
cat

This is awesome! I always wanted this full set in phase 1. How does the 8/8 work? Is it more viable then chain heal??
---
Pan over to the 30 images chain casting flamestrike.
---
"What? This is how we make our money. Leave us alone."
---
If you were to actually read my comments you would already have realised I have no problem with you or anyone else disliking that design decision of turning survival into a melee spec, but I do have a problem with you calling it an aborted fetus spec or whatever while you are completely clueless about how the spec plays, what kind of abilities/rotation it has, etc. 
---
As i said before you're talking out of your ass about a spec you don't know.
---
Don't like melee? Don't play it then, but hold of your judgements on the quality of a spec if you've not even for a single second tried to figure out how it plays.
---
Thank you! Will check this out. I did it a lot back in vanilla but what is the dust macro? Might be something I used but haven‚Äôt played in a while and have forgot some of the macro stuff.
---
If you look at the tooltip, you can see that it requires Tiger Riding, which you can only get when you're exalted with Darnassus.
---
You do need it.
---
The Northrend Ice Caps are melting
---
I just hit 45 yesterday, so I got that goin' for me.
---
strength and agility are not the stats you want for leveling. 16 strength will increase your dps by like 1. 5 agility increase your crit and dodge by 0.25%. you are never gonna win or lose a quest because you did 1 less dps or crit 0.25% less. you wont even notice the difference
---
the best stat for leveling is spirit because it gives you mana regen and you will notice it. getting enough mana to cast an extra healing spell for half your health will make a tangible difference when it happens
---
aside from spirit, getting int and stamina are solid just to increase your resources
---
so therefore, the scarlet monastary mace is the best choice i know about because it has spirit and stamina. i also used the staff from ulduarman when doing dungeons. it has slightly higher stamina but no spirit. but spirit doesnt matter much in dungeons because you arent casting spells at all. 
---
or if you want to grind out gold, you can use warden staff at level 48 for leveling the rest of the way and its also the best weapon even at 60
---
Just like the ignorance of the french when it comes to learning english. It doesn't make you cool, it's just stupid :))

No, it's not.  If you want to build a group, it is your responsibility to, "build the group".  No one else has any responsibility to assist with that.  You took the initiative to start the group, so now it's your responsibility to fill it out.  I might ask in guild chat for a tank, but it stops there.  
---
I know that tanks are ultra-scarce at all levels.  I know that a newly forming group that doesn't have a tank will be spending the next 10 to 40 minutes looking for one.  
---
I don't mind waiting for a tank, if the guy building the group is doing it efficiently!  You must have missed the part where I said the guy building the group was half-assing it!  You don't advertise as, "Looking for More", when your looking for a tank!
---
welcome to being blocked!
---
It would be my bet. Mid to end of November. We have 6 phases to go through. Can't have each one by half a year long.
---
In what "style" is a faster weapon better?  I get that you may want to feel like you're shooting faster, in which case I can understand.  But I'm having a hard time finding a situation in which you get better value or performance out of a fast weapon.
---
I could be wrong, but dodge is the only mitigation that completely negates damage.  Parry still causes glancing blow damage which is significantly lower, but not zero.
---
I would get frustrated too if my only interaction with humans for the past month was through World of Warcraft
---
If you get dotted you can blind/gouge, sprint, potion and restealth. Vanish and Improved Sprint break snares.
---
&gt;Sure but you're probably looking at something in phase 3 or 4. 
---
No I'm not.
---
My phase 1 bis set has +598 healing, 45mp5 while if you go full Earthfury the best you can do is +335healing 50mp5.
---
You should be max ranging where you can, and kill them a lot slower. If they are trying to kill you back they will have to chase you. If they are not, you will be chasing them.
---
They‚Äôve said they won‚Äôt be adding paid transfers but take that with a grain of salt and blizzard won‚Äôt pass on a chance to make more money
---
&gt;Blizzard has hinted the phases will be released on a similar schedule to the patches in the original game.
---
Schedule doesn't necessarily mean timetable. It could just mean they are going to release them in the same order.
---
That, to me, makes more sense. I strongly doubt Blizzard is going to wait two years to release Naxx.
---
On my server its so bad i had to ignore several dozens people already because i dont wanna watch 'LFM spellcleave' in /world nonstop, usually spamming it three times.
---
You did this? I did this :)
---
Just get ready for dps to play with their aoe abilities. And good luck trying to hold aggro if they don‚Äôt attack your target. 
---
I ran sm the other day and this rouge died 14 times because ‚Äúmy attacks cleave‚Äù 
---
I told him that if it‚Äôs an ability he can turn off he should because my rage dies quickly and if you don‚Äôt want aggro you don‚Äôt need to cleave your attacks. 
---
Also most hunters start each encounter with multi shot for some reason...
---
So much fun to park on a flag and sap people....
---
&gt;for every person who is in a position to handle it, there's going to be many more (the average person) who can't and minimizing it because you don't want to hear it isn't doing anyone any favors.
---
Or it could be that you have a very skewed perspective of the world and the rest of the people living in it, because you have never stepped foot outside your flyspec hometown. When you say "the average person" you are actually talking about yourself because it's inconceivable to you that you're actually below average and most people have their shit together much more than you do.
---
Yeah I downloaded it through Curse/Twitch, it has its own download location for classic with different addons
---
Well, that depends though. Did he just ask if he could be summoned and you dropped that on him or did he whine/beg for a summon and after repeatedly telling him to walk you dropped that on him?
---
I dont know. I did it yesterday as Horde with two friends and two random dd and we didnt struggle once. 
---
Also the first time we have been in that instance in like 13 years.
---
Pfft, you clearly did a bad job selling it.  The flips is what should have sold it!
---
Going to need some time of visualization so I don't mess it up.
---
nice, i always listen to Secular Talk or Jimmy Dore when playing :)
---
How DARR she?!
---
Because of it has the fastest attack speed, it's a great pet to use in pvp against casters for the spell pushbacks.
---
Lol, go to Retail.
---
What auto shot timer add on is that?
---
Verners crew, assemble.
---
Guessing you are Alli on a PvP server?
---
TBC and Wotlk introduced elements such as flying, and raid/dungeon finder. I enjoyed the expansions at the time, but in hindsight that *is* when the game started getting worse.
---
Dark whelpings are 9g on my server.
---
Small flame sac 15 s each... 
---
I hate this so much.
---
That was a pretty good spot.
---
Nobody knows for certain but there are good arguments on either side. Some people say they are 100% going to release TBC because its already made and would surely be successful, but the counterpoint to that is ‚Äúwhat after TBC?‚Äù If they forget about TBC and continue to add previously slashed content to classic like Grim Batol, Karazhan, etc., then its possible that ‚ÄúClassic+‚Äù lasts longer than a TBC expansion would. Ultimately, nobody knows for sure, and we still have plenty of classic to enjoy before we need to worry about it.
---
Maybe because of the 20 days /played.
---
Yes that looks definitely inspired by the abomination design (patchwerk etc)
---
As others have said, slower gives you so many benefits over faster.  There really isn't even a worthwhile argument for faster bows.
---
Yeah I really don't understand why people keep saying that. I've vendored so much food because I never need it.
---
I read every word.
---
Oh god no, please don‚Äôt block me. I beg you!
---
There is no golden standard. Every single person in this thread has their own personal standard.
---
How do you handle off spec items, main spec but you are currently off spec healing/tanking, equipping it now vs when you are high enough level vs after you change spec, item for your alt, item is not an upgrade but a side-grade, item is a pvp twink item and no knowledgable player will equip it to level, BOP vs BOE, rare spawn enemy, rare item, reserves, etc...
---
There is no standard.
---
We found a retail baby bois.
---
Thank god, this guy gets it.
---
Nothing officially as yet
---
That wasn't my point.
---
Yikes.
---
Classic isn't a work of art. Classic is a time machine to an era of prosperity. Think the post WW2 era in American history, for example. It's wonderful and unique to experience, sure. But it's far from perfect. 
---
Imagine America in 1950, a time of peace and economic boom. Now add in integrated schools, the polio vaccine, electric cars, HBO, and other wonderful future technology. But avoid the dark side of the future: celebrity obsession, reality TV, Fortnight, fidget spinners, etc. That's the potential promise of Classic+. We know what worked and what didn't in retail, and we now have the ability to alter history and create a utopia. 
---
I'm in favor of experiencing a no-changes classic. For now. But refusing to budge from this position as years go by would be a mistake. After phase 6, I sincerely hope Blizzard considers improvements and alterations on classic.
---
What is a reasonable price to buy the pattern for Robes of the Archmage? Gimme a range, or examples.

---
No I'm being genuine. It's not that I thought the word hyper was being used as hyperbole here, but it is definitely an overused word, especially on social media.
---
Everyone in this thread is wrong. Vernors Gigerale is the best pop/soda to hit the markets.
---
Trolls also have a passive that does extra damage to beasts. Not always relevant, but might help in some PVE cases.
---
Because not everyone can afford things of the AH. Perhaps finding it in the group was their only chance at said upgrade and you now have taken it from them. People need tons of things they don‚Äôt have the funds to purchase. 
---
I literally see no valid argument for not selecting greed when you have a greedy purpose in mind.
---
I don't really see any sound reasoning for why it would be 3 months.
---
MC was released in Vanilla on November 2004.
---
The Honor System was released in April, and BWL was released in June of 2005.  
---
So if they plan to follow a similar schedule, I lean more toward 4 months from classic release - phase 2, but nobody really knows.
---
It depends. If it's in a place guards are supposed to be able to protect, then yeah. Not all locations have guards posted everywhere, though. Simply being out of range isn't a violation of the rules, it's when you're abusing guard pathing capabilities like in Tanaris when it's a problem.

Hi, /u/50shadesofBCAAs
---
If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dbunpr/puke_the_cocky_warrior_hstalagg/). 
---
I'm a shaman coming in to say "hi".
---
Unless you're getting carried, you're not going to get the axe until level 38-40 if you are farming the mats by yourself. Even if you buy the charms off the AH, you still have to farm a bunch of bloodscalp tusks which is probably level ~35 at a minimum. 
---
The reason why this is important is because at level 36, you get Whirlwind and at level 40, you get MS. At that point, you don't want to be using your rage on sunder/hamstring purely for OP procs. Sunder is still useful early in a fight but after that, saving rage for Whirlwind and MS is a far better use of rage. 
---
Also, keep in mind that most warrior abilities are using "weapon damage" as their base damage, so a +X damage enchant will impact all of these. This would definitely be the better solution, though an enchant probably isn't worth its cost at this level.
---
You should of seen ironforge in vanilla.  Absolute insanity.  I had to avoid going to Ironforge because it would instantly lock up my PC and freeze it.
---
No they didnt.
---
Okay, whatever. Another boring and irrelevant story + mediocre "achievement" to fish for upvotes.
---
I see. I'd like to give 2h fury a shot at end game on alliance side, just to see. Is the rotation the same as DW fury or slightly different?
---
Wait you guys are getting paid?
---
I was playing Alliance in Arathi making my way towards an iron vein. A mounted Tauren, nearly 10 levels higher, beats me to it. I try to polymorph him and mine it before him. He resists the polymorph and starts chasing me. So I polymorph him again and this time it works! I laugh at him and start running away while he's in sheep form. He chases me again, points at me signaling for me to stop, so I do so. 
---
To my surprise we spend the next minute exchanging friendly emotes on top of a hill and then we peacefully part ways. It was great, rp-pvp server btw.
---
Does Herods axe (forget what it's called) proc paladin seals? So if I have Seal of Command up and the axes spin attack procs, do each of those attacks have a chance to proc SoC?
---
/train is in the list ;)
---
Yes, but Damage Meters are a thing and those addons can communicate a general gear score with each other.  So while it is not official, it will soon be supported by addons.
---
Kind of off-topic, but this is the first time I've played WoW casually with some friends. It's so nice to just have a core group of good players ready to run instances and not waste time looking for a group only to find out your tank is morally opposed to tanking more than one mob at a time.
---
big oof
---
Yup, always in the 1-3g range. And I get asked *a lot* because I spend a lot od time at the AHs. The least I got was 50s but that was below level 40.
---
Why the fuck would I lie about something like that? Lol
---
My top three dungeons would be:
---
1. BRD
---
2. Uldaman
---
3. Sunken Temple
---
Nothing beats the type of dungeon design exhibited in these places. To me, SM is probably the most boring dungeon series in classic, and reminds me the most of retail. The only highlight of SM is the final fight in Cathedral, and the rest of the place is just forgettable.
---
Except for the part where you don't get the crit damage talent till you're at 60 anyway.
---
I did skinning and herbalism! But capped myself at 225 to not spend the gold and you don't really need it  before 40
---
\&gt; even switching targets, without using a CP generating ability will cause you lose your existing CPs 
---
I played a rogue in beta and this is the biggest part of what turned me to play something else.  Needing to create a mouseover macro to kick/blind secondary enemies in pvp just felt really...not fun.  You can't even click an enemy even just to check their debuffs.  That whole thing just feels really obnoxious and I would have a hard time breaking my habits to avoid losing CP.
---
Yes I'm aware, but if you've actually multi-boxed you'd realize it's not like it magically works flawlessly every time. At the end of the day there is a person controlling all 5 accounts. They will never do as well as 1 person being clever.
---
No functional difference isn't the point. Wild you miss it again. Jump, both hands in the air real high before it goes over your head again.
---
Attack and Auto Shot aren't the same command. I don't think /start attack will stop your attack if clicked more than once. But /start Auto Shot or /start Shoot (for wands) will turn off the auto attack.
---
Wow what an interesting post it definitely deserves an upvote. Educating, funny, and entertaining.
---
I wouldn't be surprised if this date isn't set in stone yet.  I would imagine the Classic WoW team is monitoring the active player base and seeing what % are max lvl, what the projected number of max lvl characters will be in November.
---
Blizzard also has a way of staggering its different product offerings releases.  If there is a new Retail patch, or new Overwatch content, they will hold off on doubling up.
---
I really don‚Äôt know what you people are arguing. You don‚Äôt create a standard for niche rules and break the meaning of the words. It‚Äôs illogical and frankly stupid. 
---
Logic and reason is not supported by your need everything mentality. It is actually a true reflection of absolute greed.
---
I didn't dungeon too much when leveling because, at least in the context of pugs, it wasn't actually faster than just grinding and questing on average.
---
As for leveling spec, just go arms, pick up sweeping strikes, mortal strike, dump rest into fury, respec later.
---
I have most of my skills macro'd to autoattack and stance. I'm sure there's more you can do though, i'm probably not the best person to ask in that regard.
---
Line of sighting mobs is a bug now?
---
Not to mention a common plague amongst DPS classes is their slavery to the DPS meter. I got into an argument with one before (I was healer) when they were claiming that DPS is all that matters and that the group shaman sucked, when the shaman was doing all kinds of tasteful shaman support such as totems, shocking casters and such. A good CC / supporting player can make your life so much easier, and it really doesn't take much off the DPS monitor (if you really *have* to have one installed).
---
I just want to get on with everyone, but I find a hell of a lot of toxicity generally occurs in general, to the point I don't really want to keep playing. And it always seems to be the same types of people (which I hate to sling shit, but are usually DPS at the minimum acceptable level for the dungeon, who are all about speed, speed, speed and give 0 thought to CC, their buddies mana and such.)
---
I‚Äôd suggest joining the fight club discord so you can learn a lot on how to play/itemize the class.

Added in patch 1.13.0.28211
---
Added in content phase 1
---
Comments say the only way to obtain it is through Goblin Engineering Membership renewal. I did what it said and it didn't work, that's why I'm asking here
---
Makes sense. I did not know that, thank you.
---
You need to craft and send in 6 Gronkulators, 1 Samophlange and 2 vials of Headlight Fluid in addition to the gold. Hope this helps.
---
Tanking for the first time ever gave me an adrenaline rush that I hadn't felt since downing Gruul for the first time. AOE tanking in particular is a hell of a fun challenge.
---
I think Arms is totally fine for tanking while leveling. In fact, a lot of the talents synergize well with tanking.
---
Right now the only relevant macro I have is one that allows me to have Mocking Blow and Taunt in the same button. It shows me the first one while in Battle Stance and the second one while in Defensive Stance. I'm on my phone so I'll link later if need be.
---

---
&gt;Before transmog you had a "City Set", another set of gear you wore when you weren't planning to kill anything so you didn't look like an absolute twat.
---
Honestly these are a lot more rare, even on RP servers, than people like to imply. The vast majority of players just stick in their actual gear.
---
The problem with them messaging you is because of channels. People in channels can message other people in channels. Did he join a channel that you are apart of? 
---
In classic you cant right click and send bnet friends request thats what i want to know also. Howd he add you to start with. I had someone do it to me but we are friends. Ill ask him when we i see him online next.
---
Game knowledge and people aren't going to tell you how to make money because it directly impacts on their ability to make money.

It prevents ninjas by making you all ninjas. This is NOT a valid reason. Please think harder for a good reason.
---
At this point I enjoy it. It takes so long to travel to a city, I try to only travel there every 2-4 levels.  Exploring zones I avoided back in the day because they were far away or tedious is now all I do. I might just hoof it to 60 to say I did lol
---
/train is in the list :) under playful.
---
Why would I?
---
I asked a question and haven't received one solid piece of advice for a website to do this on. You're obviously a neckbeard buddy - calm down
---
In that case gore gameplay is such a loose term that it's not really a good way to criticize a game since it doesn't on its own pinpoint any problems and instead is a catch-all word.
---
Anything wrong with a game? Core gameplay.
---
Thanks I will take a look!
---
How many mages do you have in your raids?
---
Here is a tip though: Go to Dustwallow Marsh right after you get a mount, it is absolutely crammed with water that requires swimming but you can ride through it on a mount (can't say if it is true for the smallest mount-races).
---
They gave the community basic tools to create their own loot rules. Might as well be called priority 1/2/3. Blizz created it to be open ended. That is why their is no official standard loot rules or penalties for diverting from what you think the standard loot rules are.
---
If you try hard enough, anything is possible!
---
You commented twice to my reply. Are you ok? Like mentally? If you need help, happy to point you in the right direction.
---
The more I think about it, the more I would be ok with tokens. Only if they were only purchasable in game with gold, no cash purchases.
---
Typically ! is used in code as a "not". So, start Auto Shot if auto shot is currently NOT started.
---
what, the picture words are scary?
---
There's also the Kodobone Necklace from [this quest](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=5501/bone-collector) to give you something more than nothing.
---
Yeah. The instance was designed for that to be the bossroom, then they decided it can be bigger and just added the rest
---
lots of wrong info here, the part about rogue not fiting dungeons comp is true, the part about gear competition is true, but that all comes down to other people being jerks, you're not usless, just annoying.  
---
For questing, 1 potion of health regen (troll's blood) a good main hand and a sharpening stone on it,is all you need to chain mob faster than any other class, the % damage from backstab combined with the +DMG from sharpening stone (and enchant if you can afford it) is straight crazy  
---
Lastly for raid, well, endgame top dps on northdale were mostly rogues so theres that, the main reason rogues are not ranking higher overall is that people dont give them loot priority.  
---
So cheers people, rogue is good, people are meta-slaves jerks, get to know your class better, right now i'm playing "non-recommended" Dagger + ambush specc, all i'm doing is spending a bit on gold making sure my main hand is good and enchanted and i'm basically almost one shotting mobs and Player of equal level
---
You‚Äôre right I‚Äôve just got to finish what I‚Äôve started. Maybe I‚Äôll start leveling a priest in the mean time for when I‚Äôm getting ganked :)
---
All the wonder, the amazement, all the yikes and running. All the frustration and mob resistance. All the forcing me to be innovative to kill said mob. All the swearing at the screen , it all came flooding back. It IS wonderful!!!!
---
cat was not going to attack, tail wasn't even wiggling
---
You should be happy I am not one of your locks.  You would be down a stamp buff ;)
---
I see you have completely given up on reasonable discourse
---
Smart. My friends are on their way to burnt-out status and everyone is a different level range, no dungeons together. Not fun.
---
I get it.  I'm just pointing out that calling Asmo bad at games in a thread that has nothing to do with it is ironically toxic because everyone in here is complaining that his toxicity fosters ninja looting.
---
And I don't care how you dress it up, you're calling him bad for no reason.  You even go as far as to compare him to a child which is incredibly toxic.  Just because you do it in a lot of words or explain your reasoning does not make it less toxic.
---
That‚Äôs extremely debatable
---
1. Lack of true PvP. They are an extremely favorited class in PvP but we're not there yet. 
---
2. In general they tend to make better alts then mains. They have just a handful of pain in the ass qualities associated with them: Need good gear,  need consumables, Not the easiest to level,  not the easiest to get pre-60 groups with. 
---
3. Their was certainly a reverse psychology effect going on everyone thought they were going to be insanely popular so they picked something else. The problem was everyone thought that lol
---
you'd rather have distance travelled on Y axis? That's even worse.
---
&gt; I wont ever use LHW at all.
---
Then I feel very sorry for the people you play with.

#No changes
---
No, i want groups where the group leader is advertising for a tank as, "LF1M, Tank", and not "Looking for More"
---
If you were a tank, which group would you go with?
---
I rest my case.  welcome to being blocked!
---
I‚Äôm the lazy one...
---
Yeah it has been so long I forgot this was even a thing and I think it's incredibly shitty, it punishes you for switching targets to CC an add for example.
---
I get that his/her opinion differs from yours, but please try to restrain yourself from popping off.
---
BfA might have *more* story, but that doesn't make its story good. Its story is objectively bad, as it subverts years of character growth and development for shock value while leaning on tropes to span the gap between shockers.
---
m+ in and of itself is the just a giant gacha hook mechanic
---
And lastly, no. Blizzard took the randomness of loot and slapped a J-curve on it. Not only do you have to get your drop, but you have to get it with the right series of random elements. Drop + titanforge + socket = algorithmic labyrinthian hellhole of randomness. 
---
That said, it's less about the difficulty in attaining the item, but rather that the forged/socket system surfaces the design intent in an overly transparent way. It's crystal clear that this is an overt effort to create a timesink for the player.
---
The vanilla system at least did the due diligence of rooting it in the RPG elements of the world. It doesn't make sense for a boss to be posted up in a dungeon holding an entire armory's worth of gear. The fact that one boss only dropped a few items also reinforced the social function of the game, as you had to contribute to the group goals to achieve your personal goals‚Äîand you had to do this consistently over time.
---
Now, it's totally fine if you like the systems in BfA. If you feel rewarded by them, that's sincerely great! That means that the designers, developers, artists, and engineers that worked on those features did something that worked well for you and their efforts weren't for naught. However, that doesn't mean the system that worked well for you wasn't a turn-off for someone else.

I ONLY mentioned the 2h for a reason. Lol. 
---
It isn‚Äôt worth mentioning that he was using a 2h when it isn‚Äôt the reason things were going poorly. It just further stigmatizes 2h tanking, which is super annoying.
---
Do y‚Äôall have lives or?
---
Exactly, such effective storytelling, so much fun to read!
---
Making sure you attack periodically is how you prevent it from leashing.  That was a pretty good kite actually.  You would make a good hunter or mage.  :p
---
Literally nobody cares that you were too shitty to hit 60. 
---
Omg it took 4 hours to level. Fuck this I quit!
---
Haha well that works out then.  1030p MT still good?
---
It's hard out there for a DPS warrior. They want you to tank, and even if they're short on DPS for a particular run, the tank warrior doesn't like competing with you for ROLLZ. I finally gave up around level 40 and respecced tank

I'm laughing at this shit üòÇ
---
Nothing is set in stone. There's rumors they're evaluating a TBC rollout after Vanilla but only Blizzard knows for now. They probably haven't even decided yet.

:--Age|:--Should Sleep|:--Bedtime Remark
---
:--Newborn|:--15-18 hours||:--Newborns do not have a fixed circadian rhythm. Typically, they sleep at intervals of two to four hours at a time both during the day and at night.
---
:--1-4 months|:--14-15 hours|:--Between 20.00 and 23.00|:--So little babies still need food often - even at night. When the child is approaching four months, you can try to put it earlier.

:--4-8 months|:--14-15 hours|:--Between 17.30-18.30|:--Now the child starts to get a circadian rhythm. Regular naps (maybe around 9am, 12am and 3pm) and early bedtime can help your baby get the sleep it needs. If one of the lizards(naps?) falls away, it may be okay to put the baby down for the night early.
---
:--8 -10 months|:--12-14 hours|:--Between 17.30- 19.00|:--Babies of this age may need only two naps a day. The psychologists who have prepared the advice think bedtime should be no later than 3.5 hours after the last shutdown. To compensate for a missing third nap, you can move the bedtime forward.
---
:--10 ‚Äì 15 months|:--12-14 hours|:--Between 18.00 - 19.30|:--Now maybe the baby just needs a nap during the day, and then bedtime needs to be moved forward for a while. At this stage, it is recommended that the bedtime is not later than 4 hours after the last nap.
---
:--15 months til 3 year|:--12-14 hours|:--Between 18.00 - 19.30|:--During this period, many people stop sleeping during the day. Then you might need to move the bed time forward to compensate for this.
---
:--3-6 year|:--11-13 hours|:--Between 18.00-20.00|:--Now the child probably will not rest during the day and will therefore need some extra sleep at night.

How do you write dates?
---
The epitome of a filthy casual.
---
Very important for hunters as we can't shoot and move. So we need to know when the next auto attack is coming out so we can stop, wait for the shot, then continue moving.
---
That's my hope (and fear). Personally before release, looking at the phase details, I was most interested in Phase 3+ for Arathi Basin and Zul'Gurub, then .5 gear and AQ20. If the release schedule is going to be as prolonged as it seems to be, I will most likely cancel my sub and come back in the 6 months or so it's going to take for those phases to release. My fear is that there are a lot of people in my position where they will run out of things to do (or care about) and cancel. Depending on the dropoff, will it change Blizzard's plans/release schedule? Perhaps. Perhaps not.

I'm a 37 priest leveling as Shadow but plan on going holy eventually. I love healing dungeons and so far have had no trouble doing so as Shadow. However, I've heard other Shadow priests complain that dungeons are too hard to heal at higher levels.
---
My question is at what level will I need to respec to holy if I want to keep healing dungeons? Or can I just stay Shadow the entire way to 60?
---
What is this doing in this subreddit?
---
Think it through, man. 
---
3 group members agree to greed on an expensive boe shield so the tank can have it.
---
Tank rolls need.
---
5th member also rolls need. That's the ninja. Now 4/5 group members have agreed where a piece of loot is going, yet there's a 50% chance that that person doesn't get it.
---
Now consider the alternative: 4/5 members all agree that the tank should get the shield. They all roll need. Now there's an 80% chance that the item winds up where 80% of the group wants it to go, because whoever wins can give it to the tank.
---
How is a system that makes 80% of the group happy 50% of the time *better* than a system that makes 80% of the group happy 80% of the time?
---
To trick people into being there.
---
Yes, but their cast time has no difference, hence cast time spell coefficient difference is non-applicable.
---
Example: Healing Touch rank 4 (lvl 20) is the first rank of the spell to have 3s cast time, and maintains it the same cast time up to lvl 60.
---
Overly nerfed or the content was never actually hard and people have more resources and understand the game way better now. The world will never know.
---
FYI opposing faction cannot see your custom emotes. Otherwise it'd just be a really obvious loophole to the whole language barrier heh
---
Don't the various run speed boots/enchantments specifically state they don't stack with other movement enhancing effects?
---
The 4 piece blue tier druid pvp set does increase cat form, travel form, and bear form movement speeds all by 15% though. And yes it is stupidly good.
---
Always against TOS to safespot against guards in PvP using objects etc.
---
I have this same issue with fios frequently and it is super frustrating because I stream and was causing MASSIVE issues for me last night. Awesome internet service. When it works. . .
---
I've heard its [Gatorbite Axe](https://vanilla-twinhead.twinstar.cz/?item=17730)
---
&gt; and ~~fucking my orc ass.~~
---
Lok'tar my Ogar.
---
All that just to skip some trash... I thought the point was to get XP? I know this wasn‚Äôt your idea, I just mean this party you were invited to. I don‚Äôt know, I like just killing stuff.
---
Are you a troll really? Under your INCREDIBLY stupid scenario you basically say that EVERYONE who needs ANY item is greedy. Now this is the dumbest thing you‚Äôve said by miles
---
Well if that continues to be the case then I can just skip them all till Naxx. I will collect the dungeon set. Upgrade it at AQ release. Then take that into Naxx and get some weapons. 
---
If they keep it in this post nerf state, I can just steer around it and focus on pvp.
---
any external metric of classic server population is not accurate because after week 3, when wowhead published their statistics acquired via addon, Blizzard blocked any API that allowed collecting any such statistics. By their words having stats doesn't follow the original vanilla wow experience. So we have stats up to week 3 max. And that is with chacaters, not individual players. I have 2 bank alts and 3 chars to keep my names reserved. Therefore, having 1 level 60 character, I'm deviding these stats into 6 players, while in reality I'm only one person having 6 characters.
---
This is gonna sound wierd but I listen to the Dixie chicks not ready to make nice lmao. Was playing the first time I did WC and I associate it with wow now. So it's in every gaming playlist I have still.
---
He asked the two gnomes if they're a couple. One of them said no. The other was hoping for yes.

ItemRack is awesome, works really well.

because repair
---
haha, thanks!
---
Great, so we just made a new rule to slap on the standard list. Cosmetic value is not to be considered.
---
Lets go through the list of the things I mentioned, and the endless list I didn't and come up with ssmit102's personal standard list of rules that does not align with any other players.

A sure sign of great comedy is when it needs to be explained in excruciating detail.
---
What macro do you use if you don‚Äôt mind me asking, because I cannot get it to work.
---
It's only usable once every 15 sec.  Hardly spammable.
---
Thank you bud. First actual comment that hits the nail on the head.
---
During January-April (I'm a CPA) I work 60+ hour weeks. I would have NO time to pull off the leveling I am currently doing. I was lucky for the release date... but some obviously weren't so unlucky.
---
We just want the oldschool classic raiding experience again as a group of friends and we are trying to find solutions to make this work.
---
We do know. Keep up.
---
58
---
Yeah, definitely not going to help her with mount gold now!
---
Did you ever take a statistics course
---
There are other pvp servers besides faerlina...like, lots of others.
---
Right? I‚Äôm not having Issues getting into groups, hell most groups welcome me open arms when I say I‚Äôm Rogue DPS.
---
Please take this to ya boi Denalaan by Dolanaar.
---
Lol nobody watched damage in vanilla hahahahhahahahahahahahahaha right.
---
Imagine thinking that if you don‚Äôt level on your own you won‚Äôt figure out the rotation of spamming Frostbolt to infinity and beyond lmao
---
Calculate movement speed with different modifiers?
---
Found the guy without any friends to play with.
---
You can always just grind gold, or start an alt. 
---
That being said your best bet might be sucking it up and tanking for a bit, finding a good guild with friendly people, and eventually ask them to let you go full DPS.
---
Well, was kinda similar for me.
---
For some reason, I started dueling a lot at 53. Ans I mean, a LOT.
---
I spent days and days in Gadzetan, dueling horde and alliance. 
---
Cause of that, people that started leveling when I was 50 got to lvl 60 before me xD
---
I'm glad everything is new for you, that's why Vanilla felt (even more) magical. Everything was new, unknown, felt huge and full of possibilities.
---
In one word: Epic.
---
Have fun!
---
Probably cast ranges.
---
I totally get that, it's just so easy to go back and forth,  I guess I just don't get why people aren't willing to do both when necessary
---
It's only a gambling problem if you lose.
---
I appreciate the tip, thanks!
---
&gt;They get dicked on by fury dps pretty much throughout entire vanilla.
---
Maybe you do, I don't.  I can easily out DPS a fury warrior.
---
I got myself a crocolisk at level 11, couldn't think of a good RP name on the spot so just called him Chompy, thinking I'd be getting a new pet soon anyway. I'm level 38 now and Chompy is still by my side Everyone loves him in dungeons and always goes the extra mile to keep him alive. He's been an essential part of my WoW experience. I think naming your pet makes all the difference when you really want to get immersed into the game.
---
Yep, and there are chicken little people complaining that it will break the game to give pally taunt because if pally can tank then what do you need warriors for? I'm like what do you need warriors for? Nefarion and chromaggus cause everything else in vanilla can be tanked by a druid. So much overreaction and it's been like that for 19 years
---
Flash heal maintains the same cast time throughout its' rank afaik, same for greater heal.
---
Altho what I said is technically wrong: "Rank 1 spells barely benefit from +healing at lvl 60 afaik." a better way to phrase it would be:
---
Rank 1 spells - that change cast time by rank - barely benefit from +healing at lvl 60 afaik.
---
This.
---
Many, many T1s are not good compared to itemized bis lists. 
---
But that doesn't mean the T1 stuff is bad. It def got funneled to him for a reason and likely no one is really missing out.
---
For some reason they stacked on private servers. Dunno why. They do say they don't stack. Maybe it means other things like barons sword, or the postmasters set bonus. 
---
I was just wondering if somebody had tested them. My druid isn't high enough level and my higher levels don't have anything.
---
oops sorry, yeah horde. i REALLY wanted to do the frost saber grind but i am not alliance. so next best thing was that.
---
Ye i don't know, i wasn't casual in vanilla so everyone i played with had a city set and seemingly every other raider we knew did too. 90% of us it was just full tier 1/2, whichever we preffered, some loved the plate / cloth slut mogs, others dressed up in the fedora's and overalls, etc.
---
People owned items just to flex in cities too, like teebu's. Shits not a good weapon, but you'll get like ~1k gold for it in phase 2 just because people will run up to inspect them and they love it.
---
The players will get a warning first. But will get a suspension if they continue.
---
I will sometimes, its about 50/50 depending on if i have a lot of rage pooled. We had 2 locks in the party last night so I ended up spending a lot of mana healing them up to keep us going at a good clip.
---
Threat on 2 mobs isnt an issue, i can maul back and forth with faerie fire, its when the swipe spam is needed, I think. Not having Primal Fury is starving me when I want to swipe spam.
---
FFXIV is pretty damn chill when not being weird pretentious weebs but yeah tru
---
I mean both shamans and druids are expected to heal raid content. At least druids get to tank dungeons, and possibly off tank in raids!
---
Logan Paul was generating a metric shitload of ad revenue for YouTube at the time. Banning him would have been suicide on their part.
---
&gt; You wouldn't say... "I have about 50 seconds to travel so which method should I use"
---
I would say "after around 17 seconds, traveling on your 60% mount is faster than traveling by foot"
---
because while we all have a decent grasp on time, judging on the comments in this thread, not many people seem to be able to judge distance ingame.
---
That's why I said rarely. I even often would skip nightfall procs if the mob was low hp. I would only really ever shadowbolt in dungeons, but I didn't dungeon spam to level so that was rare. If you are dungeon spamming, dark pact does lose most of its value, but I am not arguing for dark pact in dungeons, rather for open world farming and questing.
---
Guys, you asked so I have delivered .... Please see my other post for my profit guide ....

bank alts are usually lvl 5, because that\`s when you learn professions, and being able to DE items with your bank alt is nice.
---
dark pact, deep affliction talent that steals your pets mana
---
I work 40 hours and have 5 hours a. Ight to myself not including weekends and I'm only lvl 27. Halp. But I also have 492g
---
Yeah... I never did that.
---
I started to level a rogue and was told the only way to play is swords. Id rather not play a squishy fury warrior. Always mained rogues in retail, now they just dont feel as fun.
---
If i was a player on the screen at the moment and i knew that cat was watching, i would /wave.
---
52 is good for the first few bosses. Anything after Angerforge will be a little high. 54+ is good for the entire dungeon.
---

---
AQ was 2006, it is 2019.
---
The system has no control over the happiness of the individuals but the people themselves do. How is this a concept that people don‚Äôt understand?! You DO NOT adjust a system to eliminate human defect because there is a chance people can ‚Äúninja‚Äù. 
---
You‚Äôve all confused being safe to make a system should do. It is unquestionable to need on anything you don‚Äôt need you‚Äôve absused the system and I‚Äôm dumbfounded some are arguing against that.
---
If they wind up using the 8/8 bonus to heal split raids (20-30man MC) then 8/8 will benefit the raid. It's their guild tho so w/e, if you find it weird then avoid a feedy loot council guild.
---
You can start BRD at 52, but that's primarily in order to get the key. There are quite a few quests you can pick up at this point though, so I'd recommend a run at 52 to get all those quests out of the way and get the key. 
---
After that, you really can't go much further into BRD until 54. At 54 you can do most of the dungeon, but it will probably be slower than solo questing. As a warrior, dungeons are my preferred method of gaining XP, since solo questing is so slow, but my warlock friend constantly complains about how bad XP dungeons are, so I believe even at 54 BRD isn't as efficient as going solo.
---
I was just pointing out two countries larger than the US. Since he said it was used to make small countries seem larger. Ya you're right there's not many that are using the imperial system lol.
---
20 heal per tick is about 100 healing power, which is 400 spirit. Buffs would give like +40.
---
Yeah. Unfortunately I cannot give you the names of reputable ones or cost effective ones. That being said I do know that some leveling services will provide you a stream of your account so you can monitor it being leveled whenever you want.
---
Playerauctions is a good site but I‚Äôve never used it for WoW and it‚Äôs all individual sellers similar to an eBay so you‚Äôd have to do some digging.
---
Lots of Electric Wizard , some old school disco  and a smattering of Spiritbox.
---
I'm having a lot of fun on mine too! Also level 18. I'm only gonna level this guy by tanking. It'll take forever, and I'm sure I'll never reach 60, but it's just an alt to have some fun on when I feel like tanking.
---
Congratulation. 
---
Not nice that horde has nothing compared to this.
---
This should have been the one and only exception for "Nochanges".
---
Rupture is a damaging spell that bypasses armor.
---
Expose Armor is an investment towards future damaging melee attacks.
---
Rupture deals its damage while you/opponent is CC'd. 
---
Rupture deals its damage while outside of melee combat range.
---
Rupture prevents opponent from bandaging/restealthing.
---
I'll expose on a bear but that's about it
---
I've had the opposite experience. I generally leave Allies alone while questing unless I am provoked (or see another horde dying). Whereas even if I try to emote a friendly interaction with an Alliance, they will wait for me to be 1-2 mobs in a fight, then kill me.  Don't generalize, people are dicks on both sides.
---
I'm going the route where you get imp VW -&gt; Ruin first anyways, so what do I know lol
---
Gojira
---
&gt; Also taken into the fact only one country has stuck with the imperial system

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial\_units#Current\_use](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units#Current_use)
---
Yes; if you can find a slightly higher level group I'd try for a few quest runs though. Get what you can out of the way, and try to get your shadowforge key. 55 should comfortably be able to do pretty much everything up to lyceum; Emp is 59 so holding threat can be an issue at 55 but is doable.
---
I had a group of friends. We were blazing through content and all of us got to 40. Helped them grind their mounts out and we all 5 of us had a mount.... only for 3 of them to just immediately stop playing the game and the other 4th just left the guild we were all in and now only plays during the late nights...lol.
---
That is still the same amount of keybinds though
---
&gt; 1.) There are a bunch of threads on reddit and official forums, and even some blue posts, discussing this topic. The consensus seems to be it's not against EULA / TOS as long as your setup follows the one button press = one action per client rule and doesn't involve automation.
---
Isn't the "dance" from the post breaking this? Looks pretty automated to me.
---
WTB orb of deception, listing prices is always 150+ what is the actually selling price?
---
Squad goals
---
Look man, I'm only here for the stats!
---
Ah, didn't know that about channeled spells.
---
I‚Äôm not giving up I‚Äôm just staying quite frankly you would be a ninja. 
---
If 5 people roll need for an item to sell then 5 people have by definition abused a system and attempted to ninja an item.
---
i see now it would have been clearer without all the other chatter.
---
whats that?
---
I think it is selfish of you to feel entitled to an item based on your class. You should roll greed because you want it for selfish reasons. Just using the definitions you want to cling to so badly.
---
He/she/it just said he/she/it didn't measure it him/her/itself.

Perfect for feral druids...who need all of the above!

---
Hows the feel of resto in endgame content? I'm leveling a shaman now, and I'm super excited to begin healing come lv 50+!
---
I got tired of not being able to keep aggro on 20+ mobs in SM/ZF, so I turned my warrior into an AOE tanking god.  Oil of immolation, explosives from engineering, shield spikes, dragonbreath chili and brewmaster trinket. 
---
Bonus if you have a Warlock for fire shield, and Paladin for ret aura. 
---
I am probably an idiot for doing all of this, but its so much fun being able to hold aggro in spell-cleave groups and watch the confusion in the mages when they don't pull aggro.
---
So it's true it hasn't been 15 years ?
---
I will say this: I expected to get back into it and have a lot of fun. I didn't expect to be captivated all over again, or have *all* my time vaporize. I was not prepared.
---
It's not worth the 5 points you have to put in deflection though
---
Really cause I‚Äôm always getting blasted by ally in arathi and stv it‚Äôs ruff life! The server must be pretty balanced cause I hear people complain about the horde all the time but damn the ally on this server! Damn them all!!
---
Thank you.
---
Also double penetration
---
Oh for sure. Played well they're a very strong class in basically everything (leveling, PVE, PVP, grinding). 
---
It's just if they're bad it really shows, as there's a lot of ways you can fuck up as a mage and wind up very quickly dead or killing your whole party very easily.
---
Chain heal rank 1. Autobots, assemble.
---
i never said you "need" spirit. i just said its the best stat to go for. all the stats are pretty bad. spirit just happens to be the best. you could take off all your gear and still be able to kill things the same level as you. gear isnt nearly as important as people think it is
---
Skinning and herbalism. Stopped buying skills at level 32, capped my skinning at 225 to save the g. AHed every single mat, checked the ones I wasn't sure would earn. 
---
AH boes, if they don't sell first time or two then vendor them!
---
Yep. It‚Äôs hard to let that damage go. But without the imp dark pact battery, think of all the DPS lost then. Not to mention if the succ dies you lose he DPS and the mana.
---
Thank you why not improved cleave ?
---
&gt; I doubt it can produce enough threat though
---
I can tell you that unless your guild is absolute dogshit it can't, a reasonably geared hunter pulls aggro with auto attacks.
---
Obviously lol, but I want to join in on the giant massacres.
---
Currently an alliance 45 hunter. Just got my LW to 225. What LW spec should I go? I was thinking dragonscale but I‚Äôm not too sure. I want to be able to use some of the stuff I make but also be able to make some coin selling it.
---
Chances are those leveling Hordes are in revenge mode after getting ganked by higher leveled Alliances, too.
---
I think I was around level 48 or 50 when I transferred to Heartseeker from Stalagg. Leveling was a lot easier (didn't get ganked once while questing), but I saw a few Hordes of my level, and even ran into the odd group, but they didn't dare attack, most likely knowing that they'd be shooting themselves in the foot, in the long run.
---
It‚Äôs funny you say mafia. Because currently the top horde guild and top alliance guild are working together to try and ninja steal any devilsaur others kill while finding any themselves and keeping the price for the loot from dropping as well as fixing the price on both sides. Very mafia-esque
---
I can find the g-spot on my own thank you very much!
---
Sorry, someone had to
---
I‚Äôve managed to get 5
---
I focused on the 40 man raids as they are a direct progression. As well as the progression most often looked at. BWL is phase 3, AQ is phase 5, naxx is phase 6. 
---
ZG and AQ serve more as catchup mechanisms than progression content. ZG gear is roughly on par with MC gear and yet ZG is released After BWL. If you've been doing BWL for a while you will do ZG for the enchants, but that's about it. Likewise AQ20 gear is worse than AQ40 gear and yet it comes out at the same time.
---
Rep grinds are another alternate gear path. If you are doing the latest raid you don't need any of the gear from them. You can't do them if you're bored but you aren't getting rewards from them.
---
Aslo it wasn't 6 months between that content in actual vanilla. ZG (phase 4) was 2 months after BWL (phase 3). AQ (Phase 5) was released 5.5 months after BWL (Phase 3) and 3.5 months after ZG (phase 4).
---
6 months between content patches would make sense if there was only 3 phases, but there isn't. With 6 phases stretching content to 6 month would extend the release time way far beyond the original vanilla timescale.
---
I don't love having mana, but it's easy enough to kill a mob using literally zero mana and regen before your next pull. I usually do this 1 out of 10 pulls and never ever drink.
---
Thanks! I wasn‚Äôt worried about not having fun, I‚Äôve been having a blast! One of the people I‚Äôll be playing with is just a bit of a stickler when it comes to things and would be pretty upset with a noticeable difference in experience. I‚Äôll just have a backup ready just in case he thinks I‚Äôm too high level for adequate experience
---
*"TOO SOON, PASSENGER. PLEASE STAY SEATED UNTIL THE BUS COMES TO A COMPLETE STOP."*
---
I will most likely use rank 8 or 9 for majority of heals and only rank 10 + nature's swiftness if I'm in a pinch.
---
As a tank, I hate the DPS'ers who get bored w me only pulling 4 or 5 so they go around and pull more. It has happened multi times in multiple instances
---
&gt;You DO NOT adjust a system to eliminate human defect
---
lol why the fuck not?
---
A significant portion of human advancement was for the sole purpose of adjusting the system to eliminate human defect
---
I did BRD with a mage who spammed fireballs on fire elementals....
---
&gt;Ye i don't know, i wasn't all that casual about vanilla so everyone i played with had a city set and seemingly every other raider we knew did too. 90% of us it was just full tier 1/2, whichever we preffered, some loved the plate / cloth slut mogs, others dressed up in the fedora's and overalls, etc.
---
It's anecdotal. I was on an RP server and I very rarely saw the serious raiders doing it, mostly it was just for RP events.
---
&gt;Shits not a good weapon
---
It's literally the best sword you can get outside of raiding/pvp. Not everybody is rushing into raiding. Hell, when I played vanilla my guild had just started MC whenever Naxx was released.
---
Half man half wolf, they are their own bestfriend.

I love this subreddit, but man...  I feel old.

What imperial system? In-game units are referred to as yards but have nothing to do with real life yards. The name alone does not make them imperial.

I don't blame him tbh UBRS is face roll and if people are wiping there then they must be terrible players.

As a prior Navy man I worked down in the whole with the Diesel Mechanics on my boat. I had to do a Six on Six off rotation while our boat was underway for about 2 and 1/2 years b4 I struck a different rate and became a Damage control man aka Fire Fighter.
---
For background reference while I was working down in the engine room w/the Diesel Mechanics AKA Engine men on the six on six off rotation for six hours you had to be on "watch" monitoring all the engines and then on the six off you were allowed to eat, sleep, shower, watch movies, go to the gym or do what ever you want. Most people would rush up stairs eat really quick, take a 5-10 minute shower and go to bed hoping to get roughly 4-5 hours of sleep. I became accustomed to sleeping 2-3 hours to have to get right back up and do it all over again. After all the sleep deprivation I went through I now honestly only get about 4-5 hours of sleep a night period. For reference I got out of the military in 2007.

I disagree. Reddit is one of the most popular websites in the world and it's highly likely that new players would find themselves here. Actually, if you spend literally 15 minutes of your time refreshing /new here, it will be extremely apparent that a vast quantity of new players are actively browsing this subreddit.  
---
You're basically arguing that power level services wouldn't want the broadest possible array of advertising, which is ridiculous. Why would they skip out on Reddit just because "YouTube has more"? That's just ridiculous.
---
The thing about leveling dungeons is that their difficulty is drastically affected by the levels of your party members. If you're in a group that can just barely get the instance done, then yes, Shadow might be a problem, but that's almost never the case. People usually err on the side of caution because they don't like to wipe or take forever to complete the run. The vast majority of groups, in my experience, are well above the instance's safety margin, and so having a less-than-optimal spec is not going to be the difference between success and failure. In other words, Shadow to 60 should be perfectly fine. Maybe don't go dungeoneering with groups that seem severely under-leveled, but that's probably good advice regardless of spec. :)

Honestly most europeans dont care what system america uses, let alone hate the imperial system. But if we just look at this at an objective level, then clearly the imperial system has more flaws then the metric system.

Get bagnon man! It will change your life.
---
That is impressive! Play it at your own pace :)
---
I've lost 3 pieces of T1 to a level 56 druid would would purposefully die at the start of boss encounters so he could afk. Shitty guild still have him look lol glad I left
---
Umm its true though
---
If you read the Cleave ability, it says "Weapon damage + 15" for example, the bonus% you get from Imp Cleave is only based off of the 15 damage, so It's an absolutely useless talent
---
I have had it loaded for 25 hours, and I have 7 in now.    I am re-addicted!   Kids yelled at me this morning to get them to school, this could be a problem ( until the older one hits 16!).
---
This subreddit has a huge ¬®retail bad classic good¬®circlejerk going on.
---
No, I vendor them lol. I really dont know how people have so much gold. That said, I've gotten REALLY poor luck with drops.
---
I've multiboxed since 2011. I find that it works most of the time, the issues I've had with interact with target is when they keep auto running. An AoE fear won't do much though- perhaps to more primitive /assist and /follow keyclone setups, but not with ISboxer.
---
I use leatrix plus and have that option enabled.
---
I used auctioneer I think in retail and it made some things better, but I was still able to do all the things I wanted to do manually. The only good thing I got was finding out how much over/under the true value I was buying things for lol
---
Welcome to the best server!
---
Thanks dudes, gonna check out the G600.
---
I let the tank get the aggro, maybe quickly pickpocket is 1-2 mobs then open up and melt them.
---
People don‚Äôt seem to mind, If they do, they better let me know and I‚Äôll stop :p
---
Silly comment - you can always make money on the AH. Maybe not as big gains but to say that he can't make money on the AH and he missed the window is asinine.   
---
So many twink items are gonna sky rocket phase 2
---
First question - are you leveling or 60?  For the most part, downranking doesn't help much while leveling.  In fact, it actually hurts you.  With no +healing, you are more efficient with higher ranks of a spell.  The lower ranks only become more efficient when you apply +healing items, as they use most of the +healing, for a lot less mana.
---
For a Paladin, it's less about which rank you use, and more about which spell you use.  Flash of Light is significantly more efficient than Holy Light.  Only use Holy Light for when you really need throughput.  
---
With that said, at lower levels, you're likely to get a lot of your mana back through spirit regen, until at later levels you can get mana back through crit and MP/5.  So you may want to learn to abuse the 5-second-rule until you can get to that point.  This will best be done with Holy Light, as you want to do your healing in big bursts, which means you can spend more time regenerating mana.
---
Lol, ty...? ;)
---
I miss the good times.
---
Please give update on spec?
---
I get asked to dps dungeons all the time (as holy is kinda a meme that I DPS but I am usually top 3 on charts) granted it's in dungeons so I can sw:p and holy fire.  I wanted to build a pi +holy damage dps spec similar to yours.
---
I've been hearing that the nodes are split by the amount of layers. For example, is there are 50 nodes and there are currently two layers, than each layer only has 25 nodes on them. This makes it feel like there are much fewer nodes to farm from.
---
What a useless thing
---
Level 39 Priest here. How does the +Healing or +Shadow dmg gear work?
---
e.g. If I get a +30 Healing Staff will that give me +30 to each and every heal I cast? What about HoT?
---
If I get a +30 Shadow dmg chest will that give me +30 to each and every shadow spell I cast? DoTs as well?
---
Not the picnics specifically, just the shear amount of stuff.   
---
You're sitting in a raid, the tank needs 5 min.  Suddenly everyone is turning into cats, tauren, putting down picnics, spider webs, driving tanks around.  That's immersion breaking to me.   
---
I wouldn't mind subtler toys or maybe some kind of limit to the toy spam you can put out.  Just my opinion though.
---
The original WoW launched 7 Nov 2004. DM came out March 7 2005. In the original WoW there were only 4 months between launch and Diremaul. That is why I think 6 months till P2 being unlikely.
---
A bit but it makes me feel better, like I‚Äôm doing more. Throw a shield and wand enemies for a bit to help kill faster
---
Yeah, it's totally believable that entry level jobs at a game developer, when WoW was under development, was around $16,500.  
---
Game dev studios have been infamous for a long time for having employee exploitation as the standard model.
---
Ye faction balance does
---
Probably. I stopped buying skills at 32, sold everything possible on AH. Would even sell boes I could use. Don't use any mats for your profession!
---
A disguise.  What are you hiding? HUWAH! It is Meltar the undead warlock.
---
Well there's a much better sense of progression since you're always get new talent points and skills and learning your character a bit more progressively. A level 60, its pretty much a static  "get better gear"
---
No it's not a catch-all. Just because it's not a combat mechanic doesn't mean it's not core. Here's a list of what I would consider "core". All of which have serious issues.
---
* Leveling
---
* Combat
---
* Class balance
---
   * PvP
---
* Reward structure (drives player incentive)
---
* Gear progression path
---
   * Catch-up mechanics
---
* Vanity diminishment
---
A few things not "core"
---
* Battle pets
---
* Transmog
---
* Mounts
---
* Achievements
---
Some of the quests and bosses can be pretty easily done at 52, but for full runs you want to be higher.
---
They played about 70%
---
You need enough regen to cast a single healing touch every 2-3 kills in my experience. Is extra spirit needed for that? Unless you are aggressively powershifting while soloing, but that seems like a great way to boost downtime for little benefit
---
I need to see this with a Dwarf.
---
Seconding Benediction.
---
What do you mean by near the top of the loop?
---
Ever since my daughter was born last year I have not gotten more than 4/5 hours of sleep on average. For the first few months she was home and out of the NICU I slept mabye 2/3 hours a day. I legit felt like I was right back in the navy.
---
I feel like this has become some sort of theorycrafting argument devoid of practical considerations. Healing for 813 vs 794.8 is totally irrelevant for tank healing. A tank healer spends his time precasting so the heal lands as soon as possible after the damage. He's also usually one of several tank healers, so there's a lot of overhealing. The important thing after hitting a downranking breakpoint is to be able to keep casting for the rest of the fight, meaning regen and mana pool become important. You've already kindly put forth that earthfury has more regen, but you keep avoiding posting the gear you propose, so if you could also do an intellect comparison I'd be very grateful. 
---
If I'm right about the interaction between 8 piece and 5 piece, then the 27.8 mana you save per cast in your scenario wouldn't be enough to compensate. If I'm not right, then the question becomes who runs out of casts first, someone who spends 27.8 mana less per cast or someone who has a mana pool for X additional casts. Then we throw in the fact that 8 piece is also two additional heals to other people, which doesn't benefit the tank, but it does benefit your healing and the raid overall. 
---
And finally, we have to examine how feasible your gear set actually is to obtain, because if it contains items like the helm from Azuregos, then I can only wish you luck.
---
Fuck this guy, play how you want
---
Questing is the worst part of this game.
---
After so many years of wow, I am pretty good at jumping over rivers
---
Paladins are not recommended for tanking for that reason. You can consecrate later, but until then... you're mostly just using DPS abilities on top of Righteous Fury.
---
Lol at OP blocking everyone
---
Maybe sort your life out if judging other people so is something you actually do.
---
There‚Äôs a leather one from ZF as wel, can‚Äôt tell tbh
---
I am 47 years old here and played Vanilla from 2004 until 2010 or 2011 (can't remember but I think I stopped at level 85).  Having a great time with Classic so far and am on two servers.
---
On a PvE server I have a Level 46 Warrior and some alts (16 Priest, 15 Hunter) and on a PvP server I have a Warlock to level 27.  I am just going at a slower pace than I would have for Vanilla.
---
I work in Infusion/Oncology now. Used to work the floor and some ICU
---
how the hell are you holding aggro
---
I was in the private server version of Storm like 2 years ago before it turned to dicks. I think it was a merge of like...&lt;SECURITY&gt; and &lt;Sanctum&gt; and some other dudes. When I was in SECURITY, it was a fantastic bunch of people. Then it added a bunch of elitists, constantly pushing to be "the best".
---
Like...you can play the game how you want, but it is a really uncomfortable way to be when most people just wanna play the game. I'm not surprised they got server first, but I'm also not surprised they're apparently huge assholes.
---
That's a really good idea, I might do that as well. BUT WHAT DO I LEVEL? I'm leveling a druid first char
---
I play a warlock and I do that. I know it‚Äôs practically worthless but it makes me feel a little better lol
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat, realising I don‚Äôt enjoy playing caster while my mage is close to 47 and the questing being tedious makes me not want to roll... but I‚Äôm so close to level a warrior. If I had more time I wouldn‚Äôt be hesitating but with 3 hours a day on average I‚Äôm not sure I‚Äôll stay sane not being able to do end game content before another 3 months...
---
Thank you for your service.
---
Would you do the same IRL? If you were at a bar and someone told a story about their sibling dying that you thought was fake - would you call them a liar to their face?
---
How many times did you exploit raid layering to get it?
---
Its sooooooo hard to pug groups. You definitely have to make those relationships with other classes to get dat gear.
---
It‚Äôs a picture from launch day that I sent on Snapchat... love the passive aggressive assholeish tone though

I'm happy to be playing on a PVE server this time around because I'm Horde on Westfall and we're outnumbered like 4:1 so if this were PVP I'd be fucked lol
---
But you aren't influencing human behavior in the correct way which is the whole point. You ironically are supporting ninja looting further by perpetrating this flawed abuse of the system. 
---
The appropriate course of action is to inform the community of what is right and what is wrong and allow them to take their actions accordingly. Could this result in a potential ninja? Sure it could - but can you guarantee that? Absolutely not.
---
The whole need first crowd is trying to avoid a potential scenario that may not even exist. It is wholly illogical and not the appropriate way to go about things.
---
I always invite anyone I see near me in a kill quest - often in item drop quests too cause I find 2 people can kill 3 mobs faster than 1 person can kill 1 mob.
---
However, some people will decline because they may be close to finished, and don't want to feel obligated to stick around and help you finish.  Important to consider both sides. 
---
 That said, some people with only 2 kills left have joined and help me complete the entire quest, and I have done the same for others at times.
---
As a mage, I completely agree with this sentiment. I have seen so many low level mages trying to aoe farm 2-3 mobs in the open world and im just like.....why? Sure you killed 3 at once but it was the only 3 mobs up and now youre doing nothing waiting for them to respawn lol
---
I believe that ability is called "Clarity".
---
If they reserve ALL the orbs, then clearly dont join those groups. Strat live is a overall bad place to get geared as a tank and most of the times Id ever go strat live, is for the orbs. Reserving the first orb is imo therefore not a problem
---
Haste as a stat wasn't in vanilla, but trolls have berserk and shamans have bloodlust
---
Yeah, so?
---
Profession question for my 33 priest. I'm currently enchanting and mining with the idea to switch to tailoring eventually. When is a good level to do so? I want to make as much gold as possible so the idea of selling Mithril and later thorium is intriguing, however taking up tailoring will also give me mats to level enchanting faster. I've been saving all my cloth on an alt so will be able to level tailoring quickly when i do switch.
---
&gt;If most people suck you‚Äôd still bring a shitty warrior over a shitty rogue tho?
---
Uh..... no. I'll bring the guy who can vanish if he fucks up instead of the bad Warrior who has 0 utility and no "oh shit" buttons.
---
Spider belt is super important to be able to break free of binds.  After that I would say stack health and look for trinkets that break CC
---
Is this BFA
---
Tanks reserving Righteous Orbs for Strath Live runs has been going on forever. They have no other reason to do the instance otherwise, so of course they'll need some compensation to be spending their time there.
---
Have 6 more, so there will be some variety.
---
I think we should stop enabling tanks since they are becoming the most spoiled group of people in the game.
---
The term isn't new. It has been done on private servers, which coined the term devilsaur mafia.

oh yah. just start in the highest lvl zone. solid advice for lvling.

As someone whose leveling a dps warrior alt and has tanked everything I just don‚Äôt invite dps warriors. Low level tanking now is better using a 2h which is basically the same as dozing. If you can‚Äôt do that, you are likely bad. The few dps warriors I‚Äôve played with have all
---
Been bad, so ya.... seems the better warriors realize you can dps as a tank... warriors 52 now and I imagine trying to avoid dps warriors is going to get way more annoying.
---
At least based on the logs in MC right now it's Warrior &gt;= Rogue &gt; Hunter &gt; Mage = Druid = Warlock
---
This is 100% true. When I leveled my Paladin in WoD, I completely ignored all the content between the first queueable dungeon and 90-100. I had walked away from the game in WotLK and came back in MoP, but I've never completed a single leveling quest in Cata or MoP content, despite having three capped and well-geared characters in WoD.
---
Even PvP has no sense of achievement with its gearing system. Once you blow through your "catch up" reserve and the initial flurry of gear is gone, that's it‚Äîyou're done. You have your optimal pvp set with nothing more to look forward to. There's no incentive to raid, because there's not much there that is going to help you in your PvP endeavors, and aside from a transmog set and titles, there's not much of a horizon for you to work towards in the world of PvP either.
---
And therein lies the problem with retail, its almost entirely designed around the sub-unsubbers and the 30-60min a day players. Rather than incorporating more bite-sized content into the old game design philisophy that created a dynamic, vibrant world, they normalized all the peaks and valleys to create an accessible bowl of oatmeal that was designed around giving people with only an hour or two a day everything the game has to offer. That sounds good on paper, but that no-lifer in purples with legendary standing on the Orgrimmar bank roof is the thing that makes you dream big and set goals.
---
There's nothing compelling about standing on the conveyor belt of loot score until you max out. 
---
It's just like any hobby. As an example, a gearhead/tuner is working hard on their car because they have a dream and a goal of getting as much performance out of that car as they can. That grind has with it a thousand built-in rewards that make it exciting and fun. Each leg of the process presents challenges and accomplishments along the path to success. 
---
Now, if money isn't an object and they can just roll in like Uncle Moneybags and buy the best production supercar in the world, then nothing is worked for; nothing is gained. There's no appreciation for the process, no rewards along the way, and no obstacles to overcome and therefore no compounding sense of achievement.
---
Or if all they have to do is repeat the same five tasks every day consistently over time and they will get the car of their dreams, that might sound good, but after the initial run there are no more challenges, no more obstacles to overcome, and no more compounding sense of achievement. This, inexorably, transforms the relationship with their dream car into a checklist item of "oh, finally! I got it!" rather than a conglomeration of achievements that says "look at this thing that I built piece by piece."
---
When our character sheets stop being project cars and start becoming sticker chart rewards, lottery prizes, and graduation presents, then they become flaccid acquisitions rather than an effigy of our personal successes and failures.
---
I can give you my first hand experience as of the past two days. 
---
Leveled shadow up until 55.  I had zero issues healing all dungeons up to ST and BRD arena/angerforge runs. 
---
I even healed a BRD arena run at 49 and it was fine.
---
Two nights ago I singed 55 mid dungeon during an angerforge run, and we decided to continue on tho everyone wanted to go to IF to turn in some quests before we continued. I took the break to respec holy, and I can say that the second half of BRD would have been tough as shadow spec, but I saw a huge difference in healing output/efficiency after the respec. It was a breeze. Then last night (at 56) I healed a full Scholo run. It was fine, but again I can say it would have been really challenging if I were still shadow spec.
---
That said, my goal was always to level shadow until 55 (when quests start to run out anyway) then respec holy and dungeon grind to 60. This makes healing really easy and also gives you 5 levels of dungeon runs to gear up for end game. 
---
So to answer your question, 55 is a good level. That‚Äôs when you‚Äôll get to the dungeons where having a healing spec will make things really easy.
---
I agree with you but I don't see it ever going away. On a daily basis I work with the imperial system and the metric system. 
---
Any airplane that enters US airspace has to conform to FFA regulations which currently mandates the usage of the imperial system. Changing just this alone will cost a ton'o cash. 
---
Then we have massive signage that would have to be changed. Remember, Germany is about the size of one of our mid sized states.
---
This is all before we get close to public opinion. In short it has become part of the national identity for some weird reason. So no... not going to change.
---
Yes strong authoritarian, not communist lol. Goes to show how much of it's actual definition is lost these days.
---
I feel you. I ended up just doing it. I was playing my shaman and the flavor just wasn‚Äôt for me. Every few days in my head I‚Äôd say, ‚Äúdamn I should have rolled warrior.‚Äù So here we are, 40 shaman parked, gold sent over to my new warrior. It already feels much better. As crazy as it sounds I‚Äôm having more fun leveling now than I have been since release.
---
Is there any point in having hit higher than 9%?
---
You also have restorative potion which removes magic effects, curses etc
---
Don't communist leaders stack the deck in their favor though?  They keep their masses uneducated and in the dark about what is really going on.
---
Our mission statement was to have wow just on the side and play together when we can. If not then not playing wow and waiting for someone to catch up is not a big deal.
---
Especially so being adults and having all kind of stuff around to occupy yourself with.
---
It's not as straightforward as that, because supply of goods is changing along with the amount of gold in the economy. Yes there will be more gold in 6 months, but there will also be more goods. The price of 16 slot bags will be lower, there will be more BoEs available, there will be more high end crafting materials available. The buying power of a gold will depend on the balance of this supply and the demand of your server.
---
"yikes" lmao
---
When it's the 20th time you make a run to a certain boss, do you still need a map to find your way? at this point who cares if it's a straight corridor or has multiple paths. 
---
Why are even arguing about this on wow classic? world design is a huge part of why a lot of us are even here to begin with.
---
ffs after killing every Eldritch being and immortal godhead in the universe, the gnomes can finally reclaim their home from some irradiated troggs.
---
Nice repost buddy
---
&gt; in vanilla being dismounted in water (coupled with the multi second mount time) is an important wpvp mechanic which gives lower levels a chance of evading ganks by mounted high level players.
---
And this friends is why you do the damn quest for Aquatic Form. I saw a druid swimming in Cow Form yesterday and it made me sad.
---
You can bring a lvl1 here and have a 60 grind for you whilst you sit and leech exp
---
\* laughs in poor\*
---
Sure, we can still dps competitively if put in the work, we can tank anytime we like, we have stealth to farm content and a spec that can do both pve and pvp with godly wpvp power. So suck on that cat/bear balls.
---
54 is still too low for last boss, and it would be hard to find groups that intend to go past golemlord but not finish the dungeon.
---
This use to happen during vanilla it's nothing new. The first orb would go to the tank and any other drops after we're free to roll on.
---
Lmao I was joking
---
Are you implying that a screenshot 8s something else than taking a shot at your screen? *hides gun*

Congrats. I also got one of these. Got it while questing in Feralas lol.

---
"I am an ass and proud of it"

Confidence, sadly, is most often inversely correlated with skill.
---
I didn‚Äôt realize there were so many heathens in the Horde. Schweppes is the little brother to the amazing Canada Dry.
---
A lot of Californians have been moving in and a lot of costs for rent or buying land in places have skyrocketed, while the businesses pay the same(because the economy in ID is not based on real estate market).
---
It hasn't gotten as bad as Portland or Denver yet, but it's getting there.  It's not on the hip-o-meter because it's conservative retirees wanting land moving there rather than fresh graduates that like liberal mj laws.
---
So, genuine question, you guys start using aoe at 4? I thought aoe became effective at 3+
---
I have it for everything I'm ok with breaking a cc with
---
There are edge cases for everything but for the most part your time on target is the most important thing.
---
Also macroing a help no dead into it will select the next closest target if your target dies, that way you don't have to right click or tab to another.
---
Never been a fan of "clit-dick" myself, prefer "girl dick" myself. Although "lady-wiener" is kinda cute...
---
Yeah, a 1.7 speed main hander just plain isn't good. A slower green/blue will do more damage even with less weapon dps.
---
Go do Hinterlands Elite Quests. Already overdue at 52. Awesome neck and trinket that will take you well into level 60 until you can get Mark of Fordring I think its called.
---
I‚Äôm not the least bit surprised a person with this UI took a picture with their phone.
---
Right, but if those profits are not to be found with alchemy (when you take into account the opportunity cost of gathering the herbs) then you're literally wasting all of your time training up alchemy, and the mats + time you spend making the potions from the herbs.
---
You could instead just sell those same herbs on the AH then and be done with it. Or skip all of it together for more profitable usage of your time.
---
All of this assuming the end goal is to make money of course. If you enjoy the journey and the work that picking herbs takes you on, then it's only yourself that can put a time-to-gold ratio on that.
---
When a warrior goes full ZOMGWTFDPS mode - they drain healer dry and then die. When rogue does that - they just Vanish and continue damaging.
---
Try rp-PvP server
---
The alternative to Auctionator et al, is to actually learn a market yourself.  For instance, as a skinner I was often listing thikc and rugged leather.  I knew the going market price and if I saw listings below the going price, I often bought them and relisted. Or bought and relisted days later once the price had rebounded upwards. The add-ons just do the same thing but for everything.  Personally I prefer knowing a few markets very well, normally ones tied to my professions.
---
Fuck guys I was joking lmao
---
I think thats true in terms of the larger scale battles (tarren mill, capital raids etc.) But the day to day skirmishes shouldnt be affected. The game is very clever at making pvp beneficial in contested zones, whether it be fighting over a quest mob respawn or for gathering profession purposes. 
---
FWIW, i enjoy the encounters with the opposing faction just the same when they dont end up being hostile, its just the tension that forms thinking shit might go down that adds to the excitement.
---
I understood it
---
I know how much you love clinging to definitions
---
ad¬∑just - alter slightly in order to achieve the desired result.
---
Sounds like we adjusted the system to me.
---
Well it works out to this:
---
If you have a epic mount you should mount up if you have to run more than 6(running) 8(aspect) 10(travel form) secs.
---
If you have a normal mount you should mount up if you have to run more than 8(running) 16(aspect)  22(travel form) secs.
---
Its called peak performance
---
I wish I had a friend group that played so we could level together. Would be way more fun.
---
&gt; I like the story element personally. My Druid doesn‚Äôt have a vocal tract while in animal form so how am I gonna communicate
---
I mean if it's just a vendor, I'd imagine a Bear could make a purchase by growling and pointing.
---
Yea I agree with you it's much more valuable to warriors and rogues which just makes my point. I have nothing to put into that slot that doesn't automatically go to every warrior who is running. If I wanted to have literally the only usable trinket worth anything to an Alliance hunter I'm immediately an asshole.
---
Someone that grinded GM doesn't know that power leveling services exist?
---
The pictures aren't even in focus...
---
Pfft I was indeed joking
---
Yeah, I don't know why were wasting time mocking Gnomes when a simple punt is all it takes.
---
Lol any decent mage would just instantly r1 blizzard on top of you. It might have some niche use, but not being able to use it in combat is pretty brutal. Also good luck ever leaving combat against a mage or a lock lol
---
I too work with both systems on a daily basis. Working as a welder in a heavy duty shop you‚Äôre forced to work with both, as manufacturers from metric and imperial countries collide. My point wasn‚Äôt to get the US to change to the metric system, but rather that one is more intuitive than the other
---
Let me explain this slowly for you to understand. You create a BASIC framework for people to follow and then it is up to the individual group how they want to deviate from the framework. You do not create rules for every niche category otherwise the framework becomes a list instead of a framework. The standard loot policy is as I have said nearly a dozen times now. Why is this so hard for you to grasp?
---
This OP is trying to establish that need on boes is the framework and I am simply stating that NO it is NOT. You can adjust the basic framework within your group however you want, but this idiotic mentally only states its ok to take items - it's completely counter intuitive to what you think you are accomplishing.
---
&gt;Warlock for fire shield
---
Druid's Thorns are basically the same buff, but does more damage.
---
Hard #nochanges is silly either way - There is nothing wrong with some QoL changes that don't mess with the core of the game.
---
Last night there was an alliance mage soloing Gorlash for the captains chest quest. He had it around 25% when I got there but he was ooming so I helped him finish it off with some executes. He thanked me and just hovered around the area, I figured he was going to repay the favor and help me.
---
Then a fellow horde warrior comes and decides to charge the mage out of nowhere. the mage handles him easily...because its a mage against a warrior. He gets pissed because I didn't help then the mage leaves, leaving me to try to find a group when myself and the mage could have easily duo'd it.
---
These people are the reason we can't have nice things.
---
Ah shiiiit man, you fucking didn‚Äôt just do that to me
---
5hrs a day isn‚Äôt even hardcore if you have work. I get up at 6, in office at 8, home by 5, food and chores done by 7, game from 7 to midnight. I would say 5 hrs a day is a lot if you have kids and a job and try to get adequate sleep
---
You can go arms and get some useful stuff like party and tactical mastery that allows stance changes. Imp thunderclap can help aoe tanking. Once you get to 50 you can put some basic points into shield block. Its doable if you sit down with a talent tree calculator
---
short answer: no
---
long answer: No.
---
A+
---
Did you see those youtube videos of mages solooing entire dungeons, making hundreds of gold per day? Did you see literally every hunter on epic mounts after an afternoon of farming elites?
---
All that gold is inflating the economy, it will drive the costs of everything up, like righteous orbs. So is it crazy when tanks monotize the only niche they have? What exactly is the alternative?
---
Nah depends on people not factions 
---
Doe the bigger faction on a server might be more aggressive (bc they can) 
---
But last time I was in stv a 50-60 20man group of alliance set up camp at nessingwary and one shit killed every horde in sight
---
But they will never know what it is like to get through a door.
---
Even the text above it fits somehow.

---
Both of those disagree with you.
---
Granted, locally it may have been different, but that what i was using.
---
All about the Professor Plums bro
---
Extremely high DPS in Raids, desirable in dungeon groups, very good/high skill cap in small scale PvP, most important class in BGs, only viable class in coordinated raid-size PvP.
---
I got stuck on an RP server back in BC and I have to say it was one of my best wow experiences. The community was 99% great people and even the 1% left over was still decent enough people. PvP servers attract the worst people but world pvp is my favorite part of the game...
---
As someone else who is disturbingly unlucky with drops, I feel your pain. 
---
I hit 40 on my mage a few nights ago and was still 30g short. Granted, I took enchanting/tailoring, but I stopped d/e'ing stuff at 20 specifically so I could have enough money to buy a mount. Everything was of value was sent to my bank alt, items get posted every morning before I head to work, and the AH gets scanned with Auctionator so I can have the most competitive prices. 
---
It seems a lot of people on this sub get 2 or 3 really good blue BoE's while they level that funds their mount then turn around and say, "lol had my mount money at 30!" but completely forget to mention those super lucky drops.
---
Are you on a pve server?
---
They're a lot more popular on pvp servers.
---
Of course dps is gonna be the worst, they make up more than half the group... 
---
Nice list though man.
---
Its literally a rare spawn dude
---
Elixir of poison resistance is great for escaping hunters who serpent sting right away (as they should).
---
Paladin: yeah welcome to the party pal..
---
it does sometimes somehow, I used it when i fell through the world in elywnn forest and it brought me to the GY in that zone
---
I told my friend to use it when a similar thing happened to him in a zone on Kalimdor, and it TP'd him to westfall GY, a completely different continent. Not sure how it works
---
To my knowledge the full-on hitcap is +16%
---
Struggling to remember. It's was something like 'STV patrollers'.  There was literally a 40 man raid grp walking up and down the  main road.
---
Big relief as I‚Äôm a first time player and on Westfall playing rogue. Having lots of fun with the game and would be a shame if I just hit a wall on endgame stuff bc of the character I chose.
---
You know, that's reasonable. We target swap 100% because of not wanting to waste combo points (my #1 gripe with classic rogue gameplay). Still, I'm surprised this the aggro swapping is prominent? We've got evasion and feint, so either the mob won't hurt us that much or we should be able to drop enough threat, but there are plenty of novices, I'm sure
---
A and I have no idea why just always have
---
Exactly, it put unjust pressure on people to go "talk" to other people and even join those so called "guilds", if this continue I'll be force to have human interaction, and we all know that the way I see the game is the way EVERYONE should see the game, those who don't are not real WOW players of course. /s
---
autodismount
---
I did this last night. 
---
Got finished with stocks, turned my quests in, and saw another warlock with that cool wizard hat on. Decided to inspect it and woah! It‚Äôs for warlocks only. I wonder how you get it. 
---
Oh man, you can get it at level 25! And I‚Äôm level 26. All you need to do is get a plant from duskwood and the wetlands. It‚Äôs 12:30, but it shouldn‚Äôt take too long. 
---
Okay, well I did it and now it‚Äôs 1, but it was fine. Let me log out and admire myself. Okay, time to click back and exit game. 
---
Except I didnt hit back. I hit delete. And in my tired stupor, I just typed out delete. 
---
Character was gone, automatically showed my next character, and then I closed my laptop and stood up. 
---
I was IN BED when I realized I just deleted my main, and only character above level 6. 
---
Jolted up, texted me friend that I‚Äôm quitting, and quickly looked to see if GMs cold recover deleted characters in vanilla. 
---
Thankfully blizzard is fully aware of idiots like myself, and left in the option to recover deleted characters in vanilla. So maybe I‚Äôm okay with 1 change to classic.
---
On the other hand. Free 5g üòÄ positive thinking
---
I use to multibox three shamans back in the day. It was probably the most fun I ever had with a video game. The power was absolutely incredible - unfortunately I don't have the budget for that anymore
---
A *good* tank can, but most people, even by 60, aren't good.
---
I guess you can farm as shadow then and deal with the respec costs
---
Clear every raid and get BiS?
---
‚ÄúRare‚Äù. The fact that you can guarantee him in every full ubrs run though means he‚Äôs not actually rare
---
Yeah it's definitely the best way to handle gear from a guild progression standpoint, but there's two big problems. First is that other people are impatient and get upset if they have to wait on "their" gear, and second is that the game isn't necessarily difficult enough to warrant such precautions.
---
It was very common in EverQuest though which is a much more competitive game (no instancing so all raid content is essentially world bosses). Your tanks and healers would be looking at significant BIS before most anyone else got anything.
---
Imagine you're a tank and a BoE drops. You need it. A rogue also needs it, and says he is going to sell it. If your other group mates roll need, win the roll, and give you the shield, are they ninjas?
---
Boots of avoidance are pre raid bis for mitigation and same thing for Wyrmslayer Spaulders.
---
I still remember our server's Scarab Lord: Kyt, the Hunter.
---
At this point I'm usually desperate for whatever kind of tank we can find, so I definitely understand that they have the power to make demands.
---
Almost nothing, ran my lvl 7 friend thru wetlands when I was 27, me killing lvl 23 mobs he would maybe get 3 or 4 xp. Higher lvl in grp caps xp for lower it seems
---
And ffs give the healer a stack of water when you enter the dungeon! Whether they ask or not!
---
Same goes for sheeping! Don't wait for the tank to mark or ask! As soon as one pack is done, find something else in the next group to sheep!
---
We never call 60 we stand and fight
---
But you run when you don't have the avantage behind your lil friends
---
Horde filth !
---
I personally would say switch along a cloth drop tier, around either 38 or 48, where new cloth styles start dropping. But that's just me.
---
Just get someone to enchant it with the first level of +wep damage. It'll remove the glow
---
&gt; Hunter's Mark 
---
Vanish removes hunter's mark.
---
Right. Class trainers have no reason for existing in retail and it's extremely sad.
---
When phase 2 adds the honor system, every server is going to be a giant massacre.
---
Do onyxia attunement, get pre raid bis gear from dungeons and ubrs (10 man raid).
---
Retail combat is OK.  I liked the Mythic Five mans.  They are a challenge.  The RPG loot elements are terrible, and basically aren't even a thing.  
---
The best part of Classic is gear, food, potions, and crafting, all of it, is meaningful all along the way while leveling.  Even end game.  I like that if I spend a bit of time doing X (most of it solo) it will help me achieve Y, and this repeats constantly from the early levels on.
---
I agree. Hate addons never use them
---
If it's a school or a wreckage, then yes the fish are limited. 
---
Other than that, most people use the audio or visual cues to notice when they have a fish, and if multiple bobbers are in the water it can be hard to distinguish which one belongs to who. So most people tend to spread out a little when fishing, rather than clumping up.
---
Varies depending on level, but there's folks levelling full groups of alts to 60 using this method.
---
The mobs also drop about 10s each, 1-2 runecloth almost every time. Plus greys, greens and occasional BOEs.
---
It's basically a gold-farm with XP on the side.
---
REMOVE THIS BLACK MAGIC FROM THE INTERWEBS ASAP. DO NOT GIVE NU BLIZZARD ANY IDEAS TO BACK UP THE .. DO YOU NOT HAVE PHONES?
---
Why not just take tailoring on the alt? Mail over the crafted for DE.
---
Seems like a nice trick!
---
No, Google pays more than fine
---
Carrot on a SICK
---
I'm a rogue, this is true.
---
Read my comment, read the comment I replied to. I too said 2-3 months of phase 1.
---
I didn't complain there is no content, I said we would complain if all we had was Ony/MC for a full fucking year. Reading comprehension = 0
---
I would be obnoxious and claim that "rdps" means "rogue dps" and whisper them anyway.
---
I know, I was there. It's still a great toy. Probably the one I used the most.
---
Can the other faction hear these emotes like the way you hear them?
---
I can tell how good a hunter is in raid by his pet. No wolf pet... means he probably doesn't know what he is doing.
---
Oh thank fuck for that, thought I missed it
---
Yes, no u as well.
---
It's still an inconvinience for him though. If he is already going to the same area or doing the same quest sure, but if he isn't then it means he has to stop what he was doing and go out of his way to help this other person do their thing. The money and (possible, depending on level) CP is a nice incentive but OP would be getting that doing his own thing regardless.
---
Don't think I'm saying you should never help people just to be a nice person, you should and I do. It just feels that mages specifically value their money per time spent more so than other classes and I guess we need to think on their terms when talking to them.
---
Ruff dude, I‚Äôm at lvl 39 with 60g.
---
Run more dungeons with a good group!
---
behind? math must be hard for some people
---
I can only tell you that 15 years ago warlock was my second character and from the little I remember shadow bolt was very OP and smash the hell out of bosses in raids..
---
So look on the tree and see a build fitting shadow bolt with critical damge and try make it work it's really fun and the damage was really insane.
---
That's all I can say because that's basically what I remember ;)
---
Good luck.
---
Cairns under drugs.
---
cross-server dungeon finder is just sensible so that groups fill up quickly
---
Orgimmar anyone?
---
I've mentioned this in other threads, [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LMGxdNio0zcZxfzox) is my current spec and the one I used during vanilla. I was able to tank up to the first boss in Naxx while still being able to reach rank 11 in PvP. The lower half of the prot tree isn't needed to tank.
---
As a tank I'd never step foot in a pug Strat live without an orb reserve. Not only do i not need any gear there, the dungeon is also a huge slog.
---
True though to blow a 5 min CD on something they can apply with almost no downside...
---
This is fine, you can either agree to thier terms or someone else will while you wait for another tank. Or just befriend a tank in your guild.
---
Bad lock
---
Nice drawing btw.
---
This is excellent! Dude great friction work. I love how this game can have community members that are this amazing!
---
&gt; Also, are there any important macros I should be using?  
---
I'm at work, so I'm going to have to use my terrible memory. In short, nearly all your abilities should be macro'd to switch to the stance that requires them. For example:
---
&gt;\\#showtooltip Disarm  
---
&gt;/cast \[nostance:1\] Battle Stance  
---
&gt;/cast Disarm
---
So if you're not in Battle stance, it switches you (off the global cooldown) and then hits disarm. This allows you to seamlessly stance dance without having to consider which stance you're in.
---
&gt;\#showtooltip Charge  
---
&gt;/cast \[nomod, nostance:1\] Battle Stance  
---
&gt;/cast \[nomod, @mouseover, exists, harm, nodead\] Charge  
---
&gt;/cast \[mod:shift, nostance:3\] Berserker Stance  
---
&gt;/cast \[mod:shift, @mouseover, exists, harm, nodead\] Intercept
---
Again, I'm at work, that might not be 100% correct, but I have a lot of macros like that. One keybind for two abilities, that will switch stances for me depending on what I need.
---
I accidentally completed the first part of Tribal LW quest (where you give 10 thick leather). Do I have to restart all of LW or am I able to respec still since I did t finish the whole quest line?
---
&gt; Rogue
---
Mirah's Song
---
In this context he‚Äôs just expressing annoyance at the know-it-all attitude.
---
The quest is in DM, so it should be phase 2
---
The numbers on your gear make me sick. Delete whatever addon that is.
---
Yo, same. Literally hit 49 two days ago on searing gorge with my rogue and was like hmm that shaman alt is looking really tempting now.
---
Tanking with a DPS warrior in group can be challenging.  
---
I tanked two WC runs yesterday.  Both were successful in that we finished with minimal deaths, but the one with the DPS warrior was quite difficult for me.  I asked him not to pull and to let me battle shout.  He mostly stopped pulling, but didn't stop shouting.  That's a big threat builder taken away from me (presumably because he had a higher rank as he was 21 and I was 18).  He also wouldn't stay on the skull I marked if he decided something else was higher priority.  
---
Often you can "juggle" threat in vanilla by letting a high threat DPS off tank the kill target while you manage everything else.  It's hard if that high threat DPS goes ham on multiple targets.
---
Reading comprehension friend. He realised he had to scroll down at 22, as such the other trees are severely untouched.
---
Every time I run it it feels like I notice something new. The only dungeon they've done that comes close to it in terms of creativity is that Suramar 5-man with the masquerade party.
---
I thought about this but main thing holding me back was that i plan to use this character at 60 and not in a rush to level another to 30 or whatever would be needed to get 300 tailoring. I also assumed that there would be some benefit to having tailoring on a cloth character at 60 but could totally be wrong about that...
---
Pretty sure the McD's in my area hire at $10/hr minimum. The Dominos hire at $15
---
I must be getting old. Is hyper the new ‚Äúhella‚Äù or something?
---
Because sometimes it's easier and faster to capture a photo with your phone than screenshot and crop. Quality is still decent enough for the purpose so why the fuck does it matter?
---
This is the correct action
---
Finish bis, max profs and start farming the rare/money making recipes, complete attunements, get epic mount, farm rep. That's pretty much the core of it
---
You know the server is perfectly balanced ratio wise when both side say the other side is the dominant force in the server.  Because as a horde on that server, anytime population comes up, everyone says there are much more alliance than horde with how they get ganked all the time.  And wowpop's recent update has the realm at 14.6k active player (those that showed up on the /who parse by users in the past 2 weeks) per side.
---
Awesome, i cant get past 165, i have a ton of 175 boxes, farmed a full inventory of the level 70 boxes and gained 1 skill, fuck that took me 2 hours for a single skill point.
---
Once you click on him to talk, you get dismounted and the flight math pops up.
---
You can spot the 60s on the mounts that dont move at all
---
Just change that "Filter" to Available only ;)
---
Man I was on Draenor back then and I remember a guy who did this.
---
Those sites are all wrong. I've done some proper analysis and on most eu servers about 5-7% of the population is 60. You can remove every player below level 20 because they play too little be accounted for as active.
---
The wolf in LBRS is he one you want. The black ones at the end, not the brown ones at the start.
---
Its the only pet with top rank for bite and howl.
---
&gt; Do you have the exact distance from IF Inn to the flight master memorized? If not, how is this graph going to help you determine which mode of transportation to use?
---
changing the axis around won't change anything about that?? Also cast range help with estimating distance
---
gotta admit i feel like 50 to 60 is the funnest. you can still grind for pre raid bis gear or good gear in certain dungeons while still leveling up. That level feels like the choices you make matter more since your so close to cap
---
What are you going on about? It sounds to me like you are seeing ghosts mate.
---
    #showtooltip Travel Form
---
    /use Travel Travel Form
---
This cancels travel form and re-casts with a single click, burning mana every single click,  You never see your character in human form, and instead you just see a dust cloud with each button press.
---
If you are at 100% mana, you should be DPSing.
---
&gt;I have a few years on priest and using max rank only is easily one of the biggest mistakes a priest can do.
---
Holy shit I hate when people say this.
---
Obviously at max level with sp gear you should be downranking. But at lower levels it is so dumb.
---
What else would people be comparing wow classic to, Final Fantasy?
---
We're both using chat, CLFG pulls from it. I just have a slick ui that lets me search by dungeon. That's it.
---
Fuck that? Don't be silly, what a strange thing to so passionately hate.
---
Ah another neckbeard comment.
---
Thanks bud
---
They also both play hockey. Must be brain damage. ;)
---
Cat camping the FP
---
That's sounds like a good macro too
---
Thank you. Hopefully it will be of some use to other people in the same way it has been for me.
---
I play on Faerlina, which means the only thing we'll be reliving is Asmon and his 26 guilds wrecking the server.
---
Yeah I agree w/ya buddy. I was getting corpse camped by a UD Rogue in Un Goro and I didn't call out in /1 for help cause I knew I wouldn't get any. I kept fighting him and eventually just left Un Goro for a little bit and grinding on some Pirates in Tanaris.
---
Thanks for putting in this effort, but surely there is an easier, and more functional, way to judge this type of thing.
---
It takes 3 seconds to mount up.
---
If you have a 100% mount then it's net neutral if you travel for 6 seconds after mounting. Anything after 6 seconds is a net gain.
---
If you have a 60% mount then the figures are, roughly speaking and for ease of use, 10 seconds travel or more to see gains.
---
I say this because I don't think many people, if any at all, know the actual distance between things. But we can fairly accurately guess how long it would take to get from X to Y especially on popular routes.
---
You‚Äôd have trouble convincing a group to repeatedly farm this specific boss. The last boss drops an amazing cape for a hunter, anyway.
---
O\_O confued wow player who lost track of time.
---
I‚Äôm not saying that just because someone can equip something they should roll need..
---
Usually don't shadow bolt too much while leveling.
---
Quick note on warlock lifetaping 
---
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more efficient for the healer to toss rejuvenate or renew on me once and let me heal up with my health stones than to drink after every pull. 
---
I lifetap because I know it‚Äôs more time efficient for me to dump all my mana and then heal myself than to drink after every pull. If I‚Äôm not pulling aggro (which I‚Äôm not) then you don‚Äôt need need to keep me topped off the entire time.
---
... tell that to my mana pool between pulls... I only need to eat or drink when I pull 3-4 mobs at once that are a level or 3 above me. I did a grind on ungoro fire elementals for hours yesterday without ever stopping to drink, and DP between mobs.
---
Thanks all for the answers, really appreciate it:)
---
If the tank didn't need a heal for 10 seconds, then you should bomb a heal on them to get to max health and drink while the next pull is happening.
---
Rank 1 renew is literally 50 health wtf why would you ever use that. Just let their spirit regen heal them.
---
I remember it as before.
---
Ya, rogues weren't nearly as broken in 1.12 and people know it... I do not miss the days of rogues who had no idea what they were doing winning every 1v1 they opened up on.
---
Its only the truth my man.
---
I'd say Spirit is low prio for Shamans since you're more or less always casting, even if it's just putting some earth shocks between your auto attack.
---
Wow THAT'S not a vanilla experience...
---
Thanks! I had heard this, but wasn‚Äôt sure if it was true. Congrats again on BiS mount
---
Well people are either rushing and not levelling up profs, getting aoe groups or just spending all their free time playing if they are 60 now. Me and my friends who are all seasoned aren't even 40. I've played since 2005.
---
My guild has 10 rogues in its raiding roster...
---
You're not using logic, you're using tradition, and trying to justify it.
---
Everyone that cares about logic should be using the ISO-8601 standard: YYYY-MM-DD. But go ahead and keep telling yourself that you're using logic.
---
You called it inner fire. I dunno what you mean by that, that's a skill. Did you mean you didn't skill it?
---
&gt; personally think that everyone rolling need on Rare/Epic BoEs is the best policy
---
Ima gonna leave my reply on the subject here:
---
If its boe i could sell and buy an same rarity upgrade for me, gold = item upgrade. so its an upgrade for everyone despite the class. 
---
Everyone should need boes.
---
Is this the thought experiment where people compare a "blizzard dev salary" to a "full stack dev salary" and then go "well they ***could*** be making..."?
---
Cuz I've interviewed for several jobs at Blizzard that paid above market rate.
---
None. I have never listened to any music while i game. I want to hear the game.
---
That's because you don't 360 the shit out of it.
---
Hadn't thought of this in YEARS!  Thank you for the laughs!
---
Congratulations
---
I have a guildie that will only tank for things he can sell. No one groups with him for this reason.
---
Thank you. I'm always trying to help out other players if I can and if this helps someone get their skills and mount, I'll be very happy. It's not fast, but it works.
---
Anyone have any suggestions for a horde grinding/questing guide to get me from 40-60?
---
I can only play an hour or two a day so I‚Äôd like to get to 60 as efficiently as possible and man it‚Äôs slowed down! I‚Äôm only gaining a level every other day at this point.
---
Even beyond linearity, what's sad is dungeons no longer have persistent progression anymore. After vanilla, there's no more ZF mallets, back door keys, coffer keys, etc. That stuff not only adds extreme RPG flavoring, it allows for farming different bosses specifically (being non-linear helps a lot with that too.)
---
I was gonna say the same..i'm on Kromcrush and every other whisper I get for dungeons is a rogue.
---
Guards can‚Äôt reach most of the world.   It‚Äôs places where the guards should be able to get you but can‚Äôt.
---
I‚Äôll probably give it a try then you motivated me!
---
alright i can understand that.
---
Rogues can't get groups. They aren't mages. You must have identified as a mage.
---
TIL there‚Äôs two auctioneers in TB
---
This.  I did this with something going for 8s a pop.   Bought it all out, costing me 24g.   Relisted at 16s a pop and not only did they all sell, the new starting price is now 16s so I jacked up the price to normalize it a bit.
---
Final boss of strat live
---
&gt;Is multiboxing against terms of service?
---
No, but it should be.
---
&gt; Go play on a pve server.
---
I mean, soon if phase 2 doesn't come around sooner, PvP servers that have the ruthlessly gank til no one can do shit, will be a pve server.
---
Phase 2 though? Open world is just one big ol' BG.
---
I mean I don't think you understand how these addons work. There's no matchmaking or anything like retail, just a UI to better read the chat spam. I don't see anything wrong with that.
---
Medium Pop in classic is the same pop as Full in Vanilla.
---
Tanking for pugs is always interesting.  If you get in a guild with some people you can trust, especially on voice chat...it's miles better.  With pugs you just have to accept you're going to get some weird situations.
---
I love the LFG chat channel.
---
I suppose it's just what you grow up with. I can't picture how big 1.9m is easily but if you say 6ft 2in I can visualise it straight away.
---
They need an incentive to run it. Otherwise why would they go? If they have no interest in going, but you need the help, and they could use a boost in gold, seems like a good deal for everyone. Otherwise don't have them tank for you and no harm no foul.
---
Thats not all, he's also really good at glaring at fire elementals.
---
So Op asked the pair if they were a couple and the girl said "no just friends". Apparently the guy she was with wants to be more.
---
Why, yes, the ISO-8601 standard DOES put the month in the middle. Unlike Europe, however, it puts the four digit year first, and two digit day last. The ISO standard is the superior date format.
---
Automation means less community engagement. 
---
Classic is about community.
---
Because Reddit Mobile does instant access to your Camera. On PC you have to Screenshot, Tab out of WoW, Go to Reddit, New Post, Upload and Post.
---
No one has time for that. 
---
Mobile it's 2 seconds.
---
I have a lot of friends working here. I've lived and worked in California for 10 years in a few companies myself. My inbox is full of recruitment emails. I know very well how much I would be making at most companies here.
---
Oh no, not my reddit career
---
Anything Glory Hammer or related for maximum satire
---
I don't understand #1. I've not done too many dungeons or 2v1 pve in my leveling, but i have kicked a secondary target and gone back to dpsing my main target. I didnt notice any CP lost. What am I missing?
---
You can also save a significant amount by having another warlock that completed the quests help you on the other step, since the items you buy for it are not consumed on use. People often charge a significant fee for it, something like 150g fee to save 250g on materials - or you can buy them yourself and then offer the same service.
---
I have tried both ways
---
Oh yes, I will edit my post (I'm at work and was going by memory)
---
Generally speaking, I haven‚Äôt seen specific boss farm runs in Strath UD. But if you found a guild group, I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd do it with you.
---
If someone in that group has the key, you‚Äôd be good to clear in under 12 mins. If you don‚Äôt, definitely won‚Äôt be hitting that 5 in an hour.
---
They are summoning Kazzak!
---
Exhalted with Bloodsail Buccaneers?  
---
If I'm not mistaken, the only way to gain rep through revered was to kill Jazzrik, which granted 5 rep per kill, and he was on a 5-10 minute respawn (I swear I've heard hours before). Which means 4200 kills of him, meaning 350-700 hours of constantly farming him to get through revered.
---
I have always gone to A without thinking about it and I‚Äôm right handed
---
You can see in the picture that they're a human mage.
---
Obviously fake we all know they will never advertise the game because they want it to fail. /s

It can all be represented using simple formulas which is most likely what OP did, all you need to know is that the running speed is 7 yards per second :
---
`y (distance in yards) =  (speed multiplier) * (run speed) * (total time - time to mount)`
---
|Scenario|Formula|Distance traveled|
---
|:-|:-|:-|
---
|Running for 1 second |y = (1)(7)(1-0) |7 yards|
---
|Running for 5 seconds |y = (1)(7)(5-0) |35 yards |
---
|Mount for 5 seconds |y = (1.6)(7)(5-3)|22.4 yards|
---
|Epic mount for 5 seconds|y = (2)(7)(5-3)|28 yards|
---
Now if you want to know the distance at which it becomes worth it to mount, isolate x :
---
`(1.6)(7)(x-3) = (1)(7)(x-0)`  
---
`-&gt; (1.6)(x-3) = x`  
---
`-&gt; 1.6x - 4.8 = x`  
---
`-&gt; 0.6x = 4.8`  
---
`-&gt; x = 8s`
---
So, in a race, someone that has to mount will reach the running guy after 8 seconds. That represents a distance of:
---
y = (1)(7)(8-0) = 56 yards
---
Which surprises me because OP says 65 yards.
---
Maybe I made a mistake somewhere? /u/sookey123, how did you calculate this?
---
I trick everyone with my subtle skills into thinking im a mage! you discovered my secret!
---
Which is thorns unless they are highly resistance to nature damage.
---
Yea I thought so but didn't want be a d.üòÄ
---
&gt;I kept getting ganked by devilsaurs

As if they aren't getting instantly nuked at their spawn points

Welcome to Reddit friend, we don't know why we are drawn here either.
---
My thoughts are good, As a warrior dps literally 99.99999% of the dungeon groups at 60 are Either Hunters/Warriors/Rogues reserving shit i need and refuse to take another melee. This results in me getting gear slower because all any group ever needs are 3-4 cloth users. As a result i have a tendency to tell people that want me to tank for them while they reserve stuff to eat shit OR reserve things myself that results in me getting rewarded 50-100g per run depending on what shit drops.
---
I can't count the amount of times rogues have whispered me to join BRD runs were HoJ is reserved and i simply go: If you want me to tank i'll reserve HoJ and they try to counter that i can get savage chest, fuck that.
---
I don't know why but when people reserve shit it gets on my nerves real bad. Instead of pushing 30+ runs each day they reserve shit and literally lock out half the classes because they want an item. And instead want cloth users to share between the 3-4 of them.
---
friendly plug for https://getsharex.com/ you literally press 1 button and can have the settings saved so it not only screenshots but uploads it to your choice of img hoster AND copies the link in your clipboard. Don't ever tell me cell phone is easier.
---
How much exp did you get for discovering SW at 59? I may do that with Org...
---
I prefer the term WMD farming.
---
Not long once you get your pace down.  Exact numbers are hard to say.  
---
Finding a group JUST for one boss isn‚Äôt going to fly, though.  What you‚Äôll want to do is advertise for Stonespine, since he‚Äôs a rare spawn and drops some Pre-BIS.  Then you‚Äôll get people showing up, you can see if he‚Äôs up, and kill the one boss you need.
---
You can enter the instance and spam /target jed without killing anything. He pats around, so you need to spam for a minute or so. If you can't target him in that time, run out, reset, and repeat until you've got him. Makes farming reeds super easy.
---
Not everyone is rushing, I'm not even 40 yet. This forum is a self selecting sample of no lifers who will tell you it's normal to be 60 now.
---
Can rogues only have CP on one target at a time?
---
It doesn't automate anything.
---
Plenty of popular addons automate aspects of classic without getting hated this much.
---
By your own logic theres no reason for anyone to answer your question, so kindly fuck off :)
---
Agreed, I love the red and orange grass
---
Female undead warriors are great. When they use skills with one-handed weapons they do a flip.
---
For the autoattack, it works like this...
---
&gt;\#showtooltip &lt;skillname&gt;  
---
&gt;/startattack  
---
&gt;/cast &lt;skillname&gt;
---
The idea is that if I hit Maul on my keybinds, it should not only try to Maul the target, but *also* trigger my auto attack.
---
It's better than actually having attack on your toolbar, because (a) one less button and (b) the attack button turns off auto-attack if you hit it a second time, whereas these macros only start the attack, never stop.
---
90% of Reddit is unfunny shitposts
---
Years first is great for file naming or anything that need to be sorted but perceptually either way is fine imo.
---
I agree. Asmongold should be banned for Layering abuse. There is literally clips of him doing it. It's super sad that blizzard blantaly ignores it because its streamers. Same thing with Jokerd, don't get me wrong he is an amazing player. But he layered abused to 60. All these people should all be banned.
---
Just picked this off a random mob, was still an improvement on what I had but yeah, just 4 of everything please
---
You can filter them too by only the ones available.
---
AOE looting was the best QoL change Blizzard ever made
---
Yes you can fish for him, but he IS a rare spawn.
---
My only problem is feeling exhausted after a run.
---
There is no reason for me to put the discord app on my phone. It‚Äôs only an excuse to you because someone isn‚Äôt doing it the way you want them to. I wouldn‚Äôt give a shit if someone wanted to write their replies on a piece of paper and sent me the pic. As long as I can read what they‚Äôre saying they are free to do it how they please.
---
Well obviously that goes without saying. I don't think anyone complains for you being outside of guards reach in the middle of ungoro crater.
---
‚ÄúLFG SM Armory. No mail users.‚Äù
---
Legit saw a warrior saying this. Instance with only one boss, who only drops mail and a weapon for warriors and paladins.
---
I'm an idiot, I use Wardrobe
---
Yeah, but what if you have movement or mounted speed increases (i.e. Pursuit of Justice for paladins or Carrot on a Stick).
---
When you're creating a group and you want to reach out to as many people as possible what do you do? You go into a major city and ask in trade chat and lfg. With this addon you no longer have to go into major city's which makes the city's feel less alive. Same for if you're looking for a group. Now you just sit outside whatever dungeon you're trying to run  and use this addon. This addon makes the game feel less alive and there's no arguing it that's why it will be banned and 40k downloads is nothing.
---
Try classiclfg and never deal with the clutter again. Ignore the misinformation-there is no automation.
---
XD XD XD
---
Use the default red question mark, and you dont have to write anything after #showtooltip, it'll automatcally pick if it recognizes.
---
Personally, I had very infrequent issues with my warlock pet which forced me to specify the rank in my macro, so try that.
---
Yeah but Outfitter isn‚Äôt in it..
---
Thats what its all about !!!
---
And yet it isnt.
---
Some people find raiding fun and leveling boring as fuck. I love the 40 man raid experience even if the content is relatively easy. You know what that's called Mr Neckbeard? An opinion
---
If there are two players with equal gear and skill, one rogue and the other a fury warrior, the rogue loses on DPS every time.
---
As someone who is new to alliance, do people hang out in stormwind or ironforge more? I used to be horde in vanilla and wanted a fresh experience. Everyone gathered in Orgrimmar of course.
---
I agree with everything except.. "Need on BoE", but if that's what the group wants I follow it as well. 
---
The big point is loot policy is set at the start, before everyone travels all the way, and everyone agrees to the same policy.
---
Exactly. A +stat green could be better that a poorly optimized piece from MC.
---
I've tried and it works like a charm :)  
---
Do you know how I can change the value of the shield? Actually it works just fine but I think I need to adapt it in case I gain spellpower etc.
---
Well distance is the domain in this instance so it makes sense that time would go on the y axis.
---
I swear Reddit is like a ducking diary.
---
It's great that multi-boxers (with the intent to sell level 60s) isn't against TOS because of $$, but I'm sick of seeing them here.
---
Roll a tank and solve it then. People love complaining, but they dont do anything to solve it
---
I don't understand why golf is enjoyable and people spend thousands of dollars on golf shit every year. That's just life.
---
Had a rogue in rfk that refused to open a chest for the group. "Why are you guys rolling it's locked? I took the time to level my lockpicking therefore it is my chest!" And proceeded to loot chest and left group.
---
Johnwick and Johnwick's dog
---
Evidently you are correct.  I guess we just didn't use them in my guild, or I just can't remember that we did.
---
Meh, doesn‚Äôt really bother me either way; one system is just as arbitrary as the other. There are very good usability reasons for having a system based on divisions by factors of 2 or 3 rather than 10. I just find it amusing to annoy the ‚ÄúMeTrIc Is SuPeRiOr!!!‚Äù neckbeards by pointing out the obvious failings in their system.
---
I wouldn't be able to assist with that since I've always been in a group with either a key or rogue.  However I would recommend the addon Atlas which shows you were bosses are in dungeons in terms of where they spawn via number order.
---
If only it was just the city. We have insane development in every outlying area. Prices going crazy and displacing people. The point is the speed in which it is happening. This is a very recent development where people are becoming unable to afford their homes anymore. We also don't have the infrastructure for such commutes.
---
Lol 100%
---
Ahhhh ok. Cool. Wow so there literally are two addons that do this, even though zero come up when you search ‚Äúgear‚Äù on twitch. Jeeeez talk about shit tier SEO lol
---
Worth doing the key quest; you can skip right to Arena using the key by going up the ramp and jumping into the arena from above.  Just be careful, the spectators will be hostile since you haven't done the arena yet but you can squeeze through the 2 packs pretty easily.
---
Yes it did lol it sucks
---
Dude. Unsainted off We are Not Your Kind is insaaaaane.
---
Any chance you listen to the new Korn stuff??
---
I am full on addicted like I was when I was 17 and played this for the first time.  I was hoping that it would subside when I hit 60 but it just grew stronger.
---
If you're only playing an hour or 2 per day, and your warrior is your alt, dont expect to be raiding with it until 6 months to a year down the road when you hit level 60. Also, make it the same faction as your druid so you can send it gold and gear. As a dps class pre lvl 60, your gear should be a non issue
---
Hey I messed up, try Wardrobe
---
Lol alright my guy well have a niceday. try to not be such a fucking asshole
---
Grats you lucky bastard!
---
Ok you aren‚Äôt going to change your mind and that‚Äôs fine. I think you are completely off base and totally illogical. I also think this need before greed mentality breeds mistrust and creates more ninjas. 
---
But feel safe abusing a system and using it wrong. It gets you the intended result you want so you don‚Äôt care. You still argue en you have no facial basis of support because you think the end goal is all that matters. When if people just died what they are supposed to it‚Äôs actually more fair. 
---
You think gold = item and that‚Äôs the complete opposite of how the systems are and how they should be used. But you do you. Just don‚Äôt expect not to get kicked from some groups if you do that and it‚Äôs not been established in the group.
---
Better to be a knowledgeable fucknut asshole than an unknowledgeable piece of shit lmao
---
That only applies to focus dumps like claw. Bite is a 10 second cooldown and costs 35 focus. You can leave both bite and growl on autocast without running out of focus. In fact, your pet will occasionally cap out on focus instead, especially if you have the BM talent for high focus regen. You're just losing out on free damage by not using it.
---
Mb first time posting here will move it
---
Razer is super hit or miss. I‚Äôve had a deathadder since like 2011? or 2013? But I‚Äôve gone through 2 black widow keyboards, both of which broke within 2 months. I‚Äôm using their new ‚Äúmechamembrane‚Äù keyboard because it was on sale for cheap. It‚Äôs lasted longer than the black widows ever did combined 3 times over.
---
Facts, kitty cats in STV drop whiskers that give at least 75s a stack, and on top of skinning and other grey items, you should be gtg
---
Technically they are right that it doesn't much matter which race you choose, however....
---
Orcs and Trolls get racial abilities related to ranged weapons, which makes it easier for you to land attacks on higher level monsters than yourself. For every level above you, the mob gets harder to hit, until around 4 or 5 levels you won't likely land any attacks and your pet will do even worse (because the pet is always about half a level behind you). So it's a tiny bit easier to level as troll/orc (assuming you stick with the weapon they get a bonus for.)
---
At high end raiding that makes a big difference because it allows you to forego some +hit rating gear for +agi or whatever other stat is useful, thus increasing your dps output over a similarly geared and specced and played hunter of another race.
---
If you're not going to raid it doesn't much matter.
---
I think their exact words was medium today, has more players than a full server in 2006. Full servers were pushing 3-4K in 2006. A high pop realm was 2.5-3K. 
---
 [https://wccftech.com/extreme-wow-classic-queues/](https://wccftech.com/extreme-wow-classic-queues/) 
---
&gt;While we are able to fit several times more players on a single realm in 2019 than was the case in 2006, we are not going to raise that cap any further, even though we have the technical capacity to do so. Raising realm caps would simply forestall the problem, letting more players in at launch but creating an unsustainable situation down the line, with severe queues when we turn off layering permanently before Phase 2 of our content unlock plan.  
---
&gt;Please also note that our realm population estimates of Low, Medium, High, and Full are based on this increased capacity ‚Äì **a Medium realm today already has more characters on it than even the most crowded realms did back in 2006.**
---
14d played and only to 54?!
---
Why? For world pvp maybe.. but other than that who cares. People cant play effectively enough to be legit good unless it's like 5 mages in a raid just having to press frost bolt repeatedly.
---
Jesus already?! Gratz. I just dinged 60 2 days ago ffs.
---
Its the most satisfying feeling when a group of low levels ganks the 60 that's been terrorizing them.
---
Last night a 60 mage was helping his warrior friend level. The warrior, feeling mighty with his friend, charges me. I kite him and get him to about 10hp and then his mage friend steps in and polymorphs me and then proceed to kill me. Repeat 10 times, I never start attacking anybody and only defend myself when I get attacked.
---
A group of us finally decided enough was enough and killed the mage and the warrior 10 times until they took rez sickness. The best part? My rogue guildie was at the GY and camped them even more until they logged off.
---
Happy to help man! If you got anymore questions you can PM me so we don't spam post :P 
---
I'll send you a screenshot and a list of all my add-ons. Got them all off twitch which is real simple and easy to use. You can copy it or get an idea and make your own.
---
If you send me your macros I can have a look at them too :)
---
Is that random world drop? New to classic, not sure how everything works yet.
---
This is an excellent mouse for the money. Been using an M901 for two years.
---
&gt; As that was my stance, your counter argument is should be that statement. 
---
I'm not trying to be a pedant, but I don't know what the hell you're trying to say anymore.
---
Why dont you google? There are hundreds of videos and posts.
---
Have a personal character you play normally, a second character you level with friends
---
Man. They're going to flip out when the meeting stone lfg are enabled..
---
You're finding a tank in 5 minutes max?? What faction / server
---
My personal best is 9. Not sure I'll ever achieve anything greater.
---
Quests are to bait questers, questers bait the gankers, gankers bait the pvp. It‚Äôs a highly complex system
---
There are so many people who just don't get why people play Classic.
---
Good for you.
---
Best way to play the game.
---
You obviously know you‚Äôre the one being the asshole here, keep trollin
---
you only have time to cast it once before losing to both mount. Blink let you gain 20 yards so it's 68 yards for 60% mount and 85 yards for epic mount
---
Not very narcissistic when its a post I made..to answer a question I asked.
---
&gt;I tried gaining information 
---
Which is why I didnt give out information on an exploit. I dont want people to have that information. Im not sure what about this is hard to grasp.
---
&gt;You just wanted to take information with out giving anything
---
Why should I tell you the exploit when you havent told me how to submit screen shots? You just want to take information and I have to trust you give some back in return. Thats not a very good trade deal.
---
I asked a question... you could answer or just downvote and move on. Or you could ask for more info if more is needed (no more is needed for this question)
---
You just sound entitled. Like you deserve to know the exploit or need to know it in order to answer the original question(which again, you dont). Or you like to argue. Either way I dont really care I got my answer (without revealing context because its possible to just you know..answer a question).
---
It's sad you feel the need to make sure you get something in return before just answering a question or helping someone. Hopefully you arnt so entitled in the future. Try and just help a random person someday (just be aware you may not always get something in return)
---
Have a good day. Im going to kindly fuck off and I hope you do the same.
---
As must the Horde.
---
Glad you enjoyed, haha
---
I actually listen to the wow expansion playlists on Spotify. It kind of creates a cool ambiance of mixing vanilla zones with, say, the wrath playlist. I highly recommend trying!
---
good shit
---
This has been posted and deleted here several times.
---
Why even post it? We all know these services exict.
---
They lose out on nothing by not going to a strath run, this instance doesn't offer gear opportunities for them.  There is a pool of 0 tanks that are slightly knowledgeable about the game that want to run strath more than once.  
---
By level 50 or so a tank typically has a full friends list of people he actually wants to run with for non moneymaking runs.
---
Yeah, everyone knows epics aren't for wearing. They're meant to be endlessly sold.
---
LFG channel is global...dude. You never *had* to go to major cities. 
---
Before this I'd do a /who for the class and level I want and ask people directly or nust guild runs.
---
Now i feel lonely. Wish I had a group of people to level up with. I had a friend who said he would but bailed out and stopped playing.
---
I use level 4 myself but again it only notifies you if something tries to elevate. Regedit will obviously do so, and most installers do too.
---
Justice must be served.
---
Borderless windowed is the only option other than windowed. Fullscreen was taken out a couple years ago with the introduction of DX12.
---
I was there, 3,000 years ago... Star always meant Sap in vanilla
---
Yeah at 30 i can only fort buff 4 people then have to drink, so i usually start with the tank and then the rest and while im drinking they can start pulling.
---
I was being sarcastic as you are oblivious that alliance do the same exact thing. I haven't seen a single horde gank squad
---
Did you even read what I wrote??? 
---
I said trade chat in major city's.
---
Been playing the game since it came out.
---
Can confirm we used damage meters while raiding.
---
Yea agreed I dont know why everyone seems to get so offended by this. I just personally dont see how its fun but apparently that's a wrong opinion. Have a nice day my guy
---
Agreed. In this particular example it's obvious that one should mount. Casters at least have a great intuitive ability to gauge maximum distance if they don't have the in-game range memorized.
---
I.e. the above poster is a priest so the range of his Mind Blast is 30 yards. If he wanted to go to a quest item more than twice that distance then hop on the 60%.
---
How is it different from: Pick up phone, Unlock phone, Open Reddit, Click post, drop phone and pick it back up, take picture, hit save, hit post.    
---
Oh wait, it isn't. I can add random steps to make it seem longer too.
---
Each spell has a coefficient, basically how much spell power affects them.  Hard casts are based on a pre-talent 3.5second cast time, so shadow bolt being 3seconds is 3/3.5 = 0.85, or 85% efficiency.  So out of 30 shadow damage on gear, 25 would get added to your final spell cast.  Hardcast heals are the same.
---
Dots and Hots are instead calculated over a 15 second base duration (not to exceed, though), and since most dots/hots last 15s or longer, they get 100% efficiency spread across each tick.
---
Talents like imp swp will add 1/2 extra tcks at the exact same damage, instead of spreading it out, so that would make it 133% effective on SWP if I remember.  On the other hand, imp renew is based on base-renew healing only, which makes it worthless.
---
Using this spec barely affects your HPS and also increases the effectiveness of 90% of your totems.
---
Yeah because it wouldn't inconvenience you in any way, you'll never be in an area with bad service where it would take longer to DL the photo rather than pure text. You'll gladly type out the long URL they wrote in the pic in your browser, because copy pasting is only for try hards right.
---
Lol imagine you were building a bird house, and you were ghetto rigging it together. And a woodworkers sees it and recommends you use proper tools to make the product end up cleaner. But you insist you lacking the tools isn't an excuse because you're perfectly able to build a shitty bird house. "There's no reason for me to own a band saw, it's only an excuse because I'm not doing it your way" completely ignoring it's just a suggestion in the first place.
---
Look you're never going to convince me otherwise, and clearly I can't get through to you. Keep doing what you want just know that some people hold themselves to a higher standard. It's okay if you don't
---
I drunkenly sold 15 gold worth of wool cloth for 2s a stack. I walked away with 35 silver though so thats cool I guess.
---
I love it. Keep on going guys. &lt;3
---
I am level 36 so I got that going for me
---
With my right hand.  If its any consolation that is rank 1 demo shout and I never bothered training it past that... Battleshout is better for aggro than Demo shout is.
---
Shift-7 is the limit of my reach
---
Nothing but truth here.
---
Gonna be a push to hit 40. 30-35 is more reasonable. I'd say do some level appropriate quests and do dungeons once you're safely in the level range of mobs.
---
The other Resto Shamans must love you, that's some pretty big prio.
---
If you are below that you are also doing something wrong.
---
Most of WoW classic leveling is knowing which abilities you actually need. As a druid I'd be at about -50g right now if I bought all my worthless abilities I never use.
---
You will never find a rookie group that is willing to kill only that boss. So dont get your hopes up that much.
---
Boss fight will end like 30 secs-1min. Stratholme trash is cancer tough.
---
Sounds too similar to https://xkcd.com/927/
---
I had a group whisper me yesterday asking me to heal live strat righteous orb runs. first one went to tank (100% fine), next were free rolls. I had a good chuckle,  and said if you're whispering me i want 2 guaranteed or 50g. He didn't seem to like that  and ignored me.
---
I'm in my 30s and I think you're setting your sights a little high. It takes about 2 hours per level in your 30s (maybe others are way faster?) In 20 hours I don't see you getting higher than maybe 35. If you're really efficient.
---
That's good. Hope you and yer pal get banned for breaking ToS. Good luck.
---
And what macro would the second one be?
---
Sigh, sure. If you're going to ignore everything I've said.

That's just gaming companies. If you go beyond gaming the gap gets only wider.
---
I started using borderless windowed years ago anyways so I wouldn't have known, thanks. There's now literally 0 excuse for phone screenshots. If you played in fullscreen I could MAYBE understand
---
Hm yeah, that's pretty much it. I personnaly don't dislike that, I like to totally clear zones I play in, and do everything I can. Achievements help me find that, and without them, I might forget some things. But not everyone is like this, I understand that.
---
Shame!!! You lied!!!
---
"hey, can I have &lt;time and help&gt;"
---
 "sure, 50s. Can I have &lt;more of your time and help&gt;"
---
"Sure 2g"
---
WHAT AN OBTUSE MORON.
---
Isn't it like 60 seconds or something? That's close enough I'd say.
---
9g at level 22? Fucking Jeff bezos over here
---
Sell to vendor, that's what the prices are based on. This is just showing *guaranteed* profit because you can flip it to the vendor.
---
As he says in the post, you could potentially make more money selling to players but that varies server by server.
---
As a LW I have been crafting nightscape tunics to make money for a long time. Made about 20g over a couple hours while doing homework just by crafting and vendoring. For most of the recipes OP posts I recommend vendoring almost all the time (if not all the time). These recipes are so commonly created (due to how simple/cheap they are) that even if you only put a couple items up you often get undercut by the time someone wants to buy them...
---
Most people don't know the command, I don't think it's documented anywhere in game.
---
Alternative is to click on the [loot] text in the chat window, that will open the loot window as well
---
Yes, you do, but most blacksmiths will do this either for free or for a small tip. I've attached several people's spikes for free, because I also advertise that I'll craft and sell my own spikes in trade chat whenever I'm in a city.
---
Only tamed this one to learn a new level of bite.
---
I guess I should add that I'm lvl 28 right now lol so yeah I won't be using that at 60.
---
I would have already finished.
---
Not a single one  made a shit load of coin tho
---
I thought I was stupid for a yard
---
Yup this is my last name lol
---
Did they increase the drop rate in classic?  I played vanilla from day 1 and had 4 60's and never had a single epic rando world drop.  Now in classic I've found 3 epics before hitting 60 (Hit 60 two days ago woot) an underworld band and a bow of searing arrows that I found while solo questing and a Jeweled Amulet of Cainwyn that I found while grouped with another fellow and lost the roll.
---
Fucking boomer game my dude.
---
What level do you plan on running Deadmines? You say "mid-teens", but I would expect if you're not at least level 17 this will end poorly.
---
It's a better placeholder than natures grasp with no improved natural weapons IMO. Either go for the weapons, or ignore balance entirely.
---
Oh, so you're Holy/Disc, not deep Holy.  That wouldn't make a difference then.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but there are no other +SP buffs in Vanilla?  If so, maybe there was a mage using Amp Magic.
---
go neck yourself
---

Nope. It started in vanilla but you had to click the meeting stones. Then later they added it to innkeepers. Then in wotlk we got the system that's now in retail.

My boar was called Borat.

My cat is called Meatwod because I can't name him Meatwad.

My gorilla is called Stonks, cause I was looking at a meme when I tamed him.

I always name my pet, usually something stupid.

My Mooses name in retail is Dog. I still get a kick out of it.

This is a classic in group out group phenomenon...  If you just play the other side you would write it the opposite way...  
---
I think if you play pvp expect anyone not to live a jedi codex while on the hunt...

Either you like it or you don't but to expect that it's all honorable people on both sides is not realistic at all.

Trust me I've tested it, 1.0 is significantly better than 1.2. I got BT after an hour of searching. Layer hopping is your friend.

With that being said, I 100% believe that the best hunter pet is the one you want, not the meta.
---
It had no matchmaking, nobody wants to run a dungeon with 5 dps or 5 tanks.
---
1) Don't be disingenuous, that's not all you wrote.

2) You asked me **what I do**. I don't spam trade chat for groups.

3) You ignored my points because you can't refute them.

If you're going to be argue semantics over 3 months, then no, it wasn't 15 years ago. It was 14 years, 9 months, 4 days between each launch. Or 14 years, 10 months, 8 days¬† from vanilla launch to today.

Ive got 3 in their 30s and a lvl 19 rouge that I'm saving to twink tf out
---
That's what I was trying to get at in my mythic raiding comment, it works when its the same group of dedicated people, and everyone knows it's a group collective. 
---
But, HONESTLY.. in classic it has many more risks. 40 people, which in reality becomes like 50-60 people (As the same 40 people wont attend every raid), and the content is NOT nearly as hard (YET). 
---
It takes so much longer to fully gear these players as well.. Boss drops 4 pieces of gear max? Even the loot council will have to wait till they are geared. 
---
I prefer a guild like yours, and it is one I am looking for. A mixture of the two..
---
Tl;dr I like your system, but that is NOT the norm for loot council raiding.
---
came here to say this lmao

Isn't that travel form? Thought they were both 40%

---
I‚Äôll add my 2cents. Am 42 mage alliance.
---
For dps/tanks:
---
Be careful with aoe/cleave dmg if CC‚Äôs are involved. This may mean tank should move a group a little if cc breaks and is re-cast.
---
Mark targets. Most will single target a skull, easy to see who‚Äôs not targeting skull using dps meters. Shame them thoroughly after the pull. :)
---
Other mages:
---
Don‚Äôt assume every group wants to aoe grind the dungeon you are in. Communicate with your group, and don‚Äôt be an ass.
---
Everyone: communicate with your group, and be friendly. Being a decent person will buy you much leeway in every other thing mentioned in this post, assuming you don‚Äôt do it over and over.
---
Also, loot before bis stuff is not worth getting Uber pissed about (I know it sucks when the feral Druid needs your Illusory Rod, give him shit, but don‚Äôt dwell) 
---
If everyone communicates and tries to be a nice person, most of these issues fall away.
---
Thanks! Was actually looking for more recipes now that I'm closing in on 300 &amp; have 5-6 full boxes full of random meat on my bank, hopefully most of it will come of use :)

Enjoy the game bro! No rush, as it is not a race to 60.

In fact those who make it to 60 first are probably those who will bore first from the lack of new content.

---
Domain is not really relevant in this kind of graph, domain and range are mainly for measuring a single function.
---
There are two different kinds of graphs, one which show functions over domains and ranges (usually only relevant to the study of a single function), like the kind you learn about in calculus and trigonometry.
---
Then there's the other kind of graph (I don't know what it's called, if it has such a name, but it's the sort of thing used in Science and Engineering) where the variable you are measuring the X and Y against are not something the axes represent, in this case, the thing that is varying is the function of distance over time, (which conventionally should be Y/X).
---
For the second kind of graph, technically it doesn't matter which way the axes are for the purposes of domain and range, as you're measuring functions against each other, rather than measuring a single function against it's input.
---
It just so happens we usually measure things with respect to time, and because time is perceived to pass left to right (I challenge you to find me a timeline that goes right-to-left!), that is the convention we have.
---
So every year we simply get more mages to cast blizzard into the ocean, solving global warming once and for all.
---
Down ranking dots is also good for healers.  Handing out Rank 1 SW:P to all the rogues you see will prevent their vanish for 15 seconds.
---
Is the mount 90g or 900g?
---
Hahaha, they can suck it. If they are just contesting resources, fair game. A similar level gank? Fair game. But you pussy out and kill someone 10+ levels below you? On the list, expect revenge. üòÇ

1. Are you in combat when they join the party?  If so, they won't appear until combat has ended.  This is an unfortunate bug that affects all healing addons, due to the way Blizzard prevents healing addons from re-ordering frames during the fight (to prevent the AI of the addon from making the healing decisions for you).
---
2. I don't use this feature.  I keep the spells on one of my action bars so I can buff randoms.  
---
3. I'm at work so I can't be sure of the names, but it should be in Panels -&gt; Text, in the bottom/middle of the settings screen.
---
4. Neither could I.
---
The quest at that point is does the pet double dip resistance or is the damage split before player resistance is applied
---
Are there patch notes for today? Or was it just a server stability patch.
---
You can get in combat just by being close to mobs. So if they ran past them that couldve been the case.
---
Ran it three times a week ago and was able to target and destroy them. Good on you for being a good guildie!
---
Sure, however with +healing it's way more effective.
---
Definitely. Who knows, if I end up liking the class enough, I may make it my main. In that case, I'll likely have a bit more time to do dungeons and level quicker than if it was just my alt.
---
Or if you can MC it and heal it back up then kill it from 100% to get full XP? 
---
Few things to test tonight I just hoped I found a bug so Blizz could shower me in many fine jewels

There's not a huge difference in them, the difference is majority of people use Reddit on their phones.

Can you apply spikes to already bound shields?

There is an addon for this, its called "Spy". You enter their name and if they are around you'll get a raid warning sound.
---
and thats only 1 layer
---
&gt; But that doesn't mean the T1 stuff is bad.
---
It kinda is, when alternatives from dungeons are easier to obtain and better.
---
wondering about the same thing.
---
It's an uncontrollable combat pet with a 30 minute CD. I don't remember whether it would follow me around, but it was really useful if you were able to make it while leveling.
---
A variation of grabbing Prep, Hemo, and Dirty Tricks in the Sub tree, Cold Blood in the Assassination tree, and Improved Gouge from the combat tree.
---
Well, yea, he hasn't bought any skills.  He probbaly can't even buy em all with 9g.
---
Yeah bro you keep holding aggro on that one mob with your increased threat while the other three run rampant, you‚Äôre doing great. Have fun with no rage
---
but that's this app with more steps
---
They probably don't want you as arms because mortal strike uses up a debuff slot for nothing. Deep wounds is also a low value debuff but it has a low priority so it doesn't cause any issues.
---
As for your damage, I don't think it will be as importqnt seeing as you're not 60 yet.
---
Even if you don't have everyone that high it goes pretty quick. I think we did it in a hour and a half with a 45 tank, 43 hunter, 43 mage, 42 shaman, and 41 Priest.
---
A few deaths and no wipes so overall pretty smooth.
---
Ultimately, the responsibility is on the player to know what buttons they should or should not be pressing.
---
Oh that's a very handy video! I didn't realize I had to continue taming pets throughout the levels! 
---
Essentially it's the kind of person that ends up on the receiving end a lot on level 60. After continuesly being pounded by bears (druids and others), the twink makes a level 19 character to regain his confidence.

hardcasts or instants based on 3.5s, dots/hots based on 15s but wont exceed 100%).

# RUN YOUR ZUGGIN' ASS BACK WITH THE REST OF US.
---
You're not special, you don't get to sit and wait for the healer to run back and start casting res. There may be respawns, and even if there aren't rez is a 10 second cast and a good chunk of mana. Stop being a Lazy peon.
---
As a Tauren, I took a screenshot of me standing in the middle of the river bordering the Ogre compound that separates north STV from south STV.  I couldn't believe I didn't get dismounted there.
---
I keep a mental track record of how many times I get unfairly ganked by ?? and then gank that many alliance below my level within the same region. Perfectly balanced as all things should be.
---
Nope, a druid and why did you delete your post if I am the problem?
---
Its still a mechanic as far as i can recall! But ye its not expected from a classic dungeon that i concur üòÖ
---
TBC is garbage.
---
Just make sure you don't ding from exploring elwynn Forest or the one North of STV!
---
Yup, I've never been attacked one on one before, everyone avoids us like the plague in solo scenarios. The only people to attack me were either "??", when I'm eating/drinking, or in a group.
---
Hello Officer, I would like to turn my self in.
---
A couple months ago? It's been out for one month?
---
In your favor for what? In this case, nothing even drops for tanks here I don't think. There's no real incentive for anyone to tank it, and that's why they're able to tank for people with these terms.
---
This is cringe.
---
So I tanked lower levels (up to lvl 50) in retail and it's my first time as a tank in classic. I have zero confidence because I'm not sure if I'm messing up or my party is.
---
We were in Uld and it was impossible to keep a group of five on me. I think the warlock was using hellstorm (aoe fireballs?) and then the priest would get aggro. This is before I even have two sunders on the skull. How do you deal with groups of mobs in dungeons?
---
Bummer.
---
TBF, not figuring that out probably did make you really bad.
---
Blizz might consider this an exploit, not 100% sure but be careful
---
My retail VW is named Klaththik. Poor guy has a lisp, but he keeps telling me to go play classic.
---
Completely anecdotal. My experience has been the opposite.
---
I mean... tanks should mark...
---
As a healer I kinda groan every time I get a warlock in my dungeon PUG.  #notallwarlocks but many of you guys life tap like there is no tomorrow, which means I waste a lot of mana healing you.  The end result is you end up using a lot of my mana that could've been spent healing the tank and I have to drink way more often
---
Don't forget itemization
---
Looks like a remake of shadow dancer
---
Thanks a bunch that‚Äôs great !
---
Thanks! Got it done with some help from the guild last night. I hadn‚Äôt killed Pyron yet despite being 59 and having run BRD more times than I‚Äôd like. Helped being a mage so I could teleport and ghetto hearth around to turn parts in while they waited for me.
---
I've played both factions and I can honestly say I like horde a lot better. I find their starting zones to be much more interesting and aesthetically pleasing.
---
I didnt delete it. A Mod did because of flair
---
I wonder if you can still cheese warsong gulch and take the flag below the map
---
Or just extend the first door up like 1 foot, we only barely don‚Äôt fit.
---
It is why my level 58 robe I can wear within half a level will ne equipped.  Stats are better then my current robe but it is butt ugly lol.
---
&gt; you would have been 16 at the time. So I doubt you were raiding MC and possibly not BWL.
---
Why would a 16yo not be raiding MC and BWL? What? That (or even a bit younger) is probably the time when you could no-life that shit the hardest. 
---
And where's this idea that meters weren't used coming from? The vast majority of mods that exist on retail today existed in some version in vanilla: Damage meters, boss mods, auctioneer, etc. 
---
Maybe you were in some guild that enforced some age limit or something, but a ton of people who are in their mid to late twenties today were in their teens in 2005, and plenty of them raided all the way to Naxxramas. I know I did.
---
Can you use this to read trade when you're not in the city?
---
People aren't deleting their own posts, it's the automod. Anything without a flair gets deleted after 5 minutes. 
---
Kinda annoying that this requirement isn't listed in the main rules, you have to look in the detailed rules to see it.
---
If you can find Mageweave Cloth under 2silver 60copper a piece, you will be able to craft it and sell it to a vendor for profit. Correct.
---
If you find the cloth for an even 2 silver, you will make 60 copper profit on each piece of cloth. This vest needs 15 pieces so 15*60 copper per vest.
---
Correct.
---
Lol. Distance changes *depending* on how long you travel. The opposite is not true. Just look at an afk guy mounted. His distance is not changing, but time is. 
---
The lines are velocity... distance *over* time. OP‚Äôs graph is if you travel for X seconds in this form, you travel Y distance. 
---
If you have the same graph without either axis labeled, how would you figure it out? 
---
At each point, you could know the time spent (because one second from now is one second from now...), you know the velocity (mount speed, travel form speed), so you are solving for the different distances in each form. 
---
Yes, you could work backwards, do the calculations then graph it, but having all the information does not mean choosing what you are solving for is the dependent variable because you plugged in the other number first.
---
Not rudimentary, non existing. 
---
In both cases, if the 5 member is a tank he would get into the queue, before and after patch 1.7, the fifth member could be anything he would be put into the group the same.
---
Seriously, this.
---
IMO, you can tell you actually played end game in classic or not by who is complaining about this. 1st orb to tank in Strath live was the status quo.
---
I hear she bake cookies for everyone under lvl 10
---
Ok, that being said, would Elemental precision matter at all in this instance since we're dealing with lower level mobs?
---
this is like that time I met a level 19 mage who didn't know he could conjure food/water.. he spent all the way to 19 sitting and waiting to replenish his bars before pulling another mob
---
Which raid bosses? I've used it (post BC) on raid bosses. In fact, some fights require it for switching tanks. Is that not the case in any classic raid?
---
We are good to go and yep it‚Äôs wildvine good thing I checked lol thanks again
---
Yep just put your real pet in the stable temporarily. When approaching pet you want to tame set a freezing trap, concussive shot, tame beast. As soon as you tame feed pet. Then it varies from 1 attack to idk 10 kills you'll get a message saying you learned (x ability). Then you can teach that to your real pet
---
Also, make some effort to learn BiS. I am looking at you healers rolling in arena spell hit belt.
---
https://youtu.be/Oja0yn4--Kc
---
Here's an example. You can't just take a bike ride raw footage and time lapse it. It will jerk all over the place. Hyperlapse basically takes footage and processes it to ultra stabilize it. 
---
https://youtu.be/sA4Za3Hv6ng is a video explaining the technology. Go to 4:40 to show raw footage, 10x time lapse and a 10x hyperlapse example of footage.
---
Venomsaur was added in wrath.
---
The app literally does that for you, or i could ctrl print screen and then draw, add arrows, bubbles, blur and pixelate what i want before saving the screenshot.
---
True
---
Not true. There are just very few drops for them. Besides, quests, money, helping guildies, etc... plenty of reasons to tank besides loot. That said, I would "expect" is the wrong for most people wanting a tank for Strath live.
---
Badlands elementals, they never even hit you as a frost mage and drop 6-15s in vendor greys. Plus some of the greys AH for engineering leveling
---
Depends on the loot council. The one that follows 'what's best for the guild' is a fucking joke considering how faceroll the content is.   
---
But the loot council where you simply reward people that come on time, come with basic consumables, enchant their BiS pieces, don't do any major fuck ups is pretty good as it's simply roll+1 rule except that people who slack on purpose get to roll last.
---
Drain tank gets awesome at 38 when drainlife starts outdpsing wanding. It's smooth sailing from there. If you're bored, you can try to fear juggle mobs. Dot a mob, fear him, dot the next, fear him, fear the first when he gets close, etc.
---
Yep dragonscale was still there we good thanks!
---
I‚Äôm kind of torn on this, cause at the same time you can justify needing all gear to vendor for money to buy gear for yourself.
---
Expose Armor is good for getting a 5pt EA up,  resetting the fight with blind or vanish, pooling energy and reopening for big damage during an opener. Its situational. Better if specced into via the assassination tree.
---
Rupture is great for bleed kiting and keeping rogues out of stealth.
---
Picked it myself!
---
You are not going to hit 40 lol
---
Since we're talking about video related settings, does anyone know what would be causing increase in GPU load when around certain lakes and bodies of water?
---
Doesn't seem to happen with all water, and lowering the water quality settings did nothing. That one circular pond on the west side of Un Goro Crater is the worst for some reason.
---
Do you have anything pertinent to say at all? The topic was salaries. I'm sure Blizzard also has more or fewer letters on their page, or the colors are prettier. Or the weather in Irvine. Or 7 trillion other random facts.

Did you also realize you can press a button called PrtScn and it'll take a picture of what's on your screen without having to reach in your pocket and pull out your potato?

They're out there! You just have to find the guilds that are Vanilla players that aren't too hardcore but already thinking of how to gear raids.

I found mine through endless BRD runs for the Nagelring for me and the Savage Chain for my Hunter buddy.

Good luck man!

level 19/29/39 alts with best in slot gear that avoid leveling at all costs and only PvP in BGs, as the BG level ranges are 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc.
---
30 is a reasonable goal for a paladin.
---
That's because.. you're a Guild Master now. What do you think people do who know what they want but can't find it?
---
This only applies to boes ofc...
---
You obviously are salty over the difficulty in leveling your toon. No fear you will be OP at 60 so why not enjoy the ride knowing it will be better instead of making this type of post?

I will hold up a run waiting on someone who does this because I am not drinking so they don‚Äôt have to run.

what unit do you work? I'm going through the program right now and playing classic on the side for stress relief. Any tips?

Likely before Xmas imo - sometime in December

What add on are you using for the health bars? I have healbot but it‚Äôs looks shitty haha
---
This, disenchanted a random lvl 30 green offhand with armor (not sheild) as a druid. Then was like huh, googled it... turned out is one of best druid tank items in game.
---
Found this restoration link, had my item back magically in my mailbox in like 5-10 minutes!
---
Blizzard isn't twisting your arm. 
---
Also their marketing seems decent, seeing as you came and reposted it here for free?
---
alright will get the key then
---
Especially if I'm only LT'ing down to 2/3 or so health to top off my mana - I'm fine, I don't need to be at 100% health at all times.  So there really should be a tip up there for the healers: "If your warlock is LTing don't worry about healing them unless it's below 50%".
---
Ranged is easier because if one of the toons is off by a few feet it hardly matters. With melee you need all of them on the same spot. It's why u mostly see ranged multiboxers. 5 shams is or 5 bookings are usually the best.
---
I have a Hunter alt named Earnhardt.
---
His pet's name is Dale &lt;Earnhardt's Pet&gt;
---
What guides?
---
Icy Veins and WowHead both recommend Leader of the Pack for all of their tank builds.
---
Not sure where you are looking.
---
That's a very valid point, which I can say the same to the guy who replied to me. My server has over 70% horde, so take that for what you will.
---
i prefer the older one, i like making my own auras, i found the power aura classic one was easier to understand  
---
i'll give it a try tho
---
Warlocks have an ability called Searing Pain that has a greatly increased threat value, kinda like Earth Shock and Mind Blast. 
---
Haven‚Äôt watched the video since I‚Äôm on the subway to work, but I‚Äôd imagine that‚Äôs what is happening.
---
Not just wow but many mmo‚Äôs use twink and twinking words. idk why
---
Some people just have a crazy imagination.
---
Not sure where you're seeing tank builds that don't take it? Only one I can possibly think of is the HotW/NS build which is more of a healer build that can sometimes tank. That one doesn't take it because it needs the point for Nature's Swiftness. If you're looking to tank full time, I fully suggest reading [Taladril's Treatise on Druid Tanking](https://www.warcrafttavern.com/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla).
---
Combat isn‚Äôt awesome for pvp, but it works okay.
---
Leveling combat pve is great and riposte is a must.
---
I accidentally hit a lvl 23 druid in mglade trying to train skills but thankfully they were Afk so they don't have to flashback to that brutality. They survived, barely.
---
I haven't gotten a healer high enough in Classic to troubleshoot that, yet.  I know it works in BFA.
---
I envy you guys. I wanted to do exactly this in classic but I never found a group/friends
---
Ye. Its doable. My GF and kid goes to bed early at 20.00. I Can play from 20-01 each Day. üòâ
---
gotta display his mighty intelligence that he is self aware the sub likes classic
---
This is a great guide! It describes the same way I leveled my LP - once I hit 250 I got the last 50 points from BRD doors and the lockboxes of BRD mobs. :) (I farmed BRD for HoJ anyway) Regarding the Items such as Teebos I am wondering the same really. Cant find any definitive info.

PvP yes, PvE no. You're not supposed to be getting hit in raids.
---
If it's for PvP though, mace spec is generally the way to go and that frees up a couple of points for you if you were having trouble figuring out what to cut for the other PvP talents. The mace spec talent incorporates the skill from Weapon Expertise and Weapon Expertise itself doesn't actually give any skill for maces. So that's +2 combo points for you to work the spec out with.

The main difficulty with Onyxia right now is the fact that tanks have a very hard time holding threat in phase 3. This is not how Ony worked on pservers, and some people are claiming that this isn‚Äôt how it worked in vanilla either.

I watched 6 members get banned from a PUG ZG grp as they were exploiting the Raptor boss several weeks in a row. I was on my Hunter at the time and there he was telling everyone in chat how were gonna do the "exploit" to safe spot the boss. Soon as four of us said no the GM popped up banned the other six. Apparently they had all been in the same group for several weeks doing this same exploit on the raptor boss.

Side note: The GM who helped was hilarious. B4 he left he left us with a free joke. Went like so

Now what?  You pretty much beat the game until new patches arrive...

human\_waste\_away - we are on the Pagle server \[NA\] \[A\] \[PVE\] and are looking to build up our core membership in the Rusty Ranch Raiders Guild for raiding and BGs.  We are an older group that are pretty social on our Discord, Rusty Ranch.  Our current WoW experience ranges from vanilla to brand new to wow.  I don't know everyone's raiding experience, but I raided a bit starting in wrath and then picked up more in MOP, then more so in Legion and at the beginning of BFA before quitting retail. 
---
What does your current schedule look like?  We are most active in the evening and night, but have people that play throughout the day.  Our plan is to raid twice a week, at night. 
---
If this works, you can always come hang out with us in Discord and see if we work for you.
---
My info is:

BattleTag: MereServant#1451

It's honestly a pretty fun feature, too bad it cost an entire major patch to get it in.

I found my original raiding guild, who had decided to come back together to play classic. It's been a blast. It feels like half of us are parents and while we want to raid again we know we're going to have other priorities too.

They are all 3 the same dps, axe is better because it's slower so you get more dmg from any ability that relies on your weapon dmg.

Lvl.18 Pally tanking
---
Lvl. 22 Rogue joins team, runs ahead and pulls nonstop with me sitting there trying to keep agro with just Ret aura and my melee. 
---
Only one died and that was on last boss. But holy hell that was a painful first tanking with Pally. Luckily at 20 I got my AoE skill and can now hold agro better.
---
Which server you on mate if gehennas ally u got yourself a mate
---
It won't be this year. You're fine.
---
(play CSGO xD)
---
Only positive experiences with loot council here. As long as gear goes where it would be best-utilized where's the problem?
---
As a level 47 warlock, I generally use AoE when there are 3 or more mobs.
---
I try to wait what seems like a fair amount of time before dropping it so the tank can build aggro but it never seems enough.
---
About how long should i be waiting to drop rain of fire?
---
Alright perfect. I figured it was a worthy enough of a buff. I just know there is a buff cap for raiding.
---
No, that's the opposite of what he said. Without the key you can get inside of the domicile by doing the arena and then get across the turning bridge without messing with the giant gear by doing the complicated unintended jump over the roof of the bridge.
---
This guy rogues.
---
It makes sense... I dont use reddit on my pc so I would do the same. Why do people complain about pictures?
---
Time to travel is what we're interested in. Not distance to travel. That's why it's on the y-axis, it makes it easier to see when the travel time for a certain curve becomes less than the travel time for another curve.
---
But that's just an opinion, it makes it easier for me to understand that way. Seeing the point that the walking curve surpasses the mounted curve and the corresponding distance. But other may be able to interpret it more easily the way you're describing.
---
Sounds like horde alright,
---
I remember a friend of my was pissed, I had asked why and they told me they had spent 15 minutes helping a horde player kill things only for them to later help a higher level horde camp them. 
---
needless to say I camped them for 10 minutes straight after this but they added my friend to their KoS and now their whole guild kills them whenever they seem them.
---
Let's not forget that THIS was literally one of the main "features" of 6.1... man.. us former retail bois have gone through some sad fking times
---
It was not nerfed.  People have unrealistic expectations, and do not understand how drop rates work.  Just because wowhead says something has a 10% chance to drop, or a 5% chance, doesn't mean that you'll get the item in 10 or 20 kills respectively.  People were posting here about precisely calibrated boomstick having a 5% chance to drop off some specific mob type.  If you only had to kill 20 demons and a world epic would drop for you, they'd be worth about 5g a piece.
---
No it's not, when you factor in the healing bonus you're missing.
---
This might help a little. 
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Resistance
---
I think spells like FN are either hit or miss, either they take or they don't and resistances factor into that. 
---
Precision might help but it still will only lower the percentage to 1% which is the min.
---
Battlegrounds, which aren't released yet, are PvP events that put 20 people in an arena to battle for 30 minutes.
---
The battlegrounds are separated by level brackets (20 to 29, 30 to 39, etc). So... players create characters and keep them at the top level of that bracket to give them the biggest advantage.
---
Brutal and wonderful. The amount of my care is trough the roof. You can tell even from PvP in this episode, that you feel way more stiffed if you have so much to loose. I feel these adventures are epic enough so I started making my own show from them.
---
Wow, total characters online at a time was 2m in both EU and NA... 4m in total ... What are the retail numbers? As an estimate?
---
If *you* get a BoE epic to drop, you can wear it or sell it.
---
If *your party* gets a BoE epic to drop, then everybody can roll on it, and if *you win it* then you can wear it or sell it.

No wife . No kids .lvl 22 atm =v
---
what realm is this? My undead need some footjob to be done.
---
Everywhere, which is why I came here to get a certified answer. Everyone has their own opinions. I question everything before just going through with just one answer.
---
A killed a horse enemy yesterday and he instantly added me on battle.net asked him how, he said maybe his ELV UI addon . Just right clicked my portrait and added me
---
I mean, it took him until level 22 to realize there was a scroll bar and extra skills. This is par the course.
---
As a druid, I would rather just have my current stat stick and not bother switching. It might make some quests/grinds a little easier, but even when I'm grinding I find the stam and str I get from my current weapon more useful as opposed to a slight damage bump against one type of enemy at the expense of a bag slot. 
---
It's a decent weapon, but for hunters and druids it's still pretty situationally useful. Warriors and Shamans can at least hit stuff with it.
---
My understanding is that ony and rag cannot be taunted, from what I have heard from others.
---
They aren't changing AV. This is the final vanilla version of the battleground.
---
I get 2.2k crits with shadowbolt in raids and half my gear is green SP boe's.
---
Warlock crits really take off once you spec into ruin at 60 and start picking up gear, but even then locks are notoriously weak until later on.
---
Set your goal for 30. Make sure you plan out how you want to level like 21-23 DM then 24-27 this or that.
---
It's harder to justify at 60. It's 99% useless in instances and only applicable against other melee for pvp.
---
Leveling up without a full kit?

It's amazing what happens when you Google these things and then they magically appear in your ad spaces...

The threat values for battle/demo shouts. Do they get split across each aggroed mob, or does each aggroed mob get the same threat put on it?
---
Melee right?  The stats look good for melee hunter with dalrends.
---
Yeah, if you lost XP in WoW on death, there would be a lot less tolerance for stupidity.
---
You posted that your experience was under market
---
I posted that my experience was above market
---
I pointed out that as our personal experiences differed we were at an impasse
---
You attempted to post broken links of 2 different jobs from an open review site as "proof"
---
I pointed out the vastly different submission rates for both sites call the veracity of the glass door estimates into question with the added fun that blizzard also happens to be "rated" as a better workplace
---
There's no way for you to "prove" your point as Blizzard doesn't post their salaries and neither do its competitors we also don't know if the job listings actually have the same structure or responsibilities as we're only guessing based on vague job titles. 
---
So again, we're at an impasse.

It's weird he has such a strong idea of what's fair when he expects tanks to tank strat live for absolutely nothing in return

No, it's just people at the top of the level bracket in Battlegrounds. Twinks are always 19, 29, 39, etc. and they have the best possible gear for that level.

You take a lowbie character and give them such powerful gear and enchantments that the character "twinkles" like a shiny star from all the enchantments and gear.

It's more that DPS is the least challenging, so it attracts less talented players.

I'll just stick to "Don't heal if you see Warlock life tapping period." 
---
If I see them getting aggro I'll help but if no aggro and they're taking damage... oh well
---
This statement is totally wrong and unequivocally false.  A hunter should ALWAYS be weaving melee hits in between shots.  It is by far the best DPS a hunter can do.
---
&gt;different functional preferences

They're replacing Snipping Tool with something even easier.  Windows key + S will let you clip a section of the screen automatically
---
Does Azeroth magic obey the laws of thermodynamics?
---
If skill and gear levels are assumed to be equal a properly speced mage should lose 0% of the time.
---
I encountered a lot of warlocks who were tap-shy while I was leveling and it made it hard to heal them efficiently.   A priest's most efficient spell isn't renew, and you're not likely to have downranked spells on your bar until 55+ since you should be stacking spirit, not +healing, at that level.  
---
I personally like to have warlocks lifetap to FULL mana after a pull.  It's a lot better for them to tap after a fight than during one, and a single max rank heal/gheal will completely heal them for like 5-7% of the healers mana which is pretty insignificant.
---
If everybody is parking to take a sip, then go ahead and drink too. Otherwise, don't sacrifice mana/DPS to save your healer unless every pull is OOMing them.
---
That's not true, there's a tricky jump onto the roof of the turning bridge which avoids having to use the key on the giant gear at all.
---
Your thoughts? Does this devalue the classic experience?
---
If you want daggers so bad why would you want to go hemo as well?
---
I've been doing everything wrong and somehow my dungeon groups haven't kicked me yet. Thanks!

A twink is a character that stops leveling at 19,29,39,49 and squires the absolute best in slot items to pub stomp leveling players in battlegrounds while they are leveling.
---
Honestly if I were to leveling another rogue I would take improved sprint and evasion sprint cooldown over riposte. I barely seen any pvp where it was actually usable while leveling and only proced like 20% of the time on mobs.
---
My paladin can't get ranged weapons :( 
---
Hope I get better ranged skills as right now (lvl 22) is not that far ranged.
---
underrated comment
---
That‚Äôs much less FPS though no? Because the extra hits with swords really adds up, I mean I thought that was a valuable talent maybe I‚Äôm wrong
---
To be fair, I believe there was a build for a level 10 or 11 rogue that abused stat scaling to gain some ridiculous level of dodge. Don't ask me how it worked, but I definitely watched a clip of a higher level character being completely unable to hit the rogue. 
---
Of course, that's a corner-case, not the norm.
---
1. Mark your targets. Make a macro " /tm 8 " and Mark Everytime you switch to a new mob.
---
So many tanks wipe groups because they don't do this...
---
If your healer has to use his mana on the rogue, mage, hunter, etc., because these players are getting hit, it's because they are not attacking the same target as you which means the healer run out of Mana fast and the fights last longer.
---
Marking targets has such an incredible chain reaction that most people in this game don't understand.
---
2. Pull back. Another major group wiper that could easily be avoided.
---
Runners get more mobs = wipe.
---
Hunter pet gets agro = wipe. 
---
Mage gets agro and freaks out and runs away from the mob and like a hunter pet gets more agro from another group = wipe.
---
Healer gets agro (see above). ‚¨Ü = Wipe.
---
Patrol comes around a corner unsuspectingly. = Wipe.
---
All could 100% be avoided by being a leader and telling your group "STAY HERE, I WILL PULL TO HERE". I would have a macro for that sentence.
---
3. Create a macro "OKAY TO AOE". Thus letting the team know, you are ready for them to AOE and that you won't lose agro if they do.
---
4. Create another Macro for new groups. **"Please attack Marked Targets. Please do not AOE until I give the okay. Please Run To Me if you get Agro. Please do not pull. Ranged Please focus Runners. Please stay when I say stay."**
---
5. You are the leader. Tanks are the leader. Be the leader and communicate these rules.
---
If it takes you that long to tab to a browser that should honestly already be open then you have more issues than you might realize.

#justhashtagthings
---
Is there a good paladin buffing addon? Something akin to PallyPower from vanilla? I tried actual pallypower from back in the day but it appears to not work with classic.
---
Yes ramstein neck - baron runs.
---
So a guy is valuable enough to feed 8/8 t1 by the 3rd reset (he said it was 3rd mc run). But not willing to grind dungeons? Like i said nevermind the neck. Litterally everything that is not the t1 (cant tell what the weapon is) is garbage.
---
But sure, you're right. Lets cheer and glorify the loot council abuser! Hurray!
---
Sorry I can't hear you over feign death. Wake me when you're back and I can multi shot more
---
Welcome to Classic
---
A character maxed at the top of any pvp bracket. 19,29,39,etc.  With the best gear and enchants on that gear.  Usually pretty op in whichever bracket they pvp in compared to others in that bracket.
---
Old timers....
---
Why say lot word when few word do trick?
---
It's a horde of gankers.
---
I‚Äôm still stoked on 20g! 
---
I might keep it for an alt.
---
Especially if you have a shaman with tremor totem
---
They have current gear, my friend. Higher content isn‚Äôt even released. 
---
I can link you a video of our next weekly clear next Tuesday. 
---
Look around, most guilds are doing this on bigger realms. Personally, this week, we had 23 level 60s and a handful of 56-59s.
---
Azshara is so nice and peaceful. Not much to do except a small handful of quests people a rarely do.
---
Just makes it a nice zone to pick herbs
---
That has always been the case, yes
---
This is super helpful. Thanks for the list of areas. I'll probably try to do a little grinding, too, if I can find a good spot.
---
Multiple of my buddies had to do that :/ it‚Äôs a shame because they powered back up to 30ish but are burnt the hell out and can‚Äôt play with us now. It‚Äôs unfortunate
---
We haven‚Äôt all flipped.  I was leveling up alch/herb from scratch on my 60 druid since I dropped skinning and enchanting since I have my smoking heart of the mountain now.
---
Gave a lowbie a strong trolls blood potion for free while gathering in Hillsbrad the other night, and tanked some elite dragon quest for another group of lowbies in the badlands after doing my Uldaman quests for the restorative potion last night.  I gave away a good few low level healing pots too that I made leveling up alchemy.
---
Forgive him he doesn‚Äôt know any better. If skill and gearing are equal hunter will never beat mage.
---
Jesus Christ that explains so much. Immediately came to the comments to see how someone was able to arrive at 65 seconds.
---
You just rolled a Tauren for druid, go Orc or Troll so your first 2-3 hours of the game are different.
---
Someone here told the story of his friend who realized that at lvl 60 in raid.
---
Efficiency and time.
---
I took 2 days off from work to extend my labor day weekend even further and just played through it.
---
I still hit 60 like a week and a half after most of our raid team
---
I play on Grobbulus and people were asking for spellcleave/aoe groups constantly while I was leveling up.
---
Theres definitely still time. If youre on herod shoot me a message! Baugrim in game.
---
It's not misleading at all.  A weapon damage is based on speed X damage.  All three weapons have the same dps, with different speeds.  Therefore, the slowest has the highest weapon damage.
---
There's nothing false about what I said, don't get bent out of shape because you assume people can't understand some basic math.
---
I was not referring to 59 levels of gameplay.  I was referring to this exact quest, and the question over which weapon to take.
---
It is going to be massive issue few months down the road and I am honestly curious how is Blizzard planning to solve it.
---
See Kronos 3 realm for what happens when one factions gets too dominant on pvp server. Especially with no bgs out yet, it will be a complete disaster.
---
Miss you buds
---
Yeah fuck that ccarlo if you are reading this you are done for my dude.
---
I'm preety sure selling accounts is against tos. Multiboxing is allowed as long as there is no automation. One button press = one action. Having a macro for /dance or copying the movements of the characters isn't against tos since each press does one action.
---
Because it's a broken piece of garbage atm. No deep breaths and the fireballs in p2 reset your threat so if tanks get hit by them its over. Complete rng fest.
---
I was new to wow as a whole and I pretty much took the whole first month to try out classes/faction see which felt right. I now mainly play a tauren druid (lvl22 now). No regrets. This game‚Äôs going nowhere so don‚Äôt rush it.
---
Also I still find plenty of people in my level range still questing/grouping.
---
No way you can expect 60-80k at level 30
---
So for the White Bandit Mask, it needs 5 pieces of mageweave, 1 heavy silken thread (18 silver) and 1 bleach (22 copper). The mask sells for 43 Silver and 65 copper (0.4365). The cost of the bleach and thread total 18 silver 22 (0.1822). This leaves you with 25 silver and 43 copper. If you can get 5 pieces of mageweave for under 25s43c (5 silver 8 copper each), you will be able to profit.
---
If you buy your MW Cloth for say 4 silver a piece. You will have spent 20 Silver on cloth. You add the thread and bleach (20s + 18s22) and that's a total of 38s22c. Sell the finished mask to a vendor for 43s65 and you are 5 silver and 43 copper better off. Thats for one mask.
---
Using this method, I have seen me craft about 50 Leather tunics while AFK, so this really is a mass production method.
---
Back in vanilla, a shadow priest tanked Ony on my server. 
---
Basically, is say virtually any class CAN tank, with preparation, research, gear, and a cooperative group. But practically speaking, some options are significantly worse than others.
---
Really nice work. I had noticed that linen bags vendored for a decent bit.  It put the thought in my mind that there are also likely others that could be vendored for more than the mats.  Thanks for doing the research. I'd like to take it a step further and factor in crafting time to calculate gold per hour.  If I'm reading this right you give the cut off for any profit.  With gold per hour you could calculate the target price to yield a certain amount of gold per hour.
---
Real mob health and classic cast bars
---
This is incorrect imo. You can start with ambush, gouge, backstab or cheap shot, backstab, gouge, backstab, then eviscerate or kidney shot, backstab and repeat if the mob is alive, no? Rogue has plenty of tools to allow for more than one backstab per mob.
---
New to tanking and ive only done deadmines. I was able to tank with a 2h at that time. I'm at 38 now and I didn't do any other dungeons but I wanna run SM. am I currently at a point where I need a sword and board to tank? I never upgraded my shield/sword up to this point so I'm guessing I can only dps til I upgrade my gear?
---
Used to work the floor and ICU, now I work in Infusion/Oncology. Tips are bust your ass through the program, get a few years xp doing the dirty work and you can do anything after that lol
---
And now in not retarded units?
---
Ironforge is closer than Stormwind to every raid in the game, also in early patches there used to only be an AH in IF, so that was another reason. 
---
Stormwind is a big RP hub if you're on a RP/RP-PVP server, but otherwise there's no good reason to stay there over IF.
---
You don't ask "how far can I go in X time?" you ask "how much time does it take to go X distance?" and choose the method for the least time given distance.  Everyone in this thread is just piling on instead of thinking about it.
---
Love it, let the purists stick to having constatly watch channels spammed by thousands of people with irrelevant groups. Meanwhile I can focus on doing other stuff and get notification whenever there's someone looking for people to dungeon I'm actually interested in. Arguments like having to go into city are irrelevant everyone is using LFG &amp; World channels anyway and this just filters out everything except the messages with keywords to dungeon(s) you're interested of.
---
After a while you make friends with the better players and can blaze through together instead of randoms
---
The DPS is the same. The attack speed isn't. The only use for the faster attack speed is caster spell pushback. 
---
Again, the DPS is NOT higher for broken tooth.
---
"Hey, can you help me save 10-15 minutes from running to town and back to stock up on expensive supplies?"

"Sure, 50s. Can you help me bang this quest out and save me an extra 5 minutes? Oh, you get all of the drops as well."
---
"Sure 2g."
---

---
I've found everything to be easier than private servers.
---
Oh and get a weapon chain.
---
What does deep breath have to do with anything?
---
It is easy, but it will be expensive.
---
Don‚Äôt think I know of an addon that displays numbers above a players head for heals but I use an addon called Luna unit frames that gives an updated UI and shows you a heal prediction while you are casting a spell to let you know on average what amount of that persons health bar you are about to fill up (also shows if you are going past 100% of their bar on a heal to let you know you are about to waste mana) really useful addon and great for raiding since it will also let other healers know you are healing for a certain amount on a tank and they should focus a different tank
---
Yeah, that seems about right. I'd definitely want to dps a dungeon before tanking or healing it.
---
My laptop performs fine usually at around 50-60 fps, with the graphical settings set to 4 mostly.
---
Problems arise when smoke or evaporation appears. Examples include lava smoke in RFC, the smoke effect from hunters Frost traps, green disease cloud from Abomination guards in UC, that place in 1k needles, which is a like with steaming water elementals and a lot of evaporation effects. 
---
Any idea what setting should i reduce to get rid of this particular problem? 
---
I have laptop with 8gb ddr4 and 250gb ssd but integrated intel gpu (intel hd 600) and some i7 cpu whose strength is 2.7-2.9ghz dual core or threads not sure.
---
I could be 10 levels above my duo partner but that doesnt sound too fun to me. I've been fishing or cooking or searching for a whelp pet. Grinding skinnable mobs, none of which are giving me experinece.
---
It's not controlling the character. The person is controlling on character and the software is repeating the action to the others. Everything u do can be sent to it and mimicked it doesn't do it on its own.
---
&gt; The nice thing is, when they drop you're not facing a lot of competition for them.
---
Seriously, I think I have seen maybe 10 high level druids on my server (Ashkandi US - Horde).  I mean I am sure there are more around but I have not ran into them.
---
What's Name of the ui please?
---
My house is on fire because my hamster ran too fast.
---
lmao go on a pve server or stop bitching. You had the same choice as everyone else when picking your class
---
If you roll need on Ravager, or on Herod's shoulder, so help me I'm gonna mortal strike you a new asshole....
---
thanks for being part of my success :) I will do exactly that then mate, thanks!
---
Mere months from phase 2? That's pretty fast if it's just months away. I would honestly like it see it far longer.
---
Thanks mate
---
I played priest in vanilla/bc, and I solo-levelled. It sucks, my friend! Enjoy!
---
Tbf, holy priest is S tier in end game content. I won‚Äôt solo level a priest again though. Find a buddy.
---
This video is outdated, 8-10 player dungeon grinding was already heavily nerfed.
---
So you got 2 on 1ed and you think you should have been able to get away?
---
You totally could but I don't have the patience to go through every recipe to find out the crafting time for them :D
---
lockpicking up to 225! tips appreciated!
---
I thought swords for the extra hit makes sword dos much better than maces.
---
I don't know, maybe. If a concept exists someone will have put the word hyper in front of it and used it unironically.
---
You have less incentive to log in daily on classic than you do on retail. Once you have gear there are no daily upkeep tasks requiring you to log in.
---
World bosses are later I believe, but honor is phase 2.
---
And yes, I think 3 months per phase is reasonable.
---
I was once a fool, like you. I thought that the corrupted blood event was neat and would do great in classic but then I took a step back and looked at it was some objectivity it would be really annoying to have all the gear and money you spent so hard earning be wasted away. 
---
Even if they just didn't patch the corrupted blood glitch it would still be devastating and you have the audacity to suggest that is applied on Portal so all the Mages are fucked and Hearthstone so anyone stuck is fucked and anyone who doesn't know about it is also fucked. Imagine taking a Hearthstone only to have all of your gear lose its durability as you die over and over again. Not fun
---

For rogues I first get a shadow word pain off and then try to spin so my back isnt to them. Then I fear and try to get off a mind blast. You can juke mind blast or mindflay to waste their interrupt. If undead, ur bonned.
---
Good god Greta, calm down.
---
Potions, and fear, maybe grenades if you have engineering. Otherwise dot, and try to shield and renew through it and hope for the best
---
Their excuse for this was that they give out large bonuses to the employees. I somehow doubt though that those lower on the totem pole got significant bonuses...bonuses also are dependent on the company performance for the year as well, so they are not guaranteed.
---
A lot of people who are 60 took vacation time the first week, or are unemployed currently. Or a part-time student. 
---
I work 40 hour weeks and I‚Äôm at 59. A few hours off of 60. 
---
Those who got 60 super quick likely did the raid exploit to get insane experience from 29-40+ skipping the worst/slowest levels for questing. And then farmed all their pre-raid BiS because they were in a raid guild to begin with.
---
You understand that you cant speak in trade chat unless you're in a city right?
---
I've been searching around and haven't managed to find a good reference for class specific (and maybe even spec specific) equivalency points. Does anyone know of one? l53 frost mage here.
---
 I do use sixtyupgrades, but it seem's like it cant be entirely correct - it's saying 1 SP = .19 int? And I'm not sure how to weigh crit chance vs int vs spellpower and so on when it comes to balancing DPS/drinking time. This has led to lots of confusion regarding gear.
---
I ask because I got \[Kilt of the Atal'ai Prophet\] last night, but wasn't sure if it was better than \[Frostweave Pants\]. A similar situation is should I be using the +33 frost dmg frozen wrath staff (with no other stats) I bought OR \[Inventor's Focal Sword\] + \[Celestial Orb\]?
---
If anything its a sign of consistency. Can't operate the UI in Windows, Can't operate the UI of WoW.
---
The ice stone has melted
---
Go arms until MS then pick up the crit and Battle shout talents in fury after. You can safely stay arms to tank until you hit BRD.
---
Glad to see another warrior tank out there, it can be very fun when things start working well with a group.
---
Yeah. My real loot competiton is accessories, weapons and wild growth spaulders. Im getting so much loot. I also get constant requests to join guilds on the sole fact Im a max lvl druid
---
I'm not sure how it applies here, but it reminded of of the time I went crazy with a level 1 rogue twink, and was able to kill most classes under level 20, and even killed like a 29 warlock once lol
---
5/5 Tactical Mastery in the Arms tree is invaluable for both soloing and tanking.  That puts you 10 points deep into the Arms tree, so you might as well make that your spec.  Once you get Mortal Strike, and are worried about surviving dungeons, you can start putting points into the Prot tree.  People will tell you Anticipation is garbage, and it is for raiding, but in the 40's it's super helpful in dungeons like Uldaman and ZF.  
---
If you want to stick to prot into 60, level 50 lets you get Shield Slam and 5/5 Tactical Mastery, so that's the earliest I would recommend making the switch.  However, that'll likely gimp your soloing/grinding/questing speed a bit, though running with your wife and running dungeons will offset that.
---
I think he ded
---
Exactly. Weapon is very important for threat and rage generation.
---
0.  
---
There is 0 differences between the factions.
---
Now here's the issue. Mages spend 0 money making the water and food. Also, it disappears when you log out. If it didn't, I would pay just for the inconvenience, but it does disappear so what if I gave 20s for two stacks of conjured water, and then immediately had to work on-call? That's 20s down the drain. 20s is like.... 5 gold!
---
So I don't tip mages. I fort and shadow resist them instead because mana is free when you have mage water.
---
I mean I definitely have tried that. Im not terrible at playing the priest just rusty and it seems like I just stay stunned and watch my health drop if im lucky i get a shield in a break fear (they always break the fear) and then repeat what they did until i die. Its literally impossible. Priest have no CC counter or way of getting away unless they stay feared long enough and we are able to mount and run....
---
Its totally unbalanced. I never remember it like this. Literally nothing i can do against them.
---
So what did they change? Seems like no one can tell me what they changed.
---
2h axe/mace in enhancement
---
I'm healing LVL 56-60 dungeons with shadow. I'm level 58, and switching to holy soon, but shadow is way faster (and more fun) while levelling.
---
Nobody needs your respect, its okay.
---
&gt; There are many different ways to define the "Correct" way to marry, &gt; but imo you guys are doing it (same-sex marriage)
---
Can you see how that could ruffle some feathers?
---
Someone from that guild took an herb node I was fighting a mob next to, I/sighed at them and I get a whisper "kill or be killed out there bruh"
---
So yes, karma is a bitch
---
2H Axes/Maces is a talent in the enhancement tree.
---
"you can pick any race and class you wan- wait..no"
---
Did this with my undead priest and I always laugh when he jumps into the air and wands.
---
Yep. In enhancement, there is a talent in 3rd row to learn how to use two-handed maces and axes
---
2h axe and mace in enhance tree
---
you get 3 msgs as a mage
---
1. water/food please
---
2. yo gimme a portal to org/sw
---
3. hey you wanna join this dope ass spellcleave group?
---
every single time rofl
---
Speccing deep prot before early 50s is a terrible idea.
---
I sure hope you have stance mastery at least.
---
I believe effects like this (and the thrash blade as another example) are all independent of each other.
---
Roll alliance if you wanna hang out with boomers and nerds. Roll horde if you wanna hang out with racists and children.
---
This post should be sticky
---
Did most of these people just not get the joke orrrrrr?
---
Agreed. I had two ZF runs last night that could've have been more different. The first one, the DPS waited for me to pull and position before unloading. Yeah, I lost threat a few times but it felt like controlled chaos. At the end of that run, they complimented my tanking and tried to recruit me to their guild. The second run, I had impatient DPS who would pull the next group for me. After that happened twice in the first few pulls, I told them if it happens again I'm leaving. They called my bluff so I left. Over an hour later they were still looking for another tank.
---
I think you're right on Ony, at least from my experience tanking her in Wrath... Or whenever they re-released it as a 10/25 man raid.
---
Never did Rag.
---
What server are you on? Never seen impatient DPS on BB Horde, if you dont mind rolling PvE
---
first off.... why do you need a damn autoshoot macro. put that shit in with your other shots....
---
It takes minutes to actually read and learn the game to an even mediocre level.  It takes far longer to research the "meta" from streamers and icyveins and adapt only that as your playstyle while also knowing enough to shun everyone else that doesn't mindlessly follow idiots.
---
No excuses for deliberately wasting your time and the time of others by being a dipshit.
---
1 vs 4 lol horde have more that are better.
---
IF, at least through phase 2 cuz it's closer to BRM.
---
For world pvp, which means it should be against the rules. I've been ganked countless times by a couple multi boxers who kos me in every questing zone. 
---
1 person should not have the power of 5 players.
---
I‚Äôd say don‚Äôt give up just yet. Try to find a guild and ask there for dungeons, or maybe slowly add people who you quested with that were nice so you can message them about dungeons.
---
Blizzard doesn't just mess with your account for giggles. If the password was reset there was either suspicious activity or your email and password combo is known to have been sold online and therefore compromised.
---
In-game distance is approximately in yards, cast ranges is measured in yards and base speed is in yards/sec. 
---
The main takeaway, if it‚Äôs less than double the range of most standard cast (30yards is standard cast distance) it‚Äôs generally faster to run if you have a 60% mount, it becomes faster to mount at about one and a half cast distance away if you have a epic mount, it‚Äôs always faster to travel form/pact of the cheetah if you don‚Äôt have a mount. 
---
Being able to determine distance is an important skill in any game that has any amount of ranged abilities.
---
I'm a newbie leveling a shadow priest. What stat buffs should I be looking for on gear? I thought I had it figured out until I got called out for rolling need on a piece of gear that was apparently for warlocks
---
Yes so, battle shout causes 55 threat per party member that it buffs. So that's 275 for you and your whole group. Then it gets divided evenly among the number of mobs aggroed. So 275 / 6 \~= 46.
---
Demoralizing shout causes a flat 40 threat (I believe? It's either 40 or like something around 43 threat) to every single mob that it hits. So if there are &gt;6 mobs, demoralizing shout is better because 7\*40 = 280.
---
But if there are 6 mobs or less in your pull, battle shout is more threat AS LONG AS you hit every party member with it.
---
Jack off 4 more times
---
I've run into some straaaaange folks on the RP server.
---
I'm freakin' loving it.
---
There's a difference between optimism and accepting that Blizzard can make mistakes.
---
It was so unlikely to you that they can make mistakes that you said, with only information provided by the OP, that there is a "good chance [OP is] lying".
---
You went so far as to make up their process and procedure that would prove Blizzard was in the right.
---
I just hope this situation causes people to learn about being open to listening to *both parties* before passing judgement.
---
It happens and you will never completely avoid it. Let the people not listening die and tell them if they dont do it right they will continue to die. I'd say your giving up to easily and getting to hurt by people on a video game. Just sit back and enjoy and let the ignorant people die, if they dont like it they will change or leave.
---
If they release early to please the no lifers blizz can go fuck
---
Yeah, I've done a few runs of it on my chars now, and I'm never doing a no-shaman run again unless hilariously overleveled. Tremor totem is way too useful
---
Yea. That's just you. Someone is probably actually trying to access your account.
---
Kudos for staying polite in the face of bad manners! Wow and especially classic teaches us a lot about how ignorant and sometimes flat out dumb people can be.
---
In my case (Warlock) i recently put together a ZF group where the only tank we could get was first of all arms specced, pulled before we had mana and the last drop for HIM was when he kept walking and pulled before any others in the group were ready. Because we had to follow him into line of sight we ended up puling more in doing so and wiping before we even got a boss down. He then saw someone looking for people to a melee cleave group and left us.
---
It happens to everyone no matter the class. Just try to find likeminded/experienced and hopefully mature people to play with. Best of luck!
---
Makes sense. Should I keep a random 1h/shield on me at all times and use it occasionally on mobs to train it so the skill stays up to date?
---
You think it's going to be better as a healer, to heal all of the extra damage because of DPS pulling aggro, and for them to not wait for your mana?
---
Yup :D
---
Old man checking in...
---
Thanks! i've been running almost exclusively with my boar (though I had a hyena for a minute) so I haven't really noticed that before.
---
One day I'll go around and get the skills I want, but I don't necessarily see a need for having all of them as a casual.
---
Sure, as long as you don't accidentally ding.
---
They gotta let you build up aggro (clap, howl, sunders, etc.). Tell them to wait like 5-8 seconds.
---
Onyxia is taunt immune. One common strategy is to do phase 1 with autoattacks and wanding only, and coasting from there after the tanks build up a big threat lead.
---
Yes . Yes it is.
---
Yea I feel you!
---
Yup exactly, not too many people either, it‚Äôs a goldmine
---
... Damn, that's a good response
---
huh. Well, im as a priest cant agree about second part, but ok :( im new, dunno
---
Your last reply got removed before I could enjoy it, one more time please?
---
for me it was! I just did it with 2 rogues and a shaman
---
I mean someone two posts above is literally shitting on a poster for relating the fun they are having so clearly some people are. Your white knighting here is a bit strange given that context tbh.
---
Depends on the class those leather legs will last leather wearers a long ass time. But finding group for Gnomer might take just as long!
---
I did.
---
7s24c.  
---
It's all in the spreadsheet :)
---
I will be the truest little Warrior I can be
---
oh lol tha answer was that simple xD sorry for ur time, im dumb :(
---
Yeah, it‚Äôs a fairly deep enhancement talent. Unlocks the ability to equip two handed axes and maces
---
Sounds like druid isn't for you, but the mid 30s is where cat form finally starts to be decent.
---
I‚Äôm bad at the game and sometimes it takes me a second to register who‚Äôs what in my party. Usually a warlock gets 1 panic heal from me early in the dungeon before I realize they‚Äôre a warlock.
---
zPerl my dude
---
I played 2006-2009. Then I played "Retail" -- with my young two sons! -- 2015-2016. 
---
Now I'm playing Classic with my (now teenage) sons, and I am absolutely loving this. They've been loving it too.
---
No, this doesn't sound healthy.
---
Make sure you have two factor authentication enabled.
---
Be assertive. Tank is head hancho and the hardest spot to replace. Ask for lead, mark skulls and xs. Is dps dont follow this ask them nicely first. If dps pull ask nicely first and if they keep doing it kick them. They need to learn. Probs worth having a warlock friend and a good guild to fill in other slots that open up because people refuse to listen.
---
I second that.
---
Hi im here, remove relentless strikes and ruthlessness for murder and relentless strikes and youre basically fine.
---
The thing about swords (or maces or axes) is that they can deal mostly full damage while in front of the target.  Daggers have to be behind the target to make use of backstab.  If you're attacking from the front a lot (solo leveling, for example) you will want to go with a spec built around that.  If you're attacking from behind (PvP, dungeons) then daggers is ok.
---
I wonder what the xp/hr would be between dmg gear and spi/int gear since you would have to drink more often with damage gear.
---
..which should be baseline, so it's not really fair at all that shamans have to spend a talent point instead of visiting a weapon master for those, too
---
Correct that is not possible
---
They break it constantly and it has a long cooldown
---
Two-handed maces/axes is 11 points in Enhance I believe. In TBC, Dual-wielding is one of their last talent points in the tree.
---
 My main on retail has been a druid since WOTLK
---
I as just joking according to post phrase :(
---
Exactly. The people claiming to roll on BOE's get upset when you mention this, but they've drawn an arbitrary line in the sand with regards to loot. 
---
If you used the need/greed system as it was intended, then there would be no problems. Unfortunately, people are incapable of doing this, so you end up with people all rolling need on gear just to sell it. And then they sit on it for 3 weeks before selling it for a minimal amount of gold, and getting no use out of it because any gear they want/need is more expensive.
---
A lot of 0/30/21 build are hybrid for healing so they get NS in the resto tree in lieu of Leader of the Pack.  Idk why, but LotP isn't meta for endgame.  Probably because it only affects your party members.
---
Dont forget you have 3 talent trees too! OLD vanilla mistake leveling balance
---
I like holding my swipe &lt;10% on the rock elementals for when they pop into 3 adds. Save the hunters from having to FD when they Multishot.
---
Marking kill orders on the silencing gators.
---
Yeah, Mara for sure.
---
there is a lot of stuff on here that is funny, but this made me laugh
---
my version of a charge/intercept macro:
---
\#showtooltip \[combat\] Intercept; Charge; 
---
/cast \[stance:2/3, nocombat\] Battle Stance; \[stance:1, nocombat\] Charge
---
/cast \[stance:1/2, combat\] Berserker Stance
---
/cast \[stance:3, combat\] Intercept
---
... if you're out of combat this'll put you in battle stance then charge, if you're in combat it'll switch to zerker and intercept ... and the conditional on the #showtooltip makes the right icon appear.
---
At this point, I might not recruit a dps only warrior. Have to at least be flexible and knowledgeable enough to try and tank. AoE groups do keep me on my toes but a warrior with macros, that does more than just charge in, is refreshing. Add some decent communication skills and I will heal them for hours.
---
Yes it‚Äôs very smooth. I know what problem you‚Äôre talking about. In the controller settings where you choose what type of mouse, you need to pick ‚Äútrackpad‚Äù the regular one, NOT the ‚Äútrackpad cursor‚Äù
---
The key word in my post is required you monkey. Leveling an alt doesn't make my main better for raiding. Farming gold doesn't make my main better for raiding if I already have gear. What the fuck am I preparing for phase 2? Pvping in ungoro doesn't make me better for raiding. Gathering doesn't make me better for raiding.
---
The entire point of my first comment is that on retail if you want to stay completive to raid you are forced to do daily content to run the neverending treadmill of artifact power. There is no equivalent in classic. This is a good thing.
---
No dog. That isn't it
---
3/4ths of the lvl 60 warriors are fury spec and "can't tank"
---
Now here is why they say this
---
Tanking is a lot of work with no real rewards. It's more expensive, more stressful, and requires a lot more focus. Nobody wants to do it. I did it for years and I have no intention of going back lol
---
there all stealthed. so ofc you cant see em!
---
but really its mostly because people wanted to lvl quickly, so you see alot of hunters, warriors, priests and mages.
---
these 4 level the fastest, as warriors can tank, hunters can solo anything, mages can aoe and priests can spec shadow for questing but still heal well enough for dungeon leveling.
---
the rest lack in some way, including rogues.
---
Tactics and a well disciplined RAID group. It's easy to hold aggro if your DPSers aren't going balls to the wall trying to kill her in phase 1. You'll notice they have a threat meter, so all the DPS should know if they're getting too close to overtaking the 'lock. That's not an uncommon strategy for bosses that cannot be taunted.
---
When I first started raiding in TBC, a threat meter was required to enter the dungeon. As was a full complement of consumables (elixirs and food buffs and other things of that sort.) If you failed to meet the requirements there were varying punishments, like not getting loot or not getting to participate.
---
[Hmm...](https://i.imgur.com/mTEzKKK.jpg)
---
do you shift click the item in or no?
---
Also warlock: WTF HEALER?!?!
---
What kind of monster use yards to measure distance??
---
For leveling it's alright but really it won't make or break you. In my time leveling it might have saved me once or twice. IMO it's not really worth it over imp sprint and the evasion/sprint cooldown reducer.
---
Because I‚Äôm not tanking? I wouldn‚Äôt tank on my phone, that‚Äôs just irresponsible. And as you can see in the damage meter I‚Äôm doing as much if not more than everybody else in the party. Not saying that I‚Äôm doing a lot, but compared to most classes playing on their computer, me playing on my phone holds up decently well.
---
Of course you can't know exactly, but you can eyeball it. If you play any caster, you have a pretty good idea of what 30yds looks like. Definitely easier than trying to estimate running time.
---
2 handed axes and maces from the enhance tree
---
Don't be evil
---
You can skip the first like 30 seconds, it was the second time I died and so forgot which mage it was but he kills me again in the second half. 
---
Was this possible in vanilla? Seems super strange to be able to stand in certain spots to avoid the guards.
---
Spirit is good if you're using life tap but stam, int, and +spell/shadow damage are also very useful. 
---
Just cause something is good for one class doesn't mean it isn't for another. If a warlock doesn't want to compete they should group with other healers. That's life.
---
You really didn't listen to me at all.  =/
---
Treating players with respect is not a "min/max" issue.
---
Every player can use BoE epics, so it's fair for every player to roll on them.
---
Best loot system if your guild is good. If your guild is bad and/or has dumb people in charge use DKP or /roll . I‚Äôm an officer in Maevey‚Äôs classic guild. We give loot to people who aren‚Äôt going to flake in 2 months and to people who put effort into their character and don‚Äôt suck at the game. It‚Äôs not hard to understand why loot council is actually more attractive to good/committed players. Most of our other shamans want ele stuff for PvP and since Maeve is a freak career healer we just gave him tier. Now our tanks can‚Äôt die
---
Don't need def stance to shield bash
---
Damn dude defend yourself
---
not braindead, just off spec. I tank strat/scholo/ubrs as a 17-34-0 warrior.. thats 0 points in prot lol. Groups take me anyway because i have def stance and taunt and dont feel like waiting an hour. 
---
We still clear all the content in the end though.
---
Exact issue with my guild. However, by sheer luck I found a guild looking for one resto sham and I pugged with them. And they met everyone of my concerns with confidence and honesty within minutes.
---
Last guild was a "mega guild" I was invited in with a "dire need" of resto shamans, then proceed to not tell him if I will be part of either raid, wont answer basic questions and recruited 20 shamans. I expressed my concern several times being pretty much all prebis and 3 epics already and plenty of knowledge. So I am leaving for a small close knit guild.
---
TL:DR: found small confident guild. Me leave big nonsense guild. Me get loot and have fun
---
&gt; Rounding back to my original question, am I giving up too easily?
---
This depends on your expectations. As long as your group is making steady progress, you need to chill. People just aren't going to wait for ideal conditions and make perfectly strategic pulls each and every time. No wipe = no problem. You can try playing another role, but they all have similar annoyances. If you're only going to be happy playing with very competent players, you need to join a fairly serious guild or otherwise filter out who you group with. Your bar for randoms needs to be completing the dungeon with 1-2 wipes.
---
You're gonna wanna hit up Tanaris and The Hinterlands to get all of the ZF quests chain done.  There are a few chains in the hinterlands that have you going to ZF and then Sunken Temple.
---
As you get closer to 50 you might want to try Searing Gorge, maybe Un'goro.
---
This is also kind of the level range where you stop having enough quests to push through a level.  I'd recommend doing some extra ZF runs as you get to 47+ or if your old school, grinding mobs.  I personally spent a bunch of time in Badlands trolling for mithril during this range.
---
You only use it when you overgear the content or have DPS with threat so high they are being throttled by the tank.  If you have to ask if it‚Äôs appropriate, don‚Äôt do it.
---
Honestly, I think lvl 25-29 are the worst levels 
---
It‚Äôs slow going and you don‚Äôt have all your tools yet and not many talent points, I‚Äôd honestly wait until 30 before making the choice maybe even 31 or 2 
---
Have you done any dungeons yet?
---
Mcp?
---
... and my AXE!
---
This totally isn't scripting or use of third party programs
---
The guild I'm in has a rotating fifth slot on the council for transparency (everyone rolls for the spot once the raid group is formed). Seems to have worked well so far at least.
---
Yeah. I'm just going to wait until the 3rd month subscription to kick in before I jump into pugs. Need to weed out the scrubs who are riding the hype train
---
How is ferocious howl for pve?  I hate doing dungeons on my Hunter but figured that might be worth a try.
---
I promise you more than just one person was annoyed by it, they just didn't say anything.
---
I disenchant when in all guild runs but if you weren‚Äôt in the same guild then that‚Äôs pretty lame. I‚Äôm all for progressing the guild however I can but gotta make sure everyone‚Äôs on the same page. That being said, I‚Äôd have passed to a Druid tank
---
It‚Äôs really the vocal few and not the majority. Of the many mages I‚Äôve asked for water I haven‚Äôt had anyone charge me. 
---
And if they did, I‚Äôd find someone else. I always headline that I‚Äôll tip though. I like to show appreciation for the minor inconvenience
---
I didn't find out till level 50 you'll be fine
---
Much higher gear/skill cap for you AND your guild/group
---
Yeah can't trust the little fuckers to do the job correctly.
---
Schweppes is the *worst* brand of ginger ale you can buy. Canada Dry is superior in both taste and nausea relief. I would probably buy generic before I bought Schweppes.
---
I never knew I felt so passionately about ginger ale. I guess chronic nausea will do that to you.
---
Way too far imo
---
The US is more like a machine that exploits anyone and everyone, that keeps rotating drivers
---
I'm fine with them as long as they stay out of my quest camps!  I know if i had a pocket group of 5 i'd be in dungeons, not bothering everyone else in the already overcrowded open world.
---
oh no i'm dumb
---
You actually have to put work into rogues, leveling poisons, lockpicking, need materials for vanish and blind.
---
Fury warrior is just as fun with less work and the flexibility of being able to tank.
---
Uh, you won't have 1000g when you ding 60 unless you have god tier luck for boe world epics and farm like a madman which would make getting to 60 take a lot longer. You also have much better gold farm at level 60.
---
Or they haven't picked a name yet...
---
its mind numbingly simple
---
apparently not lol...  cant believe he actually thought killing a mage as a hunter is easy.
---
With bartender I‚Äôd recommend going to each bar and making them a little smaller maybe .8 scale and then you can just center them with the positioning tab and bring them down to the normal bars are too so you have a nice big clear view
---
Reassure us you didn't use the Phasing cheat to acquire the gear?
---
poison the soup!
---
Yea. Good point. That another big reason.
---
Just tell them to stop :P
---
Buy all items often one kind from the AH and raised the price by 50-100%

---
if were talking, can you use a hostile spell with a mouseover. the answer is yes, atleast in general
---
all of my mage spells have a built in mouseover line in the macro. so for instance i can mouseover counter spell, frostbolt (max rank and rank 1), poly and fireblast anyone
---
Same with my group of friends, we're all sitting around 46-47 and there are days where we don't play at all (though to be fair we played non-stop the first few weeks). We agreed not to outlevel each other by 2-3 levels and we primarily level by doing dungeons, which is much more fun than grinding. It's worked out well so far, but people do need to agree to not no-life when others have work/kids/whatever. A good solution has been making an alt if you have extra time and others don't. A few of us have level 20-30 alts for this reason, which is also fun. 
---
I have no idea why anyone rushed themselves to 60. We have so much time. It's not worth the burnout when there is basically nothing to do at 60 right now.
---
I play on Ashbringer, a server that is listed as full, only ever had to queue once, and it was for 8minutes or so, so its not been bad for me so far.
---
What a dork
---
The ppl that make any gold to write home about are watching the AH for a substantial time of their play time. It‚Äôs not a casual thing. And they also probably has a tendency for economic interest and understanding. It‚Äôs definitely not for everyone.
---
All the cunts are playing Mage
---
Can you read? I said I don't use trade chat, I use the global chats that don't require you to be in a city........
---
He‚Äôs not on the loot council, I am.
---
Do the key quest quickly, wont take too long and will save you loads of time for arena+ runs.
---
I mean, if there's anyone who's got experience with opening floodgates of bad news and boogeymen it's Medivh
---
Most* raid bosses.
---
I think after MC, the number of bosses that can be taunted drops off drastically.
---
It is WoW. It is not that super graphical ultragame. And half of the endgame will be pure UI and nothing else anyway.
---
I never said that lol
---
How do I measure yards?
---
Only viable when you're insanely over geared for the content. Which wont be while you're leveling. Unless you want to tank VC/WC at lvl40
---
Its fair that guild officers can kick whoever they want whenever they want.
---
starting in barrens with warrior. Have my two stances, trying to figure best rotation for single enemy.  Thoughts on below? too much rage wasted
---
Battle stance -&gt; charge -&gt; rend -&gt; defensive stance - &gt; sunder armor - &gt; battle stance -&gt; wait for overpower and apply rend as needed
---
keeping battle shout and blood rage up as needed
---
In the earlier stages of vanilla, rogues were damned overpowered. They didn‚Äôt get nerfed over time, it‚Äôs just that the other classes got buffed and caught up over the course of vanilla. 
---
So in 1.12 state they aren‚Äôt as OP, and they are one of the more difficult classes to level so it makes sense that there are fewer.
---
How many times are you going to repost this?
---
It is indeed 80-20 alliance favored on this server, anyone that says otherwise is probably alliance players trying to sugarcoat the situation with false claims. I called out a poster earlier on his constant uploading of Ironforge screenshots while claiming that horde are growing (he deleted the thread afterwards).
---
Im not saying the alliance arent allowed to have their own ‚Äúdominated‚Äù server since every other pvp server is horde heavy favored, but im tired of these fake claims of ‚Äúbalance‚Äù all talked about from alliance or ‚Äúhorde are growing very fast!‚Äù Literally all these claims are FROM THE ALLIANCE players trying to swindle more horde over. The alliance population keeps growing exponentially since majority of the high pop servers open to transfer here are horde favored and the alliance are funnelling over by the hundreds creating an insane imbalance.
---
That's the worst part, when I hit him back the guards kill me, I assume the aggro range is bigger for me since I'm a lower level. So if I hit him back = repair bill as opposed to just dying or running.
---
The twins right in aq40 requires tank swapping, I thought...
---
why you so determined to be wrong
---
Tanking pugs is abysmal, always was. 'Tank' as Fury or Arms, rather and don't even bother with the shield until you hit the 40 dungeons. In other words, play as if you were soloing, but with a pocket healer and some other people following you.
---
If the mage keeps pulling AoE aggro, let him die every pull and on't wait for him to catch up. Or kick him. If everyone starts shitting on you, leave the group and go assemble another in 5 minutes as tank.
---
Who ever posted here first is shadow banned.
---
I dont agree with OP, it will breed more toxicity in what is already a pretty toxic subreddit.
---
Position your left hand on the keyboard on wasd, position your right hand on your mouse (reverse if left handed). Shift with your left pinky and 9 with your right thumb. Also have numbers on your mouse or this won‚Äôt work.
---
All of the big pserver guilds are alliance soooo....
---
Spell damage (once it becomes available) &gt; spirit &gt; int/stamina. You use the same gear as warlocks so don't listen to them.
---
They added Pepe, how dare you.
---
Cute :-D
---
Those are names that haven't entered my mind in 10 years. I miss the old WoW Forums and the community we had on there. I was 13-15 or so in my "heyday" of playing, 26 now. The memories are flooding back. 
---
I used to love watching, I think, Zizek mind-control people into the lava at Blackrock Mountain.
---
in vanilla and bc, raid bosses were taunt-immune, so any tank-swap mechanic meant the other tank actually had to out-threat the active tank
---
You have posted this three times in the last 20 minutes.
---
You can‚Äôt even sell enchants in this economy.  I struggled to *give away* free +3 strength and +3 stam enchants after a week of trying to sell them between 9-12 silver.  
---
It wouldn‚Äôt be so bad if you could at least get value out of leveling it.  Unless you make wands though you really can‚Äôt until you get the enchants everyone wants.
---
You really shouldn't admit you know any of this, mate.
---
props on the EQ reference.
---
Oh for sure. Way more fun after that discovery hah
---
Also was searching for this plugin in modern "Classic" version, or any similar version of it.
---
Last time I used it on private server on Vanilla version 1.12.1 it worked fine.
---
Warlocks and shadow priests share gear until level 60 mostly. Was it a ZF piece?
---
Yea, so far my boar doesn't mind =)
---
&gt;which could be 5k armor.
---
On a druid.  
---
On a warrior it will be about 2k.
---
Niche level? Huh?
---
Blood on the leaves and blood at the root
---
prefer the chunky energy tbh. really satisfying to time the opener so you get an extra 20 energy right after. (requires having an energy tick addon). also raises the skill ceiling a bit.
---
I played a Druid from TBC to Cata and had never heard this pact until now. I like it and plan to abide by it!
---
you should have realized this from the first trainer in the starting zone
---
Rune of portals is 28s. Rune of teleportation is 9s.
---
As a shadow priest, you'll essentially need the same gear as warlocks.
---
Intellect, Spirit, Stam, Spell/Shadow damage bonus
---
Something like 3-4% of players will see an epic pvp item before phase 3, there will be plenty of room for upgrades, don't worry.  
---
If you're one of that 3%, you can walk into BWL with the intention of picking up whatever rings, trickets, necks, and cloaks you still need.
---
it is a higher skill cap for healing and generally lazy tanking.
---
Ah, these names are starting to make more sense!
---
‚ÄòReaching‚Äô is overextending on something. Like running on 3rd and 30
---
The important question now is shall I mount up to travel from IF bank/mail to IF ah?
---
Cleanup
---
Depends on how much your max mana is without/with the 1200 mana along with how much bonus healing you have outside of the \~120 you're looking to maybe give up.  
---
If the answer is "I only have 120 +healing to start with", the answer is no. The effective healing done is much higher with healing bonus stacking than with int/spirit stacking.
---
I like the 'combat' modifier. I'ma see if I can work my mouseover modifiers into this when I get home.
---
That is a good mindset to have. Some people rather be productive during their game play instead of waiting around for people
---
I did RFC like two times and WC once.
---
&gt; I thought I had it figured out until I got called out for rolling need on a piece of gear that was apparently for warlocks
---
Sounds like you have it figured out but other people don't.
---
You want the same gear as a warlock.
---
To be honest that's just a super toxic thing to do. Shadowbolt costs almost twice as much as Frostbolt (on to of generally smaller mana pools) because warlocks have life tap.
---
A Warlock not eating or drinking with everyone after a pull is being a dick, but "I disagree with the design of that class so fuck those players" is a pretty terrible approach to the game.
---
You can upload to Reddit directly by hitting ctrl+v on the submit page after hitting prnt scrn.  
---
You're already using a computer. Anyone who thinks pulling out a separate mini computer is easier is just tech illiterate.
---
but really why is that?
---
I mean the same logic that is good for 300 gold, works for 50 gold, works for 5 gold, and 5 Silver.
---
The "Group earned" that loot the Group deserves it, and your Class roll shouldn't influence it all all.
---
There is either a reason to defer to class that can use it, or there isn't.
---
You know what rogues do need? Weapon damage. If this is that big of a weapon damage upgrade, guess what? It's an upgrade. This isn't level 60, at low levels when stats on gear are low, some "caster" oriented weapons are actually pretty good for melee characters. The staff in lib is also pretty decent for melee. At max level gear is itemized a lot differently and you shouldn't ever be using caster weapons, but at low levels there are some good options because all you need is the damage.
---
He's a sad human.
---
Tip for others who see this 
---
I'll /who and whisper warriors/heals with a "hey have you got your [dope loot] from XXX dungeon yet?" It's worked well and shows your taking them into consideration.
---
I‚Äôm 23 and my dad got me into the game when I was around 9 or 10 lol. I honestly hate retail compared to classic and I just feel more rewarded for my effort in classic. It‚Äôs like retail lost the magic that I felt way back then when I killed turtles for hours thinking I was getting rich lol
---
I‚Äôm an arms warrior but I‚Äôve been tanking every instance as I‚Äôm slowly leveling. I see absolutely no reason to bring along a DPS Warrior. Maybe it‚Äôs selfish, but if I‚Äôm doing the hard work tanking, I want the plate gear that drops.
---
Thanks not sure how that gets you banned tho ?
---
Dumb orcs.
---
as a shaman, yas bois
---
The entire reservation thing is a horrible bs and since blizzard won‚Äôt do anything about it, it‚Äôs up to us to enforce penalties for it.
---
I whole heartedly agree with your guilds decision.
---
Viable yes, optimal no
---
Can confirm. I had a Death Knight named thedoctor in wrath. So many invites out of the blue. I kept offering to bring my bandages, but only one group ever took me up on it.
---
Is this some rich person joke im too poor to understand?
---
Why?
---
I used to be on a 40 player guild in WotlK and we downed ICC 25 man first on our server. It was the best guild/clan I've been in period. We were basically the superstars of our server and just got together to make a guild. No loot council, nothing. We ran every raid with need/greed. People would state their reasonings and we would follow. E.g, our tank knew the rogue had BiS daggers, but was trying a combat build, the tank wanted to try a fury build, so they both rolled. In a loot council, that shit was getting sent to the favorite.
---
I just want normal people who know how to play, show up, talk shit, and get along. It is shockingly difficult to find this in a guild however. We were our own loot council. If you TRULY needed that, BiS or not, we would support you if there was no immediate need from another player. It really felt like we were all trusted friends, crazy stuff.
---
 My 15 y/o might roll up a horde.  14 year old plays Madden, so no.
---
They would sit on my lap every night 2006 - 2007'ish and "ride the boat" with some of my alts.  The boat from the Wetlands to ???? ( sorry, at work and haven't leveled up that far yet ) .   My oldest was always into Deathwing, so he got to see that fight a few times.
---
I found running the exact same comp, Frost was better for dungeons, just because if something went bad, the AoE slow from being specced into improved blizzard allowed me to kite mobs around.
---
Plus you could have her pull with frostbolt, and dps the target until it reaches her, tank zero damage.
---
I quit so no raiding for me.
---
A part of me agrees with you, for me a person needs to be aware and prevent this situations as an individual but if someone needs that bis gear and loses that item for someone for ah good after hours of grinding shouldn't there be a penalty for that?
---
Tanaris pirate area is pretty good if it's not being dominated by a mage.
---
That's another thing all the rogues ive been righting or rather the ones that are ganking me at half health constantly break my fears how is these even possible? It seems like anything done is useless to them
---
It literally salvaged my ony run. Looked like a shit show in p3 all healers were oom and leader was dead so he moved everyone into one group I dropped it and we barely downed her
---
Yea, I've leveled both to 60, and they are both obviously easy to grind it out, and can depend a lot on the servers.
---
But compare instances while leveling - Alliance have Deadmines/Stockades which are basically inaccessible for horde. Horde have RFK and Wailing Caverns which are the same. Alliance have Gnomer except horde get a port from booty bay which is trivial to get to. Horde have SFK, RFK, RFD, all four SM instances - all extremely easy to get to.
---
The racials are definitely better on horde, but that doesn't mean it's all bad, but things like will of the forsaken or orc's stun resist just make traditional CC much harder, so it's harder to win those skirmishes in the world.
---
I agree. I didn‚Äôt expect myself to be so consumed by it. In 
---
However, I‚Äôm glad I just bought a 30 day time card instead of starting a monthly subscription. My 30 days ended today and now I have to make the decision to buy another 30 days or not instead of it charging my card and keeping my sub activate automatically. I now have time to reflect, and while I absolutely love every moment I‚Äôm playing, I miss things like reading, watching movies, I was more productive and got better sleep, so I think I‚Äôm going to take a break.
---
Not that any of you care lol.
---
I'm ashamed to admit I've been playing this character for like a month. I'm not an optimal leveler. :(
---
I really like Mulgore, but I'm definitely going Silverpine over Barrens this time.
---
Oh nice 9g if you have th- AAAAND ITS GONE
---
Me and fianc√© are leveling alts as a mage/war duo and honestly me as war is slowing her down and I‚Äôm not contributing much dps wise. I‚Äôm doing better as her accountant/manager with managing the groups finances, loot and leveling direction.
---
I did a similiar post yesterday but got even more downvoted like you. It was a macro for pugs explaining the loot policy which I want to post when the group is full. Some guy even deleted his reply and account after lashing out at me. There were still some sensible people in my post. You put more effort in it than me and covered more I feel like.But you didn't cover Ninjas at all.
---
Especially about BoEs people like to argue all day, not just on reddit. You didn't even mention Ninjas. Some people rather get pranked by ninjas then to play fair and roll need which is what I'm trying to do.
---
I‚Äôm new to WoW and rolled warrior. Leveling as Arms, 8/10 times I‚Äôm only invited to groups if I tank and it‚Äôs been an interesting experience.
---
A mage on my server just got a 3 day ban for this same thing.
---
Evading the guards in a major city is considered an exploit, regardless of the method used to evade them. 
---
Just report him and move on.
---
ZF as healer
---
It would be nice, but also they won‚Äôt do it because ‚Äúwitch-hunting‚Äù.
---
Spirit is often prioritized to mitigate downtime and will be particularly useful when healing if you choose to take that role.
---
Spell damage and shadow spell damage will increase your dps the most.
---
Int will improve your mana pool and crit rate to help with both downtime and damage.
---
Healing power might be nice to have on a backup set of gear so you can heal dungeons.
---
Stamina is nice for survivability but shouldn't be a priority over any of the above stats.
---
This is more raw economics than wow specific. Essentially, when people have more money they are more willing to spend (in a market with fixed variables etc etc). Vendoring an item creates money (‚Äúliquid‚Äù assets because it could represent anything you demand and is easily transferable), which makes buyers who vendor more willing to spend money in the auction house. 
---
Of course, this is only true if buyers don‚Äôt also buy from vendors because that effectively destroys the gold used, taking money out of the economy and having the opposite effect
---
what pre bis pvp shoulders would you reccomend?
---
Keeping mining as your other?  I'm skinning/mining at the moment...honestly debating dropping mining for Eng atm since devilsaur skinning is so good.  I'll probably regret it once phase 2 hits, though...there is no way i'm touching Un'Goro after layering is gone.
---
Yeah, back in my 30s when questing in STV, a Night Elf Druid with a reputation in the zone for ganking people low on health/fighting 1 or more mobs got me numerous times. He would always wait for a moment when he could kill you fast enough that you would be no time to react before you died, and would just pop up at the most random times all over the map.
---
I found that bastard at the AH in Gadgetzan, and I outleveled him. Hard.
---
I spied on him for a few minutes until he finally left town toward Shimmering Flats, and by the time I caught up to him he had just finished ganking a Rogue that had been fighting a basilisk.
---
I killed him. Over and over and over again using a /target [playername] /cast Charge macro while rapidly spinning in place on top of his corpse until he respawned, so that he would have no chance of stealthing away.
---
After 1 attempt to fight me and 2 attempts to run away, he took res sickness.
---
There's no cropping if you hit alt+ prnt scrn.
---
A warriors right of passage, congrats! Enjoy the crits!
---
At 12 an hour and an average of 35 hours a week. Before taxes is 22k. After taxes i probably make 16k in 2019.
---
Should I make the font bigger?
---
you're sadistic. xD
---
Hey OP buck these debbie downers about the graph construction. I like it and appreciate your hard work. Keep it up!

*In sing song tune:* Anything prot can do arms can do better, arms can tank everything better than you.

---
She can go fire if she likes, having you there will help. But frost is also god tier pvp because of it's control, so I'd still probably recommend it.
---
Is she a guild member of The Climate Cult?
---
&gt; You can upload to Reddit directly by hitting ctrl+v on the submit page after hitting prnt scrn. 
---
Maybe on new reddit, I use old.
---
Fortis, like Fortis Inc. the power company?
---
Yes it's possible to work in.  
---
You give up basically 1 dps point in favor of getting riposte which means something like aggression (2% ss 2% evisc) or Murder (1% damage to some types of enemies).  
---
You have to decide if you want to get it over things like endurance and improved evasion, though.  Which are also both pretty nice for soloing.  
---
IMO if you want to solo bosses or do duo stealth runs (angerforge, princess) it's 100% worth picking up because the 10% parry is huge too.
---
Its pretty normal to give fullset to 1 player if the 8piece bonus is good. Shamans is amazing we finish also 1 shaman after another its the best gain for us as a guild and noone is complaining.
---
&gt; I'm talking dps who refuse to focus my marked targets, who see me waiting (for healer mana), get impatient and pull for me, and many other examples.
---
I'd recommend starting your own dungeon groups, as most groups are always shouting "LF1M - tank" anyway. Be **very** selective about which DPS you bring to your group. Also, have an open conversation with your healer right off the bat. "Hey, I'm going to give the group clear instructions: skull -&gt; X -&gt; star, etc. - if anyone breaks that too many times, let them die."
---
That's the habit I got into back in the day, and it generally worked pretty well. Also - consider being, eh, selective with what type of DPS you bring along. So far, I've had good luck on my server bringing an enhance shaman, hunter, and warlock. For whatever reason, **some** mages cannot evolve beyond the spell cleave trend.
---
Seriously. I've encountered only a handful of decent mages so far, and almost none of them seem to know how to DPS outside of AoE. They're consistently near the bottom on my DPS meters as a result, though at least some know how to CC/interrupt in a pinch.
---
Of the (surprisingly few) asshole players I've encountered, I'd say at least 2/3 were mages as well.
---
Tbh the only thing I want is the Zul'Gurub raptor. Even tho I probably wont get it.
---
That looks like exactly what I'm looking for. Thanks man
---
Did you look at the spec? I have 8% inc healing effectiveness specced into, I have reduced cast times and increased healing wherever possible.
---
By no means would this perform less than your standard healing spec.
---
Do you have a mainhand progression and what enchants you're using? I was considering leveling a rogue alt once I hit 60, and I hit 60 last night and have plenty of gold for funding easy leveling in alts now. I'm down to try this idea even if I have to spend more for it to be equivalent to combat swords, because I already just pressed 1 button 90% of the time and another the rest for 60 levels.
---
2h weapons is an enhancement talent
---
Na dude just simultaneously level a priest of the opposite faction and mind control your way to 60
---
Asus rog 1440p is pretty nice...
---
Druids on WOTLK+ are very different from Vanilla though. If you're not enjoying it by the 30s I would try something different.
---
Disagree, I find it more cumbersome.  Even in vanilla I didn't see the point of it regenerating in chunks.
---
Right click his portrait, it will have a drop down and click rename. You will not be able to do it again, so choose wisely :)
---
I guess, first of all, just dot for 3 mobs, it‚Äôll be more dps for sure, I typically throw agony and corruption down, switch mob and repeat 
---
Then circle back for Siphon, skip the first mob and start putting immolate, or even just wand
---
In terms of AoE, almost never hellfire unless shielded or the mages slows are up, I swear fire seems to attract more threat, space our your attacks and for the love of all that is good; if you do pull aggro RUN TOWARDS THE TANK AHA
---
This is precisely what I was thinking, everyone and their grandma was gonna want to roll a rogue.
---
My guild only has about 15 ppl but we have 0 rogues. Interestingly enough both the mage and druid plan on making rogue alts. Maybe people are saving rogue for their alt/twinks when they can afford to bankroll them nice gear with nice enchants.
---
Everyone got so excited to talk about themselves they didn't even catch the joke.
---
I'm wondering this same question as a 34 feral druid who heals dungeons
---
Underrated comment
---
And u will feel like an idiot while tanking with certain classes, not being able to pick up all the mobs. It's not you, it's the "MAGE" going way too hard way too early.
---
Real cute.
---
A lot of boomers play Classic.
---
that's a satisfying story.
---
good pov
---
Yeah, shields never go on a tank unless they're taking huge damage spikes, or they're so low health that they need a shield so that you have time to get a bigger spell off.
---
First of all, I love this combination and I love that you and your wife are enjoying the game together.  
---
Leveling prot may decrease your dps somewhat, so you want to increase hers as much as possible.  The frost/aoe spec would probably work well for her since you'll be able to generate sufficient threat and take enough damage to sustain aggro on multiple mobs, allowing her to blizzard them all down.  However, fire/single target is also very viable with you as a solid tank.  Either spec would work for the mage in this scenario and I encourage you to let her play whatever spec she enjoys because either will work well paired with a warrior.  
---
Have fun you crazy kids!
---
Aggro, seems kinda fucky at the moment. I don't know if this is the intended behavior or not cause I didn't play back in the day, but I've gotten aggro from people dragging mobs past me without me doing anything. No buffs, hots, attacks, nothing to generate any threat. That didn't stop the mobs from suddenly doing a 180 and running towards me instead of presumably resetting. Regardless of whether it is intended to work that way or not; it certainly doesn't *feel* right.
---
Yeah I know that wasnt my point. I went what I consider very slowly and still that was my playtime so he would only need 4.8 hours a day to be at 6 days gametime and he told when he wakes up to play for 4 hours a day. Checks out to me
---
The shield thing, x100000. I always end up having to tell the priest that bubble is harmful unless shit is hitting the fan. I want to get hit !
---
Just fyi, Pandaria came out in 2012
---
But yes I too am having a ball, I quit just before Pandaria, and I had been playing since early Vanilla.
---
All casters want Int,Stam,Spirit. Priests prefer spirit, Locks stam, Mages int, but they like all 3 of those stats.
---
You were probably fine rolling on that item, since there is significant overlap in what those classes need.
---
Nah, I think it's good to take a look at how you're spending your time. Can always set up access controls if you decide to come back (play within x hour range these days each week) to keep real life taken care of, too.
---
Warlock gear and spriest gear is pretty much one in the same.  He was probably just salty.  Leveling up though, look for gear with spirit, shadow damage, or spell damage.
---
Are they really worse in solo PvP in 1.12 than a Fury Warrior
---
Everything you said includes ‚Äúassumptions‚Äù about your dps.   This is great info for a guild run but I wouldn‚Äôt hold much to it in a classic pug.
---
Never! lol
---
Depends on the warriors gear, but 1v1 well geared warriors are the kings of vanilla PvP, even pre 1.12. It's just quite the mountain to hike, especially back then.
---
Play however you want. Levelling can be easier with some funding from a high level toon, but really, just play what you want to.
---
Yep. This.  Most people just want to go into a dungeon and hit a couple buttons and see big numbers pop up. Tanking is like the polar opposite of that.  
---
Tanking can be stressful in pugs. That's why no one wants to do it.  I would bet most people that do tank do it for a regular group. 
---
I  only tank dungeons for my guildies. I'd rather cut off my own toe then tank for a bunch of randoms
---
Just had to end it all weird like, didn‚Äôt ya?
---
There is a +spell damage OH from the last boss of SM Gy
---
Spirit and then Int. Eventually you‚Äôll start finding spell power, but that‚Äôs not until at least 40ish.
---
cause the time dedicated does NOT guarantee time rewarded. You can spend 4 weeks not getting a drop in the hopes that "one day my guild will give me all my tier 1 and bis weapons" and then for some reason or another you arent in those runs, not in the guild etc?
---
Granted, these are strange things to happen but I just do not trust the random online gamers I game with to treat me fairly in the future due to my current dedication to the raids. I have also seen it before.. many times. People say "Oh yeah I got this item cause we bullshit some reason LMAO"
---
BOE's? How tf does that work? "I need money to run the guild soo..." given to leader. LOL
---
I guess having more flavours means selling out? Lol
---
Orb of Dar‚Äôorahil or Orb of the forgotten seer
---
Downvoted for retarded phone picture.
---
Sounds like a personal decision.  If you enjoy leveling an alt, go for it.
---
FWIW, I'm doing the exact same thing and sending all the mats to my priest to level ench/tailoring.  It works great.
---
Remember that thread that blew up a couple days ago, received reddit gold and silver, and hit the top of /r/all about someone ninja looting. Turns out his evidence was taken out of context. But too late, a massive amount of people already saw the thread.
---
There is never going to be enough evidence to prove it while simultaneously being little enough evidence that it is feasible to review it.
---
Do whatever you find the most fun
---
I leveled a druid and basically spammed dungeons the whole way up. Heal/tank or dps.  Whatever groups need. 
---
I'd really strongly recommend picking up 5/5 Furor first. Then go feral. That's what I did and I'd do it again if I had to re level a druid.
---
Horde Hinterlands items are nuts, there is this trinket with AP/hit aswell, right?
---
You have to also remember that outside of 5 man content, tanks are not needed as much. 
---
Most raiding guilds already have the 1 main tank slot and 2 OT slots filled. This means if you arent fury, you arent raiding.
---
Find Humanoid mobs in large groups that you can kill quickly and efficiently. Sell all the cloth they drop. You could start grinding Timbermaw rep in Felwood at 47.
---
I was just commenting why all those warriors can't seem to be able to put on a damn shield and tank the dungeon themselves.
---
Spirit&gt;Intellect for leveling.  At higher levels you'll look for spell damage.  At lower levels all caster gear is roughly the same and what's good for warlocks is good for everyone.  If you need it, roll need.
---
Just copypasting works fine.
---
Because time is a function of distance. This orientation is good because it implies that travel time is the output and distance is the imput.
---
Motivation and clean up?
---
Personally in that case I think you should rush one of your characters to the exact level of his character, then catch up the other character in your free time. Jolly cooperation makes this game great!
---
Yeah, priests don't start with staves either.  You begin the game with a mace, and I'm not sure there are any 1 handed maces itemized for priests.
---
Exactly! I played druid in vanilla, and that kind of low-key RP / exploration was always one of my favorite parts. Heck, I don't even really care about endgame that much, either back then or now.
---
It's why my characters this time are shaman and hunter, and really enjoying them.
---
I‚Äôm leveling 4 at once. üò¨
---
Congratz! 
---
Just wanted to ask, if you have the meat quest can u grind up enough meat for multiple turn ins or do I have to go complete and take the meat Q again everytime?
---
Yes. The Ravasaur trainers were always in the game, but they never did anything until Wrath. They were just there as massive teases.
---
Thank you, I changed the post.  I quit tobacco the same year, I should have known.   
---
I am nicotine free to this day, but WoW sucked me back in.
---
They're mage and priest, so yeah, that's kinda part of the plan. But I also have more time to play, so I was going to level one more until it was caught up to him, then the other.
---
But you‚Äôre assuming that a single layer is the normal server capacity, and I don‚Äôt think then numbers support that and I haven‚Äôt seen anything that to suggest it.  
---
By your own examples we would have only needed 4 layers, but we know that number is closer to 10 layers.
---
You can swear if you want
---
Also to add for DPS.  
---
KILL THE MOBS THAT FUCKING RUN AWAY.  
---
You have 1 fucking job and that's to kill shit, don't just let them run away with 100hp to pull more mobs in. Do your fucking job.
---
Can you help refresh my memory? To do the attunement you have to go into MC via the BRD entrance but to do that you have to change the group to a raid, right? Doesn't this mean if you aren't done with BRD and still have quests to do in there on that run, then you wouldn't be able to do both?
---
PSA: if you have no intention of ever using an ability, save your hard earned gold on leveling it.
---
I'm looking at you, Mocking Blow.
---
You could have hand of justice, windfury and sword spec all proc at the same time.
---
Even better, the proc from HoJ can proc Windfury that can proc sword spec
---
Classic isn't vanilla wow and never will be.
---
...that we're already sliding down.
---
There HAVE been changes made already. Why do people cling to this sentiment as if everything was the same as it was 14 years ago?
---
2h axes and maces are locked in the enhancement tree. IIRC you have to put the talent in AND visit the weapon trainer.
---
Interesting, I need that for the shift key
---
There's no fundamental difference because I never said it scales off speed, and the 3 properties are intrinsically related.  You are making a mountain of an anthill.
---
No one was talking about the quest to 60.  The question was about the WW quest, and all three weapons have the same DPS.  Therefore the slowest is best because it hits harder.
---
&gt;They are all 3 the same dps, axe is better because it's slower so you get more dmg from any ability that relies on your weapon dmg.
---
That is what I wrote.  Nothing misleading.  They are the same dps, thus the slower is better because of the weapon damage.
---
If that one sentence was so confusing for you that you felt the need to elaborate, I can't really help you further.  I never said it's better strictly because it's slower, if that's what you took away from it then I have not much hope for your reading comprehension.
---
Dual-wield or 2-handed tanking can work, but it's important to be mindful of the fact that it's not simply interchangeable with the traditional sword n' board style. You're trading away a massive amount of damage mitigation for more DOS and threat. That CAN work out, but there's less room for mistakes, and usually a higher gear dependency. 
---
Generally speaking, I'd advise against it.
---
Vernor's or die!
---
Blacklists never worked back in the day. Blacklists won't work now.
---
Also, if I see someone trying to lie about others (spreading bad information)...  Well, that's what right-click report is for.
---
Naming and shaming is bad, m'kay?
---
I just tell my locks after each pull to tap to full Mana. I'm cool with letting a Max rank heal do it all in one go.
---
The ones that tickle my tits are the ones that tap to half Mana/half hp then refuse to tap until you heal them. It takes like 2-3 downranked this way which is more time and more time cutting into my 5 second rule than if we just get it out of the way in one fell swoop.
---
Seems like most people are in SW on my server, atm, but I imagine that will change as more people get close to endgame. IF is just in a better location for everything.
---
It creates a strong tank healer with splash heals that is mana efficient. It's something that can't be replicated
---
And youre too stupid to do a real screen shot? shocking.
---
Do whatever makes you happen.
---
you should kick that cancer out of the guild.
---
Do whatever sounds fun to you.  I‚Äôve got a Druid at 50 and a warrior at 25.  I double click on whichever char I feel like playing when I sit down and will continue to do so.  Why do it any other way?
---
Emperor does not drop HoJ until Dire maul patch i believe. Not 100% sure but pretty sure. Until then its General.
---
Or it just means he hasn't tamed a wolf yet and leveled it up to bother caring about sub-60 steamroll-easy dungeon content.
---
r/oddlysatisfying
---
As a healer that‚Äôs constantly having to spam greater heal to the point I‚Äôm beginning to forget what mp5 is...yeah, I‚Äôm getting pissed off.
---
There‚Äôs a ton of bads running around pugging for the easy groups and I‚Äôve only met a few that were properly specd for tanking, or had gear for it, or knew how - if I‚Äôm having a Golden day, I‚Äôll run into 2 of the 3 and then hold on for as long as I can, but all three?  Fucking unicorn.
---
It‚Äôs only worse when these same guys then run from mob to mob, ignoring my mana and will almost always be the ones to complain about it when I say something. 
---
This was never that bad of an issue in vanilla.  I would‚Äôve remembered this kind of train wreck.
---
Yes for lvling it's incredibly overpowered. Also look Into "parry haste", after you parry your next attack gets a 50% haste buff
---
Makes me miss my leveling buddy. I‚Äôm now demotivated to continue leveling because I feel so alone :(
---
It is most important to have fun and play a character you enjoy looking at all the time :)  Good race-class combinations are nice but aren't vital, so you do /moo.
---
Haha yeah that must mean everyone outside blizzard has your experience and silicon valley isn't a shithole of abnormally high costs and terrible homelessness!
---
My dwarf hunter Gorym "Goldbeard" Gauntylgrym and his trusty boar companion McRib are making quite the name for themselves on Heartseeker.
---
There is no priest in the group
---
Cats are dumb, they need wisdom.
---
Yeah, 1v1 I'll tear your mind to shreds then feast on your corpse. Two people? If you've got any sort of heals I'm going oom and getting my butt stomped.
---
Orb of the Forgotten Seer from SM graveyard will
---
last you a long time.  It‚Äôs got pure spell damage, baby!!
---
Play what's fun for you
---
The lvl 30 warlock quest gives a decent offhand
---
Update: I got 288g for mine, as a bid on AH. Less AH fees I walked away with like 275g.
---
Do pets leech xp?
---
IE if I run a 5-man party of hunters, do we get less xp if we all have our pets out and they aren‚Äôt max level.
---
Right? But it kinda just falls on deaf ears.
---
On what realm do you have 10 layers still? I call bs.
---
This is why most good tanks refuse to tank in PUGs.  With a PUG it's hard to tell the quality of the individuals.  I would suggest adding people to your friends list that you know are quality players and look to join their guild.
---
Again, beating a dead horse here; The stats on items are in their final state and make us MUCH more powerful compared to the beginning of the game. The same goes for talents.  
---
They're almost in full catch-up state, only missing the patch 1.10 drops that we'll see in phase 5. And the dungeons were designed as entry level content in a new game to begin with, not for 15 year veterans.  
---
So yes. It's supposed to be that easy.
---
It's all about that long game for selling crusader enchants and high level enchant tips.
---
That‚Äôs not how you spell Orctober!
---
Nice drawing, as always!
---
As some people have said. It's a marathon and not a race. Play however you want. That's kinda what the game is about!
---
2H Axes is an Enhancement talent
---
It's simple, don't top off Warlocks. They are used to managing their own health/mana. They have ways to recover health, they don't need the healer to keep them at full health. Honestly that's true of all classes for the most part, they don't all NEED to be topped off everytime they have 95% health. If you have the mana and want to throw them a heal, fine but don't feel obligated. Healers are there to keep the tank up, not keep everyone at 100% health.
---
Nice tip
---
I keep having people im getting revenge on layer away.
---
Spirit then Int. But if it‚Äôs upgrade, roll need. Those people that called you out sound like idiots.
---
It‚Äôs just a game it literally does not matter. If they‚Äôre doing it to you and you‚Äôre the same level git gud. If they‚Äôre higher level than you they‚Äôre assholes.
---
solution: find deviate fish pool, fish, get rum, take the rum to local  bar, consume said rum, shit talk about how you suck at fishing and end up back at the bar cause you cant catch fish, sober up, find more deviate fish pools, fish, catch more rums, repeat
---
I wanna know this too
---
I used to loop "Yakkety Sak" while doing LFR!
---
You can MC mobs to make it more fun! The battle mage mob has an arcane explosion and blast wave that just melt other mobs. Prevents a lot of damage on your group and makes those pulls faster. Other mobs have some fun abilities too. You can initiate the pull with MC and eliminate an entire mob in a pack by either getting other mobs to kill it or use all of its mana. Some mobs have heals too.
---
Cannon master doesn‚Äôt drop staff until phase 5  I think. I‚Äôve found most groups skip him entirely, maybe that‚Äôs just my experience. 
---
Truefaith is bis until t2 and comparable even to that. Depending on how long each phase is, if you get it early in phase 1, you could be using it for 6+ months.
---
I see, somewhat I agree that this is going too far for something that happened inside of a game.
---
You get Orb of Darorahil at 35:
---
[Orb of Darorahil](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=15108/orb-of-darorahil)
---
Umbral Crystal at 38 if you find it cheap:
---
[Umbral Crystal](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=13029/umbral-crystal)
---
Some of it had to do with enchants too. So you could put endgame level enchants on low level gear and there was no downscaling. Your twinks would suddenly be OP against equal level players that weren't geared the same as you.
---
I ran stocks yesterday with a Druid tank and a paladin healer. With rejuv between pulls , my healthstones, the paladin Blessing, and my demon armor, I would tap all the way to 20% HP and just be right back
---
I believe there is an advanced setting for particle effects.  Try turning that down and see if it helps.
---
Mine does that shit too. God I fucking hate it
---
Do what makes you happy. I‚Äôd tell my friend to shut up.
---
Tell your friend to not worry about it.  Although I rushed to 60 on my main, it was because I wanted to establish myself within the main raid group in a competitive guild.  If I wasn't in my position, I would just play what I want, when I want.
---
Windows has a known issue that is causing screen tear. Make sure windows is up to date. Aka check for windows update manually
---
I would play both, But at The same time try to get the best out of the rested exp. If you wanna play 2 classes go for it
---
What about fist weapons?  And what are the best 1h maces for PvP
---
So are you making fun of yourself here lmao. Is no lifer a badge people wear proudly?
---
Wait til you see her run, eh-hem.
---
I usually move backward slightly to interrupt the wand cast. Doesn't work 100% of the time, but usually I can move right after a wand shot, and start casting a spell.
---
\&gt; Bestiality is gross... where and how did that even come up?

What do you call it when a cow is repeatedly forcibly impregnated only to have their child taken away and killed?
---
\&gt; Needlessly torturing an animal just for amusement is never ok, but  killing an animal and consuming it's flesh for nourishment is. 
---
Don't act like you're eating meat because you'll starve without it. Hunting so you don't starve to death is one thing but dipshits going to Mcdonalds to get a burger are supporting the torture of this animal because it tastes good and brings them joy.
---
\&gt; I don't know much about how animals are treated in those places, but I  hope they are killed quickly and as painlessly as possible.

Yeah here's a video of them being kindly and humanely harvested for our food =)

well according to wowhead, he didn't get added into the game until patch 1.13.2.30406 so technically he shouldn't be in the game since we are on 1.12.

Do some google searches for ‚Äúwow classic rogue bis‚Äù you will find numerous sites and discord‚Äôs with this information.

A lot of it is out there. What you want to do at 60 though is up to you. PvP, PvE, etc... you can set your path.

Depends on the group.

Doomguard is the one you need to summon with 5 people where one randomly dies during summoning and you need to enslave the demon afterwards.

It still works fine, and it works on all units, even players. It's also here: [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/unitscan](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/unitscan)
---
You need to type **/unitscan** ***nameofunit*** to start scanning for something. It must be the full name, though not case sensitive, so for example **/unitscan prince nazjak** for the guy who drops the pvp trinket. You can test it by using it on yourself. Just type **/unitscan** ***yourownname*** and it will alert you immediately. Note that it only works once and after that you have to type that command again. Type just **/unitscan** to see what is currently being scanned for.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure 1.13 is just classic. 1.12 was the last patch of vanilla wow

OP still hasn't figured out that the - symbol is universally used to collapse a list, cut him some slack.

How is that not insane mana? Are you ok?
---
Eve online has had long term success with niche gameplay focused on social interactions. I think you may be right about "big budget" games, but smaller games can definitely be sustainable this way.
---
&gt;  love watching everyone drink while the warlock sits there and life taps knowing that the healer will heal them
---
Sorry but warlocks have a lot of ways to recouperate their life bar. The healer shouldn't be bothering 99% of the time. Maybe a renew.
---
To found the "Azeroth Summoning Service Company", which has hardworking warlocks working 24/7 summoning you to every part of Azeroth, including cities, dungeon and raid entrances, quest objectives and other difficult to reach locations, for as low as 1g!*
---
Just whisper us and get summoned now with 5 star service and speedy delivery!
---
* prices may vary depending on location and time
---
Yep depends on the group. I roll greed unless I need it.
---
As you level, yes. I use primarily a 2h, but will switch to the 1h/shield during dungeons when I need the extra mitigation. Typically for large pulls, unexpected adds mid-fight, or hard-hitting bosses.  
---
A 2h weapon actually is better for threat generation because of the extra damage and extra rage. But you need to watch out for your healer and throw on that shield if he's struggling.
---
Nah there's not really any loot reason to go there. Quests, sure that gets you one or two runs. Money is exactly why a tank would take the first orb - otherwise they'd go run something else that has the same chance at passive money in addition to potential loot. And helping guildies is a great reason to go, but it means you're not gonna be in that pug group. 
---
Reserving an orb is the reason I'd take the time to go there instead of any other superior option that exists as a tank.
---
Not sure why people keep saying ‚Äúprivate servers had it wrong!‚Äù, they didn‚Äôt. Private servers were almost all based on 1.12 and did not change loot tables from that state.
---
Hoj originally dropped from Angerforge and was changed in patch 1.10, along with various other items, to drop from Emperor. Classic is using the pre patch 1.10 loot tables for many items currently. This is why we see certain items won‚Äôt drop until phase 5.
---
Hoj currently drops from Angerforge. I would guess it will change to Emperor in phase 5 but don‚Äôt think blizzard has clearly stated that.
---
If I'm by myself and have time (it's a looooong cast) I open with Pyro then fire blast and alternate fireball or scorch until blast is ready again.
---
My dad would never ever *let* me mow the lawn let alone *make* me. He has to have it done his way.
---
Shoveling snow he was a little less picky.
---
Ohh yay, we get to start this thread again lol
---
Exactly this. Only other piece of gear the tank might need is the cannoneer boots.
---
What? What did he say that was shitting on the other guy for enjoying classic? I mean he is a douche, but so is the other guy. I'm not white knighting anything, and i'm not sure you understand what that phrase means. 
---
Back to the point - some people take it personal when someone says classic is not difficult, like the guy above who responded to '"Increased the difficulty" compared to what?' with this: 'Slowly pull your reeking mass back into your Dad‚Äôs basement and stfu.'
---
Which one is the bigger dickhead?
---
It could, but as somebody has already pointed out when traveling the question is usually 'How long to get from Point A to Point B?' and not 'How far from Point A can I get in X seconds?', so graphing as the OP did is fairly logical.
---
Why I love tanking as a Druid. Pre heals before pull, putting hots on warlocks to keep their mana up between pulls, innervate the healer or dps depending, setting good pace with heals because I can top myself and party up. Insaine dps with mages utilizing hurricane (over 7k in 1 cast in ZF). Barkskin+BR when someone goes down. The list is endless. Fingers crossed end game is as fun. (Grizzlybear on blowme server)
---
I've been resetting instances with portrait reset for days, but sure dude.

The links YOU posted don't work. Either fix it or stop arguing your point because the proof you posted isn't there.

You‚Äôre what‚Äôs wrong with society

Just became a lava run, nice.
---
This is currently incorrect, as the engine is currently treating multiple stacking movement speed increases as additive, which was changed in patch 6.0.2.  Having trinket+gloves+spurs on a mount will increase your movement speed to 169%/209% of normal run speed.  I have submitted a bug report about this.
---
You can verify this in game with
---
    /run print(GetUnitSpeed("player")/7*100)
---
ALL LOOT COUNCIL BAD 
---
FAIR LOOT COUNCIL DONT EXIST  
---
BLIZZARD GIVE US THE PERSONAL LOOT IN CLASSIC  
---
am i right guys?
---
I didn't know that website existed and... wow
---
I didn't realize how alliance dominated my server is, and now I'm questioning if I want to reroll or not
---
Me fucking too. I had this happen yesterday where DPS failed to kill the mobs running away with low hp and they ended up aggroing a ton more mobs which forced a wipe.  
---
4 of us ghosted back while 1 DPS just waiting and continued to talk in group chat. When the 4 of us rezzed, I drank water and topped everyone up, but made sure to use ALL of my mana.   
---
I then walked over to the last persons body and just sat on it. No mana totem or water, I just waited for my mana to fully replenish. They asked for a rez and I just said "one sec", and proceeded to just sit and wait. When my mana got full and they were still just waiting, I went AFK to go get some poptarts, made myself a g-fuel, and took a bio break.  
---
By the time I was back, they finally released and ran back on their own. That felt like a nice small victory and idgaf how petty it was.
---
Thanks! I've just been using my combat log set to all until now.
---
If it's an upgrade I roll need, otherwise I roll greed.
---
I don't care if others roll need even if it's just going to be on the AH after the run.  There is more loot to be found.
---
I've also compiled a list of eyes I will make cry.  Only added people who were 5+ levels higher than me and attacked when I was in combat.  I havent got anyone back yet, but I'm almost to 60 and can begin hunting.
---
Yes we have issues lol
---
BOOK 'EM BOYS!
---
I wait and see what people do and respond accordingly.
---
It doesn't depend on the group. If it's something you need, then you roll need. If not, roll greed or pass on it
---
That‚Äôs tough. You can do arena runs, or a few bosses and get a few runs in. Two hours though is going to be tough for a lot of stuff in classic, especially at those times.
---
There might not be a good answer here.
---
Good. It's only better to find out that you've landed in a garbage guild.  
---
It's human nature to want to stack the odds in ones favor, and it's literally not impeding you in any way. You might want to look into why you feel that it does, because it's not from a healthy place.  
---
If the reservation is made clear in the recruitment message, there's no harm and no foul, if you have an issue with that, you really have an issue with yourself.
---
The party is gathered at the dungeon entrance or almost, and about to begin the run. Announcing the reserve at this point makes you a douchebag for having wasted the time of those not in the know.
---
If the reservation is made at any point after the dungeon run has begun, you'll find people being upset with you for being a colossal spastic.
---
If the reservation is made as you fight the boss from which the reserved item drops, you're a straight up ninja looter.
---
BoP items are worth gold too.  Why not roll need on all weapon drops because they have significant gold value to a vendor?
---
I don‚Äôt see how ‚Äúrespect‚Äù comes into play.  In my system, everyone rolls need on a BoE if they will equip or use it, and greed if they will sell it.  How is that disrespectful to anyone?
---
BTW, the idea that a 300g BoE is worth the same to someone who will equip it and to someone who will sell it is flawed for a few reasons:
---
-	Time has value (takes a while to convert a BoE into gold and then gold into another usable item)
---
-	AH takes a significant cut
---
-	People don‚Äôt always get the full value from selling an item
---
The most valuable way to use a BoE is to equip it if it is an upgrade.
---
The secret racial trait the creation screen doesn't tell you about.
---
I could just imagine the complaint post "Warlocks are the worst class, I almost die every time I fight a green mob and need to drink/eat after each fight".
---
I mean... if you run out into world as a tank class, let 1 mob hit you, time how long it takes for you to die... without fighting back
---
It takes a LONG time. And its much easier to run away from fights in retail, mobs don't seem to daze you as much.
---
Lmao exactly how it is for me
---
I left the sub cuz wow sucks and why I still getting the feed idk...
---
There's a level 51 ret paladin in my guild who is perfectly comfortable swapping into a mishmash of caster gear to heal 5-mans. No problems yet. 
---
I truly don't think dedicated healing specs are necessary before 60. You might be able to accelerate a dungeon clear by encouraging a tank to chain-pull more, but that'll be more than offset by your struggle to kill mobs solo.
---
Was a DPS (warlock) with a 19 twink warrior when I stopped playing before Cat was released. Decided to roll something fun so I went with a druid. So much fun tanking and healing dungeons or whatever I am needed for. I keep two sets of gear so I can perform most roles and I am having a blast.
---
Depends on the item, If it's worth less than 15g i just roll greed.
---
If It's a massively valuable item i roll need
---
Being in demand doesn't pay the bills, doubly so for plate wearing tanks.
---
I was think the same thing. Were is she sending excess heat to? Outlands? Where do the ice shards come from?
---
It's best to mark before the pull so it's clear on approach. Once the pull happens all bets are off that people will notice it unless you announce it over voice comms.
---
I don't psycoanalyze strangers who do or don't because that's silly.
---
wow_irl
---
Confirmed. I made both DS pieces and equipped them at 53/55 and its been huge. Thrash blade and the Marshal Windsor quest sword do just fine. Krol blade is fancy, but overpriced for how good it actually is.
---
Well, it could increase competition for those trade goods if more people know about crafting/vendoring as a source of profit
---
Holy shit
---
Gnomeregan, Uldaman, Mauradon (WC is just Mauradon Jr., with raptors instead of satyrs and druids instead of dryads), BRD, LBRS. BFD is a maze, but not as long. Temple of Atal'Hakkar (aka Sunken Temple/ST) is fairly simple in design but takes a long time. Most dungeons in vanilla were significant commitments.
---
It blows my mind how people like you still haven't figured out that people like you typing things like this *is* the reason they do it.
---
Wait. So I'll have to do math before I can fly?

Download sharex and set it to auto upload to imgur

I honestly think I have made enough nightscape tunics to kit out every man, woman and child of every race in Azeroth with this. I‚Äôve vendored about 99% of the items I have made and made it to 40 with enough to buy my mount.
---
Some people can‚Äôt see the benefit but honestly it hasn‚Äôt impacted my play time a huge amount. I buy from the AH before I log off and then against first thing in the morning while having breakfast. At night when I come home from work, I fire up wow, park myself at the vendor and set to crafting 400 jungle stew or 80 tunics and then go and make dinner, sort my kid‚Äôs lunchbox for the morning, do laundry etc and occasionally pop in, sell what I made and start crafting again.
---
&gt;  until you get into BRD and get Dal'rend's
---
Might be at it a while if you're farming BRD for Dal'Rend's...
---
Meanwhile, on Pagle - Horde... not even half that many people in Org.
---
Because that's not how software works.
---
All this means is that they made the game world assets align with vanilla, it doesn't mean a thing for being easy/hard to backport content from later expansions
---
All loot available to drop from a given boss is in the game currently, if the instance is in the game. So you can get leaf for rhokdelar afaik even tho it says p2 in loot table. How have y‚Äôall not figured this out already?
---
This is because they didn't give us, but more importantly, me Frostmourne.
---
Naw it's fine
---
If everyone in the group rolls need, I'm also rolling need.
---
Thanks to battered chests opened on my 5 characters leveling up. I now have more than enough to make a full silvered bronze set... as soon as I get the leggings recipe and more blacksmithing skill...
---
My problem is that I‚Äôve run into an offhand for every leve range so far and I keep it in my bag hoping I‚Äôll get a 1h itemized for me and I‚Äôve yet to get a single 1h that has useful stats so I‚Äôve just been using staff the whole way lol
---
also learn how to stance dance.
---
You're just wrong bud. There are 3 plate items for warriors/paladins and 3 for druid tanks. Regardless of whether they're BiS or not is irrelevant to the fact that tanks can and will use them.
---
Also, I'm not arguing against reserving an orb, I was arguing against no tanks having any reason to go there otherwise, which is falacious.
---
Depends on the drop as well. If for example shadowfang drops in BSF better click need since noone gonna equip it until phase 3
---
They should introduce climate change into WoW... sort of change the landscape over time and the map over time like they do with Apex Legends to keep things fresh.
---
Wait...so I'm a bear tank that's happy to pop out and HoT the locks to help us speed up...why would that be a bad thing?  
---
I don't mean slowing us down, I just throw a rejuv while the healer drinks and start moving to the next location.
---
I'm almost 300 fishing, and high 200s cooking (those 225 quests were fun!). Anyhow, all of my fish recipes are level 25, and as a level 41, I was hoping to find some fish to cook up for 40. Anyone know a vender that sells a recipe, and what kind of fish they use?  THanks so much!
---
Anything is possible, but you can heal every instance playing a healer as a dps spec until at least lvl 50.  So why make your solo play more difficult?
---
If you use original patch schedule as a guide, December launch of P2 would be appropriate.  
---
P2 "just" adds Dire Maul and Honor System.
---
Damnit man I want my damn flask!
---
In my experience (and having multiboxed previously) it's not usually for the goal of selling accounts afterwards, but just that the game becomes much easier and much faster when you have a full 5-man party everywhere you go, especially if you don't really need to concern yourself with gearing all of them up. 5 players worth of damage, 5 players worth of loot, 5 players worth of experience. It's powerleveling without having to rely on anyone else.
---
Selling the accounts is just a nice bonus at the end, if you're into that.
---
How about rolling on an RP server because "there will be less competition".
---
It's kind of astonishing how badly people covet a title such as server first. Especially in a game like Classic where it really comes down to time played instead of skill level.
---
He's a YouTube celebrity whose main audience consists of mostly 6 to 13 year old kids. He filmed himself in Japan and one of his stunts was filming himself in a forest where people often go to kill themselves. He showed a dead body on film while joking around. He's a dick head and one of the worst influences on kids that I've ever seen.
---
The rule I follow (and state to my groups ahead of time) is that if you plan on equipping any blue BoE immediately, you can and should roll need on it.
---
For PURPLE BoE items, all players should roll need, because everybody needs a couple hundred gold.
---
The only thing that gets me is staves don't require any talents and are often just as good or better than the 2h axes and maces you find while leveling.  I think it's perfectly fine to make 2h use require talents, but that was a pretty big loophole to leave open.
---
&gt; No one wants to wait for you to complete 4 more quests before you head over to the instance. Your time isn‚Äôt more important
---
Oh man, so much this. Had a group of 4 getting ready for ZF, we are all in Tanaris repairing and things while looking for a fifth. The last member joins and is questing in Arathi. Waiting for him to fly to UC, zep to ORG, then fly to Tanaris was brutal.
---
Gratz!  Q: Do you sleep?
---
Most deff, I don't judge strangers over arbitrary shit.
---
Yes easily, as long as they have good shield+1hander they do fairly well vs rogues. Not warrior favored but maybe 60-40 or 65-35
---
derp my first comment was definitely incorrect. whistle is actually in the list, in the playful section :)
---
you should 100% play the game how other people want you to play.
---
I can flip that around on you easily. Why do you "need" a 500g upgrade more than I "need" a 500g payday that I can buy an upgrade with? Our benefit from such a drop is basically the same. 
---
I get where you're coming from and I'm not trying to be obtuse, but please at least consider that side as well. The value difference between using a BoP item vs vendoring it is clear. The value difference between using a BoE item vs trading it is a very different scenario.
---
Welcome to classic pvp lol. You would hate me. I play super cheap but that‚Äôs what builds the hate for the other faction and makes it fun. This same warlock has killed me about 10 times over the last two weeks. He‚Äôs always around lol. I‚Äôll get him eventually
---
Man, why you gonna tell on yourself like that?
---
Is anyone else getting a regularly occurring UI error saying addons are causing many errors and potentially slowing down the game, ignore or disable addons? This screen pops up every time I play and it's very annoying. Is there any way to stop this window from coming up?
---
If you are going to give the traditional answer at least advise them to wait until others all roll Greed before they do so they don't get ninjaed. 
---
But really everyone rolling Need on BoEs is more fair, IMO. Why should 4 people miss out on their chance for 100 gold or whatever just so the one person can equip the item rather than spending their  own 100 gold for it on the AH? 
---
Really the fairest would be to auction and divide the gold five ways. But that's more burdensome that it's worth so just letting everyone roll for the 100 gold (or whatever) the item is worth and let the situation work itself out from there. If one party member wanted to buy the item from the group that would be an opportunity for everyone to win something. They could give each of the others 20 gold.
---
Omg I‚Äôm in LOVE!
---
I left and came back on a few times after WORHK and am feeling like it‚Äôs my first time playing again, with the benefit of knowing all the basics
---
How do you mouse backwards? Did you bind a mouse button to backwards walk?
---
A lot of WoW's quests beyond level 10 are written so poorly that you don't have any concept of what or where you need to go. 
---
A quest in Darkshore will tell you to "Go to the river east of Auberdine, then follow it North to the first cave you see, from there you can look for X" whereas a quest in Tanaris just says "Bizzle Flizzleboop needs his pipe."
---
This is hilarious, because back during actual Vanilla it took us like 5+ months to see our first Earthfury shoulders drop. So many shamans were stuck at 7/8 and had mentally moved on to BWL.
---
I quickly announce : "all need" if it's anything of serious value and press need
---
Talk about it beforehand? My vote is always Need on BOEs in leveling dungeons, but agreeing on the policy before the first pull is best.
---
Its just the truth. Lol not sure what the big deal is.
---
My hearth is Menethil now, and was for a long time in Vanilla. Boat ride to Ony, short ride to THELSAMAR, because I was so damn poor I would use my 40% mount to ride from there to BRM because flying into Thorium Point was so much money. .
---
&gt; Druids might have this easier than warriors though.
---
Bingo. I'm also a druid, but I've rolled warrior before - and druids QoL for aoe threat is *sooooo* much better than warrior.
---
They didn't in vanilla. Yes, it was tested, sadly EJ forum is dead.
---
BiS twink items definitely sell, I've flipped 2 Shadowfangs on my server both for 350g and 1 Night Reaver for 80g. Shadowfangs have gone up 15-20% since then and Night Reaver has gone down by 50%
---
Love this story!
---
We're in this together bear friend! Some streamers said only warriors can tank and a huge chunk of the community started spreading that bullshit.
---
I've seen plenty of ppl literally say druids can't tank dungeons
---
Yes, it could, and that‚Äôs what a lot of people in this thread don‚Äôt seem to understand. Since the relationship is linear, you can just invert the graph to show the opposite relationship. 
---
Which one you use just depends on what question you want an answer to, and in OPs case, it seems like the question being answered is how long it takes to run a *specific distance* for each travel method. If the question was the opposite (how far can each method travel in a *specific time*, then the inverted graph (time on the bottom) would make more sense.
---
Just tested on a human. roar is silent :(
---
I have this for every single attack ability. It blows when you sunder something on a tab target but your auto attack isn‚Äôt turned on
---
I actually made a post yesterday asking if there'd be any interest in this if I were to make it and my post was removed.
---
Luckily I played healer for 10+ years on retail so now that I rolled tank for classic, I think I get the gist of my expectations.
---
I played pretty fine till I I unsubbed. Sorry I don't pay for bad nostalgia trips that aren't close to the original.
---
You just need to find some chill mofos. Gotta be friendin' all the good folk you meet along your journey. Its what I did in vanilla nad what I am doing on my tank when I play it.
---
Why would Alliance go for the Frostsaber when they can get "similar" cat mounts much easier?
---
I will use immolate if I'm killing elite mobs that are getting chain-feared since they go out of range pretty often, but usually my opening is: send in the pet, CoA, siphon, corruption. Drain life spam until it dies.  
---
At level 42 drain life is going to out-dps any wand, and the succubus does about 30% of my damage (turn off lash of pain, it drains mana you can use).  
---
Between all this, most mobs die just about the same time corruption/CoA are running out (lvl 54).
---
If you don't let yourself cap on hp (life tap) or your pet cap on mana (dark pact) you can easily chain pull 5+ mobs before you have to drink.  
---
Some more advice: if you can afford it, get every piece of the shadoweave crafted gear off the AH. It basically lasts until 60. +Shadow Damage is way more important than any other stats.
---
Step one: Go to Freewind Post or Bloodvenom Post
---
Step two: Shadowmeld and wait for a victim
---
Step three: Mind control someone from shadowmeld and make them walk off the ledge. Cancel the MC and once you are out of combat proceed to shadowmeld again in a slightly different location.
---
Repeat until your desired consistency of salt.
---
Going to Angor Fortress will get you 225 in an hour.
---
I was level 59 when BC came out.. so the grind just continued to 75.. and then I was just burnt out.. never got into any of the end game..although I was looking forward to it when I was just grinding to 60.. I look forward to it this time around too.. let's hope I make it
---
You don't need to HoT the locks because they tend to regen it on your own.
---
You SHOULD HoT the locks because healing is threat!
---
You don‚Äôt prevent ninja looters unless you change the loot system to master looter. But then whoever is group leader could essentially be a ‚Äúninja‚Äù
---
You cant stop anyone from rolling need. 
---
I normally think it‚Äôs pretty obvious in each run outside of raids. 
---
Let‚Äôs just say you run RFK and there is a 28 warrior and a 32 shaman (enhancement) 
---
Let‚Äôs say corpsemaker drops. Obviously would be an upgrade for both warrior and shaman. The level req of corpsemaker is 29. Both should need because it would be an upgrade. In my opinion if you‚Äôre level required to run an instance then you should be able to loot what drops if you need it, doesn‚Äôt matter what level you currently are. 
---
Now if you‚Äôre worried about ninjas the best way to combat them is wait to roll. See what the other members do. 
---
Most people are nice and not going to ninja anything on purpose. And if it‚Äôs a BOE it makes it much easier to admit a mistake and trade the item. 
---
But since there isn‚Äôt personal loot, the chances of something being ninjaed is just part of the game.
---
only?
---
I don't understand it. I've been playing 5.6 hours a day since the release - that's nearly 6 hours a day. At work. At home. Sure, I'm a warrior and taking my time, but I'm level 46. How is this possible?!
---
Still... I'll enjoy my grind thank you very much.
---
oh baby 50+ int for one crit, incredible!
---
Not gonna lie, they had us in the first half
---
I thought YouTube pulled it because of the forest backlash?
---
 I highly, highly, highly doubt that any server has a 5:1 ratio. Please stop believing those random census results.
---
You only need 39 other people to raid. If you can't find 39 people on a medium-high population server...well...
---
I respect your opinion but I think the phasing should probably be lowered in time length. I'm only 42 but I still think things like BG's and additional raids are sorely missing right now.
---
I just got a half chub from this post
---
I tank a lot and like to tank as well. 
---
In my opinion, the powerful prot talents don't scale that well at low levels. For leveling, go arms and stick with a two hander when solo. Tactical Mastery is the most important, the crit bonus and bleed, improved overpower, and make sure to get Mortal Strike as soon as you can so you have an instant weapon attack you can use. Weapon specialization is a pain while leveling though because you switch them so often, so you kind of just have to guess and hope.
---
If you really want, if you are level 50 and have a good one hander and a good shield (block value especially), you can respec prot. Take shield slam and tactical mastery. With a good shield Shield Slam does decent damage, and there are some nice utility skills in Prot as well. I did that at 50, took the 5 crit in fury, and then filled out the rest of prot. So at 60 I'm 11/5/35.
---
Hell yeah. 2004-2009 or so here. This damn thing ate up so much of high school, and now it‚Äôs even worse because I have no parents kicking me off the computer and I can drink scotch while I play.
---
I will do nothing of the sort. That video is region to me.
---
When the other PVE servers are on 30k minimum? Yes. Harder to find groups, less high end dungeon groups to try for gear, less active AH. Of course there will be raid groups, doesn't mean I'll get into one
---
think they are comming in Phase 3 i read that somewhere can't find source tho
---
Ya no matter the spec front loading all damage and getting some mana ticks is how most mana classes should be doing things. It is the same on my warlock where I put all my dots on a mob then wand until dead. Anyone casting constantly is doing it wrong and will be drinking constantly where people front loading will be getting in an extra 2 or 3 kills between mana breaks.
---
This, 100%. I'm leveling holy because I'm mainly duoing with a friend, but while leveling solo this is invaluable. I love healing, which is also why I rolled pally (and for nostalgia), and having the plate/mail gear and 2H for soloing is a must. It's slow, but definitely doable.
---
Seal of Justice comment is the most underrated. I use it while healing dungeons, especially when the AoE dps is a bit wonky or if dps is just being weird. It's saved us from many wipes I like to think, and I always wonder why other paladins never think to use it.
---
Have seen this joke like 3 times already in this sub lol how is it getting upvoted still
---
Reddit - Roll need on all boe rares/epics
---
My personal experience - Need if you plan to equip it (always check with group 1st), Greed if you dont.
---
He does tho.
---
I hear ya.  But the data we are getting is distance breakpoints, not time breakpoints.  Therefore I personally find the distance on the X to be more logical.  Obviously the amount of controversy right now shows that neither of us are really correct and that the way this chart is read is subjective.
---
I didn't even consider the X and Y being flipped until I went into the comments.  
---
The discussion is actually pretty entertaining honestly and funny to see how differently people see and read data.
---
thanks  mate :)
---
30k LMAO
---
Because something 2% weaker not being BIS immediately makes it unwanted loot. 
---
It is utterly baffling that people have this insane mentality that any slot without BIS might as well be empty or something. 
---
"Nah I don't want any of these huge upgrades, I will wait 2 years untill I win all my BIS in T1 raids!"
---
Your hunter alt is better geared than 99.9% of Hunter mains atm.
---
Best advice all day. So I guess im screwed until the BG trinkets come out otherwise all i can do is stand there and die when it comes to rogues I guess.
---
no mercy for horde filth. For the alliance!
---
This isn‚Äôt super cheap though, super cheap would be maybe fearing me into a big pack of mobs. Not intentionally exploiting the aggro radius of guards in a town. This is something that just shouldn‚Äôt be allowed, which from what a couple other people said it actually isn‚Äôt allowed
---
Welcome home OP, welcome home
---
I'd also argue that you should always have tactical mastery, so that means arms until at least 49.
---
If Berserking is used properly its better than blood fury. Hard to beat +5 axes tho.
---
OP, I feel like I should mention that as a warlock you have a separate trainer for your demons‚Äô abilities. Not sure if that‚Äôs something as easily missed too
---
I got a boe last night and said i needed it. The others rolled greed for me. It depends on who you're with.
---
It was a pug too
---
Yea ur chances to MT are pretty slim if ur quitting.
---
Mount savings are slow but steady so far.. Hopefully I hit 40 and 100g at the same time!
---
&gt; The end result is you end up using a lot of my mana that could've been spent healing the tank and I have to drink way more often
---
That sounds like a you problem since you choose to heal them. Im playing a lock. I lifetap like no tomorrow. I also have a whole bunch of tools to get all that health back.
---
Are Enhance Shaman in any way viable for raids, beyond totems? Mostly just a curiousity. 
---
The major changes I see that didn't exist for most of vanilla, or at least the early Vanilla content =
---
- Tranquil air totem added, giving them a threat reduction option.
---
- Increase in totem duration (patch 1.11)
---
- Decrease in totem mana cost (1.11)
---
- Frost mage talent 'Winters Chill' added which gives frost shock +10% crit rate, thus giving 10% more chance for it to proc Elemental Devastation (+9% melee crit rate).
---
Same reason as any.  Ethics/morals or the lack thereof.
---
What am I healing if they aren't tapping to full mana? That's the whole point of my comment in a thread telling locks to waste time drinking/eating instead of just tapping between pulls and never running OOM while the priest twiddles their thumb.
---
Content is piss easy.  Having efficient DPS and a tank that can protect them is the only way you clear stuff efficiently, and the healer has almost nothing to do besides DPS stuff themselves when people don't make use of them.
---
I'd be curious to see how it behave in Classic. Well that's a bummer if it doesn't stack. 5p still is a great mana reduction cost bonus.
---
Whenever I need assistance I just pay haha. I make money pretty quick as a Rogue, over 10g in pickpocketing alone.
---
Paid a tank 5g for RFD, paid a priest 10g to help me kill a rare in Un‚ÄôGoro.
---
It‚Äôs just easier to offer gold than to spam for hours and hope someone‚Äôs feeling generous or needs the quest.
---
I don‚Äôt mean to set a precedent, but I don‚Äôt have time to wait forever. Thankfully I‚Äôm now near enough to my guild tank in levels he said he‚Äôll help me out.
---
That's awesome I got left behind by my friend group.  They pushing level 51 and I'm 40.  üòî Cool to see y'all sticking together!
---
Son, please have a seat, we need to talk. You're 16 now, its time you take care of the family in my place. Keep everyone fed, get them to school and take care of any additional needs your mother might have.
---
I'm making a mountain out of an anthill because you're the thousandth warrior I've seen referencing weapon speed. It should just be removed from the info screen, so people can't possibly confuse others.
---
Yes.  Some of the runs can be pretty gross (run back to RFK/RFD for instance) and if the group has been going for a while the mobs at the entrance may have started to spawn again making it impossible to get back to the group.  Saves a ton of headaches if everyone just runs back together.
---
Ok then please tell me how you know how many seconds you have to run?
---
Time should be on the X-axis because of readability, not because it's technically required.
---
Considering I have a degree in mechanical engineering, I don't appreciate being condescended to.
---
That‚Äôs so.. sad? Impressive? I‚Äôm at a loss.
---
Even low tier gaming mice will change your world.  Go corded, get more than 3 buttons :)
---
Nothing you said makes any mathematical sense.
---
Damn.  I was hoping you‚Äôd gotten meta hud working and had just tweaked it a bit.
---
It‚Äôs such a good looking set
---
The game is roughly built around acquiring better loot to make your character better. In the term of need vs greed your statement above about selling it for money is greed. While someone needing it to improve their character is a need. 
---
But honestly there is no right answer to this question. It‚Äôs always group specific.
---
Honestly the only class i havent had to do this with was paladin, because their first 5 points drastically reduce the mana cost of their seals and judgement and with Blessing if Wisdom they can basically spam judgement and seals all day.
---
for karma
---
whats the plugin for gear stats?
---
But there is plenty of demand for good fury dps warriors. The top parsing dps warriors have 5x the dps of a ret paladin. 
---
So as a non tanking dps warrior I contribute more to a group then any other dos class. By your logic, all dps players are bad then simply for choosongba class that isnt warrior since they perform worse and contribute less than a warrior.
---
You dont have to tank to be a good warrior. Tell that to one of the ones putting out 1500 dps on the boss and laughed out of town.
---
Infinite Jealousy. All of my RL friends are either too busy, have no interest, or just prefer to spend their x hours of daily gaming elsewhere. I'd loooove to have some friends to do all this with!
---
wait... i need riding gloves + macro for changing them when I dismount/mount...
---
Jesus, all I do is go to college and I am only level 29... The real world must be easier than anticipated.
---
if you are 60 you can solo farm mara goblin and princess and if you are shadow you can add croc in as well
---
and that's why horde will get rolled in most PuG bgs
---
you can see my specc at the end of the video
---
It's not quite pre raid bis but it's really nice to get 9% hit chance if you don't have full pre raid bis. If you have full pre raid bis you don't need rune and can use Hand of Justice instead
---
I only have 3 pets that I will tame other than the ones I needed to level up skills. I tamed a nightsaber in Teldrassil that has been with me from level 10 to level 53 currently. The next pet I get will either be the wolf from BRD or Brokentooth. That's it. While I understand that getting new rare pets can be fun, I really like how I've had the same pet this entire time.
---
It's not that it doesn't stack.  
---
It didn't and it shouldn't. It's 25% per cast. Bounces are not new casts.
---
Play how you want, but warriors who spec for it,  have good macros for weapon and stance swapping, have been the best tanks I have run with in classic.
---
Lazy cleave dps tanks, which are the most common thing I see, are "fine" but rarely do those folks have good aggro management. They rely on the dps to reduce Ttk, if dps are knuckleheads, also very common, they don't have  the tools to pick it back up.
---
Not advocating for leveling pure prot, but saltiness aside, OP is not entirely off-base.
---
In my days you kept stuff on the deeprun tram, where it belongs.
---
You can use the gold to loot other items from the AH Boss. 
---
But yes, I agree it depends on the group. Maybe you have reasons to want gear to go to certain people.
---
Yea, but not everyone thinks like that, that's why its best to roll need, so you don't get fucked
---
Yep...I'm in it for the interaction, not the loot.  I ain't saying I won't roll need on something I actually need of course...but gold, meh, it comes and it goes.
---
Can we get a megathread for people bitching about mages? Its become 50% of the content on this sub and is getting out of hand. We get it, you dont like mages, lets move on with our lives and get to real content

you can prevent it easily. if everyone needs on boes ninjas have no chance of snatching it.

My cat that I've had since level 10 is named Spitz and is named after my cat growing up. He was the meanest cat I've ever known. When I switch to MM at 60, I'm going to tame Brokentooth and name him Spam after the only cat I've had as an adult. My character will level up with my childhood cat and spend it's time at max level with my cat that I had for 12 years as an adult. Don't know what I'm going to name the wolf I'll get for raids.
---
Same...
---
Went all in!
---
A level ~30 guy on my server has taken the last few days buying Thick Leather for cheapish and making Nightscape Headbands, which he sells in bulk for disenchanting directly instead of on the AH. I bought a few hundred from him during my leveling so we‚Äôre on friendly-ish terms. I asked him how much he gold he had, and it was ‚Äòabout 300‚Äô.
---
I did it for enchanting formulas, later on pets and transmog, so many runs.
---
I can use *most* the stats, but if I'm getting use out of the strength it means something has gone very wrong.
---
Unless I'm doing the gimmicky strength-stacking Survival PvP build where you try to "one" shot less geared players with a "use all melee attacks at once" macro. But that's a gimmick, and while hilarious when it works,  it's not actually any good. 
---
Anyway, no expert, but I'm pretty sure Ret and Prot Paladins use all those stats too.
---
He tried to argue a point and OP responded that he still disagrees. Your comment is the only one that serves no purpose. At least mine explains something, otherwise this comment would serve no purpose
---
Ya but as I said no need for it, I get there are some people that won't see it, but for how populated the server is right now no need. Maybe later in classic we may have to sit in trade for people
---
When did people stop saying AOE. I feel so lost and old
---
Was watching a streamer talk about why he did it and it made sense to me. The point he was making was that you gotta choose how you want to earn your gold endgame.  He was a tank and given the choice his first choice was to earn his money tanking.  So he'd do orb reserves. 
---
 And given the need for tanks I don't think that's such a big ask.  If you need X dungeon for anything other than the reserve item you get a tank.
---
But even with non tanks if someone organizes a run and is upfront about the terms of the run I think that should be fine.  If a mage wants Balestrom's Boogerstaff and he organizes a run on the basis its on reserve, he's organizing the run and I think its fine for him to do so.
---
You just make serious responses to frivolous comments.
---
Wow: 34 inch rog swift 3440x1440

Wowhead/other docs: 27 inch Asus 1920x1080
---
the only way the mob addon even works is it takes the amount of damage you do in a swing and then calculates what it would be based on the %. So if you swing and hit for 3% dmg, and you did 100dmg, then he's gotta have about 3.3k hp. There is no way to obtain that information on a player unless you dueled them or something.
---
I'm level 25 and at 16g. AH and mining makes good money.
---
No need to be bitter about something that happened 15 years ago. The bugs have been all patched now so there is no need to worry this time.
---
I usually have the tv on in the background. Binge watching King of the Hill at the moment.
---
Rend is a joke, general drak is a bit harder, you might struggle to beat him without a healer right now.
---
Everyone is basically in pre-bis/raid gear already, those early 60's bosses just aren't that difficult when everyone outgears it. Plus, those fights are so drawn out and non-bursty you can easily just have people taunt off and bandage; and pot when it's on CD.
---
Not to mention "that easy" but you still wiped on it twice, so it's not like you should be struggling to stay awake
---
Yeah, a mage touched you in a bad place....
---
There's a weird combo of people having lots of fun with it (like this guy), people who are pretty casual about it but enjoy some meatier RP, and then people who take it way too seriously and whisper you shit like "\[\[Your character wouldn't possibly talk to mine so casually, so you're either trolling or terrible at this. Blacklisted, reported and ignored.\]\]" 
---
All in all I love it though.
---
TL;DR - Aggro the bartender and AoE the entire room.
---
Not true as the catchup gear is not in the drop table currently and won't be until dire maul is released.  The loot will then be changed and gear added to certain bosses loot table.
---
Jeez was this made for a forum avatar in 2004?
---
Nice man! Unfortunately I am very indecisive so my main character is only around 23
---
No kids but full time work with other responsibilities means I don‚Äôt really have much time for games these days. 
---
Keep that grind up brother!
---
That's the perfect way of playing the game.
---
This is awesome.
---
Good old grateful dead
---
Why's it a waste? I've saved my VW's life countless times with it.
---
But have you heard about the time I ran a dungeon and a level 32 mage used aoe at an inappropriate moment?
---
Irked? I'm enjoying myself.
---
You must be fun at parties.
---
half the people just open trade and type "water."
---
naw dawg, at least say please.
---
I /guffaw at people i kill in wpvp/arena and I think I'm fucking hilarious. Dont @ me
---
I'm not who you were asking btw
---
I use old Reddit as well and you can do it there.
---
I love this. So glad to have all you new players enjoying this game for the first time
---
You need to consider that's \~8 AM for the east coast, so you MIGHT be able to find people without work/school that day for runs. Best bet is to probably try and find a group that plays at a similar time. It doesn't actually solve your problem, since finding that group of people will be just as difficult, but hopefully you'll only have to do it once rather than doing it every single day you want to play. 
---
Alternatively, you could play on an EU server, as that's much later in the day for them. Still before the end of work (it's around 1 PM for England, if I remember correctly), but you might get more people in that timezone. 
---
I don't know if you'll ever be able to do a full run in two hours though, not with pugs. By the time you get a group together, get to the instance, and then go through someone inevitably pulling 3-5 pats, you'll be out of luck I believe.
---
What you‚Äôre solving for is, by definition, the dependent variable. The independent variable is just the one that‚Äôs ‚Äúknown‚Äù without any calculations. For example, say I drive my car at 60 mph all the way to the next town. **Depending** on how far away the town is from my starting point, it will take me a different amount of time to get there. 
---
The travel time depends on the distance, and is therefore the dependent variable. As I pointed out in another comment though, you can say the opposite with the *exact same equation*. They‚Äôre literally the same thing, and your argument doesn‚Äôt make any sense. The only decision to be made on which variable you use on your horizontal axis is what information is fixed: do you have to run a specific distance, or do you have a specific amount of time? In game, you usually know the distance (or can estimate it), and need to know how to get there fastest.
---
This is satisfying in a very minor kinda way. Thanks for posting.
---
Yeah seems very fair
---
Just save it. People are focused on leveling now but in the next month or 2 when gen pop gets at or close to 60 they will be either going balls deep into professions or even switching to something else. With extra gold they will be willing to buy mats instead of farming. That's when you drop shit on the market.
---
ONCE every year AND FOR ALL of Azeroth
---
How is that no kids thing working for you, MrCreamypies?
---
LOS pull to end of bridge.
---
I have a level 30 Holy Paladin right now.  Duskwood was my best friend for the last five levels.  Loads of undead and lots of quests that people will beg for help with.
---
I use Blessing of Wisdom to have enough mana for long fights, Retribution aura for extra dps, and a two handed weapon.  I was able to solo Stalvan at 28 just by outlasting him.
---
Because its a good solution for boes and idiotic for bops?
---
I wasn't really referring to the azerite gear.
---
I'll break it down a little bit.
---
If you have a level cap character,
---
Level 1: Full heirloom gear. Gear scales with you. Kills all incentive to kill bosses and takes the RPG out of the game until you're basically level cap.
---
World quests, Benethil (or whatever it's called), and 5 man dungeons are all capable of giving loot that is superior than grouping with 25 players and killing bosses in the highest difficulty of the hardest content in the game. Maybe not world quests, but you get my point. The difficulty does not match the reward. The reward drives the incentive (and therefore can kill it).
---
Report him and he will be punished.
---
Should we tell her about Cataclysm?
---
&gt; My vote is always Need on BOEs in leveling dungeons 
---
And this is where confusion spreads. Doubtful your policy is Need on BoE's.
---
More likely it's need on BoE on purples, or blues. Never seen anyone in real life Roll need on Green BoE's.
---
Doing those damned pirate quests in Tanaris last night when a 48 Undead mage rolls up and starts doing the AoE grind. Being a frost (not imp blizzard) mage myself, I decided to the right thing: CS while he was casting blizzard. 
---
For the next 45 minutes, we would go back and forth, CSing each other during pulls but never *actually* engaging each other in combat. If he'd survive, I'd polymorph him back to full health and poke him with my dagger and run away /giggle'ing.
---
Stiff, if you're reading this, best of luck aoe grinding and I hope to continue the shenanigans if I see you again.
---
Or choose poorly, get frustrated with the name, and then set him free - free to go live in the wild with a shitty name and get harassed by all the "unnamed but at least it's better than that" beasts of the world.
---
just like people getting punted into lbrs from the bridge
---
Laugh a minute was only the beginning
---
Almost everything I put up sells. From 1-60 I got about 400-500 gold total.
---
Holy shit lol it is, no wonder I felt like it was talent starved...
---
&gt; You can't vary the rate at which time passes 
---
Never said you could. But we are certainly varying how much time it takes to get somewhere based on distance and means of travel.
---
I just go eat them yummy bodies to heal up. And yet healers still fill me up. Im like D: no save your precious mana.
---
Awesome! Thanks!
---
You joke, but that just triggered so many 4heads in this sub
---
Okay, let me try breaking it out for you:
---
BoP Item Drops:
---
* Depending on the specific item, only certain classes can use it as an upgrade.
---
* Players roll Need/Greed
---
* Nobody "rolls Need for gold" because vendoring provides very little gold, and because it would take an eternity for players to gear their characters if every single person rolled need on every single item in a dungeon, even if it wasn't an upgrade for them.
---
* Significant value is lost if it is given to a player who cannot equip it.
---
BoE Item Drops:
---
* The item can be traded for an upgrade, which means that every class can use it equally.
---
* Every class showed up to the run, so every class has equal claim on rolling for it.
---
* No value is lost when it's given to a player who cannot equip it.
---
* Auction House feeds are only 5%, and you can always sell expensive items in trade chat to avoid the fees.
---
* It is disrespectful to take loot from your party, when everybody earned it, and everybody can use it equally well.
---
* BoE items represent the same amount of gold for everybody, and they should be rolled as such, unless the party specifically agrees otherwise.
---
Does that make sense?
---
&gt;people having lots of fun with it (like this guy), 
---
I am 100% this is a fetish and he is fapping while you guys think it's "rp".
---
I can barely remember who I grouped with recently, there is no chance I remember the name of some Alliance rando.
---
Got revenge killed once recently. Saw a gnome rogue running across Shimmering Flats. I /threatened him and he stopped to look at me. We spent a few seconds staring each other down, then I closed the distance between us with Ghost Wolf and tore him a new one shockingly quickly (windfury lol). Then some time later he ambushed me while I was losing to an accidental multi-basilisk pull, which may actually have been a favor since you don't lose durability if you die to a player.
---
Learn how spell coefficients and downranking work and then maybe you'll understand.

I've had warlocks that tap down and then hellfire and kill themselves
---
I was thinking that to be my strategy, or at least level the one more than the other then split my time more evenly once the one had cought up to him.
---
I having a gaming mouse, but I prefer movement on wasd in conjunction to mouse. Shit, I meant unbinding S earlier.
---
But, if you're binding backwards walk to a different key, you're not unbinding it. I'm talking about people that unbinding because they don't see a need to ever walk backwards.
---
He lied.
---
No mini creamypies just yet
---
On a PvP server, against the opposing faction, that is cause for straight-up war. All-out war. All-out brawling, storm-the-beaches and let‚Äôs take this fight to the nearest capitol city and kill their leader kind of war. So if the same faction is on it, guard them while they fish.
---
If PvE server, the biggest ‚Äúwar‚Äù is a struggle over resources. Fish against opposite faction, and let friendly faction be.
---
To home this drunk guy must go.
---
I don't think theres a decreased chance to be dazed when on a mount? Do you have a source for this?
---
Yes you're right, it's a shithole and no one wants to live here because of that. That's why those costs are "abnormally high". That's exactly how it works.
---
Was seconds away from telling you to hit printscreen instead
---
Yeah that's still a faulty argument. There are things that can be improved without harming the core fundamentals that make classic have the strongest distinctions from modern WoW.
---
Equating having changes like dismounting automatically when you want to do anything, cast bars on enemies, minor energy caveats does not equal something as drastic as LFG or flying mounts.
---
xp/per hour donig ghosts in winterspring? 56 atm spamming BRD but going quite slow
---
I think reserving items is selfish, so I simply avoid those groups.
---
I don‚Äôt have a problem with those people forming their groups that way but it isn‚Äôt how I prefer to play personally.
---
&gt;you can't complete wc without a healer,
---
wc is a 5man dungeon where you don't have your full toolkit. UBRS is a 10man dungeon that's pretty easy to 5man up until the room before Drakk. I mean the waves come out like once every 2 minutes, you have plenty of prep time, and Rend doesn't have very much health.
---
Yes, Schweppes taste like lukewarm Sprite :&amp;
---
You probably wouldn‚Äôt be able to level as pure holy spec. It would probably have to be a holy/Ret hybrid.
---
There are a few talents in holy that are good for damage dealing, but you‚Äôll be severely lacking in damage mitigation. 
---
It‚Äôs possible you could level holy with a Tank and Shield in order to have better survivability
---
Bahahahahaha.
---
The pattern's not going to be worth anything in a month or two, way too easy to solo farm it as a mage.
---
You can reliably get it in under two hours of farming, hard to justify more than 70g or so and a few servers have it under 50g already.
---
This is fantastic!  Thank you!
---
It‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt understand what OP‚Äôs graph is trying to answer: how do I get from point A to point B fastest, if I know how far away they are from each other? They‚Äôre just used to seeing the opposite.
---
I'm sure one could, in theory, get all the way to level 60 without moving their character at all from the character creation spawn point. It would be a ludicrous effort, but we're talking theoretical.... but all it would take is a group continuously kiting mobs close enough for the unmoving person to receive their share of the XP. As they got higher and higher level, mobs would have to be kited from farther and farther away. It would take months, years even, but could theoretically be done.
---
7 downvotes? Nice. If u dont wanna fight for honor and glory for The horde, go to pve. Ima keep killing every alliance i see.
---
No you're so very wrong here. You bought your abilities and leveled up so that YOU could benefit. So that YOU could make it into dungeons and pvp and raids. You got spells and gear so you could quest and survive. You got these things because it's an actual need in the game. Youd never pick wow up just to never obtain gear or spells. 
---
You asking for me to pay for YOUR spells is nonsense af. I'm not asking anyone to pay me to open boxes, I'm asking them to not be butthurt like a child whenever 1 locked chest spawns of the 5  unlocked ones.
---
Welcome dad
---
are you in defensive stance?
---
metahud looks pretty much like an older icehud to me, what was different about it?
---
Many would have preferred progressive itemization, but that‚Äôs not what Blizz decided. Not much we can do about.
---
Plus, avoiding dealing with the abysmal itemization of early Vanilla is overall preferable for most people. That shit was awful.
---
Quality post!
---
I saw a undead rogue (skull lv) walking up to sw gate and as soon as he touched the cobblestones, he was attacked by the guards. Then he sprinted the hell outta there.
---
I was wondering what the heck he was up to but this answers my question.
---
Meh, i only play tanks. None of my toons have ever been specced DPS. I am a sucker for punishment. Barely hit lvl 50 last night, prot spec the whole way.
---
Phase 2 is pvp + dire maul. Phase 3 is next raid tier which I think is much longer away. Most people are getting antsy to murder each other, and I think it would be a good addition, along with dire maul. The "pack" is currently in the 40's so I could see it in 2-3 months that a lot of players are entering their 50's and looking for endgame!
---
Yeah but Druid‚Äôs are super rare
---
Honestly not worth searching for to see this guy‚Äôs content
---
Just to clarify, see below, he didn't realize that was for level 53. You will be able to get to natural weapons, so nature's grasp isn't wasted points.
---
It‚Äôs showing up as 1,2,etc being bonded twice on his main action bar and right action bar. There isn‚Äôt a shift modifier.
---
Elvui
---
Control+Button shows as C-1, C-2, C-3, etc
---
Shift+Button shows as S-1, S-2, S-3 etc
---
Not until later phases. Angerforge drops it for now, it should get moved to Emperor later on.
---
It's possible, I know there are quite a few out of bounds in vanilla that should still exist!
---
Do it for the steez
---
I agree, this does seem possible.
---
Can you elaborate how exactly?
---
I got into RFD easy as Alliance.  Just a small stroll from Ratchet and as a Warlock orc racials dont hinder me fearing them :P
---
So long as you've enjoyed your time, very right.
---
So emp and angerforge drop it?
---
If anything you can have one in a melee dps group to twist windfury and grace of air totems. Or find a raid that doesn't care as much about min/maxing all 40 spots.
---
It‚Äôs a mix. He‚Äôs nice for paying his rent. But at the same time it‚Äôs a shitty thing to do for loot. But it‚Äôs also....good? I‚Äôm conflicted..
---
Can't wait for phase 2.  The second pvp is incentivized there's going to be blood in the streets.
---
I suspect you wouldn't have too much trouble doing /who 60 warrior and just asking someone to help you out.
---
I've had a Sentry Cloak and Skeletal Club up in the AH 3-4 times now with no one buying...and at simple vendor markup prices too.  Zero takers.
---
That's my boy. Just tame him up, feed him a few mushrooms, and he's a loyal companion for life.
---
So how‚Äôd that one group go, though?
---
Obligatory 'what UI is this?' question
---
Can‚Äôt believe this dude typed lalalalala what a douche bag am I right??
---
Feeling entitled to an item at the expense of others sounds more selfish the giving everyone a fair shot at it.
---
this is fucking driving me nuts.
---
I love taking Rogues on my runs when I tank. Sap ain't great cc but it's fine. Lockpicking this early on is extra useful b/c of locked doors that the group may or may not have the key for. ALL THE INTERRUPTS!
---
Cloth turnins! It took around 8000 runecloth to get to exalted.
---
I want to say Hinterlands myself
---
I always tend to move when the mobs readjust behind me. Sometimes it means I‚Äôm dragging them for a bit until I can block again
---
See also: Seal of Wrynn for ring equivalent :)
---
I wish i had your stamina
---
I'm not really sure how much more clearly I can lay this out for you.
---
If everybody in the party can use the item **equally well**, then everybody should roll on it.   And it is **greedy** to take items that your fellow party members can use **equally well.**
---
BoE items **can** be used **equally well** by everybody, because they **can** be traded.**
---
BoP items **cannot** be used **equally well** by everybody, because they **cannot** be **traded.**  That's why people roll Need/Green for these items, so that loot goes to the person that the loot provides the most value for.
---
You can totally customize the update rate &amp; other various settings for Recount, so in short yes although I'm not sure what you're looking to do
---
If you're just looking to hide it, I believe you can use /recount hide and /recount show to hide the window and bring it up as needed
---
I was just thinking of something like this! I wish we had something that could do it!!
---
Right? reddit just made that Royson dudes twitch career, his stream is booming after the ninja loot post. 
---
Funny how the haters were the one to make that dudes career.
---
Rather than engage in blatant ad hominem, how about addressing my actual point?
---
Now not showing skin is progressive?
---
When stats were introduced they included vanilla stats
---
You can bind a key to hide and show the damage meter and only check it every so often.
---
&gt; not as bad in Portland
---
HA.
---
Moved there, rent was ~500 a month.
---
Two years later and its $1000 a month.
---
Moved back home because I was going to be homeless as a retail department manager
---
haha if there's some min-max strat that says don't train health funnel, that's cool. I don't claim to know the class better than anyone else, but I know that health funnel has been massively useful with the way that I play the class. My goal is to never get touched by a mob, and if my VW dies, the mobs are coming.
---
I think you misunderstood. He did find the rare spawn in the dungeon, he was under the impression that it shouldn't be there since Atlatloot indicates it's not supposed to be in until phase 5. It would make sense since it wasn't added to the game until 1.8.4, but he doesn't drop anything significant anyways so not a big deal.
---
&gt; Searing Gorge Burning Steppes Western Plaguelands Eastern Plaguelands Un'Goro Crater Silithus Felwood Winterspring
---
Except they don't. Plaguelands give me quests for 60 mostly, which I can do. Winterspring has a couple, so does Silithus but they will never give me two entire levels.
---
Since the paladin talent gives mounted and running speed I don't think it makes a difference
---
Are you actually retarded?
---
0/10 bruh :p
---
5-10 levels in the range where these are relevant is a lot shorter than the amount of time it would take to grind the equivalent gold at that level..  You're acting like these items make much of a difference.  They don't. The meta of the game is AoE dungeon farming -- yes for 90% of the playerbase.  
---
Again, twinks are the only case where these items actually have significant value.  Choosing to equip it is objectively a lower value than using it as a twink or selling it.
---
Theramore
---
Yards and meters in game are the exact same distance and depend on which locale you're running in
---
I mean, you can use the "if the hunter is good and kites you" argument for literally any 1v1 matchup. But kiting at the perfect range and timing your auto-shots is a very tough thing to do. Most fights don't actually go that way and one slip up can quickly put the hunter on the defensive.
---
Generally spriests have the edge against hunters and many other classes 1v1 simply from their sustain (health, not mana) via vampiric embrace. Locks are ruthless for the exact same reason, great sustainability in 1v1 battles.
---
It‚Äôs pretty common to not start at zero when there‚Äôs no useful data between 0 and where they decided to start.
---
Also, he‚Äôs trying to show how time changes in respect to travel speed.  It makes sense.
---
Its on a different layer.  Of time.
---
Where were you grinding these whelps?
---
Blaumeux has been a 10/10 server so far. Friendly people and high population but almost never had a login queue
---
Mobinfo2 mate
---
Can't you like, sell armor kits or something?
---
Can't do DPS when you're dead. All he had to do was build up a couple combo points on your target, SnD, then pop his BF. You'd have threat established by then and he wouldn't have an expensive repair bill.
---
Low end aoe damage and group buff spam aren't going to hold aggro from a geared aoer spamming with no regard for threat.
---
If a guy can use a piece of gear, I let them have it. It's a happy experience finding a nice drop. I can get money all sorts of ways.
---
Ok I took it in... Now what do I do?!
---
Why even play classic wow if you want to multibox? It just trivializes the experience without the thing that makes mmorpgs good, meeting people.
---
I doubt it's fun pressing 1 button and killing things. What's the point of you even playing for more than a week after the gimmick stops being fun?
---
Classic wow is meant to take it slow and have fun interacting the world with people. Multiboxing really should be bannable, it's blizzard sanctioned botting.
---
I can understand why you want to pretend this is about BoP versus BoE.
---
However, it's not about that, it is about value.
---
Some are arguing about BoE purples should be need.
---
Some are arguing that BoE blues should be need.
---
Some are arguing that any BoE that is a twink item should be need.
---
Some are arguing that Any BoE over some imaginary gold threshold AH value , e.g. 15g, 50g, 100g are need.
---
and very Rarely you get the ANY BoE should be Need, but when ask to clarify they actually meant one of the above, but they put off the decision about at what price point they meant until they see what drops.
---
However you don't want to pick value to state your argument on, because as soon as you do the greed becomes transparent.
---
Right, because elites fall over all by themselves once your 60.
---
If your farming EPL or Winterspring elites, or dungeon bosses the parry and riposte is very valuable.
---
Oof, if leveling as a solo warrior is WoW on Hard mode, you seem to have selected ‚ÄòInsanity‚Äô
---
Out of curiosity, what positions did you interview for and why were there more than one? Did you get offers for all of them? Did you refuse those offers then and if so - why? 
---
And most importantly, do you work there right now or have you worked there for any length of time?
---
That brings up another question; what exactly is 'totem twisting'?
---
Does this make group composition more important? I guess my next question is this only with ‚Äòphysical attacks‚Äô or does spell damage count as ranged?
---
Again. Your reasoning behind needing a BOE item is a greed roll. 
---
And to add to my point what makes a BOE blue different from the random silver bar that drops that you probably just roll greed on and if you win vendor. Just since that doesn‚Äôt sell for a high price on the AH it‚Äôs not a need all of a sudden? Sounds like a greed issue which is literally the roll option. 
---
Im arguing actual meanings to the rolls not if you should need or greed. If your party all decides to need BOE then cool. If you were someone who could of used that upgraded BOE and lost to someone selling it on the AH you‚Äôd probably feel like you were ninjad.
---
Not many people would ask "how far can we go in 't' seconds." They'd more likely ask, "how long would it take to reach 'd' yards." Whether or not it *can* make sense to put time on the y-axis, it makes *more* sense to put it on the x-axis, as more would intuitively understand that.
---
And so could he.
---
&gt;without even considering the fact that int also gives you more mana for longer fights.
---
Lmao int is utter trash. The only use it has is in raid fights where you would otherwise be completely oom after exhausting evocation, mana gem, mana pot, demonic rune, etc.
---
And that's not even talking about leveling up, which OP is asking about, where intellect is completely and utterly WORTHLESS. The only time is has value is if you're standing around at full mana (which you shouldn't ever really be while leveling). If you aren't at full mana, intellect is worthless.
---
Intellect does fuck all when you consume a mana gem. It does fuck all when you regenerate mana in any form whatsoever. Spell damage, on the other hand, makes each point of mana more valuable.
---
I bet you think vigor is a good talent for leveling rogues.
---
It‚Äôs no coincidence the same person who takes pictures of their screen also didn‚Äôt know to scroll down.
---
Yeah but it‚Äôs not nice peoples fault and we shouldn‚Äôt shit on them for being nice just BC others are bad
---
Truly a classic
---
It's funny because I had the opposite experience. I went to the grand exchange in OSRS and I was bewildered that (unless I just badly misunderstood the interface) you can't see what is being sold, how many are available, at what price. There's a nomjnal price but as far as I could tell it was arbitrary and unrelated to what prices were being traded at. You just have to blindly place buy or sell orders and hope it works.
---
I hope that's the case. I swapped to windseeker because the pop on my main was so skewed in terms of faction. Hope I dont regret that.
---
When VW is nearly dead you should be sacrificing it
---
Did it three times in an hour a few days ago, each time a higher level warrior offered to come with. It's a warrior thing.
---
Depends when you joined. They changed the population display so it's no longer the total population of a server. It now displays how close the server is to hitting a queue time.
---
So while full/high used to mean the servers couldn't hold anymore people, they now just indicate if there's a queue or not
---
Server transfers have been running and lots of alliance on my server have transferred, so it's likely that the populations have started evening out and most servers are going to be quite full but not overtly so
---
No unauthorized specified either. Blizz does not care. Thousands of people are using cloud services with their platforms.

I don‚Äôt understand what your complaint is? You don‚Äôt like leatherworking?
---
The key bindings changed for the better üòÅ
---
Dude, we are not robots, the same solution doesnt have to apply to 100% of the things that have monetary value, why are you so dense?
---
Yup, totally agree with this. It can be useful in very few situations to keep moving, like the healer is stunned/slept/silenced or something, but in general it's far less disruptive to just sit there and take the hits.
---
Uncheck in the dropdown (top left) "show unavilable"
---
What‚Äôs wrong with crafting the set for yourself and maybe selling a few for profit later?
---
Kind of fucked up you lied about this part lol
---
The twin Emps swap location. They have an aggro reset when that happens. 
---
Also, can you shoot me a message? I have a question about an add on
---
It does in Idaho
---
Is it cause of the water? Cause I feel like it's not a huge deal to have the healer rez everyone if there's no mobs directly next to everyone's bodies
---
I get what you're saying but you shouldn't encourage players to tank who have no want nor drive to do so. They likely have their own reasons against wanting to tank. If they're playing fury warrior they're likely not in the shop to tank, telling them to put on tank gear won't change how they approach the dungeon nor will it suddenly change their experience as a tank.
---
Literally not a single item that I wear has been changed in any itemization patch but okay
---
Press Windows key, type snip. Click snipping tool, copy the image, paste in Reddit.
---
HAHA I do this on my rogue..I sneak up and then pop out of stealth on their lure and then be like "How did I get here and what happened to that dwarf girl I was talking to?" or something similar
---
I've seen people selling the CD for 5G which seems low. Even 10g + buying the felcloth is still cheaper on my server than buying mooncloth for 25g on the AH. 
---
I've just been making the mooncloth myself and selling it.
---
Suuuuper late on this but I wanted to let you know that you can use excel's number formatting to create an easier to read G/S/C output.
---
In the dropdown where you can select number/fraction/decimal/etc you select "More number formats" which brings up another dialogue box.
---
Select "Custom" and where it says Type: put in #0"g" 00"s" 00"c"
---
Highlight all cells that need this and change to this custom format.
---
12345 will now be formatted as 1g 23s 45c
---
It breaks your current format (decimal gold) but this can be fixed if you multiply the outputs by 10000.  Alternatively you can use #0"g". 00"s" 00"c" but the previous example would read 1g. 23s 45c (I can't can't remember if/how the decimal can be removed)
---
The formatting should carry over to google sheets if you're importing.  Just wanted to let you know in case this was of any help!
---
I have a rank 2 hunter skill I can't seem to train because rank 1 doesn't appear on my list anywhere. It's confusing the fuck out of me.
---
Or I'm just not playing warrior which had all their itemization buffed ? It hardly impacts any other class, healers get basically the same gear, and casters get neck+belt with hit that's all. As a rogue there's not a single prebis item that the current itemization buffs, not one.
---
250g on my server
---
I think its dropping a totem while another totem's buff is up. Windfury -&gt; Air -&gt; WF -&gt; Air
---
Advice noted.  
---
Nowhere in my recommendation did I suggest forcing ones self to tank against ones will... No very clearly means no.
---
I simply offered a route to getting gear (both the sweet sweet BiS Fury gear and the boring, bland, blah tanking gear) that is less fraught with long wait times and group formation struggles.
---
Play the game you want to play, but I‚Äôd wager the less time spent languishing in LFG chat the better.
---

We have no choice but to Arthas this Arthas.
---
You're not serious right...
---
Auctioneer also does.
---
We need more people like you :D
---
You can set up searches specifically to look for vendor differences, it's fairly fast, actually.
---
I only disenchant when the disenchant results are worth more than the vendor or ah price. Otherwise just sel the item and buy stuff on the ah. There are addons like tsm that display the enchantment, vendor and ah price.
---
Tukui has a built in health/mana counter that updates when you are fighting an enemy. Not sure how it works with friendly targets but you can sometimes see their health.
---
Doesn't work for linen or wool. Silk and up it's great for.
---
That's not the same as getting higher level means putting effort into the game while getting power by having more characters via multiboxing isn't acquired ingame an can exceed what is possible with a single character.
---
When you get killed by a higher level player you can at least aspire their level.
---
Anyone have a recommended keybind set up for late game warlocks?
---
I‚Äôm running drain tank, so far I only have q for wand, e for drain life, mouse up for dark pact, my two mouse buttons are pet attack/auto run, and my SB is shift 1.
---
Anyone have a preferred keybind setup they wouldn‚Äôt mind sharing? I‚Äôm not sure exactly where to put what, or which skills I should even have bound.
---
I guess so but I dont know how people can get tone from text. But its whatever have nice day my guy
---
Ither dance?  Nelves have 2 dances?
---
There‚Äôs an addon. Not at the pc nor do I remember it.
---
Contact support.  They replaced my G503 for free.
---
you'd have to loot like 200 level 70 junkboxes to go from 125 to 175 though right?
---
The ritual has begun...
---
I got one from a chest a few days ago and thought it would be worth more but on my server it is also only worth 4g.  Decided to keep it since i'm a druid but seriously considered selling it since i am also destitute lmao.
---
&gt; SUPPLY YOUR OWN FOOD if there is no mage in the group. I love watching everyone drink while the warlock sits there and life taps knowing that the healer will heal them after he refills his whole mana bar drinking his expensive drinks. 
---
I don't expect to get healed after life-tapping. That is what Siphon Life / Drain life is for.
---
Actually I find most warriors will try it and the stress and hassle isn't worth it.  I'm confident and if people give me shit I quickly call them out for what they are doing wrong. STFU hunter, stop multishotting before the mobs are in range of demo shout and maybe you won't pull aggro etc. But if you are a new warrior and don't understand why you can't hold aggroe and everyone is being shitty to you, why even bother?
---
Why does the game refer to you use ihr and not Sie oder du?
---
Must be nice to have friends. I've tried to make some in wow but it never works out.
---
I just mean if you play solo as a warrior I hear that it's very hard to level. We only level together so I'm just constantly healing her and she never has to take a break until I run out of Mana.
---
&gt; demo shout spams 
---
Demo shout spam isn't a good plan anymore, they fixed the threat values, and even at rank 5 the threat is minimal now.  
---

---
Keep it up as a defensive debuff but do not bank on it to hold aggro, especially if you are 55 and your DPS is higher, particularly 60s approaching pre-raid BiS gear.
---
Do you use ThreatPlates or a similar addon?
---
On Sulfaras?
---
Huh weird, ive put together 3 or 4 groups for it now and havent had that much trouble
---
Move so mobs they aren‚Äôt behind you. 
---
Melee don‚Äôt want you to move. 
---
Range don‚Äôt care.
---
Are you for real? Fuck sake
---
That's why you use a Succubus cause of the charm not to mention fake casting lol, but I hear what you're saying.
---
Nice! Also, a Tauren warrior named Nightstalker, nice
---
He got Friend Gnomed
---
That‚Äôs what I figured, put the hunters to use for the ranged and melee chars for obvious close damage buff. Shammy is a good note for being used as the healer for the totem buffs.
---
...
---
Not as nice as buying it off AH though.
---
Startattack is for melee
---
I actually removed T keybinding and set it to 
---
#showtooltip
---
/cast !Auto Shot
---
So I can always auto attack depending on situation
---
Intimidating shout, duh.
---
Did you find my multibox? üòÇ
---
Idk this seems like its out of more than curiosity lol
---
I pull threat immediately from my succubus, and I dont understand how people always say "just fear" a mob when that nearly always agros more mobs.
---
I literally never give water to randoms for free, unless I'm just standing still and feel generous.
---
This made me laugh harder than I care to admit.  
---
Also, why did I make my mage and warlock gnomes?
---
Please remember later. This sounds like something I'd like to have.
---
Didn‚Äôt say he was just said that in my experience almost all the mages are douches...there‚Äôs a difference between asking for an appreciated tip and demanding outrages amounts of silver for food/water/int buff....I don‚Äôt know any context here so I‚Äôm not commenting on this situation I‚Äôm only stating my own experiences....this post actually made me laugh. Either way I also said there are those cool guy mages that help without a second thought so I‚Äôm not just bashing them all
---
Consider grinding the timbermaw in southern felwood. You get rep, all the drops a humanoid would drop, plus if you did the flower cleansing quest you get the felwood specific drops to cleanse the flowers in felwood which are very useful for all aspects of the game.
---
Timbermaw have some solid enchanting patterns and other various recipes that get released in later phases.
---
Sounds like a Jazz loving troll to me.
---
It's because we spent 15 years being harassed. We put the time in. We adapted and overcame.
---
These sweet summer mage children haven't had those experiences yet.
---
I'm rocking a  49" Samsung CHG90 QLED Gaming Monitor and love it. Plenty of room with UI to spare!

---
You are right in one aspect. It probably wasn't due to layering that people were able to reset bosses in MC. It was most likely due to another bug not related to the technology that brought us layering. Still the fact that people respawned raid and dungeon bosses remains, no matter what you want to call it. Go crawl back under your bridge and get some sleep you grumpy fool.
---
Can we get this in a more compressed form for us mobile users? Far too high res /s
---
Moments like this feel great. Especially if you're on a PvP server.
---
The other day I worked together with a hordie to clear an area where it was impossible to pull mobs 1 by 1. So we just attacked them together.
---
Another time I helped a horde kill gorillas so I could skin them after he looted. Was fun until some high lvl guy came along and nuked me. I hope the guy I helped made him feel bad about that.
---
If its cool with you I'm just going to ignore all of your points and pick out the specific portion I like. And to really sell my imitation, I'm going to fucking throw in some god damn cursing because it really sells the point. 
---
&gt;The only use it has is in raid fights where you would otherwise be completely oom after exhausting evocation, mana gem, mana pot, demonic rune, etc.
---
Cool we are on the same page. int is AWESOME. Can't forget the all caps.
---
if a BoE rare/epic drops and everyone is rolling greed, should i still need it?
---
Lmfao, you wouldn't trade me. 14 years of PvP servers and I've never seen it this bad. Every server is different, but don't try and tell me Skeram isn't a slaughter fest for alliance. For the first time I am considering just shelving the game because it's so bad and I'm not rerolling or swapping to some dead server. 
---
I always love when people use a certain experience as an example when they got camped. I can't even PICK a time I got camped because it happens non stop. I'm not going to bother looking your server up, but Skeram has the farthest ratio off, so yeah, you wouldn't trade.
---
first i would like to thank you for your answer, and providing a talent tree.   
---
but saying i did half-assed the work is a little rude if i say so myself, this is my first time playing priest, and im trying to wrap my head around a build that would meet my needs, not everyone\`s  
---
may i ask you why not remove 1 point in silence resolve to get the final point in matyrdom   
---
\- i feel like 16% threat reduction might be enough and the final point in matyrdom will greatly help in BG's
---
samething, why not remove 1 point from spell warding making it 8% to add into blessed recovery   
---
\- to get 8% spell damage reduction, and add a buff ( to protect from dispels in pvp )  
---
some people seems to sware from inspiration and its armor bonus is (tank healing pve, and raid pvp) you seems to disagree, care to explain ?   
---
why do you think having the fifth point in spiritual guidance or the fift point in mental strenght is beter than the last point in improved healing   
---
thank you verry much
---
I need help on this topic as well. I leveled up Gnomish engineering, crafted all I need and then tried switch to Goblin. Relearned my profession from 0 and on 200 skill read book in Tanaris gnome house and chose Goblin engineering. Now I can access Goblin Trainer without having a membership card and I don't have an option to renew it. Am I screwed? Is it still possible to get card and start renewing it somehow?
---
Your server is wild, I‚Äôm consistently selling low level boes with good stats for 2-3x vendor price
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/news=295091/blackrock-depths-loot-tables-use-pre-1-10-sources-in-classic-wow
---
Nice strawman. It's actually sad how many boxers try to defend themselves with stupid arguments
---
Why would there be a tier set for fury ? It‚Äôs for tanks.
---
VW threat is bad a it does the lowest pet dps.
---
Could be argued the other way around too.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong, but that only compares it to the market value of the final product right? Not the vendor sell price.
---
Succubus and imp. Voidwalker only used when you need a shield or maybe when you are pulling a named mob out of a group of mobs.
---
I searched most of the pre-raid bis Mage gear I could remember offhand. The biggest difference was each item with spell power had about 6 extra in the final version as compared to the original. Definitely nice to have, but not game changing.
---
Worth less than 4g on my server.
---
Not as big an idiot as one would have to be to ban someone from a subreddit without even telling them why, or responding to the banned user inquiring about it. Now *that* would not only be a fucking idiot, but also a real asshole!
---
I'm pretty sure that all auras only affect other party members.  This is why it's not worth bringing a shadow priest for the buff, because it only adds up to 15% X 4 = 60% extra shadow damage for warlocks when you could just bring another warlock and get 100% extra damage.
---
Don't quote me on this one.  I'm recalling from memory a bunch of reddit comments from years ago.  There's a lot of room for error there.
---
I actually have a question. Once you level up a skill that you already had do you need to replace your, lets say new rank 3 skill for the rank 2 in your skill bar?
---
if you're a spellcleave scrub group sure
---
well im not exactly an expert concerning rogues, but the healer part is very wrong, my shamans healing gear should be nowhere near as strong. shoulders gloves legs and ring should never be there with those stats.
---
Nah but figure most servers probably have guilds with the same name.
---
A guy that doesn't know how to take screenshots, doesnt know how to filter, and doesnt have a mouse, knows how to work the AH? Big doubt.
---
Warlock
---
I disagree. Getting a drop is always a good time.
---
Yes you do
---
The absolut fuck did I just read.
---
And I've never been through a party that passed BoEs to people who needed them unless they were low value blues. It's always been all greed or all need and possibly sell it at a discount if someone could use it.
---
Anecdotal circumstance has little value in this kind of discussion. A BoE is a lottery item that has no ties to the content your party is doing and it is rather selfish to expect others to pass on the value of the item just because you can equip it. It's the same concept as telling hunters that they can't roll on Hand of Justice because warriors and rogues can use it more effectively.
---
Are we talking items you've worn? Or BoEs you haven't equipped. My first response was for the former. There are a ton of twinks items sub level 20. Search for level 19,5 and 1 twinks guides.
---
It had no  reference to my comment. Are you stupid? (Actual question)
---
FAIL druid with no manatee form haha
---
Yeah it‚Äôs more convenient to do it on the phone and it gets the message across exactly the same way a screenshot would. The commenters are a bunch of circle jerking divas trying to look cool in front of eachother. ‚ÄúTake a screen shot!‚Äù
---
I know. When I played WoW originally it was already live for almost a year so the economy was big enough to play the AH. this is still far from it. 90% of the time when I go to post a green, I see I can make a profit of just a couple of silver above the vendor price. the margin is so thin that you end up losing money if you don't sell on your first attempt because you lose your deposit. I thing I even vendored a blue at some point it's ridiculous.
---
Obviously you should blink, mount, then dismount when blink is off CD, remount, etc.
---
But that sounds like hell
---
Wow. Way to have a really good point and then shit it all up at the end. I main tanked one of the top guilds on my server back in vanilla, but I‚Äôm level 44 because I have a demanding job and a wife who doesn‚Äôt want me to tell without her. So take your ‚ÄúAll the noobs are still leveling‚Äù post, and sit and spin on a [Twig of the world tree]
---
I'll just drop this here:
---
https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/global-ignore-list
---
Work's amazingly and allows me to be extra spiteful.
---
I‚Äôm level 47, and Princess Theradras‚Äô Scepter dropped (req. lvl 49). Would it be best for me to use this, Gatorbite axe, or executioner‚Äôs cleaver? I‚Äôm an arms warrior. I also managed to get the Blackstone ring, so I was considering dual wielding Thrash Blade and something else.
---
Classic has/had some really weird gear.
---
There's absolutely not enough axes to make every warrior an axe Orc warrior....
---
There's only a single 1h epic axe in phase 1, and 1 2h axe.
---
Next phase no new ones introduced unless they add the nightfall 2h recipe.
---
Next phase with BWL you get 3 added, 1 1h and 2 2h.  Then nothing until AQ, when 2 more 2h get added, and a single 1h that has int on it, finally a single 2h and a single 1h in Naxx.
---
That's a total of 4 1h axes across all 6 phases of content.  That's gonna be enough for your fury warriors?  
---
Not even APES had all their warriors be human and there's a much better case for that as there's more than twice the number of swords + maces.
---
I believe it is, but only slightly and depends on where you're coming from if it will be worth it or not. From what I can gather, the tram takes 60s to get between the cities, and pauses for 12s at each end.
---
Love doing this with my box people get so confused!
---
Also interested
---
check the rest of the comments and even OP agreed to redo the graph
---
You'll use slam as a rage dump.
---
If you think it's some massive advantage where you just pay to win, maybe you should try multiboxing, it isn't easy to set up and use efficiently.  World PvP?  One howl of terror and the entire party is split up and disorganized, ripe for being picked off one by one.
---
 /shrug
---
Sorry buddy don't trust you
---
Wetlands lockboxes got me to 175 pretty easily. From there is was mostly junkboxes till I could open the Searing gorge ones.
---
I find it interesting to see how easy it is to become racist from things like this.  "LOOK I RAN WITH A BAD MAGE SO I HATE ALL MAGES NOW".  I know people will say this is thinking too much, but it's pretty clear the same logic can be applied to some pretty hateful thinking.
---
Do you use a microscope to read the text on your ui?
---
Yup only see evade when my succubus opens up as I am throwing a spell on the mob.
---
Please point out where I made that mistake - I'm really not being confrontational here with you. Just trying to be better at communicating! I was trying to say that most of the people at level 60 right now are not noobs and that the noobs mostly reside in the 1-59 range. I never meant to imply that all of the people that aren't 60 are noobs...
---
I have to say, yes, it's not cheating, but I always get a bad taste in my mouth whenever I see it.
---
Isn't the base patch right now 1.12? So should be there now I think. And I mean, stay wise it's not much if a upgrade. 5 more healing and 3 mp5. Dunno if that's worth the 200+ gold to farm materials.
---
I've got a Ghost Saber and I named him Casper. My first pet was a Raptor, and her name was Lizzy.
---
I know but you can't configure it to look like the screenshot which I tried for 30 minutes
---
Made 3 so far and all have sold within 1-6 hours
---
Get a mech strider at 40. Till then just save up cloth and do the remaining nelf quests in places like feralas. Theres a major drop in rep gain once the quests are out of your level so dont bother running back to powerthtough them.
---
iNsEnSiTivE
---
You‚Äôre right. You‚Äôre so smart!
---
Go through the classic wowhead comments of any rare dungeon weapon drop
---
I think hate for rogues on pvp servers primarily came from level 50+ rogues hanging around low level zones and murdering lowbies and then vanishing, only to pop up at some other nearby location and do it again and again.
---
What do you do?
---
Missing pyromancer Loregrain
---
Yes I would do that. If he says he needs it and will equip it later, then I will believe him. Rather not assume the worst of people, if they want to be shitty in game that doesn't really effect me. It is as if that item didn't drop at all for me.
---
Just because its allowed doesn't make it not cheating. The game is not designed around that shitty multibox bullshit. If it wasn't making blizzard more money it would 100% be classed as illegal.
---
That wiki info says 1.9 aren't we on version like 1.13?
---
These screenshots. 
---
Christ.
---
I'd rather let other people feel like they won the lottery.
---
Found the mage
---
I think it's actually the opposite. A lot of children that grew up with touch screens and their main device is mobile.
---
Is that Greta?
---
&gt; It's all relative to the other servers.
---
What do you mean? the maximum amount of player allowed to be logged in a server is changing during the day? 
---
I would expect them to raise the cap by night (most played hours) and lower it during the day but that would keep the server status almost fixed..
---
"Provides immunity to Charm, Fear and Sleep while active.  May also be used while already afflicted by Charm, Fear or Sleep.  Lasts 5 sec."
---
WotF blocks both of those, and can be used once affected. If someone pops it BEFORE affected, then they obviously made a mistake.
---
All your big points. Claiming the addon somehow made cities empty-easily proven false. 
---
Your claim that it was banned-false. 
---
Meanwhile I already answered what was changed in the addon in the post AND linked a source but you still didn't get it. 
---
I mean dude...you got nothing right and you were incredibly smug about it.
---
Powerfully.
---
Did you mayhaps play on the maelstrom server back in the day?
---
Well it also turns out they found a clip of that victims GM also ninja looting, telling everyone to greed as he need rolls on an item on stream. Doing exactly what royson did.
---
So now there‚Äôs some fuckery as that GM is now being seen as a hypocrite in asmons eyes and his communities. Both guilds say they‚Äôll goto ‚Äúwar‚Äù with each other but the details of how that‚Äôll happen are unclear even to themselves.
---
Not all of the recipes are profitable. Some of them will only ever be a money sink and should be avoided as much as possible.
---
Sometimes you get lucky and people will post items at or less than vendor price, some auction add ons even have settings specifically for those.
---
I use Auctionator which allows me to save searched for items, I can even make 'shopping lists' so I have mine sorted into 'Cloth &amp; First Aid', Cooking Ingredients' and 'Leather/Hides'. I just click the item and it scans AH, listing those items in order of cheapest per unit which makes it easy to see which ones to buy and I do not have to calculate if that stack of 17 is cheaper per item than those stacks of 1 because it does it for me.
---
What the fuck... who cares lmao the quality is fine
---
Or maybe he is named after Fortis Watches.
---
what do rogues offer in organized BGs? picking 1v1 fights? those shouldn't happen a lot in organized BGs. What else do they offer? Decent flag defenders i guess, but even at that there are better options
---
In vanilla, you could still get xp after 60, but when it filled up nothing happened.
---
This WILL get your account banned.
---
That's a good way to be man. And play more casually
---
Taking images with your phone lol
---
It‚Äôs still pretty slow
---
Is it twice as long? no then its an unfair advantage.
---
if you're leveling 5 characters is it 5 times as long? still no
---
Imagine the day you will find out about the print screen button. That will be a great day.
---
Haha I'm about done talking sense into this thread. The point is that NO pet can tank and hold threat. The VW has the lowest damage out of all your pets, so why then if nobody can hold agro would you use the one with the lowest damage? I promise you are not playing your maximum output and ability if you are using a VW and especially if you are using funnel too.
---
i think he just meant you don‚Äôt specifically need it, it‚Äôs a way to save money for your mount by only training the skills you use every fight
---
If you haven't tried it, you should try Vernor's gingerale!
---
I do not like Canada Dry.
---
I DO like Shweppes.
---
I LOVEEEEEEE Vernor's. It's even barrel aged for 3 years! =)
---
Ahh so I should just get the mech mount right now and wait till I‚Äôm 60 then?
---
Dw isn't the best spec while leveling - the ring won't be enough hit, but don't let that stop you from doing it. Im an orc arms warrior and I'm planning to farm the axe since I'm axe specced.
---
Oh, God it's so hard. This is my first time playing, and my fiance is about 15 levels ahead of me so he's been doing lots of dungeons while I've been leveling solo as an orc warrior, and it's a slow grind. I luckily have artisan first aid so I have lots of silk bandages, and my fiance will make me conjured bread often. He will occasionally come and help me quest or dungeon, but I'm really proud of myself for all this solo leveling. :)
---
Sometimes it's a wipe but I die like 20s later so theyll be back way before I get back anyway
---
Oh for sure lol I definitely signed up for it and I‚Äôm having a lot of fun on the server.  There is always some shit going on somewhere.  I‚Äôm just stating what‚Äôs inevitable.  Asmon‚Äôs guilds are def gonna poop on the server a few times during the event.  Their numbers are nuts.
---
I agree 100%
---
Titanic legs are phase 5 though.
---
What level were you when you learned how to use printscreen?
---
As a math and physics major I can assure you that you're wrong and OP agreed to redo the graph because of complaints, not because the graph is wrong. We're looking at time to destination which makes this a function of distance.
---
I used to be part of a guild on MG called Prism. Does that sound familiar to anyone?
---
What are you talking about?? 
---
It does make citys empty.  Explain how it doesnt make them empty. 
---
Maybe it wasnt banned but I can see it was heavily modified from it's original release.
---
I feel like SoR, SoL and SoW work, but SoC does not.
---
Got to get the "retail" mindset out of your head for fury warrior gear here in the first couple of phases.  
---
Fury wears a lot of leather, mail, and plate. Most plate will be geared towards tanking, that why you have to wear leather/mail.
---
Version numbers go 1.8, 1.9, 1.10, 1.11
---
2.0 is TBC
---
3.0 is WotlK
---
ETC
---
to be fair you can just skip over most of them and buy the highest rank ones at 60. Demon abilities dont require a prequisite ranking ability.
---
Ok I'll take a look at that as soon as I can.
---
It would be so cool if it did and there were combo interactions.
---
I mean, I literally gave two examples in my comment, mouseover and downrank modifiers.
---
Say for priest, using a mouseover help macro for pw:s, it is a single key press while hovering over the player or unitframe to bubble them without having to switch targets.
---
Or saving mana by using a less powerful rank of a heal when your highest rank would result in a large overheal on the target.  You macro in a shift, ctrl, alt modifiers to cast 1-2-3 ranks lower of the same spell, from the same single keybind slot, toss in a mouseover on that as well and you don‚Äôt even have to pre-target the player that needs the heals.  There‚Äôs plenty of other examples and uses all intended to make you a more efficient healer.
---
It is slightly slower then most classes, and slightly harder than druid/hunter sure, but not as bad as people make it out to be.
---
you have to not be grouped for this to work. the low level tags the mob, then the high level kills it.
---
Health funnel certainly has its places, and this can be one of them. I think overall though it‚Äôs just considered a waste of gold at a time when gold is scarce and there are other, more usable spells to buy. But you do what works for you..that‚Äôs all that matters!
---
Awesome! thanks so much for the response! So cloth and questing at 60 looks to be the way I should go then? Also, what cloth should I be trying to save up?
---
Oh you sweet summer child....check the building on the right of the warlock trainers in ironforge to blow your own mind
---
Xloot
---
That's how you get added to my ignore list.
---
and bears.
---
Eh I just think you shouldn‚Äôt accuse someone of not knowing what they‚Äôre talking about because of their age, when you yourself don‚Äôt remember or know what you‚Äôre talking about. Being a healer you might not have noticed, and being wrong isn‚Äôt in itself a big deal, just don‚Äôt assume someone wouldn‚Äôt know cuz they‚Äôre younger than you. üëçüèª
---
I'll throw in that you can also adjust the scale of the font (it will also adjust the scale of the floating XP text you get when you complete a quest/kill a mob) by adjust a CVar (console variable.) The variable is WorldTextScale, default is 1.0. You can set it by using "/console WorldTextScale x" where x is the decimal value you want.
---
Run your Zuggin' ass back.
---
10 second res, 10 second drink, it all evens out. Plus respawns if there are any.
---
Yep same deal here, pretty annoying bug
---
With that logic, you have to set a gold amount that is worth everybody needing on... A BoP can still vendor for some gold, why wouldn't everybody need on that and vendor it for the gold amount? You run dungeons to upgrade your gear, and if it is a direct upgrade at the time, BoP or BoE, that person gets the item. The reasoning you are using is just an attempt to justify a greedy play style.
---
Get out of here with this crap...
---
And then there is a CD for it which you're free game like anyone else.  I played Undead Warlock originally on retail back in the day lol.
---
I love when mobs disarm me in bear form. I hear the sound, see the debuff, and laugh as I continue to maul them with my bear paws unaffected since I didn't have a weapon in the first place.
---
Def no then. Need is for stuff that improves your gear. Everyone needs gold.
---

Could also be Fortis, the Belgian bank (owned by the French BNP Paribas)
---
Yep, all of these tropes are getting old
---
Right now, nothing my level range is appearing in Darnassus. What should I do?
---
My warrior alt is around level 20 and the first 20 levels have been miserable. I know it gets better as I've leveled on before, but I forgot just how bad it is early on.
---
You can tell from a safe distance on any class.
---
Keanu is the Chuck Norris of 2019
---
I'll say very right. I'm also around that level and /played. You're not especially smelling the roses, but not breaking yourself over to level up.
---
I love mages, btw.  Always have, always will.
---
Thanks for all the water, bread, and portals you guys give us.
---
What is up board 8
---
tbh with a 15 year old game that has been theorycrafted to hell, I think it's hard for a sub like this to have any better content.
---
I can do rend and Jed runs at 59 in a 5 man so as long as ppl know what the fuck to do it's not hard.
---
Rend is pretty much a roll of the dice if he resists and parries everything I do though.
---
Who are you
---
Hey guys these guys leveled too fast and I am going to threaten to punish them by not tanking.
---
Lol imagine being this delusional.
---
&gt;Morckie#2962
---
I Have        Nuclear, Wiz, Gladiator      on Kirtonos
---
Which ayed against many of those.  Personally as a human warlock currently I haven't had any issues.  You win some, you lose some.
---
gotta play with water at lowest for the true classic feel
---
Can anybody explain the crab memes? I don't understand any of this lol
---
This. I'm by no means an expert and TBH I struggle w good warlocks. If you have a pally have them use the blessing that reduces threat on the Lock. 
---
If not just tell them to run to you if you lose threat. Some of them run away and they make it waaaay to hard on you. You will lose threat. It's just the way it happens.
---
If tanking were easy Mages and Warlocks would do it
---
This I can understand, the Chuck Norris thing I just don't get. Always been a karate guy, there's no real comparison to Chuck.
---
Wtf am I watching?
---
Sounds like healing random pug dungeons.
---
And I think for the most part there usually is understanding. In most of my runs, nobody waits for me to build threat and go all out on mob packs, fully aware that they WILL pull threat one way or another, ultimately getting hit but clearing the whole thing in a much more efficient fashion, although perhaps less elegant to some.
---
I found its not until you get slam at 30, then whirlwind at 36, then 31 pt talent at 40 that it really picks up steam ... but until then it's pure torture.
---
What is quicker, life tap or drinking?  Why are we sacrificing DPS when there is absolutely no reason to?
---
The way WLs "effectively manage their health and mana" is by life tapping and getting 1 heal between every pull or two. No other way is more time efficient.
---
Good warlocks will tap the shit out of themselves and be pulling the highest dps possible, and any halfway decent healer will have no issue with it.  The fact that health is literally a resource to WLs means they absolutely will receive more healing than everyone but the tank.
---
Are you just a shit healer butthurt over having a warlock with expectations higher than you can meet?
---
I havent played one but comparing my /played with other hunters i know tells me its not that much faster. Maybe they are really bad.
---
Y'all gonna meet up in a year and someone will fuck the guild leader's girlfriend. Mark my words.
---
A handful to you is 2 or 3 ??? I've raided MC and BWL   I understand more than you know lmao.
---
This info is wrong thick hide is fully multiplicative
---
But Retail slapped a 30 Minute cooldown on my 10 minute Get Naked toy :(
---
Its 60 mp5, maybe not insane for 5 pieces, but its pretty damn good. And then its 24% increased healing for 3 more pieces which is kind of insane
---
If you don‚Äôt let you 16 year old play a game for 3 hours a night then you‚Äôre just kind of a dick
---
What? I still need to do the same amount of work to raid and have a character at a raiding level. I don't want to have weeks played on a character just to have to re-roll and start from 1 to be able to actually find a guild
---
Never too early to start acquiring the mats. It ain't cheap
---
Noob
---
Arent you a cheerful bugger.
---
Did everybody roll need on the Krol Blade?
---
Ninja looting is not banable/reportable. 
---
Breaking verbal contracts between two parties is. 
---
If I say ‚ÄúWill you port me to org for 1g?‚Äù And you say ‚ÄúYes I will port you for 1g‚Äù and then you end up taking my gold and saying hahaha sucker, then yes that is an example of a reportable/banable offense.
---
Getting into a pub group and everyone just greed rolling by default or say the raid has ffa loot enabled and you take the item/roll need. That is not banable/reportable and they will tell you tough luck.
---
Its all in the verbal contracts. If you just assume everyone is gonna hit greed without an agreement than you are Shit out of luck.
---
@Geedeepee91
---
Agreed. The only groups I'll post in City for are Stockades, RFC, and maybe Deadmines if Westfall is somehow depopulated. 
---
For everything else, I use LFG global channel, not Global Trade, since people are trying sell stuff there. Don't fuck up their trade channel with LFG requests like some filthy barbarian. Bad enough with folk spamming it with what could have been a private conversations.
---
Thanks to OP for pointing out this Add-on isn't getting shat on by Blizz. now. I'll check it out and if I don't like it, I'll uninstall instead being a gatekeeping dickbag, cheers.

Rogue
---
Yeah I enjoy the nostalgia ride wiith classic, but I do want to see Blizzard doing something new with this amazing foundation of a MMORPG
---
BoPs do not have the same equal value to everyone by any remote margin. It's disingenuous to try and treat them as the same thing as a BoE. BoPs can only be obtained by grinding specific content for them whereas a BoE can be obtained by doing any of the countless ways of grinding gold.
---
You run dungeons for a chance at specific gear. You don't run BRD hoping for a Myrmidon Ring for example. BoEs have no relation to your intended purpose and are a lottery item that have a hard defined value equal to their gold income.
---
Go arms 2H and u will be fighting 2 mobs at a time your level with sweeping strikes.
---
There is a curve for using a VW. Up to about mid 30‚Äôs he easily holds aggro. And I can tell you from multiple experiences that, when I get jumped from behind by allies, having a shield to block damage and interrupts has made all the difference in me winning a PvP battle.
---
Sure the succ does more damage, but with the time (and frustration) I‚Äôve saved corpse running, I‚Äôll take the blueberry every time.
---
But that‚Äôs my playstyle. No one should bow to a meta that others think exists if it doesn‚Äôt fit their spec or playstyle.
---
Because the chance of WF proccing off of itself (at 20%) are 4%. To proc 3 times, that's 0.8% chance. 4 times is a 0.16%. 5 is 0.032%. 6 is 0.0064%. You can see how it continues from there. Wimdfury is a random proc, and the most damage it did was to frustrate players on the receiving end of a combo-proc. It would really suck to be a prot warrior and get one shot by a triple proc, but the chances of it happening were less than one in a hundred. Reckoning was exploitable because it was predictable. A patient pally could sit there building stacks and one shot raid bosses. Sure it required a *lot* of time and effort, but it allowed raid mechanics to be soloed.
---
The story would be better if you were horde.
---
/flus
---
;)
---
5 SM/Ruin spec'd Shadowbolts all aimed at the same target and cast at the same time seems pretty devastating.
---
Combined with dots and free mounts this seems like a way to farm gold. solo instances, and cheese pvp.
---
This is why people should stop swapping layers.
---
It's slow questing unless you have a pocket healer.
---
It's fast in dungeons.
---
Is there an addon that shows vendors and merchants on the map?
---
You can also just bind stop cast to a certain key in the keybinds menu. I‚Äôve put it on S since I never backpaddle anyways
---
Lots of people lfg in trade chat. 
---
I see it every night when pugs are looking for more people for MC or Onyxia. Face it the addon doesnt belong in classic wow. Please keep that trash in retail. 
---
Blizzard wouldn't have made a statement on this addon If they didnt think it effected classic wow in a negative way it's that simple. End of story. The addon doesnt belong in classic.
---
Projection is a funny thing
---
I havent even bought slam.
---
I think its hard to compare without knowing what that /played includes.  Some folks stop to level profs, some take more time to find groups for dungeons and such, some zones are way more efficient than others, etc.  All things being equal, Hunter should blow Warrior out of the water in terms of questing speed.
---
Not just twice. Three times, even.
---
Heh, I do feel sorry for the dps warriors I meet in dungeons I‚Äôm tanking while I‚Äôm levelling. There‚Äôs no chance I‚Äôm letting them group with me in the 60 dungeons and steal my DPS offspec gear!
---
And my VW can absolutely hold aggro for at least half the fight. I send him, DoT up the mob, wand wand wand, then at this point he might lose aggro, at which point I start draining soul and he's dead before he gets to me. The VW serves his purpose. Obviously he can't hold aggro if you're spamming destro spells at the mob.
---
Add-on what's training is nice. Tells you whats available, what's coming soon, and what you've trained already. Shows the training cost too
---
Really? Why?
---
I make it haaiilll
---
Uovote for the comparatively high effort meme compared to lots of the dross you see flying about. Bravo sir.
---
(high value = anything linked to Jurassic Park)
---
Layer hoppers (and PvP players in general) deserve the deaths.
---
The old guy needs way more features to make him look old
---
I feel this way about the hundreds of annoying sad saps that want to tell us all how they are losing interest in the game at lvl 40 or the I‚Äôm an altoholic.
---
Awe, I was hoping to drop some knowledge but someone always beats me to it :S
---
Irony from the racist projecting racism into a video game.
---
This made me laugh really hard, so thank for that.
---
In vanilla I had broken tooth that I renamed to OPP
---
Hopefully someone gets it...
---
Need is in reference to do you need to actually use it in game. Everyone needs gold. If you need something you don't actual use you'll earn a name for yourself and possibly a ban from blizzard.
---
As a druid tank, I probably need to shift out and back into bear before the next pull if I'm out of rage... and if I'm already out, the 2 seconds it takes to his a few people with renew isn't a problem as long as I have the mana to shift back into bear. 
---
And now that I'm over lvl 40 I sometimes shift out to pop an innervate on the priest before the next pull. Costs me almost nothing, and they'll have all the mana they need soon enough.
---
Doctors hate this man!
---
I don‚Äôt get it, do some DPS run past the group and attack random mobs?
---
I always stay with the tank and focus down what everyone else is or switch to the next target if that ones almost dead.
---
What you said made sense to me.  It's just I'm definitely not new, I inspected a shammy in org last night and that's when it all clicked for me lol
---
Realistically it didn't slow my leveling at all, but there were some nice 1h axes I passed up on because I just assumed I couldn't use them.  Granted I didnt do very much leveling with a 1h/shield, mainly used my 2h.
---
Refer to my original comment.
---
For what it's worth I agree with you. 
---
A BoE being worth more gold shouldn't mean someone who actually needs it misses out.
---
Old School RuneScape meme leaking into other gaming subs is the basics of it. It‚Äôs like a protest or sort of outrage meme. 
---
I find it hilarious every time I see it outside of OSRS.
---
Was after Patch 1.7, guess 1.12 or rather the current 1.13 no longer show overcapped XP.
---
I haven't levelled warrior in this version but a warrior was my first 60 in true Vanilla. So going from real noob to learning my class as I went along I never remembered it being as hard as everyone makes it oit to be. And really...who cares if it is slower levelling wise. I remember at around 40+ killing 2 mobs 2 levels higher then me at the same time as a common occurrence. Getting three was tough and a mob 3 lvls higher is death. Just need to know how to pull away and keep good eyes aroumd you.
---
In the screenshot, Sonos rolled greed.
---
I thought it would be some good memories and nostalgia before I'd leave after a bit.....boy was I wrong I have been reconsumed and making new memories with my friends, making new friends and having a blast just like in 2006.
---
This game has completely consumed me again
---
Don't know if I'd agree, I'd expect people to give me at least one melee swing before they go in, and they can use that second to look haha.
---
what? ofc its cheating! you can solo all content up to raids. It becomes a single player game at that point, why not just play retail then?
---
just sit around and sell ports...unless your server is dead, then RIP. you can pair this with crafting food for people, small peanuts, but some will buy it
---
not uncommon to make 5-10g per hour in tips...id much rather do that than grind mobs
---
I'm sure you have grouped with some dreaful level 60s - I understand and agree with your analysis and have never tried to refute it.
---
Where did I say that casual players are noobs though?
---
I thought i am stupid for like 30 sec
---
Cool it has the logic built-in, to parse text well enough to do what it does. Stoked to check it out when I get a chance.
---
Right with you. Over 75% and I‚Äôm at least satisfied but yeah I hate started a pull with people not topped off too.
---
Tauren hunter is fine choice, infact i played this combo as my main some 13 years ago, you have 5% more hp and that sweet aoe stun when you desperately need a second to make a break for range or survive.
---
wait till they learn about training pets...
---
I‚Äôm jealous man.  Congrats.
---
Lol I just think you‚Äôre a player similar to my high school girl friends dad who sucked at the game, was in a crap guild on a crap server and never did anything worth time. Remember him being blown away that I raided at the level I did. And it‚Äôs all subjective. I spent Friday‚Äôs and Saturday‚Äôs with friends. Who raids those days? Trust me buddy just cuz you sucked doesn‚Äôt mean because I was 16 that I did.
---
Totally different circumstances.
---
Ya as an undead lock I even have cannibalize to help every pull or two. I hate when I start eating a corpse and I get a full heal from the healer because it's just a waste of their mana. 
---
Usually you can tell if a healer is gonna be micro managing your health early on and I /w them and tell them to not worry about me unless we pull too many or they're very bored and have plenty of mana
---
It is fun and challenging, but it takes a ton of commitment and patience to iron out the kinks and get things sorted. Questing pisses some people off, but it's essentially the same as a group being in the area. Tagging mobs is less of an issue because we only tag and kill one at a time, but imagine collecting 60 quillboar tusks x 5 characters - you're going to be at it a while. People get jealous of us running dungeons "solo" because they've been in LFG chat for an hour. 
---
And in PVP, people just need to adapt to take a 5box down - any coordinated effort from 3 players could do it. PVPing is like bringing a vehicle mounted cannon to a gunfight - slow to move, can only hit one thing at a time, but will fuck anything up over in that general direction. It's a huge weapon, but it also denies your team about 2-3 other player's worth of adaptability and skill.
---
&gt; which means I waste a lot of mana healing you
---
No, stop it. Your mana is for the tank. If the warlock dies, they did it to themselves. You healing multiple party members means if the tank goes down you're left at the top of the threat list alone with no DPS anywhere near you.
---
Dish out the tough love. Whisper to your tank "I'm not healing the warlock" you *should* get a response of "Good!" and the tank should *not* taunt mobs the warlock pulls.
---
If you end a battle and have 75%+ mana, throw a HOT on the warlock (and their pet if you're doing really well). As the team progresses, if things are going smoothly and your mana is doing well, then you can put more into the warlock, but get conservative with boss fights. Often at 75 to 90% damage, bosses will hit the tank hard and you need to be there with mana ready.
---
Remember: if your DPS rage quits, you can replace them in 30 seconds. Your tank will thank you.
---
Also from last weekend: the warlock pulling by sending their succubus into battle while healer was still drinking. That was a new one.
---
as opposed to what? everybody getting free gear? or blizzard dictating who does and doesnt get gear?
---
As a tank ^ this. The only time you should be abusing the AI is if the healer is LoM and you expect a wipe. Then if you have a frost mage kite the enemies through the blizzard. In absence of a frost mage, go battle stance, hamstring what you can and kite as best you can.
---
I guess I‚Äôd rather just trust the people in my group and try to help them rather than be selfish at the chance at some gold.  Social connections are a major part of this game, it isn‚Äôt just items.  It‚Äôs worked out for me so far, and if someone ninjas something their group tries to give them, that reflects badly on that person, not on me.
---
Sure, gotta get range, concussion has to land, can‚Äôt cheetah into mobs, etc, and need a few vipers. No doubt about it.
---
I soloed my entire way  to 56 and only did dungeons for the quests. (Except i spammed sm armory to get the herod set). Im now specced deep prot to spam endgame dungeons to gear up/level at the same time.
---
Just use succ, does more dps. Void is garbage at holding threat
---
I'm not an elitist because your bad with money management and basic math lol, you made the comment exposing your situation and now your salty someone makes a comment on it lol.
---
Note that quest XP doesn't benefit pet only kills
---
Clique is also very popular!
---
Shaman tanks, with proper gearing, can tank up to and MAYBE including UBRS.
---
Not really, its just as fast or slightly faster than leveling a Rogue if you know what you do
---
If you really can't see similarities between making assumptions about other people playing a class based on experiences with one class to racism, you must be a hunter.
---
What a pretentious pile of crap.

Combined with our cost of living it's a losing prospect.
---
Whatever you choose, get 11 points in arms first (Anger Management).
---
You don't have to be greedy about it though. Allowing the person in the instance to get upgrades will speed up the instance. You don't need the gold THAT bad. Don't be that person.
---
Try 4 hours, everything the same.

Tank üíñ U.

Revenge and sunder are your big threat generators.  Revenge when able and sunder elsewise.  Battle shout spam on 4+ targets with all party members In rage is actually best aoe threat.  If you‚Äôre in an aoe clear group, charge thunderclap shout then start getting hamstrings on everything.  You aren‚Äôt going to, nor are you meant to, hold threat on an aoe cleave.
---
Yeah I haven't had a queue in a very long time
---
Just got my Kodo as a troll and it is VERY expensive, I'm talking ATLEAST 900g ontop of the 900g you already need. 
---
I went to the tauren starting zone at lvl 60 to quest but each quest only gave 10 rep, at that point it's just faster and cheaper to grind money and buy cloth.
---
It is an insane grind, it takes a lot of time and gold and every person that does this is a little crazy, but it's worth it in the end.
---
Good luck friend.
---
Have you updated the spells in hour hotbar`?
---
Obviously making fun of one self is a sign of strength, I do it everyday. To do it randomly and no context
---
You still haven't grabbed your mail. Damn that's some old ass mail.
---
What's a free action potions or trinket lol, or fake casting a hearthstone as a Tauren?
---
"Ah, so you're the father of the Shaman who's gonna get F'd in the A on Saturdayyy~"
---
So how does that work exactly? Do all the characters just make the same moves? Is there some interface that manages group control?
---
A timeless classic.
---
Face it, Blizzard disagreed with you because it's still here.
---
You're actually a moron.
---
That second paragraph is bs. As soon as i got sweeping strikes i ALWAYS fought 2 mobs at a time with no problems. Like i said if you spec something besides arms you are making the experience bad for yourself.
---
My main reason for not grinding higher level mobs yet it still happens even if I'm attacking something green level

Ideally, you'd use different pets for pvp and pve because you don't want the same stuff trained on them. For instance, if you're using a wolf for PvE then you likely want it set up with fire resistance (at least until after BWL), stamina, growl, bite, furious howl, and dash. In PvP, though, it's generally better to get a fast attack speed cat trained for frost resistance, maybe shadow and/or arcane resistance, bite, claw, dash, and maybe prowl. You want your pvp pet to have a decent chance to resist frost mage freezes, polymorphs, and priest/warlock fear effects, and you want a focus dump that lets them get off a lot of melee hits against a caster to delay their initial casts as much as possible.
---
Fun item, I've been stockpiling them whenever I see them up on the AH since they usually only sell for 2-3g on my server. They should be in high demand for level 30 bracket twinks once BGs release. And I'll have tons of them to drip-feed back into the market.
---
I was in the top guild on Kil'Jaeden.  I was the top shaman there for most of MC until I switched to mage for BWL.  I was the third 60 on the server with my Shaman.  I played.. ALOT.  I also didn't have shit going on except being a bartender.
---
I know what end game was like, I saw the long raid nights.  I also saw what it does to people, and that is not something I will let my child be a part of.
---
Oh didn't see it! Thanks :)
---
Arthas has the best plan for the Ice caps: Path of Frost Death Knights. They walk all over that water, the water freezes. New Icecaps.
---
How's elemental been?
---
oh no. ive been defeated
---
Well said.
---
&gt;I personally think that everyone rolling need on Rare/Epic BoEs is the best policy at lower levels
---
at this time and for i would guess a month more i would disagree on the rares pretty much the entire leveling experiance they sell for pennies right now better to left a person who needs it need it.
---
but you get a proper good epic everybody should need. same with rares later as people start leveling alts the gold is simply too good for the general rule not to be need on rares/epics.
---
just that right now the money isn't there and space is at a premium so you won't be able to keep it until the value is that high so let the guy have it.
---
Funnily enough, we‚Äôre told no one cares and should move on, while people STILL hold ‚Äúhuntard‚Äù over the heads of hunters 15 years later.
---
It sucks that the best version of Rockbiter weapon was in Cata, after all the tanking talent options were gone. 
---
I would kill for the Cata rockbiter in Vanilla.
---
it is just the culture here man you gotta get over it. Why is barrens chat so toxic? Thata just the way it is bud.
---
I've been making the mooncloth and selling it. Even if I don't grind the felcloth, I can buy it for less than 2g each on my server, and the mooncloth sells for 20g.
---
If that gets you finding out about ScreenCaptor is gonna blow your mind, son.
---
I feel a similar rage when things parry my Riposte..
---
I think it's entirely normal to think that 5 players vs. 5 players should be an even matchup (disregarding player skill, of course) regardless of how much money any of those players have blown on the game. The fact that that's not the case, to me, is a flaw in how Blizzard manages their game.
---
Consider the fact that, in your own words, the only way to make this fight "apples to apples" is if the non-multibox side manages to bring 30 individual players to the table. How is that fair?
---
PUG raids take anyone. Hardly an argument.
---
I tank as a pally. So far I've had a pretty good experience in classic but I get why no one wants to tank. First tank specs level to slow, second if you are perfect tank spec people talk shit, and three in retail DPSers treated tanks like crap.
---
IIRC voidwalker sucks in general, succubus is overall the best
---
Blame pc culture and their garbage ideology.
---
"Give us strong, gay women characters! We want representation!" /s
---
Number of groups that turn up their noses at prot pallys and bear druids is too damn high.
---
When the only tank anyone will accept is a prot warrior, there's just not enough to go around.
---
Now, as a prot pally I do alright, but I usually have to do quite a bit of convincing.
---
Because dumb fuck retail tards don't realize Ironforge is best girl.
---
Lol shut up loser
---
Imagine being so bad you‚Äôre fighting people that don‚Äôt have a cast bar add on
---
It depends on play style. If you don't want to ever sit and drink or spend money on drink, use void. If you get him to pull one mob, you can then alternate life drain and life tap for full hp and mana. Then you can go back to your usual DPS rotation on the next few mobs and repeat. I get it though, succubus kills much faster, she is awesome but I life to use VW because it allows me to not ever buy drinks.
---
I've done no maths but drinking could take a lot of your time too.
---
Considering it works exactly the same in places like deserts and volcanoes where there wouldn't be much moisture in the air, that doesn't seem likely.
---
I've been getting into to podcasts. Pod save america is pretty good.
---
Typically i just tell need to avoid problems...i used to think like you and try to convince people for greed but just not worth it, and if someone actually needs then if i win the roll vs someone else who would hit need to keep it, i can always give it to that person instead of losing it to a selfish player.
---
Everyone needs 1k gold THAT bad for the epic mount, you just gotta see them like a bag of gold, and if a bag of gold dropped, what would you roll?
---
Its about boe vs bop are you dumb ?NO ONE is needing bop items for vendor.
---
Were talking about needing on epics or blues that sell for hundreds of gold on the ah. It's too easy to let a ninja steal these items if you do need vs greed. Everyone is protected by needing.
---
I mostly agree with you. I do think that content updates get a little sketchy though, if they raise level cap or ilevel too much that will inevitably lead to trouble.
---
Pretty sure the people being nice are not doing it after they show they are entitled shits.
---
Yep don't listen to anyone :)
---
You might have your minimap set to not show low level quests. Although I thought that was a later addition to wow.
---
How do you think people kite bosses into cities
---
Level 60 still has gold sinks of repair cost, water, and respec.  But otherwise yeah, any gold spent at 60 is still 'in the economy' as it is paid to other players.  
---
there's also the AH cut which is a constant 5% or 10% off of anything sold on AH, or whatever it is.
---
Excuse me..hi. Mages are a class.
---
We have someone like that here in Minneapolis. Really cool guy, no legs, loves getting stepped on. When you find your passion, I suppose...
---
Eh, wouldn't blame that stuff, just the hugbox coddling shit they do so players can't mess with other players
---
Avid multiboxer here.  There are two reasons to box: PVE and PVP.  This is clearly a PVP boxer.  Multiboxing all of one class is orders of magnitude easier than multiboxing a ‚Äútrinity‚Äù comp or other varied compositions.  However, the only thing that these comps do well is troll people in PVP.  They are hot garbage in PVE (in Classic).  These comps are generally run by the people who suck at boxing.
---
I‚Äôm very adamant that multiboxing should be restricted to PVE realms as a result.  It‚Äôs a massive advantage in world PVP‚Äîan almost de facto 1vX scenario.
---
However, multiboxing PVE is more than fine.  It takes pretty immense skill to pull off your own five mans.  I was a Mythic raider in Live until Classic launched, and it takes more coordination to multibox Classic effectively than raid Mythic (in PVE).
---
Again, this guy is just a PVP troll.  Feel free to flame him.  When you see a guy running a tank, healer, and three DPS, know that you are actively witnessing a pure glutton for punishment roll by.
---
Put that shit on your resume. IT would legit hire you
---
Could you elaborate?
---
I was thinking of doing something similar for gloves on which I have the riding enchantment. I want to equip them when I mount, unequip when I dismount, all on the same macro.
---
Would that be possible?
---
._. 
---
I escape a lot as Rogue and uhh...So am I supposed to let myself die so I can run back with everyone or should I stealth and walk back so I can help with any patrols? I usually do the latter to help them get back to the point we died at if patrols respawn.
---
In around thirty years!
---
I thought the rep gain was the same regardless of level.
---
Ive noticed dark pact combat bug. My healer friend notices it more often than I do, if I dark pact at the end of a pull, he can't drink for a few seconds after my last dark pact.
---
That stupid belt from BRD Arena. I got the ring from the very first Arena I ran, then ran it at least 50 more times and still haven't gotten that belt. In fact, I'm not sure if I got the Ogre Boss 5 times in 50 runs.
---
There‚Äôs a difference between his comic buddies who have YouTube channels as well as their other things and people exclusively known for YouTube like Mrbeast, NELK, Elle Mills.
---
I respect that. Generally I ask the group what we will do if the situation arises and go with whatever the majority thinks. But I'm still gonna wait until last to roll if possible just in case haha
---
Everything you do in WoW is for gear. That's the whole basis of the game. Dungeons aren't any different in that aspect. 
---
Why is it right to force someone to grind for their Myrm ring instead of selling the extremely rare drop that everyone worked for? As stated before, you can use a Warden's Staff just as much as a Druid can. That is the difference in BoEs and BoPs.
---

---
I hate questing but Ungoro is single handedly the best questing zone in Vanilla by a LARGE margin.
---
I always used to try to put it off so that it got me as close to 60 as possible, because I would always be grinding moonkin in Winterspring for the rest of my levels.
---
"Can you hearth to Gadgetzan?"
---
No? If you're DPS, goodbye.
---
Tanks and Healers can get away with this shit, but they still shouldn't do it.
---
ohhh good point good point.
---
However, even the most popular fish bot, which doesn't even use any type of memory reading/injection, is now detected. So, it at least seems that Blizzard somewhat cares about even fish botting.
---
Is there an addon that alert me that Overpower is ready to use?
---
why did you get 5hp more for lvl 60?
---
Let it slide out then repeat.
---
whoever invented using the term toxic in gaming I'd really like to punch in the face. every kid uses it nonstop now.
---
I use a scroll wheel when I'm on reddit browsing through the comments, but in the skill tree, it's often faster to click the bar and scroll down. Though, I just minimize the tree and don't use scroll at all. But there isn't anything wrong with clicking a scroll bar because it is superior in some circumstances.
---
Fetish? Lol
---
What the fuck? Who is talking about same sex marriage? However i can also apply it similarly but not exact. If you wanna hard core raid/be apart of a homosexual relationship THATS GREAT! 100% ok and thats what you want to do. But for me id rather take it slow and also have my heterosexual relationship. 
---
There is no "Correct" way to play this game, its just based on someones personal definition of correct.
---
Hard core raiders will hard grind the game and raid all day every day, for them this is correct 
---
Some like to log in and rp and make little to no progress, for them this is correct.
---
And for me the fun and adventures i make with my friends as im playing the game slowly, is correct.
---
Only thing that isnt correct is crying about how someone is playing the game "incorrectly".
---
Traitor
---
Yea you just sound like a piece of shit
---
Evaluate your personality
---
I LOVE tanking. Probably my favorite activity in the game. I love leading. I love the responsibility. I love taking the big hits and having this giant boss right in my face failing to take me down (assuming our healer is half decent).
---
I really don't know why so many warriors refuse to do it or even learn how to do it. For me, tanking is the single best reason to play warriors. Myself, I'm a druid bear tank and having a blast.
---
I come across a couple playing a night elf priest and a night elf warrior quite often, but the warrior is male so it's not you :(.
---
Hardcore for most people is different than hardcore for reddit.
---
That's exactly what I do, I don't click and ability, not really sute hoe its related to this thread tbh.
---
Man, you really dig the faction rivalry, huh?
---
Stay in Arms for a long time. I've tanked my own dungeons 95% of the time through level 51 and haven't dropped a point into protection.
---
You're extremely more effective solo and duo and will be plenty tanky whilemdealing out more damage. Protection is a tree that you only really need in the end game content.
---
&gt;shield slam has no modifiers
---
I thought shield slam scaled with block value.
---
&gt; haha if there's some min-max strat that says don't train health funnel, that's cool.
---
Do yourself a favor.  Skip those.  Play the game that you want that brings you the most joy, after all, it's your time and your money.  You're not playing it your way when you do that, you're playing it someone else's way, which is about the same as watching youtube videos and repeating what you see.  That's not a game, that's an action.
---
Guess I'm a doofus that missed the rock... Oh well, not like that'll be my last time to run BRD anyways.
---
Too bad her character name wasn't Gretathunberg
---
I love it as a Pally tank. Full T6 and killing it. Pull until the healer says stop. We used to see how much i could handle in there.
---
I think its cause Cleave replaces your auto attack where as WW dosnt
---
I need everyone on my server to see this. As a tank, it‚Äôs infuriating when I pull a pack and the dps engages within 0.01 seconds. JUST GIVE ME LITERALLY 2 SECONDS, I need to build aggro on the group. Then the mage pulls aggro and starts running a marathon and I have to try to catch up with them to pull the mob off, then the mob that everyone else is focusing loses aggro on me and starts going after someone else, then it‚Äôs a clusterfuck, then the entire instance catches on fire and burns down.
---
&gt;If I was a hunter, and a 300g BoE bow dropped, I equipping that bastard right now
---
Which means you saved 300g from having to buy it. How is that any different from any other player gaining 300g? The opportunity cost for all players is the same.
---
That's a great idea man! Maybe make a list of tags as this will make it easier to search on! 
---
A bot for the most reputable traders would be awesome.
---
It's kinda cool. It's timed to 'We Will Rock You"
---
Are you me?
---
Seriously though, I got through STV in a snap because I have been waking up at 6AM and playing for a few hours. There‚Äôs no competition for hardly anything, mining nodes are up, hardy any worry over pvp. 
---
Sip coffe, grind. I wish all my hours were these morning hours.
---
So to clarify you had no life and are questioning what a 16 year old was doing spending all their time playing wow? Although again I never said I was the best player just that I played and I knew for sure damage meters existed. You come off really salty for being wrong and having to question my choices as a teen or even my parents choices. I raided 3 nights a week for 3-4 hours a night. Didn‚Äôt have to play non stop to be hardcore. Even when I was in SWP in TBC I raided 4 nights a week and non of the days were Friday and Saturday.  But keep waving your internet dick around without proof you ever played. It‚Äôs easy to say you‚Äôre the top anything online.
---
The healing doesn't produce threat it classic, that's a private server thing
---
Yeah, I've had a few ranged classes decide to try to pull for me because they have ranged attacks.
---
My favorite though is when there are 3 melee DPS and they have a silent agreement to never attack the same target. That's super fun when I have to spend all my rage and my taunt cooldowns to try to keep 3 mobs on me so the healer isn't wasting mana healing the whole group. It's also a lot of fun finishing every single pull with no rage pooled for the next encounter because the DPS is seemingly dead set on attacking whenever it is that I'm not.
---
Y'all're gonna hate me but Thunderfury because it looks cool
---
Solid video thanks for sharing 
---
The way he throws out numbers when he‚Äôs talking kind of reminds me of [this](https://youtu.be/WFoC3TR5rzI)
---
Dude I love you, I did this with leatherworking by hand just for the top leather w/ hide and leather w/o hide vendor items while I level and I think you just saved me hours of math on other professions. Sadly Blacksmithing was my next task and you didn't get to that one yet. but awesome work!
---
Do you not get a Renew option when you talk to him?
---
Same thing I do. If you put your VW on a mob, only use DoTs, wand, and drain health, you usually won't pull aggro. And if you do, the mob will be so close to death that it'll probably only get in a shot or two on you before you finish him off. Saves tons of money on food and water, and tons of downtime on eating and drinking. Is it the most efficient way to play? Have I tracked the XP per hour and compared it to using a succubus and eating/drinking between pulls? No. But it works just fine for me.
---
It definitely doesn't help that, using the default UI, HoTs aren't super noticeable. Back in the vanilla/BC days I had an addon that played a more noticeable tone when a HoT was cast on my lock, which really helped. I mained a lock and healers (pally and shamy) through vanilla and BC, so I've been on both sides.
---
I still don't get the hard-on for censoring names.
---
Remember to have an addon like ItemRack so you can easily switch between both.
---
I would recommend a list like this under Tank Quest Items as a starter

As a mage I see how many people have mana pools, and I make about 50 water per person and give them before going into the instance to everyone who needs it, I also ask at the end of the dungeon if people would like more water :) people really appreciate it and I hope that all mages do this as well, not sure if they do but it costs you nothing and it helps others out!
---
Because it's literally more difficult to take a pic with your phone and then post it vs. just taking a SS and posting it; and it'll be lower quality. So there's absolutely zero reason to take a screenshot with your phone...

The sex part you added wasn't obvious nor implied in my understanding of what was here.  
---
Revealing romantic (love) interest can hurt a friendship; this has nothing to do with sex.
---
What did you grind?
---
It's so strange though.  If you like feet, just look up pics of feet.  I just can't imagine how laying on the ground and having people walk over you could be sensual.  
---
Besides, when I was 15 I tried to wank it to the new Sylvanas and Alexstraza models in WotLK.  I couldn't even do it then and the models didn't get any sexier.

Blizzard wants to know your location

I was not a classic player, but am experienced with other MMOs. I feel like I missed the boat on WoW and want to experience what I missed.

I started roughly two weeks ago and am in the high 20s.  I'd like to be part of a team and help work towards a common goal as a guild.

I noticed the phase shift thing the other day for the first time and it was quite annoying. I had to resummon like two or three times and I think what made it work was summoning while not in combat or something. Was very annoying.

Coming from you I take that as a compliment.

Majority of your damage output as a rogue is from weapon auto attacks (white damage). Go with Mirah‚Äôs for offhand, it‚Äôs BiS for offhand sword spec until you can get Brutality Blade from MC
---
For what it‚Äôs worth, I completely agree with your points. It makes way more sense for everyone to need something that‚Äôs just crazy money.

Then you don't know anything about lv 19 pvp rare drops.

As for reasoning. I cannot really supply unbiased reasoning
---
Argo is part of the game and it changes as you get a higher level, also part of the game. Should he not use his higher level gear as well?    Shit, it‚Äôs not a level playing field and will never be
---
IDK, man, I literally just don't agree with you and I'm honestly not certain why you're this determined to challenge my (nonexistent, jsyk) masculinity.
---
Thank you! Nah it was the Blighted Leggings off Azshir the Sleepless. Definitely perfect for my class
---
Good point. I'll make sure to pass on all the tanking gear while I'm tanking, since I'm spec'd for dps.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt know, because when I was on DOS, printers were too expensive to own. Most of the printing I actually did was at the library, and they‚Äôd let you use Windows 3.11 to print.
---
Unfortunately that does not work either. My wife and I tried it and my exp was still capped like I was in a party.
---
Whats even the use of invis? Is it different from stealth at all? Also the detect invis spells... are those useful for anything other than succubus?
---
Holy is perfectly valid for leveling if you take the smite / holy fie talents. They hit fairly hard and are efficient.
---
If I tell a DPS to stop pulling aggro multiple times, I stop saving them. I‚Äôll let them handle whichever move they pull off of me. Including if I have nothing left to attack. I‚Äôll just stand behind them utterly motionless until they either die or kill the monster. I generally let this continue until they learn their lesson, even if it means they die multiple times to trash
---
I still panic everytime I answer the phone and its the IRS. Even though it happens all the time. Would rather be a healer with a terrible tank.
---
Zandalar Tribe has been good to me. There's less rp than I'd expect but people are generally nice and chill. I've only encountered one toxic player. MC pugs are in full swing but I still see people queuing for low lvl stuff all the time. Never had any problems finding groups as a rogue and non spellcleave character. Faction balance seems to favor horde a fair bit but it's not terrible. It doesn't seem to be terribly swedish either but of course me and my mates are from IKEA so there's  some.
---
Anyway to setup details! Addon so that it will reset the data automatically when joining and leaving a group?
---
I'd probably say Mirahs plus it's a quest reward vs drop so easier to get also
---
I came across a ?? Druid while travelin thru Ferelas as a lvl 30 (got lost on my way somewhere else lol). We had a dance party in the rd when an ally runs up and attacks him and I start going noooooo! Hes cool! The ally /sorry and joined our dance party!
---
Agree here. I usually ask if the group minds if I need, and will equip right away. Hasn't failed me yet!
---
If you are in the party who found the BoE and it is an upgrade for you, then it goes to you. If nobody in the party can use it, then whoever wins the roll can sell it. I'm honestly trying to understand why you wouldn't give it to the person who needs that piece of gear. Not trying to be a dick lol
---
Consider you don‚Äôt know how to scroll, I‚Äôm not surprised this was a phone pic over a screenshot
---
I think I get why sharing an account with your kids isn't against tos now.
---
I just downloaded Buffwatch yesterday for my paladin, it seems to be working out pretty well so far. It's on the twitch client.
---
It's not a point of view to say "this is the convention".
---
Here's my tip for mages.  Once you join a dungeon group, pre-conjure up a ton of water and maybe a bit of food so you're ready to hand it out.  All mana using classes will want water, and making sure they're well hydrated will make the run go much faster because everyone can go all out without fear of running out of drinks.
---
I used to conjure up at least 2, if not 3, full stacks of water for all mana users (even hunters and enhancement shamans love water) when I played a mage as my main back in vanilla.
---
So many times I've come in on my hunter and asked a mage for some water to literally get something like a single stack of 6 water from them.  You're really holding your group back by not handing out copious amounts so they can go all out without fear of running out.
---
These are the type of people who like to claim retail is shit, classic is amazing!
---
He is not referring to Bind on Pickup epics, he's referring to bind on EQUIP epics.  If I'm running with a group of randoms through UBRS and the Edgemaster's gloves drop, which auction for 400-700G, I'm instantly needing. If you don't need on that, you'll get ninja looted.
---
It is the only fair way of handling items that sell for crazy amounts.
---
Same with the mage tailoring chest pattern from LBRS. I don't care if a mage is in the group. All people earned the right to roll on that. The default loot rules are need on expensive auction items.
---
If you disagree with that method, that's fine, but sooner or later you will be ninja'd from, it's just reality.
---
This makes me question the thermodynamics of frost mages.
---
What people aren't telling you is once a quest is grey in vanilla its rep reward is decreased by 90%. So don't go do old darnassus quests. Your only option is Runecloth turn ins at 60. It's just a grind, and seeing as you're a mage it'll be easier than many.
---
What's your question
---
Yeah i'm enhance so t1/2/3 all suck lol..
---
I like how you responded to this reply, but completely ignored the one explaining how you were wrong about standard graphing conventions. 
---
The thing you control the change of is generally the x-axis, which in this case is distance. The thing you measure based off of x values goes on the y-axis.
---
I got mine at like 41. Mind was beyond blown.
---
Also I‚Äôm a Feral Tank main so that made it twice as sweet.
---
If I were that tank, I would prefer that everyone had rolled need. If all 4 of your are going to be nice and give it to me, great! But by rolling greed you increase the odds of it being ninjad. Assume for a second we have a sneaky bad actor in the group:
---
3 benevolent members greed or pass so I can get my shield. 1 ninja needs. I need. I have a 50:50 shot of winning the item.
---
OR 
---
All members need. 3 good actors will give it to me on a win, 1 bad actor wont. I have an 80% chance of getting the item.
---
Only one I've seen I did an underwater quest with (I am male orc lock), naturally did not buff her underwater breath and then she died and said she didn't get that skill. We were in our 30s or 40s... its like a 10s skill lol
---
Its nice to not have to decipher what we're looking at from some blurry, usually tilted, almost always has a glare, too close or too far away picture. It takes an extra, 20 seconds(?) to print screen and upload.
---
&gt; We can split pull + trap.
---
&gt; We can split pull + pet + trap. 
---
As the healer: Fuck off with that crap. I pull when my threat is 130% of the Tank, or, if you've pulled the mobs close to me, 110% of the Tank and now I'm the threat target.
---
Quit getting me killed/forcing me to back off and lose LOS to the tank.
---
Agreed, thank you
---
it's 100% the tank's fault to assume your group understand you're los'ing.
---
different groups use different strats
---
Nonono...you keep the rum and drink it before a big fight for the STA. Plus its fun for your grp to suddenly see that your char is tipsy lol
---
They changed it many years ago but that's not Classic.
---
Loot council is bad, but I haven't seen anyone say that Blizzard should add personal loot.
---
Could you source this nonsense strawman?
---
You guys sound salty asf lmao get a life
---
To trainer - no. I have only "Access to goblin engineering schemata!" or smth like that. I can open and learn goblin recipes without card in my inventory.
---
Alright paint me incorrect then.. I was under the assumption that If the rarespawn loot tables were fully in the game then the non rares would be similar but I believe cause it‚Äôs endgame y‚Äôall are likely more correct than I am
---
Yeh I was being unnecessary snarky, my bad and apologies fellow Redditor. 
---
But I can't help but read the reply post as dismissing someone else's experience of fun because questie exists.  I agree that douchebaggery abounds but I can hardly criticise that in others- as a great man once said - people who live in glass houses should shut the fuck up.
---
Tbh I find the whole difficulty comparison a bit ridiculous.  Neither game is particularly difficult afterall, they just have different game designs.
---
&gt; Be aware when a tank is doing a LoS pull. Once you attack that ranged mob way over there, it‚Äôs going to stay there until either you LoS him or the tank runs all the way over there. Typically if the tank was doing a LoS pull, he was doing it because the mobs will flee into other mobs when they get low or there are patrols around. You mess all that up when you don‚Äôt respect the LoS pull.
---
This is the biggest and most common problem I have when I tank. Even when I explain what I'm doing, I have a hard time getting certain people to let me LOS pull. Which is fine, I just remember who they are and don't group with them again.
---
Roll last and do what everyone else does.  If you don't "need" it and everyone rolls greed on a high priced item, then just greed it to be fair.  If everyone rolls need, then just need it.
---
so when shit hits the fan all mages jump as iceblock into the ocean?
---
Or it's because you guys don't understand math but want to seem smart when you're not.
---
What he did is perfectly fine and makes sense for what he wanted to display. You guys just don't know how to actually read graphs and are freaking out cause it's different than what you're used to. Which is hilarious. It's ok though, this is a learning opportunity. :)
---
I don't have any experience with these add-ons but they may have the functionality you desire, they seem very advanced and complicated. Try looking up Super macro or Gnome Sequencer Enhanced. Will likely take several video guides to learn wtf todo with them. Best of luck
---
But no one is clearing end game content
---
I‚Äôll have to remember this when if off tanking
---
There was a graph like this made for optimizing Zul Aman bear runs back in the day.
---
Dear fellow hunters, paying attention to mob health and a well timed cshot or scatter can save the group from wiping. You wont get any thanks for this and rarely will you get blamed for a fleeing mob pulling but its just good hunter skill. Who cares about being top DPS when you have so much different shit you can do to make things to run smoother.
---
Funny enough, I ran inside the inn and another mage casted another frostbolt on me and killed me, and he did not get attacked by any guards. I forget if I was recording for that, I'll check when I get home. Obviously he can use his higher level gear, and even run between mobs without getting aggro on them to gank me in the wild, I have no problem with that. That's not the same as being inside a town with guards and finding just the right spot to avoid aggro on them, that's exploiting.

One thing i do not deal with though is people trolling eachother in group. I have a mage friend who always manages to get into some snarky argument with other mages if we have a 2nd in group. That i would literally rather sit here crunching numbers and working on spreadsheets then put up with two dudes swinging their dicks at eachother and one leaving and ruining the dungeon.
---
I am currently using Questie but having it Hide Objectives.  This way I still get notified that there may be a quest I forgot to pick up, but I still have to try and figure out the objective/area myself.   So that's an option as well.
---
I tought for a second the bitch second from left holds her legs in the air and shows pussy holy moly..
---
I feel like I see waayy more T wars and druids than hunter or shaman. Like huge diff in population.
---
Human - Warlock
---
Gnome - Mage
---
Dwarf - Warrior
---
Night elf - Hunter
---
Orc - Shaman
---
Troll - Priest
---
Tauren - Druid
---
Undead - Rogue
---
Cuz I was helping a guild member who was getting ganked. And I basically asked in general chat if anyone was getting ganked while trying to quest. So I was trying to help people in need
---
If that fails we kidnap Princess Bubblegum and force Ice King to drop giant ice cubes into the ocean until climate change is over.
---
I'm not at all surprised lol
---
Joke's on you. I'm already in IT.
---
That is really funny though hahaha guess you never get used to talking to the most powerful collection agency on earth.
---
&gt; while levelling you could be waiting for 15-20 levels
---
no you're waiting 10 levels each and every time.
---
&gt; The nuance here being you are trying to justify not spending
---
no the nuance is just as I pointed it out. There is absolutely no reason in the world to spend money buying water /use the one you bought, when a member of your group can literally create it for free.
---
You probably understood it wrong
---
So you're saying freezing band drops and you pass on 500g just because a mage happens to be in the group with you? That 500g is a devilsaur set and half of a krol blade, a much bigger upgrade than freezing band is.
---
I am working on a version that is set up for 40 man and you can easily swap between them with profiles within Grid2. Give me a couple days.
---
I added Shadow Protection/Prayer of Shadow
---
Innervate is already in there if you're not a druid. I've updated so druids can see it.

Deja does exactly what you describe.

You can also assign multi bindings for each button. For example the d pad on the left of my screen does shift-1, shift-e, shift-5
---
Fandral's Seed Pouch! 
---
Ran Firelands every week for it, got it during Legion. Took forever. This was also ran on Multiple Druids each week . . .
---
They‚Äôre 36-38. I was helping my warrior friend get his mats and he was able to solo the mobs at lvl 36. After you get all of them, though, you have to beat the cyclone an, which is a 40 elite. 
---
Definitely need a group for that, although there are usually a few warriors around there that are willing to help out. We helped a couple alliance warriors get their cyclonians, then they helped us with my friend‚Äôs cyclonian. Your mileage may vary there, though.
---
this. A warrior beats anything and if it doesn't the warrior wasn't angry enough.

Now that you mention this, I have seen this number mentioned on Herod forums when discussing realm balance.

Found the guy who blindly clicks "accept" to the ToS of any software.

Everyone makes fun of the no-lifers here, in a wow classic subreddit....
---
You know one might expect a lot of the no-lifers to be active in a subreddit dedicated to what they are no-lifing at.
---
Its not a far reach to think alot of the no-lifers actively participate in self-deprication, on this subreddit, every day.
---
Also if you could not brag about how strong you are that you make fun of your daily, that would be great. Im pretty insecure about my ability to flaunt my strengths and your stealing my thunder buddy.
---
Meh, I enjoy the posts. People enjoy sharing stuff about the game they love.
---
I guess it's a bad time to tell you I got Rosewine on my first run with no roll competition.   Smolderweb is my bane.  Just give me my mp5 gauntlets
---
Every time I'm having fun doing something, I always make sure to ask strangers online if I'm having fun the correct way or not.
---
It's the best way to ensure that I'm spending quality time
---
You don't have to use a guide to level tailoring.
---
It's also popular because it's for *bags*.

It's not a 20 minute respawn either.  None of the limited patterns respawn that fast.

[Brewmaster trinket]  wat?

No. It is just disgusting. I don't see a second one there to explain the expletive.

And not even well fodeveloped excel lol basic gridded cells with some larger font titles and sections with a few formulas here and there üòÇ some of these spreadsheets are real suspect. Gonna have to up my game too.

I got killed when I was a lowbie and I can't find the person who did it to me, so I'll take it out on this other lowbie.

Don't like it? Don't play pvp

Yeah people have scripts set up that just buy all the limited supply recipes from her when they pop up. On my server it‚Äôs basically always camped 24/7. With stupid prices on the AH.

It's so annoying. All need is not selfish, benefits everyone, is more fair and prevents ninjas. The only reason they have a hard on for need greed on boe is because they have nostalgia for vanilla.
---
You're asking why griefing someone with a 0% chance of consequences for yourself is appealing?
---
Truly a mystery. I'll get our top scientists on the job of solving this conundrum right away.
---
Not a reportable offense lol
---
They probably didn't want him to have to BEAR the burden of keeping their life up.
---
I read the whole post including the title.   I guess your response is evidence enough that you made an assumption and look like an ass.
---
So this would be classism, not racism?
---
I've never played a shaman, but something tells me it's probably 2H axes and maces. If I had to guess one step further, I'd say it's probably in the enhancement tree. Perhaps someone with more knowledge could confirm.
---
Isn't this a default setting? Someone was asking about this the other day in the Daily Questions Megathread as well, but I've always had completely separate bars for each of my three stances. I keep stance specific  buttons on their own bars, such as Overpower/Revenge/Whirlwind all being on the same button.
---
What‚Äôs the macro for that?
---
No feet, loves feet? It does make sense, somehow.
---
With your logic though, why not just allow speedhackers to completely dominate the spawns in a zone? I mean, they could do it with a whole guild if they want, so what's the difference?
---
Clearly there is a line somewhere. We get that you think multiboxing doesn't cross it, but as /u/ptainballboi07 said, it's a bit of a silly comparison to compare multiboxers to a guild of people.
---
lol, they were all mostly frostballing, could have put 6 hunters there and it would have been the same.
---
^ what he says
---
I always used shift+E for pet attack.  E is whatever my spam ability is.  R is usually the 2nd most used ability or finisher.  F is a 3rd most used ability, if you have it.  Q is a situational ability like stun or interrupt.  1 is an opener. 2 is a less used situational ability like taunt or heal.  3 is a even less used situational ability.  
---
Then you have 4, Z, X, and C for even LESS used situational abilities.  I never usually bind V, G, or T.  Middle mouse click is Mark Skull and the side button is the default auto-run.
---
You can rationalize it anyway you want Ninja.
---
Not reportable. He isn't avoiding guards.....
---
Gnomes are girlfriend bait, man---Especially without pandas, blood elves, and worgen around.
---
This is what I did, 13 in ret and the rest in Holy. It's great to have the extra intellect for leveling and dungeons, the extra healing helps you spend less mana while you level, and getting consecration let's me tank dungeons as well. It seems like most dps are a little stupid and don't follow markers, but with all the AoE threat paladins have with consecration/ret aura I hardly ever lose threat in dungeons.
---
Trogg dropped this in the Badlands for me. Still have it in my bank.
---
I think they just fortis was a good idea.
---
one thing i regretted, not having any screenshots from vanilla.... they all went gone with each new pc i bought
---
At higher level almost everything is team play
---
What is the ilevel mod you are using?
---
you dont even need a program. its built into windows. there's a goddamn key on the keyboard JUST to take screenshots.
---
He grinded faction
---
NO! it is not the same thing because it is a literal upgrade for that class and is designed for that class to wear! I flat out don't buy gear on the market. I rely 100% on drops and quests as most of us leveling have to. It is bullshit that you think you should be taking gear that someone in your group can wear. BOP's are also worth gold to a vendor, why then shouldn't everyone need on BOP too? It is exactly the same situation. Just because you are greedy and want everyone else to participate in your mental gymnastics doesn't mean we have to do so. People should be able to wear the gear meant for their class without buying it.
---
Sarcasm isn't going to get you far in life.
---
I was just wondering what I would be missing out by using a questing addon.
---
Yeah, maybe not for paladins, but what about other classes?
---
Wait what, you can farm rep with them which causes them to not attack you anymore? Hell, that's crazy. I'll look into that if that's true
---
This is the daily questions megathread lmao why would I not ask questions? If you notice me that much then youre the one that needs to get out you smelly neckbeard lmfao
---
There is a big difference between someone who is almost 30 playing games on their off time, and some high school kid playing in their off time.  High school is when kids really start learning about social queue's, social interactions, and dating.  High school is getting you ready for real life, and it should be spent doing that.   If you are spending 4 hours per night playing video games 3-4 nights a week in high school you are either neglecting your studies or neglecting your friends.  
---
If you fail to see how a single grown man playing video games vs highschool kid playing video games is different, I don't know how to help you.
---
Yes the client is based on 1.12 but blizz confirmed that loot tables will be reconfigured in phase 5 to mimic the patch 1.10 change. There are a number of items that are unavailable currently and will be released later.
---
14 stam, 5 healing, and 6mp5 Plus fade cd reduction. It‚Äôs worth it for how long you will use it. 
---
You also shouldn‚Äôt be buying all the mats. If you are getting the pattern you already have to be 300 tailor which means you should be making mooncloth irrelevant and just saving it. You‚Äôll be farming demons for demonic runes for raid anyways and they also drop felcloth. If you are farming strat live, you will naturally get the 4 orbs. The pearls are pretty easy to farm too. I got all of them in 1-2 hours killing turtles in hinterlands and opening the giant clams. Only thing you will need to buy are the ghost dye or get an alchemist to make them. Last I checked on my server they are going for 2-3g per on the AH. Runecloth is easily obtained too.
---
So I‚Äôm not sure why you would be spending 200+ gold for the mats. Maybe 20-30g max from ghost dye, if you farm the pattern yourself. It‚Äôs much more of a time investment rather than gold. I guess if you‚Äôre rich you could just buy everything. 
---
If you‚Äôre going for full prebis you‚Äôll also be running a lot of strat live anyways for the ‚Äúof healing‚Äù archivist cloak. So I view it as just a time investment that you‚Äôre gonna be doing anyways and the pattern is a bonus. You make some decent raw gold from strat too with the added benefit of mana pots from the crates. It‚Äôs a good dungeon to farm anyways.
---
Here's my shitty fanart!

Having no issues at 56 as an arms war with the above strat
---
Personally, I twitch when we're waiting because you can get a female dwarf's legs going 180 degrees in the opposite direction of her upper torso repeatedly and it always makes me giggle.
---
That sounds like a pretty toxic cycle. It's not that I don't like PvP, I love my PvP realm. I just have never understood why people kill lowbies.
---
Thank you! It was the Blighted Leggings off Azshir the Sleepless. I figured they were pretty perfect for my build
---
Yep. There was a common trick for mages who knew you were there. Distract -&gt; sap -&gt; restealth -&gt; cheap shot -&gt; gouge.
---
As as soon as they heard the cheap shot they would blink, but because of spell batching they would blink while gouged, so you could catch up and kidney shot immediately.
---
Power. Obviously.
---
Lol, so did a priest in my guild. ‚ÄúOh what‚Äôs this ring? Ohhh this is nice, didn‚Äôt even know it dropped here!‚Äù
---
Ugh
---
None of that tells us that one was a bug and the other a feature.
---
I am going to go insane if another client sends me a picture of a spreadsheet instead of the spreadsheet itself.
---
thanks for the guide i just today looked for a solid guide and then my prayers have been answered
---
To be fair some mobs were removed from UBRS in patch 1.10 to speed up run times and make it easier. Quite a few instances in the upper tier (BRD, Scholo and Strat) all had pulls removed to "Improve the 5 player experience" and "Speed up run times".
---
Everyone's acting like multiboxing is this new thing. I played in BGs against a multiboxer in vanilla (on my server pre-battlegroups) which led me to it this time around. Folks are acting like running up on a full party would be somehow different depending on how many hands are involved. https://www.engadget.com/2006/12/15/interview-with-xzin-the-man-with-ten-arms/
---
I just resummon him.
---
At some point later as well, the voidwalker becomes far less useful at holding aggro to the point that it slows you down. From 40-60 I mostly used the Succubus for the far higher damage or imp for ranged dps and Stam buff instead of VW.  Sure it'll require you to eat and drink more but you'll level much faster overall.
---
I usually stop questing at 55 and just grind and do dungeon runs for BiS gear till 60. Lots of places you can mob grind for decent gold so you can finish off skills or epic mount. 
---
Questing thru 55-60 just leaves you almost under geared and deff too empty pocketed.
---
it's true....... but takes a LONG time of grinding, hes a mage so probably AOE'd the pirates for a day or two
---
Why would he not buy them all? Warlocks get a free mount.
---
because its the darn euros that are posing them
---
Well thats half the battle. We have one inspector from the state who apparently was sneaking around in the woods watching our crew trying to catch them screwing up so he could shut down our site...
---
And faxes are indeed ebola. At least its not all purely snail mail anymore holy crap. Although honestly that would make things so much more relaxed because it would reduce the instant transmission.
---
What's the lowest level enchantment that provides a weapon glow? I saw a guide that said it's Enchant Weapon - Minor Beastslayer, but it looks like that was added in 1.13.
---
The aim of this graph is to show, for a given distance, how long it'd take you to cover it in different scenarios. Hence why time should be in the Y axis (as others have explained in other words, time is the depdendent variable).
---
Otherwise the graph would show, for a given amount of time, how much distance you could cover for each scenario. We want the distance to be common to each scenario, not different, and that's why it should be on the X axis.
---
Dude what? Have you heard of addons?
---
Now you're just making me want to ignore my 49 priest and hop onto my lvl 11 hunter. I want to get back into classic kiting, takes so much more skill with no auto shoot while running.
---
Awesome. Thanks!
---
No problem! If you enjoy taking cool screenshots like this, you're always welcome to join us on r/classicwowscreenshots. It exists for this type of thing.
---
You do realize that even if your 6k would be accurate, originally in Vanilla the servers were a lot smaller sized than that and people managed to play just fine? Sounds like you are making the problem bigger than it is. Are you sure you are as  happy playing classic as you thought beforehand?
---
And here I was, thinking how quiet and assmongler free the sub has been today, then you show up and dump this shit on us.  Fuck off.
---
You have the patience of a saint for dealing with this guy.
---
He‚Äôs learning so much today!
---
Please find a lower resolution picture and then remake this meme
---
I'm sorry, but I just don't see any merit in that argument. You're ignoring the number of actual human players on each side.
---
The fact that it takes a disproportionate number of players to take down a multiboxer means that multiboxers are disproportionately powerful. They didn't acquire that disproportionate power through in-game means (i.e. leveling / gearing up), so why should that path to power be allowed?
---
(Side note: I'm actually 100% cool with people multiboxing on PVE servers. It doesn't really affect anyone's experience negatively there.)
---
 The mage may also be busy killing mobs and is not paying attention to what the int buff is on the priest. If the priest gave a friendly reminder " hey can you into buff please" the mage would have no problem. Bit then it could also be what you suggest.
---
 I always buff when asked or if I notice it while drinking but the rest of the time I'm putting out damage and paying attention to the mobs and what they are doing.
---
But technically speaking most mages dont conjure up elements but transform the energy around them.
---
Mages are basically catalysts and just really good at physics.
---
So casting blizzard just cools down the water thats already in the air and expending energy with that, in many of the books this use of their mental energy or "Mana" or the lay lines all around them fatigues them, makes them tired, hot, sweaty and generally feeling ill.
---
So if they cool down the oceans and air with casting blizzard, but in turn raise their body temperatur and need for rest and calories really offset the climate or would it just shift it in another direction?
---
As far as its explained magic, atleast arcane, nature and shamanistic elemental magic, is a 1 to 1 deal that always balances out, the only exception is fel magic which takes energy from another host, which most likely also needs to get their energy from somewhere.
---
And now i rambled on and forgot what i wanted to say, yeah sorry its late and this thought just wouldnt let me rest :/
---
It will be common when DM comes out and you can just do the chain that gives you faction for all of them. especially since its repeatable
---
wait until a super high level player ganks you and something inside just snaps.
---
Saw hoj drop, hunter needs, I need, we both lose it to a ret paladin.
---
It depends if you're set up to wand down enemies or drain tank. I use succubus for damage and use drain health to tank the enemy, if you're doing a dot and wand strategy a VW is fine
---
And the gold sellers channel invites in game lol
---
I already use modifiers and yeah I know about durations but its cool I krrp an eye on those with weakauras, in addition I wasn't referring to curses but Magical dots plus I will still have them independently bound for refreshment, this is more of an opener.
---
Sounds like this sub with the way people freak on OPs for posting pictures instead of screenshots üíÄüíÄüíÄüíÄ
---
It just seems like such low hanging fruit. It doesn't prove anything and you don't gain anything from it. It just seems bizarre to me.
---
Better than a druid following you around for 2 hours trying to starfire tag every mob out from under you all because you wouldn't accept his random group invite.
---
Seriously this stint of WoW has been filled with nothing but complete dicks start to finish on my own faction.
---
Wish this wasn't my first time rolling Alliance, cause it is reinforcing my bias.
---
‚ÄúNow tell me how rude I am‚Äù rofl
---
As a priest I gotta add, shield away, the tiny amount of rage the warrior/druid loses is nothing to them eating a 30% HP hit instead.
---
You mean Shadow Word: Pain?
---
I've never had someone turn me down as a bear druid.  I'm chalking that up to them being tired of spamming and going, "FINALLY" when I get into the group.
---
It doesn't seem excessive to me at all. It takes no further time or effort to hit one button over the other. It's not more complicated, more difficult, or more convoluted than the alternative. It's total cost is the 3 seconds spent trading the item, for guaranteed drop security. It seems needlessly risky to me to do otherwise.
---
Yeah of course dude. Wait till you have cb prep and you can deleted people. Just watch world of roguecraft..
---
Taunt is expensive.  It's on a long cooldown (10 seconds I think?), so using it on a DPS is risky.  If a DPS, especially at low level, pulls aggro on the focus target and that target is at like 50%...it ain't worth it to taunt.  Save it in case you need it to help the healer out.  DPS can just keep reducing that mob to ash even if they get hit a couple times.
---
BoE and BoP items are different because everyone can use a BoE.
---
If a BoE plate item drops and I'm a shaman who put in equal time for the dungeon, I'm hitting need. I can then take that item and trade it to a warrior for a shaman BoE.
---
Passing it to a party member solely because they can equip it means I've just passed an opportunity to get a best in slot item because.......???
---
Yeah my group just hit 50, and it's been a blast so far.
---
Independent and dependent variable are completely arbitrary here... The only information given is speed and x-intercept (either 0 or 3 seconds depending on whether a mount was cast or not).
---
The convention is to show time on the x-axis when it comes to graphs showing acceleration, velocity, or distance traveled. That way derivatives actually make sense. The derivative of these charts (slope of the line) should show speed (yards/second). Instead the derivative of this graph shows the inverse of speed (seconds/yards). 
---
It's also much more intuitive to read when time is on the x-axis for reasons /u/Minus-Celsius already explained. Bigger slope should be a faster speed not the inverse.
---
All good locks have threat meters. It's way too easy to pull aggro by doting up a group beyond your tank's AoE threat while leveling, and extremely easy to pull aggro off the target even if the tank is concentrating on it. A good lock keeps an eye on their threat and taps/heals up when they're in danger.
---
You can't quest when you're dead.
---
I don't kill lowbies myself, but I can see a small benefit in delaying the progress of the opposing faction.
---
If you can use a wand your melee will most likely do terrible damage, not sure why you'd want to do this.
---
That feeling of stepping down on someones neck while their face is in the dirt. It's a good feeling.
---
I'll be honest. I never want ro gank alliance members BUT... sometimes I wish I could gank my own factions mages that do dumb AoE pulling. I was in a cave and one mage was AoE pulling 4 mobs. He screwed up and couldn't handle it so he bailed. All 4 ended up running back to the room I was in and all aggro'd me. Hunter is easy life so I killed them all by juggling aggro between me and my pet so neither of is died.
---
...... then I realized I didn't get any loot or XP from my hard efforts because he had obviously tagged them all first. I raged harder than any time I had been ganked by any alliance dude.
---
So u agree, self deprication is probably common on this subreddit?
---
It's simple, because they can do it with little to no consequences. 
---
IMO killing lowbies is fine, no judgement from me. It's when someone is camping lowbies that I really start to think, "this is a shitty human being."
---
But in that event, holler out to general, local defense, or your guild. There are many people like me that get a lot of enjoyment punishing bullies. Since they're camping lowbies they are almost always garbage at PvP too so it's pretty low effort.
---
Climate change isn't real ^(/s)
---
You can‚Äôt make out the images that he posted? I can.
---
It‚Äôs faster and easier to just take a picture with your phone and post it through the app.
---
Tanked for a group that didn't mark or focus target,  kept telling me how to tank and the rogue kept pulling. Tried to warn them about a pat, they ignored me and pulled again.  Pat shows up and the hunters pet ends up pulling another group as well. They were all in discord.  Told them best of luck.
---
Yup. Had a random grp in Loch Modan questing and one guy kept needing, he was younger and new and thought that clicking greed had a penality because being greedy is a bad trait lol
---
Cast sequence should be what you want with a timer.  I believe it just resets when the timer hits or if you reach the end of the sequence.  Set it for 3 to 4 seconds and you'll be fine.
---
For mouseover and target use this:
---
/cast [@mouseover]Corruption;[@target,nodead]Corruption
---
Macros use a fall through logic of sorts.  It checks the first valid condition and attempts to use it.  So if you have @target first, it won't attempt to cast on your mouseover.
---
Oh, hell, naw.
---
My heals and bubble is for the tank. If DPS pulled agro, I'mma gonna point and laugh with my boy with the taunt. We'll rez you after the fight is over.
---
Ummm no.  You just can't read
---
Also to this, I've played wow since I was a kid and played every xpac for at least 5 months each. And I am absolutely loving classic. I like that it's a little simpler the pvp almost feels like a moba where it's a bunch of quick counters or outplays bit usually ends in seconds.
---
Consumables are dope because they actually give an incentive to keep up with them.
---
Raids yeah they're easy af now, I remember them getting a little harder but by no means do I think people will struggle that hard.
---
But I have tried to replay games I love like skyrim and league and more I end up playing them for 10 hours tops then quit again for months.
---
Classic has gotten 12 days of play time out of me already and I cant wait to go home and play.
---
The good point you made was the lore. I remember wildstar flopped but NOT because of the story, it wouldve been cool to be more invested in it. However the gameplay was a ton of hard work with 0 reward, they missed the balance. 
---
An mmo COULD recapture that it just requires people to leave wow which they probably wont until they're burnt out at naxx
---
Respawns were 15 minutes apart on her twice last night. I bought two patterns...just sadly not the one I need (bag). She was heavily camped otherwise though. üôÅ
---
Thank you for this garbage post with no context.
---
That is the full chat log.
---
Yeah i lvled a hunter to 54 and i just started lvling a priest alt that i will probably be my main soon from how much fun im having.
---
Positioning. You have to be close to the totem. This is especially true if the shaman does not have the totem increase range talent (most will not when leveling). Totems have a 20 yard range unless talented.
---
That saying is actually attributed to notorious big.   2pac has much better quotes.
---
No I mean, "Rule \#1" for the sub is made for just this reason.  It is the reason cited for deleting posts like yours.
---
This. I never expect heals. In fact my partner is our healer and he ignores me because he knows I don't need it. I'll ask him for a renew if I'm in danger. Dont waste mana on healing the warlock unless it's a difficult encounter or it's all gone to custard and you can spare the mana.
---
Leveling as prot is like eating breakfast with your tennis racket. It probably won‚Äôt help you get better at tennis.
---
Wait, they are? They're not 10s like literally every other weapon type in the game?
---
Never underestimate the amount of time people will spend on things like this. There may be some cheaters, but I'd wager that most of them just have no life.
---
It sells for a decent amount so I could really use it, but I'm too busy using the vex staff from zf.
---
I mean, if it's selling for a really high profit margin and you can just sit there spamming a macro or something (like you mentioned yourself) to try and buy it while watching things on another monitor or anything else, then you can hardly blame them.
---
They could be cheating with autoclickers. Or they could just be sitting there, spamming that macro and watching Netflix between whatever else it is they do in their day when they're not logged on. The best you can do is report them and let Blizzard do the investigating. If Blizzard takes no action, there's nothing more to be done about it; they're either legitimately clicking a macro, or there's not enough evidence of cheating.
---
Yeah i saw them recruiting during launch week and they specifically said they wouldn‚Äôt help, would talk trash etc..
---
I thought it was pretty funny, but not what I‚Äôm looking for and they were straight up and honest but I was fortunate enough to see the recruitment message and know to stay away. 
---
I haven‚Äôt seen them recruiting recently so others wouldn‚Äôt know what kind of guild they are.
---
Nope, it is a lot lower.

I forgot what xpac it was, but I named all my pets by what buff they provided. Haste the ray was very popular for awhile.

**Kurrinaxx-Horde-lvl40**
---
Hey Everyone, 
---
I'm currently a level 40 enh shaman. I've mostly been grinding and a bit of questing. I would like to run some dungeons, and find players that are down for gank groups. 
---
I'd really like to get a melee cleave group going, i wouldnt even mind respeccing to resto for that task. 
---
I'd also generally speaking just like to make some new friends on this server, im in a guild but it would be sweet to meet some new people!
---
I mean, we get a free 40 mount, and our epic mount costs considerably less depending on how cheap you can get the mats. Pinching pennies while leveling really isn‚Äôt a big deal for a lock.
---
Wholesome
---
Yep. I was gone for a week and have 6 days played. Loving every second of it. I wanted to roll an alt on my server and it would have been nice to have gold/leather to send over but if my server was "dead", i wouldn't have wanted to
---
Doesn‚Äôt it automatically move to the next available skill when you learn the last showing green? I remember just spamming ‚Äúlearn‚Äù and it would go through all of them reguardless of spec
---
If you don't implement flying in TBC, you have to redesign zones. If you redesign zones, then you're basically making TBC++ #smartchanges. 
---
Which would be fucking awesome and I'd love it, and I would literally pay 100 USD a month to play this. But, I just don't think Blizzard would ever do that, and I don't think players would tolerate it without endless bitching.
---
Why do people prefer Fury over Arms pre-40 for leveling? They both seem to be alright but Arms getting more rage for a charge and keeping more rage after a fight seems to work well with mobbing does it not? Arms is also considered better for PvP and you don't even DW until 60 anyway for Fury. 
---
Which is better/easier for 5 man tanking?
---
Look into TSM (Tradeskillmaster) it has a sniper function that scans the last page for deals but you can just change the pricing to what you want so it fits your needs. might need a tutorial on TSM though as it can be kinda confusing for someone who never used it. there are many on YT.
---
It's one of the coolest places in the game, even if it's miserable. I wish there were more zones with extreme color effects.
---
ESC &gt; ELVUI &gt; Double click Action Bars, you can enable extra bars from there
---
That's it, thank you :)
---
in another 30 years though...
---
But you don‚Äôt even have a pet.
---
Spoiler alert, everyone is.
---
honestly i wish i could round up every single phone poster and put them in camps
---
Ok this one I understand a little bit. I never really thought of it that way, but I can see the thought process being a little more logical here
---
You just barely have the minimum specs, so I'd expect the game to be slow but playable on minimum graphics.  
---
You can try closing any programs running that you don't need, use windows disk cleanup to make sure you have enough free space, reboot once a week at least, and finally you can remove the case on your computer to blow out any dust that might be clogging up your machine. That should at least make the game more playable. If you have any budget, some RAM and a SSD might breath a little bit more life into that machine.
---
Yes, but the entire argument is should it be allowed? It obviously allows a clear advantage. Honestly, if it didn't require extra sub money, do you think it would still be allowed?
---
What exactly is modern bullshit lollygagging? Greed is in the game for people that want something for gold, but that‚Äôs a separate conversation altogether. Regardless of your self proclaimed ‚Äúmain tank‚Äù status, I stand by what I said about not being one if that‚Äôs your principal on aggro and you‚Äôre consistently disobeying the rules set forth in a pub regarding loot. Or are you just cherry picking what‚Äôs convenient?
---

I might just hate you more than I hate elves.. but I bet you rolled an Elf too....

Definitely Shadowprey Village in Desolace.
---
You sound hella creepy and weird lmao
---
Gang gang son, my group and I are at 33ish.
---
First time really getting into wow and I'm loving every minute
---
I mean, it is reportable and someone on my server got a 3 day suspension for this EXACT same thing (he would stand by the arena wall and kill people without getting guard aggro).
---
What is the general protocol for raid loot? I'm playing a hunter, and say I'm doing a MC raid that has 4 other hunters and a hunter item drops, does top DPS get priority? Does everyone just roll need and whoevers the luckiest gets it? If you already won a hunter item earlier in the raid and another piece drops, do you sit that roll out since you already got a piece? Personally I feel like if an item is an upgrade, and u can use it, everyone should need regardless of if they've won before. Is this the general sentiment?
---
When my friend and I level together, its not just lowbies, it's any Alliance we see, we attack. We are in the middle of a war, we aren't taking any chances of getting our backs stabbed after we leave them alone.
---
Seriously THIS! Enough of the meta-slave mentality that is rampant in retail. Classic was never tuned to be that "difficult" in terms of dps cutoffs etc. People seriously forgot about just having fun. 
---
If APES can kill rag first week into Classic with greens on, a raid of boomies dps can do it just fine. For those that don't know, boomkin spec druids are considered the worst "simming" dps spec in the game. But they can still put out enough numbers to kill Rag.
---
Non-optimal is not the same as failure.
---
One of the only true classes to play! Keep it up brother!
---
Fury just kinda goes "ok I can't whirlwind now" and BTs. You lose some rage gen from the mh but if you already had some pooled its very minor.
---
Okay thanks!
---
I dunno, the culling of Stratholme wasnt very green. And it's still burning to this day! I'm no expert, but I'm sure the continuous burning of a city for almost 20 years adds a lot of GHG to the atmosphere
---
No swords. Axes and maces.
---
Don‚Äôt take this advice. Figure this out with your group first.
---
It's not my fault they put strength on leather, stop attacking me! Also do you mind if I need on that Eye of Rend? 2% Crit is BIS bro
---
We had a level 45 Hunter in ZF who learned the hard way that when the timer of FD runs out, you die for real.
---
Well someone has to entertain the party.
---
shhhh nobody knows that druids counter mages because nobody plays hc druid. don't let the secret out.
---
hey everybody, here is a post that got a lot of upvotes three weeks ago but I'm counting on none of you to notice
---
Auctioneer has this option.
---
I don‚Äôt directly kill often. Pulling mobs into a guy and frost nova? You bet. Sheeping a healer in an elite quest duo? Absolutely. That‚Äôs the fun shiz.
---
Will do, ty!
---
And the constant posts about him get removed because it is against this subs rules.
---
Femorc. Look, the increase spell damage helps my arcane shot and the healing helps mend pet! I think!
---
&gt;Yea until you get a 500g epic item ninjad from you..
---
State the rules prior to dungeon. Blizzard will enforce those rules and take the item from the Ninja looter. 
---
Only if it's stated before though.
---
Is there any list that shows what level is ok to start tanking a dungeon? I've seen a rule of thumb to be 2 levels lower than the highest level boss of the instance but wasn't sure if that was too conservative.
---
Blizzard isn't forcing anyone to be a part of a loot council. Is your sarcasm detector broken?
---
There was a guy on my server in vanilla that made it all the way to rank 14 without realizing he needed to train beyond rank 1 Mortal Strike.
---
Unless you're a Sub rogue and you can still open with a 1shot ambush and disappear into the shadows with a vanish/sprint before anyone knows what happens.. even the 60s wont be able to get you
---
About to head into UBRS for the first time and hopefully MC next week. I‚Äôve been fine healing by myself and mostly use greater heal. When I start healing with other people though should I consider a downranked heal or flash heal instead?

I want to have fun in the game! What other people?

Robe of winter night gives 40 shadow and a ton of int, very close to just as good imo

Add for rogues:

If you have a Druid in your group, and you need +int leather gear, you are an enourmous piece of shit
---
40k as a feral in blues
---
When it's good fanart or an unique comic, that's always appreciated.
---
With the amount of players? Yes.  
---
For each individual player? No.
---
I didn't say everyone has the money. I know multiple people (about 4-5) that were able to afford it because of SFK blade, Lynx, or cloak.
---
If you're in a guild group or with friends, absolutely allow the people that need the gear to roll need. If you're with PUG randos though? What's to stop someone from needing on something their class can use and just selling it despite what they tell you? 
---
Also - anyone can sell a BoE and buy something that benefits them, and nobody needs gold more than anyone else. Letting everyone roll on BoEs is the only thing that's really equitable.
---
in a few levels (around 30) if you want to speed up kill speeds significantly you should drain tank with succubus. I haven't used my VW since getting my Helynn except for on a couple of fights where I needed his shield to sacrifice for.
---
then again. If you like to just use the dumb blue marshmallow then do it.
---
&gt; It's also much more intuitive to read when time is on the x-axis for reasons /u/Minus-Celsius already explained. Bigger slope should be a faster speed not the inverse.
---
We're not looking for faster speed. Are you kidding? **We already know what form has the fastest speed, and that's the epic fucking mount.**
---
We are **not** at all interested in the fastest speed. We are interested in the shortest time to cover a distance.
---
What secret ;)? 
---
All I see is a deleted comment hahaha
---
More like a gradual change and not a "see your world is fucked now" change.
---
Like every month or every quarter year or something something changes in the zones, hoggers army got bigger so they overtook the mines.
---
Defias brotherhood got killed so now the mines are empty and goblins moved it.
---
Wetlands had a hurricane so now its flooded.
---
Blackrock erupted, lava everywhere.
---
And stuff like that, nothing super big, just small changes that shake things up a big without deleting stuff completely or at all.
---
I‚Äôve literally been on top of it and still not getting it. I thought maybe it was something about me being a spriest
---
Yeah, it really sucks to be going about your business only to get casually one-shot ganked by a passing 5-box of mages/priests/whatever. Always good to be reminded that not all multiboxers are in it for the troll factor. Keep on keeping on, man.
---
Barrens chat has been way better than other chats.  The worst is hillsbrad and 2nd worst so far being desolace.
---
Fuck that, my class has been memed for 15 years now. With the influx of terrible mages, it is time to pass the torch. You'll get used to it, I promise.
---
Bro I have 69 kids and 420 jobs I JUST cleared Sarkoth now give me upvotes üò†üò†üò†üò†
---
&gt; BOP's are also worth gold to a vendor, why then shouldn't everyone need on BOP too?
---
The difference is that you can't typically buy a similar upgrade for vendor price. If the group needed on every BoP, everyone would get an equal number of items, but they wouldn't get the *right* items, and they wouldn't be able to convert the small sale price for the wrong ones into the right ones. Everyone actually ends up more powerful if they follow the need/greed system.
---
When it comes to high value BoE's, though, that's not true; everyone CAN convert them to equivalent upgrades for their class. Because of that, both the need/greed and the all need systems result in similar power upgrades for the group. The latter system, however, is not subject to ninja abuse, which gives it the advantage.
---
&gt; People should be able to wear the gear meant for their class without buying it.
---
The vast majority of meaningful loot in the game is BoP, and will be distributed based on need in some fashion. Having a few exceptions for the very rare high value BoE's that drop in order to discourage "theft" makes sense, in my opinion.
---
Keep in mind this doesn't include the rest of the gear. Basically there is a blue post about itemization and how we are playing with catch-up gear, and with catch up stats and itemization. That's why this so much easier, everyone is already running with AQ catch up gear according to the blue post. 
---
&gt; Blizzard has shared more details on itemization in WoW Classic. While items changed throughout vanilla WoW, with different stats, bugs, and appearances, WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item: 1.12 
---
&gt; Along the way, we‚Äôve seen many questions asking if we‚Äôre also retracing the steps of incremental changes to individual items and their stats that may have occurred throughout original WoW. Such a plan could be called ‚Äúprogressive itemization.‚Äù  
---
&gt;Here‚Äôs an example of progressive itemization. The Tier 2 warrior Helm of Wrath originally had Spirit and Agility on it, as well as critical strike chance. In Patch 1.5.0, the helm‚Äôs stat budget was changed to Stamina, Strength, and Defense, along with elemental resistances. Then in Patch 1.7.0, the amount of Defense on the helm was reduced. In Patch 1.8.0, the 5-piece set bonus that included the helm was fixed to work with Whirlwind, and in 1.9.0, it got a better look with an art update.  
---
&gt;**WoW Classic will only include that last version of the item, as it existed in our reference version: 1.12.**  
---
&gt; **When new items are added to loot tables, you‚Äôre generally seeing a deliberate effort to provide catch-up gear and/or to provide new goals for players who had exhausted an existing reward structure. For example, in original WoW, items were added to give players a way to quickly prepare for Ahn‚ÄôQiraj without having to spend months in Molten Core and Blackwing Lair.**  
---
&gt;**The changing of existing items in patches often illustrated the original design team responding to how players played the game. Their primary goal at the time was to make rewards more relevant and exciting. Developers realizing that Spirit probably wasn‚Äôt an ideal stat for a warrior raid set helm\* was an example of this sort of change.**  
---
&gt;This means that while content will be unlocked progressively to allow for each raid tier to shine, systems such as class design, battleground mechanics, and stats on existing items will all be set to their final 1.12 conditions. That should take the pressure off players to be constantly figuring out what we might do next to remain exactly in line with how the game once played out, and we can all focus a little more on community building and enjoying the experience together. 
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/news=291443/itemization-in-wow-classic-items-to-use-1-12-versions](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291443/itemization-in-wow-classic-items-to-use-1-12-versions) 
---
Since we are playing patch 1.12, that includes a lot of the catch up gear and mechanics.
---
Fair enough.  I'd personally still rather have t1 considering wearing cloth/leather isn't really viable for pvp healing as a Shaman and I don't have the time to grind out rank 13 for the epic pvp gear.  I guess I'll be looking for another dkp guild so I can get the gear I want rather than the gear they want me to have.
---
Wow rip your leveling with rank 1 shadow bolt all the way to lvl 22
---
What everyone already said, but keep in mind if you respec and don‚Äôt keep the talent, your weapon skill drops to 0.
---
Go look for it yourself :P
---
Classic doesn't play itself.
---
I‚Äôve played since vanilla and never rolled need on a BoE to sell it, and none of my group members have either.
---
Different path of addiction - let the man ease into 1 addiction at a time.
---
Found the guy that doesnt know wow no longer has a ToS.
---
You should tell Blizzard they've been allowing cheating for 15 years
---
Health funnel has saved MY ass multiple times. I'm also really really stingy with food and water. I have no problem pulling multiple mobs with 20% hp and mana.
---
So you're finally figuring out that sucks to play a class that's popular and accepted to shit on constantly?  
---
This post brought to you by hunter gang.
---
You‚Äôre the one making fun of ‚Äúthe rules‚Äù and now saying to learn them. Must be young. I‚Äôm specifically referring to instances where you are not lead, and the rules of the run have been told to you before the dungeon starts. Your original comment was that fuck it I‚Äôm gunna need what I need. This is stupid and will get you a terrible reputation. That is my point. If you are always leader, you avoid this entirely. Hope this is clear.
---
Imagine being so delusional to think that an initial hype wave results in continuous growth instead of the inevitably collapse and steady decline.
---
Wer soll laut Gr√ºnfaust weiter posten? Mit was hat diese Person seine Zeit verschwendet?
---
That is the most complicated round about way to punish someone for doing something not against the ToS.
---
What the fuck are you even talking about. **Intuitively** you follow your **input** in this case **distance** across the x-axis and then draw up from there because it's the **independent variable**.
---
The reason it's normally time is because we normally ask ourselves "At t=6seconds where is my particle?"
---
However, in this case we are asking "If i'm traveling distance = 40 yards, which form should I use?"
---
This. money should be spent for leveling asap.. that means needed vendor items, mount, and cheap upgrades you can come across. the raw silver per kill at level 50 is around 4 times the amount of the value of rare drops. for lvl 30s
---
It all sounds reasonable, but i disagree with the need on boe logic, imho if the item is an upgrade for the guy, then he should be entitled to it as a priority, as long as he will use it. In other words, they'd already won the roll by being a class able to best take advantage of the item dropped.
---
And before anyone calls me "selfish", i am speaking as a warlock main, there are basically no &gt;60 epic boes worth noting that i could obtain (aside from that 35lvl ring, but i have bought one already so it's irrelevant).
---
Sorry, its called Thunderbrews Boot Flask.  I never really looked at the name and knew it had something to do with brew.
---
I got this pattern for my buddy (thank god.) I also made the macro and spammed it for something like 2 hours. 
---
The pattern sells for 15-20g on my server, but the irony is that the bags themselves are only 3 or so gold, which is barely over the price of Runecloth.
---
There is like no mob grind if you sprinkle in a good amount of dungeons, I'm not talking 100s, but I probably did 60ish in my entire leveling experience and just mob grinded 59 to 60 because I was farming rare recipes I needed
---
Sure but scroll down and read the comments telling OP to take a statistics class or redo fourth grade and get a chuckle out of the irony

Pretty sure the EOK has always worked that way and you‚Äôre meant to use it to scout and view things. If it actually gets attacked and killed all that aggro then goes to the lock.

is that the pizza guy?
---
Its bumming me out that the arcinite transmute is essentially worthless on my server. The arcane crystals are going for 30g and the bars are going for 31. Makes no sense what so ever.
---
Is there a limit to the other one?
---
Priests are the best healers, but you'll always get a spot as resto shaman, windfury is awesome for all the rogues and warriors in the raid
---
I would say DPS is my top priority honestly, but I do enjoy tanking and I'm willing to sacrifice a small amount of DPS to make the tank life a bit easier.
---
I think I agree with just taking a bunch of feral talents until 60, forgoing the Nat Weapons and Omen for a strong tanking spec so I'm not throwing 5 points into Natures Grasp
---
&gt;Judaism, Christianity, Deceit

Awww their names match how cute

How is removing infowars from the game ruin it in anyway at all? How does that impact WoW in any remotely reasonable way?

Next thing you‚Äôre gonna tell us is that Deathwing is still alive and attacking the city!

Roll PVE, problem solved

Yup, this is exactly why I gave in and downloaded Questie. I was spending so much stupid time tabbing out to google. Would much rather just stay in game and have my questions answered.

My favorite part of exploring is finding cool architecture and Wpvp, so for me getting questie did not take away from exploration.

One of you are toggled for PvP and one isn't?

If you are going to use drain health, just drain tank with succ. You‚Äôll still save money, and it‚Äôll be faster/easier.
---
AH is better than bandages for all cloth, at least silk+
---
You choosing to pass is fine, of course. You declaring that such an item SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED for DPS is telling everyone else that *they* should pass.
---
You're comparing "My favorite ice cream is Rocky Road", to "Everyone's favorite ice cream should be Rocky Road".
---
imagine reading the above posts and thinking that the mage never looked at a video or stream of another person doing what they are described as attempting to do, thinking for 2 seconds how long it takes to level from 20, when you squire blizzard, to the Arathi Highlands, a 30+ zone, and wondering about the amount of time one person has with the required spells to AoE farm in the described anecdote and thinking to ones self, "how can I passively aggressively shit on someone online in such a manner as to affect their cognitive reasoning abilities so they regret sharing their words on the internet ever again."

build up rage on one mob then use it all on 2 mobs using cleave sweeping strikes. use axe spec for crit. and buy some health pots, get lots of bandages. be prepared to die and earn your way lol. also leveling spirit is pretty good if you dont get much pvp
---
Wrong choice. WoW is life
---
Ok not 24 lol good
---
Cool story bro, I‚Äôm sure your life is full but f wonder and fulfillment. Thanks for sharing.
---
Blizzard doesn't need to do anything you need to stop whining so much.
---
After a certain talent threshold or with a wolfshead helm a druid wants to be popping out of bear and then back in to get the rage for the next pull since they likely end the fight at low or no rage, so go for it.
---
When my brother and I were younger, our dad used to say ‚ÄúSchweppes!‚Äù instead of ‚Äúshit!‚Äù and to this day I can‚Äôt think of Schweppes without thinking of shit xD

it depends on perspective.

100 armor becomes 460 in dire bear form w/o thick hide and 506 with 5/5 thick hide.
---
 506 is 10% more than 460.
---
 But the 100 armor is giving you an additional 46 armor (506 minus 460), or +46%, only because of thick hide.
---
Can we interest you in a character on a nice, safe "Normal" server?

What about reg lvl 60 dungeons?
---
I get the message that my account has been locked for suspicious activity sometimes when I get logged out of bnet but the game is still open. As in, I'm playing on my desktop, quit to log in screen, go play on another machine (logging into bnet) which logs out my bnet on my desktop. Then if I go back to my desktop and try to log in I get the suspicious account warning, unless I close the game, reconnect bnet, then log back in. Maybe something similar?
---
If he never logs in again just know... Hes probably playing a hunter
---
I feel like you didn't even attempt to read my post or respond directly to the points I made.
---
&gt;NO! it is not the same thing because it is a literal upgrade for that class and is designed for that class to wear!
---
Who cares if you can wear it? That BoE could be traded for items I could wear just the same. Its worth in the group is exactly the same to everybody: what it sells for. The player can buy the BoE if they really need it.
---
&gt;BOP's are also worth gold to a vendor, why then shouldn't everyone need on BOP too? 
---
Because BoPs are worth far less to a vendor and can only be gotten through that specific instance based on pure lucky drops and has a far higher value to a class who can actually use it. BoEs are just gold sacks that everyone benefits from equally.
---
&gt;Just because you are greedy and want everyone else to participate in your mental gymnastics doesn't mean we have to do so.
---
Basic economics is not mental gymnastics. Opportunity costs are important here. If the equippable player wants the BoE then he can buy it.
---
&gt;People should be able to wear the gear meant for their class without buying it.
---
TANSTAAFL.
---
You saving 500g (the cost of the item) is the same as me selling it for 500g. In both cases we have an opportunity at 500g: the same value for all players.
---
&gt;this avoids that as well. 
---
My point is, you don't need to avoid it if it's not a problem. And if you state these rules before, then it's not a problem.
---
A dungeon is doable at -5, but doable and practical/worth are different things. -5 will require coordination, dedication, cooldowns, and maybe consumables. -3 will be a little hard, but acceptably challenging and reasonable. -1 or on-level is pretty much a guaranteed wipeless clear.
---
Currently there's 2 up on my server for 480 and 550.
---
What if wow dies tomorrow??
---
Hunter/warlock are the easiest while being very fast levelers.
---
Druid has the most flexibility/versatility, and while it has a massive kit, it's broken up into more palatable sections (caster form, bear form, cat form) so it's not *too* difficult to get the hang of. If you are totally unsure of whether you'd prefer to tank, dps, or heal I recommend druid.
---
Those three IMO are the best for new players. Mages are also pretty decent, but in terms of "good new player class" I think they still sit a little behind hunter/druid/lock. But really pick whatever you think is the most interesting, you'll have a good time that way and it's not like any of the classes are impossible or "too hard" for a new player.
---
Lol I just did SM with two hunters and herod charged at one and he FDed and I thought he got one shotted as well. lol.  I forgot how much it messes with you when you're playing whackamole (i.e. healing).
---
Lol wow you‚Äôre a bright one with those baseless assumptions. I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll get you far in game and out. Toodles simpleton.
---
He said he was friend zoned. That automatically implies a relationship beyond friendship is desired, and therefore sex is on the table by default.
---
Hey now there‚Äôs an idea!
---
So they're not paying multiple subscription fees then?
---
He paid for the gear.
---
Threat meters dont do shit, buggy af, specially on Onyxia.
---
 Hes getting 1 shadow bolt off every like 5 secs (compare that to the other warlocks that arent getting meele pushback), which is why I ask. The only thing that comes to mind that might make this happen is possible threat from Drain Life healing.
---
had a dwarf tank roll need on blue cloak from vancleef. He was wearing 3 stam cloak, blue cloak had 3 stam, 6 agi.
---
me, hunter, wearing 1 agi, 2 stam cloak. He won the roll
---
Tanks if you are having a hard time keeping threat on 3-4 packs try making marking macros and marking a skull. 
---
Keep partial threat on non skull and most on the current skull. 99% of the time most dps will hit a skull first.... ok maybe 60% but better than none :)
---
The graph shows exactly this. Look at the big arrows pointing to the intersection between mount and run and look at the Y axis. Some people are visual learners and the graph aids them!

You put 2 or 3 sunder armor on every mob, then demo shout. Use taunt when needed. But probably more important: mark targets and get some dps that play according to the marks
---
That would be awesome indeed. Glad you like the idea. :)
---
How many times can you laugh at the same joke?
---
so fuck the guy that can actually use it then because you can turn it into something you can use? how is that even kind of fair? Something he can use did drop, let him fucking wear it man, not everything that drops is for you.
---
As a warlock, I specifically tell the healer if Im going to be life tapping intensely and not to heal me, just allow me to regain it naturally from life drain/siphon life and occasionally throw a hot my way if it gets too bad. Im not a priorty target if Im not actively being attacked.
---
This goes double for Forsaken warlocks with cannibalize.
---
yeah you would like more in there wouldnt u u/virgin_dildo_lover
---
This happened to me when I was pulling mobs for one of the quest in the salt flats. 3 fucking mobs and I barely get out, my pet is dead, I‚Äôm just trying to skin and boop rogue outta nowhere. Probably could have one shot me even if my health wasn‚Äôt in single percentages.
---
Yeah fighting frost mages in raid spec is so depressing lol. You just kinda stand there and look menacing
---
I remember back 12 or so years ago watching ‚ÄúThe Hobbs way of pulling‚Äù And he would very regularly be running people through dungeons with 4 low levels and him at max level.
---
Prick in what way? There's two warriors in that raid, I assume the other one has those already. He didn't, and apparently would wear them when he got more set pieces. I didn't figure out any reason to hate on him based on *this post alone*.
---
It works, but only if the other people in the group are using it also.
---
I run ClassicThreatMeter, ThreatPlates, and Tiny Threat  (add-on for Details) just to cover different options.
---
SHAME
---
Aw yea, those were the days. &lt;JUICE&gt; was a big rivalry for us.  
---
I played alliance back then, but playing horde in classic.
---
No one is saying you should roll need on BoP items, we're only talking about BoE items that are Rare/Epic.
---
Same with Paladino's.  Holy pallies can/will roll on anything from cloth to plate with int
---
Ah okay! A couple of follow up questions (sorry if they‚Äôre obvious answers, still learning) 
---
what cloth were you buying/best to buy? 
---
Do you know
---
How much cloth you ended up needing?
---
Quick we need to sacrifice our friends to the gods
---
Because I have nothing to fear.
---
I mean, our internet laws here are pretty safe (Brazil) and I can download whatever the fuck I want even torrents and not getting SWATTED.
---
Xp gain is the same but rep drops. If youre 40 and go do a ratchet quest youll get 200xp but 1rep.
---
Apparently you were missed with the passcode. If mage isn‚Äôt easy just quit now. It‚Äôs all uphill baby.
---
Yeah, the XP is based on what you get and is not affected by anything else.
---
Most raids will either be full pug, in which case the person organizing it would agree upon the rules, or they'll be primarily a guild or group organizing it, in which case it will almost certainly be lootmaster. In those cases, the hunters would /roll or something similar, assuming it's a guild that's actually decent to their pugs. Some guilds are known for not giving pugs anything, so always be aware of who you're running with. 
---
I'm not 100% sure for other classes, since I'm primarily concerned with my Warrior gear, BUT I believe that most raid gear is Class specific, meaning if two pieces of Hunter gear drop, then the same people are eligible. At that point it would be up to the raid leader/group to determine how loot is split, but generally speaking the same folks would be able to roll on it.
---
Get 5/5 cruelty from fury first then all arms, respec at 40 for mortal strike then get cruelty more fury talents after that.
---
My guild has been doing our best to attune people to ony which means I‚Äôve likely run that place close to 50 times now including rend runs. We have scouts go out before each clear to look for Jed and I would guess out of 50 runs we‚Äôve seen him around 30+ times. I‚Äôve seen that fucking trinket drop twice. At the point where I‚Äôll just wait for our mages and locks to get talisman.
---
Female Nelf Warrior was my first character, and I miss her so much.
---
It was added at the end of WotLK as an equivalent to the Winterspring mount.
---
So downranking can help but its alot more effective when you get more spellpower since the low rank spell still scales the same as the high rank spell but with less cost.
---
I want so bad to have Goblin Jumper Cables and watch the group lose their mind when I vanish and res our priest on wipe.
---
As a healer I prefer that you don't run around.  I found that more experienced tanks will know exactly where to pull and stand so they don't LOS my own heals.  Newer tanks tend to do things like, go around corners and tank in doorways or up or down ramps. I'm not sure how much it takes to just swivel the character around to see if you can see the healer, but I feel like running around makes healing harder depending on how aware of your position is in relation to environment.
---
I get it, I just disagree.  You seem to be the one who ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt get‚Äù my posts.
---
I agree that if you are going to be so selfish as to need all items above some arbitrary value threshold, alert your party of that beforehand.  All the groups I‚Äôm in seem to be able to use the need/greed system just fine.
---
I can't wait for phase 2.
---
Yes. I've been playing prot warrior and i'm slightly slower at killing mobs than other warriors and much slower than ranged classes. Very easy to find dungeon groups though so you can make up some of the xp that way if you want.
---
Eh I always er on the side of caution when it comes to privacy. Maybe I'm being dumb lol
---
Okay got you. so thats what I was already doing basically. I was just wondering if that is was actually the correct way to go for it.
---
For a minute there I thought it was Cersei Lannister
---
If you pull aggro blink or run towards the tank and also try to slow the mobs with cone of cold.
---
I mean, we didn't had classic for the last 14 years so... Maybe not?
---
lvl 32 mage who ONLY plays when my pally buddy plays....you just blew my fucking mind lol
---
hey if you want to lvl to 60 spamming blizzard with 3 mages and end up not knowing pvp and the vanilla world its up to you. personnaly i didnt tank any magecleave groups i find it boring af. it excludes all other dps classes while solo aoe is still faster. "oh i keep getting ganked" why are you on a pvp server then? mages can 1v1 anybody... now theres too many mage 60s and they barely get any loot in raids its hilarious
---
She probably thought he looks like a big teddy bear /shrug
---
People say do what's fun. But, there's a lot of advantages to having a maxed out toon, and those advantages are fun.
---
People prefer Arms over Fury for leveling, because Fury requires higher %chance to hit, and you won't get gear for that until the later levels.
---
To make them mad
---
Dang. Okay. Thanks so much for the response!
---
I always liked EPGP.  Grab a spreadsheet or something out there for all the item calculations.
---
Show up to raid on time?  3pts.  Each boss kill, 5pts for everyone in the raid.  Stayed until end of raid, 2pts.
---
You bid your "EP" on gear which then gets converted to "GP".  
---
So a helm drops and it's valued at 2GP, you have 10EP/3GP = 3.33PR  
---
Other dude has 12EP/2GP = 6PR
---
The other guy gets it because he has higher priority.  So then it looks like 10EP/4GP = 2.5PR.  You would get priority next item.  
---
Then as soon as raid ends all EP is automatically reduced by 10%.  It rewards people that show up to raid consistently, while at the same time the more casual players can still obtain gear over time by not having their EP drop 10% (because they weren't at raid).  It keeps it fair enough until you get into the really hardcore optimizing, which vast majority of players do not do.
---
\^ This guy versatile otter power bottoms
---
What happens in phase 2 :O
---
Anyone else's group of friends rush to 60 but you're still only in your 30s-40s?
---
I see that now, thats awesome. So was the confusion due to private servers calculating this talent incorrectly?
---
It's the same as taking nodes, chests, or mobs from other people.  I do it, but that'll depend on your morals.  
---
I RP an asshole in game.
---
Minor Striking, if minor beastslayer is unavailable (it should be available).
---
Okay. Gotcha. Thanks!
---
Because its true to this day. Literally the best wipes I've had, no dismiss on jump down in mara last night too, too funny. Then does it again
---
&gt;so fuck the guy that can actually use it then because you can turn it into something you can use?
---
so fuck the guys that can turn it into something they can use then because you can use it?
---
You're complaining that an item drops and a Hunter can only need on it because they get to equip it in 1 step while other classes take 2 steps to equip it? There's a natural gut instinct to let the player who can immediately use it grab it but when you step back and see that the item is just a representation of something every player can use equally then it makes sense that everybody needs.
---
The BoE has the same value to everyone in the group: the amount it sells for. Equippable players save buying it and non equippable players gain the gold from selling it.
---
Regardless it's better to let others know
---
Same exact thing happened to me
---
Aspect of the cheetah only effects run speed.
---
A normal day as Horde doing ganking in a coward way. In other news, the water is wet. :)
---
Thats just an all-caster party, which yeah, sucks. It's not a spell cleave if no one knows how to spell cleave.
---
Probably gonna go with this. Thank you so much for the help
---
Pretty much this.  Tank in Ubrs  told me to tank a dragon.  I told him a rogue would prob live longer than me in zerker stance.
---
Got dps charts for that fight?
---
My heart pounds everytime Garosh runs into the arena. Still havent gotten the Chain chest. The last group I was in said it dropped twice in their arena runs and got vendored both times. /wrist

---
Here's the thing, if you're so unselfish and you want the BoE bow to go to the Hunter, you STILL hit need to prevent it from being ninja'd, then you trade it to the Hunter.

---
Pretty much this. Its also much harder to hold aggro if your dps are casting aoe spells
---
Just wait until you do scarlet subterfuge and keep getting dispelled.
---
Not only will the elites go hostile to you and grind you into a pulp, forcing you to either take res sickness or likely die trying to escape after your 5 minute walk back... you have to go to the other side of WPL to get the disguise again... and risk it all again for those pre raid BIS pieces...  all while waiting on an escort NPC with like a 20m respawn. 
---
Mind controlling people into Lava and black rock mountain, dumping them in fatigue waters in STV-Ratchet, or dropping them into the dwarf underground area outside thorium point...  good times as an undead priest...
---
Priests = ultimate vanilla trolls.
---
you can hit revered from the quests (feralas is the next big darn rep zone). After that, it's all cloth turnins.
---
[quote]Your policy means that no one gets to use BOE gear unless they buy it. That's bullshit dude.[/quote]
---
You can still win it and equip it on the spot if you so choose. Why is gear for you in this instance more important than gear/currency for everyone else in the group just because you can equip the drop directly?
---
Nelf Warrior PVP is fantastic!

Charge from the bushes!

It's the most revolting thing that isn't cheating that you'll see out in the game world, tho!

Still doesn't make them drop the holy water for the swarm of undead after Ramstein though.

Just flip the domain, answers the same problem and makes the graph actually intuitive. How long to travel / how far? Same shit
---
Blizzard won't though.
---
Is there an add on that can tell you all potential drops from any mobs?
---
I totally don't miss carrying those things to lan parties.
---
Dunno. I've never tanked in an MMO before, and I've never played WoW, as I'm a long-time FFXIV player, this is just the rotation I've started using from my own experimentation. It normally works well for me though, so I'd assume (and hope) that it's decent.
---
Faerlina still has a queue, but it's only been like 250 people when I've been on lately compared to the thousands it was before.

If you are super paranoid, go for it.  I‚Äôve never needed to in my groups.

Meh, I really don't care anymore.

Start questing in nelf zones asap. Feathermoon stronghold in feralas is one, i think silithus had some but not sure. 
---
Go find the quartermaster in darnassus, should have quests to turn in 60 cloth from wool and up. Runecloth (the last level, from nobs in their 50s) is repeatable. You want to do any quest that is at least green.
---
As a healer I have learned to leave the DPS at 60 to 70 percent, as for locks between demon armor, health stones, life drain, and bandages the only time they should be getting heals is when a mob is hitting them with melee or boss aoe abilities.
---
Reported!

Elemental won the recent cross server dual tournament, must not be THAT bad.

I downloaded the latest version of curseforge and it won't seperate

There's a staff from the poison elemental boss in gnomer that I think is called the aquacane that allows underwater breathing. Alchemists can also make potions that let you swim faster.
---
Cheetah doesn't impact swim speed.

Yea it is similar, with the inner and outer circle of layouts and the way the 4 sections are broken up... But the problem with UC is it's on multiple levels, whereas Ironforge is all nicely situated on one mostly even level.

Ravager is one of the few sources of pure AoE that hunters can get.  Volley is on a 1 minute CD, traps require you to dismiss pet and feign, and even then don't always work.

He was also at least level 37 if he was using Ravager, so why are you complaining?

---
I already worked a lot as a data analyst for digital marketing agencies and companies. I know what companies are interested and it's not in your hentai bizarre tentacle porn search, I guarantee. They want to know what you listen, what you watch, what you are more inclined to buy, subscribe or experience. They want to know your likes, reactions, posts and photo locations. But let's remember it's all in "bulk" data, no company sees individual data like "mad scientists watching rats" or anything. They can't even, by law.
---
The privacy "thing" is so much more complex and we, as individuals, aren't at risk. Unless you consider receiving an email marketing, popup, message as a "risk". Nonetheless, you could always use add-ons to block ads, as I do after working for so many years for this industry.

I stopped trying honestly
---
It would help in classic if the pets didn't jump with you half the time.  So you get led to think it's okay.

Agreed. I've been 60 for weeks now and have seen a grand total of one drop in UBRS.

You're in favor of a player having a monopoly on a sack of gold without others getting a chance.

He's playing a role, why use an overly-strict definition of the term?

---
I understand the intuition perfectly fine, man. What I'm saying is that it is convention to put an independent variable on the x-axis because generally, that's the variable you're asking about.
---
I perfectly understand and accept that generally you want your velocity in distance/time because, well, that's the definition of velocity. And I understand perfectly that a large majority of the population is extremely used to having time on the x-axis, because well, generally we use time as the independent variable. *Especially* when you first start looking at graphs that mean things, and *especially* when you start getting into physics. But, you really need to understand that sometimes it makes sense in rare cases, such as this one, to just kinda flip it. I promise the graph is easier to read the way OP put it in. Imagine using it while farming herbs, tell me where your eyes go first when you think about what to do when something is 60 yards away. Like, when I'm thinking about actually putting this graph into practice, I'm not even looking at the Y-axis. I'm looking purely at the distances and i'm then going up with my eyes or finger and stopping at the very first line I come across.
---
I think huntards are getting away with more because we aren't ccing as much these days   
---
you'd usually cc something and then here comes dumbfck hunter over there spamming multishot
---
That is a difference of 263 bonus healing. Which adds about \~224 in actual healing power to your Healing Wave.
---
If your average Healing Wave heals for about \~1100 or so (very easy to reach) then just ONE of the "jumps" from the 8pc set bonus is better than that amount of bonus healing. And it jumps twice. And it's a "smart heal" meaning it always goes to the lowest health target and it's never overheal.

Ye, I'm an unread warlock, whenever I see a gnome I will attack, even if I'm outnumbered by far, I will burn that gnome and give him dots to count on. When I was making my way to burning steppes during the late 40s I went through wetlands, I made sure to kill every gnome I saw and usually ignored their friends. Gnomes must die.
---
I had one day this month like that! Straight 11 hours of glorious wow with a walk the pups break. This my game time is only 3 days and I'm level 34. I have no idea how you have a kid and be that high of level lol. Anytime the kid is awake in engaging with him, leaves very little time to game.

---
Sounds like you‚Äôre a greedy asshole who‚Äôd rather ‚Äúfuck you, I got mine‚Äù than actually being fair to people who actually need the gear regardless of price it could sell for.
---
Ask yourself if this really makes sense. It would make sense if horde had very little population which is not the case. 6k is more people that vanilla servers had TOTAL, not just one faction. Since thats clearly not the case why would a 5:1 ratio matter for PvE? 5x more players means 5x more groups but there id also 5x more healers, 5x more tanks and 5x more dps. The percentage of empty spots is the same, the total is more but there is also the same percentage of people looking to fill those gaps and the toal is also more making it absolutely the same.
---
Came here to post this. 
---
A lot more bite to it compared to major labels. Personal favorite for me, haven‚Äôt seen it local though. Always bring back a few cases when I visit family in New Brunswick.
---
I was pulled over once while drinking a can. They thought it was a can of beer.

Yes, avoiding guards in towns is absolutely a reportable offense, as it always has been. He should have been attacked by those guards. I'm sorry if this information upsets you but its true.

Amen.

Downvoting for the axis
---
Really? My fiance went ud female.
---
Remember, duel wielding increases your miss chance by 19% (?) against a similarly leveled mob. Then take into account weapon skills... ya fury warriors probably miss **A LOT**
---
I've always wanted something like this.
---
Played this game way too much since it came out and never met a ninja with the need/greed system.  Don‚Äôt really feel the need to adjust my play patterns, explain a different roll system, and risk taking items from people who used the need/greed buttons correctly based on the theoretical possibility of losing a chance at a bit of bit of gold.  I guess if you care a lot about extracting every possible bit of value from your dungeon groups, needing everything makes sense.  Just not how I choose to play.
---
The add on can not detect other players talents, auto invite anyone, or communicate through non public channels. These are the features that have been removed. Those are big features. Also that's 3 things not two. Get your facts straight you retail pleb.
---
Water expands when it freezes! That'll make it even worse!
---
Whats a fair price for the Devilsaur set?
---
Yes.  The scaling for prot is that it is pretty good at being hit by multiple guys while having someone keep them up and other mow them down.  Great for dungions but out in the world it falls apart.
---
using sword and board means you take less and deal less damage so you are more rage starved.  You can swap to a 2 hander but then half your talents are wasted.  Battle stance vs Defencive stance has similar drawbacks.
---
Even in dungeons prot will make sure you survive but I'm not sure they run a faster dungeon then an Arms warrior swapping weapons (2 hander for smaller pulls swap to sword and board for large groups or when interrupts are required).  The rage starved thing is even worse for prot there (without being able to stance dance with charge pulls) and your damage as an arms warrior in defensive stance almost keeps up with the dps.  Prot can pull bigger...and needs too to function...but depending on comp that might not be ideal.
---
I had the receipt. I don't remember if they asked for it. I believe it's (at least internally) a "known issue" so I don't think they'll give you a hard time but your mileage may vary.

Warlock mount is virtually free though, and epic mount is unavailable until DM comes out.

Use the filter and show only available spells. Helps clean it up.
---
Have your demon summoned when you check the demon trainer for that demon's specific grimoires.
---
This kind of comment doesn't help me at all. The funny thing is the only reason I started playing classic is because of all the talk of how great the community is and how helpful people are. For the most part this is what I have found but that doesn't extend to Reddit I'm finding. Too bad because like I say, so far in game people have been very helpful when they learn I'm new to the game.
---
I wish I had more in game friends.
---
Got that one as well and it's really nice for wow.
---
Alright here‚Äôs a link of something a bit different for ya and I‚Äôll explain my reasoning for some choices. This can easily be used for pvp and pve.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxMGsAioobGtkc
---
General points:
---
I personally don‚Äôt recommend pvping as deep holy. I‚Äôve always been of the mindset that spirit of redemption and lightwell are trap talents. They pull new players in because they look appealing but they are actually a waste of talent points. Spiritual guidance won‚Äôt provide much benefit at prebis gear levels as you just don‚Äôt have a ton of spirit on your gear. Spiritual healing is only base healing so doesn‚Äôt scale with gear. 
---
As a priest, you should view yourself as more than just a healer. You are a utility class in pvp with heals, shields, offensive/defensive dispels(shaman only other class who can offensively dispel), fear, buffs, mana burn. 
---
Talent explanations:
---
There‚Äôs no real need for silent resolve in most situations. Ally side has blessing of salvation and horde side has tranquil air totem so you should always have a threat reduction during raids. You also have fade to help out if you happen to pull aggro. 0 points in SR is perfectly fine.
---
Martyrdom is simply too good to pass up imo. You will likely get hard focused in group pvp often so you should take all the defensives you can get. Healing focus only gives 70% pushback resistance, so unless you are grouped with a pally using conc aura, you will still get pushback when getting focused. 20% resistance to interrupts and immune to pushback for 6 seconds guaranteed after a crit is just really good.
---
Imp inner fire are flexible points. I like it because it will help against melee. You can do 0-3 points here and put them elsewhere if you want. Only pvp use. 
---
Mental agility, meditation, inner focus are all core talents. You should not change these. Just too good for pvp and pve. 
---
Imp mana burn is pretty good and I personally prefer taking it but these points are also flexible if you don‚Äôt want it. Only pvp use. 
---
PI is so strong in group pvp and pve. If you go that deep in disc, mental strength is the obvious choice and you should go 5/5 no matter what. 
---
Blessed recovery for purge bait, as you mentioned already, but also a nice bonus if it isn‚Äôt purged. Plus synergizes with martyrdom. Can drop if pve is your main focus.
---
Inspiration is less important on horde side because shamans have the same talent (different name, same effect). 1 point is fine to get the buff up but your crit isn‚Äôt that high in prebis so I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much about it. If pvp is your focus, you can drop this point for something else IMO.
---
Spell warding is very good for group and solo pvp. The flex points I mentioned earlier could be out here to go 5/5 if you want.
---
Holy nova exactly what you mentioned plus very strong max rank in large scale pvp battles you might find yourself in phase 1/2 maybe in blackrock mountain.
---
Improved healing just helps with mana efficiency. Important in both pve and pvp.
---
I think that covers everything. I‚Äôd like to point out that you could move some points into blackout as well. Always nice to have a chance of a stun. Lots of points can be moved around but I hope my explanations help.
---
I‚Äôm also a huge fan of tri spec. I tend to play offensively in group pvp so I love having the option to do damage/slow with mind flay plus silence. This spec is a bit more gear dependent though. But nice to try out, it‚Äôs quite fun and gives you a break from only healing. Doesn‚Äôt work as well in pve for obvious reasons, unless you are designated as the shadow weave priest in your raids. I can link this too if you want.
---
Long read, sorry. Let me know if I missed anything or have questions. I love discussing priest talents and would love to hear alternative options/reasonings! Apologies for spelling/grammar errors, on my phone.
---

Rofl, who the fuck has any grasp of 76 yards in this game, as opposed to 23 seconds? The graph is garbage to read, a truck load of people didn‚Äôt understand it: hence you are wrong.

Like Christ, who the fuck thinks that ‚Äúif I run above 62 yards I should mount up‚Äù, as opposed to any running above 8 seconds? Amazing
---
Please point out what is wrong with my argument and how your process is more fair.
---
&gt;Your policy means that no one gets to use BOE gear unless they buy it. That's bullshit dude.
---
If you want people to be invested enough in your gearing to pass on things that the whole group can benefit from, group with guildies or friends, it's that simple.
---
You're basing your whole logic on the fact your forearm is a foot long?  How is that a generally applicable unit? lol
---
yep, as an experienced role player, OP is in fact role playing. don't get crazy on the definition for it.
---
Those who seek happiness by taking away the happiness of others will never find permanent happiness.

---
It should be prioritized.  That's my opinion.  That has nothing to do with actually happened during the run.
---
The fact is the trinket is itemized for DPS.  There are other trinkets that have +heals only and +mp5 which are not itemized for DPS.  DPS should get priority.
---
In this specific instance, the healer tried to use an ultimatum so he could reserve a trinket that 4 other members of the raid also needed that are DPS casters.  That makes that guy an asshole, not me one because I think it should be prioritized based on its itemization.

Honest Answer:
---
I think you are trying to over-inflate your self worth by seeking validation of some sort from people that honestly don't care if Faerlina and it's cluster scenario of streamers thrives or dies.
---
Sure, I like /popcorn to pass the day, but honestly, not at all interested in playing with that cesspool of a player base.  Other realms will be around a long time, likely far longer than I will end up playing this go-round.
---
I was watching a video of someone leveling an Orc Warrior and he got to that quest very clearly without any idea what he was in for. It was strangely satisfying watching him slowly start losing his shit with that quest.
---
I didn't start in vanilla, so maybe they buffed the rates by the time I got there when I started in Wrath, but I doubt it. And I did that quest in a three man group with some friends. I'll never forget how few Zhevras have hooves.
---
Now you can finally start playing the game.
---
I firmly believe, at this point, that everyone is just taking pictures their monitors to spite the PrtScn Army.
---
I feel that.
---
My comment comes because I use my mice for work and play, so if the scroll wheel were failing to work properly, it'd be an insta-replace. Don't have time in my workday to be frustrated with a malfunctioning mouse.
---
Casters need to. Melee don't.
---
I'm new and I'm playing warlock. Are you saying I can use something other than wands and daggers?!
---
This is what I do. I tap a movement key than the hotkey for the spell I want to cast. You're still stuck with GCD though if you don't cancel in time with the moving. (I guess that's still two buttons to hit which is what you are trying to avoid.)
---
Thanks for sharing.

Its slow until you get a ww axe at level 30 then you can smash out the levels pretty quickly

Ohhhh shit. Okay. Is that what happens ? I'm a priest and when running pug dungeons I notice this but never played attention to the class. Everytime I panick like how the fuck did I let his health get so low?!! Then it's back and I'm like oh shit just a glitch. I'm level 34 and still it gets me everytime ran gnomer a few days ago
---
Also that those multiboxers would be unable to control their characters effectively without 3rd party software to distribute their keypresses.
---
That LK kill felt soooooo good though.
---
Not really in. And where do you draw the line ?
---
Say you were in the same situation, then had a phone call, so you went afk: after how much time is the person still playing entitled to his loot ?
---
Regardless of the reason, if you aren't participating in the farm, you aren't entitled to the rewards. 
---
And to take your situation: what if the other person had left the group while you were afk, and had gotten the boe. Would you have asked him a chance to roll as well ? And under what grounds ?
---
That's dope. And getting to level 20 is actually higher than I thought.
---
Read time instead
---
Drops like 8 items and some are only good for some people, you use a master looter and people are only allowed to roll for things as a main spec. Some things everyone rolls on.
---
There are 2 main options for guilds: loot council and DKP. Loot council is literally a council of officers voting who gets each piece of gear. DKP is a system where you gain points by participating in raids and you can spend them on drops. Both systems have serious flaws and are a key reason guilds either succeed or fail.
---
I'd actually say it's the perfect time to power level professions. As an enchanter tailor, I have ditched trying to make greens with tailoring to DE them. I just make whatever is cheapest to lvl tailoring and vendor it. Any greens I get dropped in the world I also just vendor. The vendor price is higher than the average DE loot, so I just end up buying stacks of dust on the AH. For the vendor price of 2 greens, I can easily get a full stack of dust... Why even bother trying to farm the stuff yourself at this point...
---
Add me on discord Content#8369
---
Or just Print Screen
---

---
I tried posting a meme but the mods deleted it, so basically fuck trying to create any content for this sub
---
I use an addon that hides all the minimap icons unless i hover over it. Not only because of this but because i also had to many and then there are sone you can put at the border and others you cant and its just a mess. Minr is a mess right now too but at least i dont see it and have a clean minimap unless i hover over it. I think the addon is called neatminimap or something
---
Back then I had more /played until 60 and 50+ felt like nonstop mob grind while I've been more (time/kill) efficient this time. So I might have seen more drops in general and maybe even spend some gold on bags since the prices went down \~8 months after release.
---
"being dedicated on"
---
On top of that lil jab at your terrible english skills, do you really think anyone will gain from your empty words? Such a basic thought. "Have you tried putting in effort?"
---
Only someone as stupid as you would need to be told something this simple, so I guess it makes sense you would think others need the same thing.
---
Also the amount of gold you get at level 60 instead of exp for quests is pretty insane, on my mage I didn't do any of the level 60 dungeons (I did do a full quest clear of BRD though) and strat/scholo/l+ubrs gave me almost 100g on the first clear each from the gold and runecloth drops + quest rewards since some of them are part of quest chains.
---
Sometimes your melee dps is higher than wand dps, so Firestone can work for leveling.
---
Obviously that's not how it works. The spell condenses water vapor high up in the atmosphere until it is heavy enough to fall down as chunks of ice. You are destroying heat out of nothing.
---
It's gonna be rough with no LFG system. But good luck, have fun.
---
It's just not true about BoPs because of how a BoP works; You can't sell it to another player, just a vendor.  The difference is a BoE has value to the entire player base whereas the BoP only has value to the party/raid members present.  These are two different classes of items and the rules for one do not dictate the other. 
---
I'm sorry that you have so much time and 300g doesn't mean anything to you, but to the casual play that is "life changing" gold at this point in the game.  So stop trying to sound all high and might by calling me selfish for thinking that the rules should be established at the beginning and that I prefer the "let's all try to get money" method.
---
Ok fair enough but the post was about doing ubrs with no healers so
---
Why is Ice Armor rank 1 not just called Frost Armor rank 4?
---
Yet it has over 40k downloads still. I wonder why...maybe because the core addon still works? Yep.
---
You're clearly too stupid to reason with, goodbye.
---
Ok you greed, more chances for me ugh what a dense mf.
---
Imo finish leveling and see if you want to farm gear or pvp/raid, get gold if you feel inclined to experience the lore and read quests ect do it on an alt. That way you can have fun in both aspects and the extra gold from your frost can drastically help leveling your second character.
---
How do you know the herb is 60 yards away? I know there's distance tracking addons for mobs.
---
So you admit rational discussions are wasted on you. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Pop. Six. Squish.
---
So basically it‚Äôs whoever gets the drop first since a rogue can chain combos and you‚Äôre pretty much fucked against a good rogue.
---
Somehow it's more frustrating when you wipe because a hunter's stupid pet pulled a pat than it is when like a arms warr accidentally pulls the same pat. I am not saying that it makes any sense.
---
Das konnt ihr noch nicht.
---
Haha, my guildie was complaining that the paladin healer in their group, at like, level 50, didn't have rezz because of this.
---
Nah cause he won‚Äôt have an interest in items he can‚Äôt use, and that kind of behavior would definitely get someone blacklisted. The actual raids themselves are quite easy so as long as you do it every week after reset there will be reputable people running pugs.
---
Wow i went thru the first 16 levels in a day as a warrior and it wasnt that bad
---
Totems and their buffs can be finicky, I suggest whispering a shaman and asking them to party up for a min or two and testing it out.
---
There is more than that trust me. You don't get every single person from a /who. I've /who'ed my guild and knowing everyone the exact number online only get lower results. This is to prevent spamming as well as auto layer hopping. Classic servers even at a low pops still has more players than a med-high pop in vanilla. Those mods were not accurate and that was part of the reason that blizzard shut down the auto /who command (the other being for gold sellers, spam, and auto layer hoppers)  since people were using inaccurate data like what you posted to demand server changes.

"Dire Maul is similar to Maraudon in that it's a 5-player dungeon that can be run prior to hitting level 60. It can be found in Feralas, and is recommended for levels 44-54. "

I look at it from the standpoint of who is going to benefit the most. Besides building a twink, there is very little benefit to equipping an epic at lower levels. You might increase your leveling speed a slight amount, but one epic equipped is not going to speed things up for you that much. The gold value however, is incredibly useful. If I can sell a BoE for 200g, that saves me HOURS of grinding for gold for my epic mount. Since an epic BoE is something that CAN be converted to gold, it would make sense that everyone in the group that contributed the same amount to get that item should have a chance at it. Why should everyone in the group give up HOURS of their future time to help some idiot who is going to equip the item to speed up his leveling by 20 minutes and then vendor the item all in the name of "IT'S AN UPGRADE!!!!111". Fuck the rest of the party right?
---
I honestly think that #NoChanges has made it super enjoyable. Not having the option to push for "improvements" means I just accept how things are and learn to live with them.
---
I've played since launch and was someone who was highly critical of vanilla and looked forward to the changes new expansions would offer. I'd participate on the forums, arguing that my class was weak, offer suggestions on how to fix it, etc. My enjoyment of the game was limited because I always felt there were ways to make it better. Having (the illusion of) input into the game made it harder to really enjoy it.
---
Because A: someone in the party actually needs the item.
---
B: it creates little to no drama for that item to go to the class that can use it
---
C: gold is gold, you can earn it other ways than needlessly pissing off someone because of it‚Äôs supposed value on the AH. 
---
I truly hope you‚Äôre not a guild or raid leader, because your idea of distributing loot seems really unfair.
---
Wait how is MLB first baseman Adam Lind in Menethil?

I don't think rep vendors are in game.

No, it's fine just beat them before they kill you.

60% of the time it works 100% of the time.

Same here. One guy quit instead of resubbing cause the game is "boring", two went back to raiding in retail once they cleared MC, and the one friend who stuck around only plays one or two days a week.
---

---
Yea, dude's a retard
---
I'm new to mage  and a single target frost (like going down the frost tree with imp frost) at level 33, are you just getting enchants for +frost on your gear or you're getting +frost damage gear specifically?
---
But the coefficients are the same whether you have the tier set or not.  Having more +healing or having the set doesn't make +healing better or worse for downranked spells.
---
If you look in the enhancement tree you will find 2h axes and maces.
---
That is a little to conservative.  It would mean you would want to be 26 or so before doing SFK...and the opening level 20 mobs wouldn't be worth it.

---
Not one, but two!

Sorry you have such a difficult time making gold in this game that you feel the need to selfishly steal from people you are grouped with.  Guess I‚Äôve always just had an easy time making gold so I‚Äôd rather be friendly.
---
Would completely deplete the Earth's fresh water supply.
---
The main capitol cities are still very populated with people, however, the focus has mostly shifted from Ironforge to Stormwind (For AH access, unless you dropped the 5 million gold on an AH mount) and Boralus (Main hub of BfA). This is for Alliance of course.
---
oh ye misread your comment sorry
---
blink only moves you a couple feet, and mounting takes half a week. Why would you do this?
---
Yep! I usually pull unless I'm 60% (because my damage is sad). If I end a fight at 15% that's fine. I just don't want to die.
---
Alright alright. I want to be at least known for being helpful as a Holy Priest come raid time my whole goal is to be a decent healer in the long run. I want to alt a rogue or warrior but I just do not have the time.

Only one mage in the raid outdamages the warrior in naxx, the one with the first crit.

Most of the damage in a fight is tank healing, having a few shamans with t1 8/8 is good for tank healing while also being able to help the raid healers.

Only drops Desertwalker Cane for unique loot though, hardly gamebreaking by any stretch.
---
Is there an add on that simply adds a button to sort the inventory? I just wanna have it all in one place without dragging stuff all over.
---
Yeah if you are ahead of the curve it's a great time to do that.. but most people are more concerned with getting their mounts, skills, etc. There is also just less gold accumulated because people havent played as long yet. Once the economy grows, more people will have more gold to toss around and the prices will go up for things. Ideally you stock up on mats to level professions and sell them when the economy goes up. But then you're sacrificing your gold now for more gold later. I personally would rather get my mount, try to get to 60, and then make those decisions.
---
&gt;So you admit rational discussions are wasted on you. Thanks for the heads up.
---
And you admit that you think you're way is the only way anyone should play the game, and how other people feel about the game doesn't matter. Thanks for the heads up.
---
Look for the addon autobiographer, its got all kinds of stats, breaks it up by level and total etc. i like it.
---
&gt; so fuck the guy that can actually use it then because you can turn it into something you can use?
---
Neither system fucks anyone. Both systems give everyone an equal chance at an equal upgrade. 
---
&gt; how is that even kind of fair?
---
How is it NOT? All five players have a 20% chance to win the roll and get a large upgrade for their class. Which part isn't fair? How is anyone getting an advantage over anyone else? 
---
&gt; Something he can use did drop, let him fucking wear it man, not everything that drops is for you.
---
If that's how you want to run your groups, feel free. I don't think that system is logically defensible as better than the other options, though. "All Need high-value BoE" is equally fair and less abusable. Maybe it's less fun, less interesting, whatever, but those are subjective determinations that you can't hold other players to.

How much are enchants supposed to cost? Is there like a guide somewhere i could reference, or a general guideline? Or as an enchanter, am I expected to just spend my time farming mats and recipes and hoping I get enough from tips? Like do tips really outweigh the material cost?

It's not a fetish. Using your phone to take a picture of your screen is something that has always been reserved for the AARP crowd, and even then it's ridiculed by younger generations. My personal annoyance comes from the fact that it takes less time to hit Print Screen, than it does to pick up your phone and take a picture.
---
 Using the built-in screenshot method also allows for more quality cropping and editing. I'm not sure what the rush is to get your post on Reddit. If you are so proud of your achievement that you feel the need to share it, why would you take a sideways, blurry and horribly oversaturated phone picture instead of taking the extra 60 seconds to crop a proper screen grab?
---
I think you are right. And I think I remember it getting "unlocked" close to the release of BC, but I might be remembering wrong.
---
Multiboxers have to have invested time into the game, and therefore deserve to be able to five-shot you. You're getting overly salty about that.    
---
Conversely, that ganking rogue kid got a hold of Mom's credit card. You shouldn't be able to effectively turn yourself into a miniature world boss for lower level players (and clog up a server slot that could be used by a non-ganker, mind you) just be being more toxic than you.

Used to be Ironforge but SW is more popular right now.

You'll get Sword of Serenity through SM at the earliest 35 if someone will carry you. Otherwise CB is still decent but falling off. If you're desperate you could try to go for the scepter at the end of the Kurzen quest soon.

Number of Hunters, fast looting to friend, didn't or couldn't be arsed to ensure all have rolled.

Yeah I been in a raiding guild, and yeah I watching him now, just like you, difference is I won't defend such a thing, if anything Mcconnell should had allowed it to be fairly rolled off and not logged out, you can defend asmon all you want, but Mcconnell has no defence, and as he likes to put it "Co Leader"
---
Don't believe everything you read on the internet
---
&gt;It's itemized for DPS. 
---
No, it's itemized for both DPS *and* healers.  The fact that there are other trinkets also itemized for healers doesn't change anything with regards to this trinket.
---
Yeah I‚Äôm really not into raiding. Definitely enjoying and taking my time with the leveling process. Level 36 but I don‚Äôt get a lot of time to play.
---
I don‚Äôt really understand it, unless you‚Äôre gaining my guild-mates or touching my ore.
---
But I was a locked chest. Why would I roll if I'm the only rogue? Yeah literally speaking they don't get a mount but they do get a huge speed boost right?
---
I'm definitely not ahead of the curve. My main is lvl 34 now, but I am a warlock so the mount is not really a concern.
---
Stuff is really really cheap right now. It feels to me like farming vendor trash is by far the most reliable way to make money right now at the lower levels. Especially if you're doing quests at the same time. I'm not saying you'll be able to level your professions all the way and have plenty of cash for your mount, but the way I'm going I don't expect to be too far off from being able to afford a mount if I started saving now.
---
Gotta level my alt before next raid.
---
He was being a jerk about it, but etiquette is to roll on all chests. If someone can open a locked one (rogue, blacksmith, etc.) then the group still rolls on it. You're part of a group, so everyone contributes their skills for the good of the party. Same way everyone buffs, provides water, or otherwise helps the members of their group.
---
I got a group of friends I play with and I gotta agree it‚Äôs awesome! At the same time it‚Äôs good to not always play with the same group. Remember, there are other players out there that may have zero friends to play with
---
Yeah, he should have. My guild only gave about 5 seconds per item for rolls. If the master looter announced the item you wanted, you got your /roll ready
---
I don't understand the drama about this being too fast at all.
---
I only attacked a grey once, normally i never attack. But when i specced to elemental, on my way to badlands i just had to try and oneshot that nightelf in wetlands with elemental mastery combo.
---
Omg Heavy Junkbox just triggered my PTSD
---
Agility is way more important. If you're on a pve server, then don't even bother looking at the armor values. Even on a PVP server I'd have to be looking at a very minor sacrifice of agility in exchange for a lot of armor and probably some stam too to consider it worth it.
---
While I think it's lame to ask for free water randomly from a stranger, this mage's response is also kinda douchey. Funny, but still douchey.
---
And less than 2 seconds needed to type /roll for an item you should already know whether or not is an upgrade. This shit isn‚Äôt retail where you gotta sim it to find out.
---
And FYI you have to use the book in Tanaris as well to switch specializations. This confused me for a week, I thought the quest giver was bugged.
---
High value items are functionally equivalent to gold. An edgemasters in your inventory is the same thing as having 500g.
---
The orc stun resist racial is probably the best racial you can have as a lock. It‚Äôs better than Will of the Forsaken. Resisting a stun or not is usually the deciding factor whether you kill a rogue or they kill you. And RP wise, there‚Äôs still an underground network of orc warlocks (see Cleft of Shadows)
---
&gt; I think you are trying to over-inflate your self worth by seeking validation of some sort from people that honestly don't care if Faerlina and it's cluster scenario of streamers thrives or dies.

I keep reading about this but I haven't seen this mindset at all in dungeons so far. In the countless dungeons I've done I have yet to see someone complain or even ask "why are we waiting?" once, I've seen some DPS pull mobs at times but it wasn't because the tank is too slow but rather they wanted to pull that pat before it gets too far or pulled with CC.
---
Maybe casters feel like the tank is going too fast? That's my best guess because on my mage I'm used to tanks pulling when I'm at 20% mana but I like seeing that, it gives him more time to build threat and if the healer is at 100% mana there is 0 reason to wait for mage mana even if all 3 dps are mages IMO.

Retail boss kills feels so much better imo. Shit is just too easy in classic, it just doesn't feel so good when you need max 2 attempts per boss.
---
Ask your shrink dude.  How can you not have an ounce of autonomy in your life that you can't decide what character to play in a video game?
---
Thanks never read this before
---
The best etiquette would probably be to offer to open it for whoever wins the roll. 
---
I had a rogue go up to a locked chest and just take it as a pull was finishing and /rolls were coming out. His logic was that none of us could open it anyways and then I linked my skeleton key and told him he was wrong. He kept the bag upgrade but left some mushrooms in the chest for "whoever wanted them".
---
If I have a key that will open the box on me, I always offer to unlock it for the roll winner. It just seems like a positive thing to do.
---
.. You don't need a VPN for starters. I play NA from EU with no masking or anything and never had an issue, aside from shop items occasionally getting assigned to my EU account instead of my US one (despite buying on the US site, for my NA account).
---
ive always played with rogues who just open the chest and let everyone roll
---
I have autoloot on. So I'm guessing I should turn it off for chests, open it and then leave it for whoever wins? (Genuine question, no sarcasm)
---
I agree completely. Thank you. Crown bumped me up a big amount of AP.
---
Also my ms hangs around 100? Never had an issue with it.
---
Incendius is pretty damn active. still sits at high population in the evenings. So do multiple other pvp servers. Faerlina is actually probably at the greatest risk of losing it's population since many of the streamers will move on at some point and their fans will go with them.
---
If you're trying to get a night elf mount, you can't really get one at 40 if you're not a night elf. Even if you did all their quests from level 1, you'd only be like halfway there at 40-45. Don't let videos from private servers fool you, they had BC (double) rep rewards. Cloth is the only way to get exalted, and you're only really going to be able to do that at 60. It kinda sucks, but that's how it is.
---
Grats! I do Patrol Security in Portland 60+ hours a week with a wife and daughter. Just hit 42 last night with my mount. I‚Äôve been binging on my nights off to compensate
---
In my groups, if we have a rogue and there is a locked chest, everyone rolls. The rogue unlocks it and the winner opens it. I thought that was pretty standard.
---
So far I've wanted 2 pieces of loot. Cookies stirring stick and the hat and acidic walkers you get in gnomer. 
---
 I had to run both dungeons twice to do this. Maybe lucky maybe not. I don't know since it's nothing like the purple stuff.
---
You all contributed to get to that chest and through the dungeon. With out the others in the group you wouldn't have gotten to that chest. You'd have to unlock it, but everyone rolls for the contents of that chest.
---
Lower rank spells are affected differently from +healing. At low +healing, max rank spells are more mana efficient. As you gain more +healing your lower rank spells become more efficient to cast in terms of healing/mana spent. With the low +healing you have in full your lower rank spells won't be as efficient as someone with higher +healing.
---
Pineapple on pizza is great and toons was said back in the day
---
you wouldn't be in that instance able to reach the chest if it weren't for the group you were with. it's a double edged sword in the sense that the entire group, including the rogue who can lockpick it, made an effort to get that far therefore the group should get to roll for it. my alt is a rogue and I go by the "everyone rolls" rule, myself. you can be a dick and keep it for yourself, but expect to be called out for it.
---
How about being parried by totems?
---
Asking the real questions.
---
Yep, there are quite a few. Freezing band and Edgmaster's to name a couple.
---
Pretty sure I heard the word toons much more than characters, but my main memories are honestly from BC and onward.
---
Even if its a locked chest its typically good etiquette to have everyone roll on it and have the rogue open it for the winner. You are all running the dungeon together - no need to get suddenly greedy over a random chest.
---
Also druids dont get free mounts - Pallys and Warlocks do.
---
TLDR but it sounds like u mad cuz u related to what I said. GOTTEM
---
I swear I have seen more cell phone photos of computer screens on this subreddit than any other PC game. It's kind of endearing though.
---
It‚Äôs annoying but if it means everyone else can go do something for a while I‚Äôll bite the bullet. Depends on if I‚Äôm cool with the people in the group though. Doing it without asking is rude.
---
At least when you zone out and get murdered by horde you don't suffer durability loss.
---
Supposedly Muhammed has one ready to go
---
Me and my wife play almost every night. I called my character a toon the other day and she looked at me like a murdered her mother. It was funny!
---
I mean.. Resident Evil 2 is 21 years old and just might win Game of the year this year

Work all day, play wow until I sleep. Since launch :,)

If the BoE is an improvement, I will definitely let someone need on it. But I want to see them equip it right away.

Alright then
---
Facts: 1) classic is a flawed game. 2) flaws make classic
---
I definitely remember it from MMOs before WoW were a thing
---
Bit overselling kill of the boss that keels over with 20 people with half a brain, but you do you.
---
Toon was a widely accepted tell back then. At least from my anecdotal knowledge.
---
It works for ferals
---
Generally in groups I've been in it usually goes. "Rouge can you unlock?" "Yes" " ok roll for chest" If you want to keep locked chest loot to yourself and don't want to be hassled about it then your best off lying and saying you can't open it and going back for it after the run.
---
There is nothing in the EULA that says multi boxing is cheating, and people have been doing it with no consequence for years now. All it takes is the resources to do it. I, myself, don‚Äôt multibox but its an accepted play style by Blizzard.
---
I mean, surely it‚Äôs only 8exp because that capped him at 60 and the excess was wasted?
---
Games can be challenging without needing to be complex
---
Classic wow is a grind and the journey is the challenge, and thats what people love about it.
---
Modern MMO try to make the game more challenging for the hardcore, but a simple game that is hard has more mass appeal than a complex game that is easy or hard
---
Which server?
---
&gt; you should not be taking hits
---
What if I'm melee-weaving while my pet tanks and having him pull a new mob when I melee to finish off the last? That will be at least a couple hits. 
---
Also, when you say "AP", ranged and melee are completely separate stats right? Something that just says "attack power" won't affect my ranged damage at all, will it? In that case, the only things I've seen that increase ranged are my hunter's mark and aspect of the hawk.
---
By that logic everyone should roll for every mine/herb and skinning node as well
---
I don't have time to read this, but I can tell you that if everything is working as it should there should be literally no difference between a trained pet and a tamed pet, once loyalty is at max.
---
Might want to add a section about rogues and locked chests. I‚Äôve run into far too many who think it‚Äôs outright theirs.
---
Did it too and lost 97 to 96 on t2 helmet.  My soul was crushed.
---
Thank you for the back up.
---
Imagine being this stupid.
---
grats now your poor
---
People have been saying toon for as long as i can remember. As much as I dislike it.
---
Herod is more populated than Faerlina. Herod has more veteran players than Faerlina. Herod won‚Äôt lose as many players as Faerlina when streamers move on as it has a smaller streamer fan base than Faerlina. Herod is the likely server that will stand tall if what you say comes to pass. 
---
With that said, I transferred off Herod. It was too crowded. Things will get worse if/when layering is turned off. I am in a medium pop server and am having more fun now. Perhaps it will die out one day. But if I had to pick between Herod and Faerlina, Herod is the clear winner.
---
Everyone knew what they signed up for on a mega server, everyone is should be used to the queues already and for those who aren't it will be the final push to change realms. This is not problematic because it's a self-imposed inconvenience. But the effective player population exploding by a factor of 2 when the final switch is hit while effectively being forced to play on a half-dead server for the entire period leading up to it? That's fucking nuts. The best solution is to cut layers asap even at the cost of queues so that the players get to play under the lasting conditions.
---
I agree with buddhist #2
---
Is there a way to have my characters online at the same time on the same computer? I.e. have my alt account stay in the auction house while I'm playing with my main account?
---
Have you tried a [target=mouseover] in place of the @hbtarget?
---
There's razorfen downs, uldaman and the big kahoona: zul farak.
---
If you make the group, then make the rules but typically in pugs it is /roll on chests and BoE blue+. 
---
Mages make consumables for the group and later can set portals, other classes have active or passive buffs, one of ours is we unlock stuff. Don't be a tool about it. 
---
Unless you are on an RP server, then you can be a greedy prick...in character.
---
I did this for mage to make robes if the archmage. As soon as they were made I dropped tailoring for engineering.
---
Can you be more specific; what do you consider broken about classic that you would like to see changed?
---
If your first thought is immediately distrusting anyone/everyone, you should be playing a single player game and not an MMO. You *generally* need to have the capacity to at least have some faith in your fellow players to not be shitty, unless given reason to.
---
I love how people keep repeating same shit in the comments like fucking NPCs.  
---
"They had 10 sec, that's enough to roll"  
---
"You should be ready to /roll"  
---
"Asmon did nothing wrong"
---
If it's a pug, than /roll on everything that would be an upgrade for you. If it's a consistent group then it varies. Here are a few of the common systems.
---
* Fixed point cost: Of those who want the item, the person with the most points wins and pays a set cost.
---
* Open bid: Gear is auctioned off for the points. Whoever bids the highest wins and pays that amount of points. Players can see each other‚Äôs bids.
---
* Closed Bid: Gear is auctioned off with buyers whispering their bids to the lead. Whoever bids the most wins and pays that amount of points. Players cannot see each other's bids.
---
* Fixed point percentage: Of those who want the item, the person with the most points wins and pays a set percentage of their points. Thus if you have more points, you can win more easily, but also will spend more on an item.
---
* Loot Council: A select group of people choose who gets what piece of gear.
---
Overall I would try to avoid loot council if possible. From what I have seen it tends to have the most loot drama and is often rife with abuse.
---
[This is personal favorite system](https://sites.google.com/site/leftoversworking/loot-and-points) it's variant Fixed Percentage cost with an added option for gear you only kind of wanted.
---
Armory and some stats were a part of BC, Achievements were a LK thing.
---
Sure, but no other item was rolled off this quickly. You come to expect a cadence when rolling off items, and if you generally have 30-60 seconds on all past items in the raid, you might not be trying to lightning roll on every item. It's not about whether or not they knew it was an upgrade, it was just that they weren't poised to roll since that's not how it had been on any other loot roll.
---
I didn't like people saying "toons" then, I don't like people saying it now...
---
But it was still said back in Vanilla.
---
Only one may rise
---
Yeah, hunter feign death makes them show up as dead to friendly players too. If they stay in feign death for the full duration then they actually do die, though.
---
Well I said inside, inside is a far cry from the entrance.
---
That's a Stormgrade Badge
---
Okay TIL I can open chests and leave them for others (I thought it worked like corpses where if I kill it only I can loot it) :) but shouldn't it also work for mobs which drop thick leather when skinned and also expensive herbs?

---
total clickbait. 'some raid members waited way too long to roll and rolled after the loot was given to someone'.
---
A couple of my casual friends left because apparently using Chrome Remote Desktop to get in queue a few hours before you get off work is too hard. 
---
Besides that I haven't noticed a difference.
---
When the succubus comes out of invisibility at nearly the same time my attack lands, the mob evades. I didn't use the succubus a ton back in vanilla, so it's possible that this was always a thing.  
---
That did not happen in vanilla and It is not on the blue post of not a bug
---
As a rogue myself, I have everyone roll for it, but I always take the moneys on the inside.  No one has said anything yet.
---
&gt; I play a Warlock and I tell the healers not to heal me unless I get below 50%
---
As a healer, it's our job to decide when to heal you. When shit is going bad and we have to focus on the tank then by all means, be conservative with life tap.
---
If things are running smoothly, then having one member running around on 50% health just complicates things. We either have to hit you with overhealing or an inefficient heal, or wait until you take more damage which is usually when we suddenly have to juggle healing you and others at the same time. Yeah, yeah, dps shouldn't take damage, etc. They do, sooner or later.
---
It's just much nicer for your healer to for you to drop below 50% (probably 40% health is the best time to heal my warlock friend without wasting hp) so they can throw a greater healing on you when it's convenient.
---
If a rogue doesn't want to unlock chests and share the contents, they are perfectly within their rights to do that. Unless someone is paying your sub fee you get to do whatever the hell you want.
---
At the same time, if the rest of the party wants to add said rogue to their shit lists and blacklist them from future party invites, they're also perfectly within their rights to do that.
---
If a player wants to be anti-social in a social game, that's their choice. But freedom of choice does not mean freedom from consequence.
---
If edgemasters dropped and there was a warrior in my group who didn‚Äôt have it, I‚Äôd say gratz to themü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
Locks don't default ownership to a rogue, honestly.  There are other ways to open locks. But normal etiquette among strangers would be to roll, but groups vary. Maybe the tank overreacted, noone here knows. But i can say that entitlement attitude toward any situation in game can always cause problems. You can fight for that chest, but anyone around to see might skip over you the next time they see you needing help. That is the beauty of classic. Your attitude and reputation stick with you. You have to figure out for yourself what is worth causing negativity over and deal with whatever come with that down the road.

Hmm.  Not my server so I can't comment.  Just hasn't been my experience so sucks to hear yours is kind of crappy
---
High five
---
I get what you're saying, but not everyone views it that way. Of course, I do think classic as its original state should exist. But right now WoW is in a weird state where there are two entirely opposite sides of the game, and not much to choose in between them.
---
I'm sure I'll still fall for it but I can at least expect it when I see I'm grouped with a hunter now
---
I was just thinking - they need an RPG that hides (or has no level system) your level, abilities everything. 
---
Then when one player approaches another player in game they have to guess and take a chance on trying to defeat them. That would make it so much more interesting.
---
You have to go in and add game time, not a subscription.  It's a different section.
---
Not if it doesn't sell. Hell, I made 10s this morning by bidding on silk that the bid was below vendor cost and vending it. I've gotten 3 silk bags below vendor cost too.
---
Nope. Typo, meant S.
---
I don't really understand this kind of power play tbh...gf and I were leveling in hillsbrad a few days ago and a high level alliance decided to follow us around and help us kill mobs for like a whole hour, I kept telling my gf to just ignore him and I'd get on my mage if he ganked us (I keep my 60 mage parked in whatever zone were in on our low lvls). He literally just helped us quest for an hour then just rode off. No emotes, no dancing, just following us and killing things we tapped. Never been so confused, he must've been extremely bored.
---
Agreed. It goes up against escape artist which is more directly useful against problem classes like hunters and mages.
---
Shadowmeld is decent, it has a lot of situational value particularly in world PvP. But eh, if you want to sit in stealth until you can gank someone in world PvP, or defend flags in BGs, you probably rolled the wrong class. It is great for Priests and Hunters to avoid being a focus target initially. But that has less value for a warrior in a group setting.
---
With that amount of healing power you can cast Chain Heal to heal more for less mana.
---
on the shop page you need to scrol down to game services like transfers and it should be there.  Listed as game time
---
Mages will blizzard anything these days.
---
People would counter with 2 things: 
---
1.	That works and is fine now, but in a year when the number of people leveling (and thus possible help you can get) is 1/10th it is now, are those quests still fun? Knowing that you‚Äôre artificially slowed because of something you can‚Äôt control.
---
2.	The opposite end, where you‚Äôre leveling your 6th character, are those quests still fun?
---
It ruins faction identity and brings us right back down to the slippery slope of chipping away at what makes Classic good.
---
Nope, i have never been killed by one but have kill a 1v2 multi boxer since they all unskilled ass hats
---
Maybe for psychopaths. Most people don't take pleasure in ruining someone else's experience for no reason.
---
...I don't think you thought very hard about this before posting it.
---
Let me simplify things for you: if I'm level 20, and one guy with a 5-box of level 20's rolls up on me, I will not win that fight. We're each one person. They've invested about as much time into the game as I have. Why do they get to be 5 times as powerful as me? Because they paid 5 times the sub fee that I did. Hence the "mom's credit card" comment.
---
Where?
---
Ok, but where, how?? Can u show me a link or somethi bf ? What options to what setting ?
---
Really depends entirely on what gear you have. Up through level 33, I tanked with sword and shield just because my 2h weapons weren't always up to snuff. Got my WW axe at 33, and Ravager at 36, and tanked with those two up until ~44-45, where I switched back to sword and shield. For higher level dungeons, starting around full BRD runs, you want to be sword and shield and most likely prot spec. I switched to prot at level 49, that was too early in my opinion. I'd stay arms until around level 55.
---
Hanging on a wall? 
---
Art.
---
Being pulled by a boat?
---
Skip.
---
I can attest that stone skin and strength of earth definitely works! Been doing lots of WeakAura stuff to know that at least. I'm thinking mana/heal Totes don't actually give an Aura, just an area that grants the recovery if you're within range. So you wouldn't really see a buff popup. Can't quite say for certain yet though, once we get our mana and heal Totes I'll mess with it and report back. I should get them by tonight!
---
Was there Reddit already?
---
Oh yes, but as horde this time around.
---
Yeah, cause he cant see who hes talking to.
---
&gt; wearing cloth/leather isn't really viable for pvp healing as a Shaman
---
Not really. Once you wear a shield that's where the most of your armor comes from.
---
You have a software to manage de 5 wow windows and to let you control each one at the same time ( keyboard not mouse) and then you spend hours to configurate your toons. You need a ton of binds like one to follow the main one to target the main's target ect ect. The most useful thing is the bind to interact combine with enabling click to move. You ca make all the toons walk to an npc and interact with it. Click to move is built in wow but nobody use it. Here he is just using arrow keys to move around.
---
He bought his epic mount with the gold, bragged about ninjaing the item on stream, and has still received no ban.
---
Holy crap inflation is insane in a new server! I got exalted on my Tauren warrior with org at 52 on a non fresh server for probably just a couple hundred gold. Congrats man it‚Äôs no easy feat
---
You‚Äôd be surprised how often it happens. You pretty much only hear the horror stories of selfish assholes here on reddit. People regularly pass truefaith patterns to priests with no idea they‚Äôll actually learn it and craft it. Same for mages with their pattern and many other things.
---
There‚Äôs also a massive difference in human greed for real world items and gold pieces in wow.
---
You need to learn to trust, or you‚Äôll have a horrible lonely time in this game.
---
Ahh &lt;Free Folk&gt; too bad about the old guild name :(
---
Group with friends with the same logic and increase your odds by at least 20%. Or just make groups that have that same thought process.
---
Shift is the default key to hold to disable autoloot if it is turned on.
---
Spanish Guitar.
---
When did I say it was a long time? Never. 
---
I said rolling doesn't take more than 2 seconds, and you should be ready either way.
---
If you want to go for implications, what I imply is - 14 is longer than 2, and is therefore plenty. Not long, but plenty. 
---
Please actually read comments before coming with your input. Thank you.
---
I read an old wowhead comment that said it didn't back in vanilla. There's an addon called MonkeySpeed that should show you if it does or not if you want to try it yourself.
---
This is true.  I‚Äôve just been vendoring basically everything, unless it‚Äôs a blue.  Just not worth the time to go back to town and auction or mail things between characters.
---
I‚Äòll share this one simple trick: when you enter the building, you can stand in the left bsck corner of it snd basicslly kill whoever you want without aggroing the bruisers.

---
For common/ low level enchants, you will be working for tips. For rare and high end enchants, you should charge a crafting fee, like all other professions. The fee should be proportionate with the cost and rarity of the enchantment, usually somewhere around 10-20% of the cost of materials.  For example, Enchant Weapon:Crusader is a desired and rare enchantment; usually only one or two people will have it and be logged in at the same time. The materials cost (from back in the day; current costs may vary) are about 120g. At 20%, you would charge 24g to enchant. It being a high-demand and ultra rare enchantment would allow you to charge more, of course; probably up to 70g, with their materials.

Only people that can‚Äôt spell ‚Äúcharacter‚Äù use the term ‚Äútoon‚Äù, change my mind
---
A little incomplete here. The amount of hit you will need for raiding depends on your weapon skill. With 305 (orc with axe or human with swords f.e.) you only need 6%
---
Oh when the healer told the tank to pull more because he wasn't pulling enough, he literally pulled the entire graveyard out of spite to kill us all. He was a dick
---
I've never seen a miner dig a node and then let the group as a whole roll, personally I think the same logic should apply but many don't.
---
Ran a loot council for years and our guild never even came close to gearing out the council. Doesn't benefit the raid as a whole so we made sure everyone was getting loot fairly. We also had a log so if there were shenanigans going on , the rest of the raid could see it.
---
Just because you had a bad experience with it , doesn't mean it doesn't work.
---
Pretty much I picked Normal. Sorry OP perils of that pvp life. Need find something break MC.

Consider using a healing addon like vuhdo which will provide information about incoming heals. It will tell you when someone else is casting a heal on another person and the amount they will be overhealed. Typically if you‚Äôre in a group with multiple healers, most use their most efficient lower ranked heal on the group and sometimes the tank(when damage isn‚Äôt too high which is when they‚Äôd use max rank).
---
How's leaving undercity treating you?
---
Yeah exactly.  They've never had to take a screenshot and upload it to a website because everything they've ever put online came from a phone and was selected from the camera roll.

baha
---
I'm pretty fluid between terms, occasionally I use "toon" but I can't say where or when I picked it up. Hell, at he moment I can't figure out what "toon" means other than talking on characters. Might be having a brainfart though lol
---
Just report them. The GM's will take care of it.

---
It was fast looted 100%,pretty obvious, all his other MLs took x2 x3 the time, either for drama content or just to please his friend. Its his guild at the end of the day, he raids without voice coms and still without loot council. No one is forced to be there, if they dont like how he does things , it just takes 2 seconds to gquit
---
Yeah, pretty much this. After that you just got gold instead of getting XP, right?
---
You know those people who beat their children because they were beaten by their parents? Same thing. Some people get killed by high level players while leveling and then feel like it's not only justified but their duty and right to be on the other end of that once they get to higher levels. I'd bet an interesting research project could be done on it.
---
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs really bannable.  Tickets can be slow sometimes.  I know people have items removed from stuff like this though.  Either way I wouldn‚Äôt really care.  Not much different from just losing the roll legitimately.
---
You have 4 posts in this thread. Why are you do mad

already have just annoying is all dudes killed about 4 people doing it
---
RFD at 38/40, ZF at 45, Maraudon at 48, Sunken Temple at 50, BRD at 52(56 for full clear), LBRS and beyond at 58.
---
14 seconds, waow.. when he takes forever to do anything... didn't it take like 3 minutes for him to even open the loot window?
---
If you are 30 levels higher they won‚Äôt be able to sheep you. Still we will have our trinket soon enough :)
---
Most of them are gearing to 'play the game'. That includes questing, and farming stuff, and all aspects of the game.  
---
Healers need raid consumables to, generally this means going out in the world and killing things; either for gold or for the items themselves. It's already slower if they are heal spec because their spells do a lot less damage, what you are saying here is that it should be slower even more because they aren't allowed access to any gear that improves their ability to play the part of the game they actually spend most of the time doing.
---
I understand the entitlement, it's been around as long as WoW has. It's just sad that it's back in such force.
---
Greater Heal is neat if you're the designated MT healer, otherwise expect to be using a lot of Heal Rank 4
---
Everybody right now has dreams don‚Äôt they guys?  I‚Äôm really not into dreams anymore, I‚Äôm into fucking nightmares... You gotta end somebody‚Äôs dream, you gotta take their jobs, you gotta take their heart
---
-Jon Gruden
---
Lots of good points,  but there's one thing I slightly disagree with:
---
&gt;Be aware of your tank‚Äôs position and make sure you‚Äôre not out of LoS. Even very small barriers will prevent you from healing.
---
This one is backwards. It's the tanks job to stay in line of sight to the healer. Should still be the PSA to healers about small barriers though.
---
Another thing, but this isn't something that fits into a post like this because it's a more advanced trick, just thought I'd post it.
---
&gt;Try not to have a HoT on the tank when they are pulling multiple mobs. From a practical standpoint, this is the healer version of opening with blizzard as it pulls threat from everything the tank has not yet gotten threat on. The best practice is to open up with a big heal for the tank. It gives them enough time to build threat on the targets and is also typically the most mana efficient.
---
 If you HoT up the tank then you stay out of combat, you're not pulling any threat. If the HoT falls off the tank before you enter combat, the threat dissapears. If you enter combat all the threat gets applied to you though. So basically, HoT the tank and don't heal him at all before you have to so you don't grab any aggro, and the HoTs will have done more good than harm.
---
This requires knowledge of how combat pulses works to avoid you accidently entering combat though. But the short version of that is, do not go too close to any mobs or players in combat.
---
Whining on reddit =/= the majorities game experience.
---
There are a few bugs here and there, but for the most part the issues haven't affected general playerbase near as much as reddit would have you think.
---
People wouldn't be getting readdicted(or sucked in for the first time) if it wasn't close at all.  And it's not nostalgia, leveling in vanilla/classic is just a fun game.
---
One out of four stuns isn't to be relied upon.  WotF will help you beat priests and other warlocks. And can be a rude surprise to an intimidating shout warrior.
---
DKP systems can also result in something like this if no one else wants to do a 8/8 t1 shaman's job
---
That's just my stance on this. Obviously my opinion is only relevant to the people who understand it. You don't need my respect that's up to you. Using "Nobody" is a fallacious argument of ad hominem. "Attack the person not the concept"
---
Yeah toons was a term even as a non wow player i knew was popular in wow. Every other mmo i have played it was called "characters" and as such thats what ill call it here.
---
Right next to the Greymane Wall all the way south in Silverpine
---
We need to be friends.
---
If something says AP, it affects both. If something says Ranged AP, it only affects ranged. I'm not aware of any items or abilities that would only affect melee AP.
---
Jealous much?
---
I ran my first UBRS as a Holy Priest and had a lot of trouble with healing threat. I was downranking spells and primarily used Heal (Rank 3). Almost immediately after casting one heal, the mob would aggro off of the tank and on to me. I was even careful to wait a few seconds before casting. What am I doing wrong?
---
Can assure you the transferred-to servers are incredibly alliance heavy.  Horde literally can never pick a fight or they get camped forever.  Boring..  was honestly more fun fighting 1v3..
---
Nice the keybinds make sense!
---
To be fair, you state pretty directly in your post that you don't like killing the opposite faction, and even wish you could group up with them. Sounds like they understood fine. PvE servers exist for people not wishing to participate in world PvP, that's all they were trying to say.
---
is this an american thing? is there actually danger for you guys when not using a VPN?
---
And if you've got the bag space for it, also swap in alternate gloves and boots for that sweet sweet extra speed.
---
What happens when your tank would rather do something else rather then run the 23rd guildie through his 147th Strat live run?
---
imo, capitalism is what most guilds do, and it results in a distribution curve, not a hard drop-off outside the loot council  
---
All capitalism means in this case, is tit-for tat among the participants
---
I'll pin this right next to the idea of dumping ice cubes in the ocean to stop hurricanes.
---
I'm not sure on that one. I've not tested it. But generally if your macros relate only to the class you're playing on (most will), then you'd want them in the character-specific category. It's odd though. The character specific macro page has a scroll bar, but its greyed out.
---
Haven't noticed any differences on Incendius. No more queues but still high population and there's plenty of people from both factions all over the place.
---
Shamans as well.
---
Why do the mods suck at keeping the shit out of the subreddit? So much shitty meme pics with no content. There is no content here anymore and no one gives a shit.
---
I could've sworn there was something like this back in the day. I'll have to go back and check, but IIRC you could could tell it what to sort by and it would do so accordingly. Will update when/if I find it and/or its equivalent.
---
These posts are making me happy
---
It took me about 20 levels to realize I‚Äôve been using my rank 1 spells
---
Got ya. Def use a password manager in my phone and have them saved on the sites I do frequent on PC. My PC is gaming and work. I only really do browsing when I‚Äôm in a situation that I‚Äôm not around my pc oddly enough. Should login to Reddit on my PC for something to look at during long flight paths.

Nah, Thug Shirt. Rogue starting shirt.

I'm a 51 Warrior, who is looking to get the 2h Axe from Mauradon to replace WW Axe. This is my first time playing WoW, so i dont know dungeons and am very much still learning the game. Due to these reasons, i havent ran many dungeons or even tried looking for a group.
---
If y'all are ok with a semi noob, i'd like to trial the guild.

Maybe Putin will solve the problem, [for his interest.](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2019-09-29/climate-change-russia-s-oil-and-gas-heartlands-are-under-threat)
---
Might give it a try, went to the discord and people seem really nice so. :)
---
Don't worry, some guilds have "loot council" so you just don't get gear unless you're one of their butt buddies, so get used to it! Classic is basically how the wealthy elite act in real life and why I quit the original version. The only reason i'm playing classic is because retail has the same nonsense (needing the best guild to have good gear) and RNG and artifact gear that ruins alts and no pvp vendors, hooray!
---
and the party wouldn't be able to unlock the chest without the rogue.
---
Not now in classic, but in actual vanilla.  I was in a guild that got server first rag kill and killed him every week after. I got rank 14 before I got bloodfang pants.  
---
PS - they dropped the last week I played wow, I was in the raid but got disconnected and had the 'that character already exists' bug.
---
They were DE'd.
---
Why were you not naked tho :(
---
I'll look into it. I'll use your sheet as a starting point, and post what I come up with here.
---
Got completely roasted by everyone in the badlands when I asked for help completing this quest:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=739/murdaloc
---
This level 40 quest has a 2H mace reward that you can use at level 30, allowing you to plow through your 30's as a Paladin.
---
"Why are you in the Badlands at 30?"
---
"He doesn't know how to play"
---
"Come back when you're leveled"
---
On and on.
---
Multiple people killing the quest mobs. Ask for invite and they just mock me.
---
Shit has been wack as fuck. 
---
Hope this shit comes back on these dickheads as the servers mature and people continue to cap.
---
Helped a random level 25 pally do his SFK quest the other day just to help combat this 'fuck you' attitude that has seemingly carried over from retail's hookup culture.

Or you know go to wowhead and search for yourself. Click oldest first in the comments section
---
You are mistaken.
---
I bought my own mount... Was that an argument? Druids have a very difficult time in this game being that it is worse than all the other classes at any role. It's literally a meme class.
---
All gear in wow is "free" if you think about it.
---
I‚Äôm Alliance on Mankrik too. You‚Äôll have to let me know if you find a good LGBTQ+ friendly guild. I‚Äôve had some issues so far with this too and have gone guildless for a bit. My character is a 45 Holy Pally, so if you‚Äôre looking for someone to level / dungeon with let me know!
---
It wasn't a beta. It was free marketing.
---
Well this was before TBC and arena was the beginning of homogenizing classes which helped ruin the game... so arena players can keep their stupid term.
---
What exactly do you gain each level? I see that when I level i get a talent point, an increase to cap of weapon skill, 1 or 2 points in some stats, and an increase in "beast mastery /survival/ marksman skill" by 5 points each time.
---
But what does this really translate to? Does 5 points in beast mastery actually affect my damage? Does a level 48 actually do any noticeable difference from a level 47 as opposed to the 2 agility points he got from leveling?
---
"Simple trick". Not funny at all when you actually trying to be dedicated and get the pattern yourself \_TO USE\_, by clicking your macros as a living human being without any cheats. That corner is a exploit and should be considered as one. And people still attack...
---
Compare to a hunter that can kill elites 10+ levels above it.
---
Im going to have to investigate this
---
Not necessarily, I had this experience in my early 20s and we are still incredibly good friends to this day, it was a little weird for a while but once we both had other couples and knew we had moved on all weirdness was gone.
---
nope, but it keeps people from running over top of them and triggering a pile of bugs.
---
Then you just die of pure bewilderment
---
Tanking gnomer is like herding cats
---
Is this on Kurinnaxx?
---
What is with you and thinking this far in people don't have keys? 1 person in the party needs the key. That is it. I have all keys, yet I have not been in a party since week 1 were someone else didn't have the key. That counters 1-3 and again druids are healers and that counters 4.
---
this used to annoy me too until someone pointed out that a lot of people use reddit on their phones, so a mobile upload is quicker and more accessible
---
which I guess I can understand, but it still bothers me all the same haha
---
Pretty sure toon came from that really early disney MMO where your characters were called toons, like short for cartoons.
---
As a rogue main this is what I do, for courtesy.  I guess I could be a dick and be like "you wouldn't be able to get this anyway" but it my opinion taking a rogue to a dungeon that can open chests is part of the trade like mages and water. Imagine a mage not wanting to make water for the healer?
---
Pronouns: Zug/zug
---
Troll - Rogue
---
Orc - War
---
Tauren - Shaman
---
Undead - Priest
---
Dwarf - Hunter
---
Human - Paladin
---
Nelf - Druid
---
Like that?
---
There's no difference. You'll have the same total training points no matter what. The stats of two pets of the same type at the same level will be identical outside of attack speed but the overall dps will be the same regardless.
---
I did it up to level 26 then switched to arms when I got a nice 2h sword.  My thought was I was new to the game and wanted to learn tanking.
---
Yes, it's a lot slower and not worth it I eventually realized.  I still don't want to fight 3 mobs my level, but one or two are usually no problem.
---
It's good courtesy to roll on herbs and mining nodes. Skinning is rarely rolled because of how much opportunity you get to skin things (unless we're talikng devilsaur or onyxia), but feel free to establish skinning rules with your party before the run.
---
&gt;As a healer, it's our job to decide when to heal you. When shit is going bad and we have to focus on the tank then by all means, be conservative with life tap.
---
That's exactly what I'm talking about. I'm NEVER going to lifetap my health down below 50%, however I'm going to be lifetapping every single time I hit 100% health. I don't expect or even want the healer to heal me. I DON'T need a heal. My health will regen. I can use a skill that recovers health. I can use a health stone, hell I can even pop a health potion if I feel like it or throw a bandage on myself. I do this ALL THE TIME when I'm not an instance, nothing has changed just because I'm in an instance with a dedicated healer.
---
Now if you the healer just can't stand for me to be below 100% health and want to top me off, then that's on you, but don't expect me NOT to use lifetap and also don't expect me to lifetap myself up to 100% mana after every pull, I don't need to do that, my mana regens in between pulls and my life regens as well, just hitting lifetap from time to time and then occasionally stopping to take a drink when the Mage is works just fine.
---
Yeah man, it was so bs. I wasnt happy
---
Oh I teamed up with an alliance last night killing all the afk bots doing exactly that. I'd rather Blizzard do something about it though.
---
I use Azeroth Auto Pilot and it‚Äôs not to bad
---
That is part of my point. All we can do is tell you etiquette going forward but weren't there to actually see it. Everyone who was there knows who the dick was and after a while they'll see negative consequences for their actions. If you feel strongly it wasn't you, then no worries.
---
lol that last sentence was nice
---
Typically Ony is done with guild runs who pick up others.
---
So they have their reputation on the line. They might reserve the head or only allow melee/tanks to roll on it, or reserve Bop stuff, but they'll declare that at the beginning.
---
You either play along or make your own group
---
dont remind me... ATM im only leveling my VW's skills because thats all I use.
---
I did this in original vanilla. Didn‚Äôt learn until about level 30.
---
thats just readers being mad that they don't understand it (IE why you format it so people can intuitively understand it)
---
Love biggles
---
You have programs that map your key to each client at the same time. This is not against the rules because if I press the "1" button, all it's doing is pressing "1" on each client. One input to one action.  There are some addons out there to help out with managing it all, and the rest is just done through in-game macros pretty much.  
---
[This is what my screen looks like when I do it](https://i.imgur.com/uYukIYO.png)  
---
The program automatically mutes every client besides the current one I'm playing and I have hotkeys to switch which screen I'm actively playing. This is all done through Windows rather than the game, so it's fine.
---
The EMA addon lets you set up teams of a master and the rest slaves, and whichever screen you're currently playing gets automatically promoted to party leader, which then becomes the master. When I walk up to attack something, I can press 1 to cast Smite or something on the master and the slaves will /assist the master client and press 1 as well.
---
Anyway, there's a lot that goes on behind it all but it's not against the rules because everything is done through addons or the in-game macro system. It'd be the same as if you were just auto following your raid leader and all your abilities were /assist Partyleader then cast the ability. People complain because they see a multiboxer and think "one person" versus "one person" rather than "one character" versus "five characters". Treat a multiboxer as 5 different players and you'll find they're at a disadvantage when it comes to even fights.
---
I've been using Guidelime with Bustea's 1-60 horde guide, seems pretty good so far tho I've only been to L33 with it.
---
Different strokes for different folks I guess. I've only ever done dungeons with one group and they've always offered the chest. Nobody rolls for the tank's mining nodes or the healer's skins either though
---
Good luck figuring out who is jist spamming a macro watching tv and who is scripting
---
Something has gotten lost here. I was responding to "The priority should be to DPS first."
---
The concept of "priority" is basically the same as "reserved", because it makes someone who could use an upgrade ineligible.  
---
Guild runs are a little different, because often there is a plan to get a specific person a specific item for progression; but those are generally more planned, friendly and there will be reciprocation with other runs happening.  
---
In PuGs if it's an upgrade, you should be permitted a chance at it.
---
These arguments on many different topics are why we have BfA, Blizzard responding to people whining on the forums.
---
Um, wouldn‚Äôt 5 people thinking and reacting independently from one another farm better than 5 characters limited to what one person can do at a time?
---
As long as it‚Äôs not botting, fine. I don‚Äôt like multi boxing, it‚Äôs a practice that ruined me playing a Cleric and Sorcerer in DAOC, but I just don‚Äôt see how it is detrimental to this game. At least not in any way that can‚Äôt be countered or that has any lasting effect.
---
A majority of the people here crying about it is due to financial or technical requirements that they themselves can‚Äôt muster, so they couldn‚Äôt even if they wanted to. Money will always give an advantage, period. Better computer, better equipment, more accounts. As a result jealousy will rear its ugly head.
---
If a multiboxer is ruining your playing experience by killing you then get some friends, even temporarily recruited friends, and corpse camp the shit out of them.
---
I don't need a dps chart to know that the boomkin was at the bottom.
---
2h windfury crit are the best
---
What‚Äôs the minimum lp level requirement for Angor? I see some conflicting info.
---
Yeah, mon! For the Horde!!!
---
I don't think you know what that word means
---
Quick tip, don‚Äôt upgrade drain soul and only use the rank 1 to save mana since you only use it when the target‚Äôs nearly dead and it does no damage even in higher ranks.
---
Sounds like a good way to get booted from the group immediately
---
Give him some slack. OP was clearly not in the front when brain cells were dealt out
---
Layering is the most retarded game feature blizzard has ever come up with
---
man i know dd/mm/yy date formats make so much more sense but it still hurts my brain to read them as such
---
XD was part of that. Great seeing it here
---
What is with you and assuming everyone does? I literally just got my UBRS key yesterday and have only managed to get 1 group for it since launch. I have the other keys too, but do you now understand the majority of players still aren't even 60 yet? They're not just going to start immediately tanking UBRS in low level blues and random greens and expect to down Rend reliably and frequently for those shoulders. Thinking otherwise is stupidly elitist and naive.
---
I'm along for the ride. Just hope when time comes it's not too bad.
---
This is fucking dumb. Clearly whoever was the leader should have realised that they needed a tank, and inviting people without figuring out the key roles would only lead to failure. Don't make people do shit they don't want to do. Even if they have to leave group because they don't want to tank, it's not their fault
---
A lot of naysayers here. I don't know what is realistic but I'd say don't set a level goal. I'd set a goal on what you want to get out of the experience itself, say something like "I want to come out of this weekend feeling like I got the most out of leveling that I could". That way you'll feel less pressured and good in the end, instead if possibly falling short of your goal and feeling disappointed.
---
Your system is not the traditional one my dude. Needing on boe epics was the only way we did things back in the day, at least on my server. Never heard of anyone doing it your way until classic rolled around.
---
I think the most impressive thing of all of this is that you got to level 22 with rank 1 shadow bolt! HOW HAVE YOU BEEN DOING DAMAGE!?!?
---
probably the same way i do. some dots, then wiggle my wand till they die.
---
You should Fade. Your tanks and dps should also be more alert and cc/pull mobs off of you.
---
A good rogue will see something running at the healer and immediately stun it/blast it with damage and then pop evasion to keep the mob off of you. That same rogue is going to catch a lot of shit from the clueless party for splitting dps/pulling aggro, though.  Replace rogue with any other dps in this example for a similar story. Alert hunters will trap/pet tank mobs off of you.
---
Stop using words you don't understand.
---
I would swap Orc and Tauren
---
I bind my side buttons to alt and shift to use as modifiers for keybinds.
---
You just have a poor imagination.
---
&gt;From my knowledge if I'm invited to a group while the person is in the same zone, I will stay in the same layer? 
---
If the person who invited you is in the same layer as you, you'll remain in the same layer. If the person who invited you is in a different layer, you'll move to their layer.
---
&gt;If I join a group to do ulduman, will I exit in a different layer?
---
See above. It all depends on whether the person who invited you was on the same layer as you.
---
&gt;And finally if I log out, and back in, will I stay in the same layer or be randomly put into one?
---
You risk being put into a new layer when you relog.
---
Just curious do you think every single frost mage is just mentally retarded or what?
---
When they say warrior LFG SM, it should be obvious that they're picked up to tank unless stated otherwise
---
Thanks, 
---
I don't understand how greeding an item that someone else needs and will immediately equip, makes me greedy, but needing the same item makes me "respectful of other players".
---
guess I'm just old.
---
NO CHANGES!!!!!!!!
---
Naw bro you only roll against your class usually and if you're late to 60 most people will already have a lot of T1. I did 1 MC trash run and got my bracers. The harder part is getting your pre-raid  gear in dungeons in my opinion. It's all fun though so don't worry if it takes a while to get decked out.
---
But its only accepted because they get more money. Its still cheating since the games designed around playing 1 character. If it was really 'not cheating' you would be allowed to do it from one account.
---
Look at the difference in UI and keybinds too haha the playerbase has come so far
---
We need more influencers in this world.
---
If you follow/watch one don't forget that you add a number to their weight when comes time to use arguments by popularity. Known as a fallacious argument as it makes people think the more popular you are the more valid your opinion is. This being wrong since that would make the most popular person in the world always correct which is very bad.  Can you imagine not being able to challenge one's opinion because they are more popular? That's tyrany
---
Hanging off a ledge?
---
Cliff.
---
You're never going to get more than 50 results from a /who and that 8d too small of a number to determine anything.
---
They're mostly not cheating, just sitting there hammering away at their own macro, and any time they spend responding to you is time they might lose the next recipe spawn so yeah, they're going to ignore you.
---
So let‚Äôs see... you were abusing mechanics to grieve people in Gadgetzan. Somebody then reported you and you got punished. Now, since you can‚Äôt play wow, you‚Äôre on reddit trying to get people to side with somebody who is abusing mechanics to grieve people...
---
Bold move Cotten, let‚Äôs see how it plays out.
---
Let's walk through this.  I can tell you have an emotional attachment to your argument here in this thread, but you have to be able to let it go.  If you are at the AH and you want to go to the mailbox, you think "that is about 30 yards, I wonder if it is more efficient to mount or walk?"
---
The distance is given, and you want to figure out which method is faster.  Nobody said anything about speed.  It is absolutely intuitive to think about different amount of time to travel a fixed distance and we do it every day.  We even substitute time for distance, e.g. "that city is a 2 hours drive away."
---
If I want to travel across the country, I could drive or fly.  I don't compare the maximum distance of each travel method for a given travel time, I compare the travel times for the different methods.
---
724 comments, you're literally the only one. Just letting it ride at this point haha

But there's a hole in my bucket

Bigglesworth Boys represent!
---
&gt; Well all I have to say after reading this discussion is that /u/Rofo is going to forget to spell out the loot rules one run with some pugs, a BoE epic will drop, and he will get ninja'd. 
---
That's on me, I'm not so greedy that I'm going to come here and cry about it.
---
I posted the whole macro in another answer below.
---
1-20 has been pretty great for me. Buy a good green weapon every few levels. I've been enjoying a lot w/ a 1H+shield, arms spec.
---
Where exactly is this happening, you know definitely so I can avoid MCing people there
---
Charge on 1. Makes my head hurt.
---
You make lots of assumptions. Each loot system has it's ups and downs. None of them are inherently better than the others. It just comes down to the people involved. I've run DKP in EQ for the last few years and it worked great, and that's with just as much loot in 72man raids so it's even more scarce , and more powerful, than wow loot.
---
Ayeeee you know we dem boys, I knew I'd find at least one of you in this thread lol
---
Tysm!!
---
I get it though.
---
We want our monster races to look more human to show off gear better...but then that makes them not monsters.
---
Best compromise is going female, where at least shoulders fit properly.
---
The guys that have been doing it on pservers won't be challenged by any content really, but even with the improved talents, I think BWL will provide some challenge to most guilds. AQ40 and Naxx will definitely be challenging to a majority of players.
---
Most spells (think fire ball) have a range of 30 game units by default. The tool tips then show that as 30 yards (30 meters in EU), although it doesn't necessarily line up.
---
I did no thunderbluff quests so I was just barely into honored when I started farming gold to buy cloth. I also bought cloth at a higher price then other people were paying because I wanted to be the first person on my server to get a diff faction epic mount.
---
Skullflame is actually pretty good, there are some dickheads but every human demographic has dickheads. Also conveniently the majority seem to be stuck at like level 40 so we don't see them at 60,most people running dungeons and raids are chill.
---
Layering is the concept that makes cheaters better at the game than fair players. Change my mind.
---
Yep, it does everything that global ignore list + spy does, and you can use it to make nicelists as well. Surprised it's not more popular.
---
This has been brought up before, and I agree with part of this: they should fix it. No changes are fine but obviously exploits should be addressed. That still lives within the spirit of no changes, it basically just takes away a thing for players to abuse and doesn't waste the time of GMs having to verify it. I'm in the no changes camp myself but this just makes sense no matter how you look at it.
---
I did have a quick look at Blacksmithing as my other half's warrior is a Smith. I think the list came out shorter than the Engineering one and almost none were able to make any profit. It really was pretty depressing. Smithing uses too many materials for my system to work properly, sadly.
---
Have you seen the garbage that's inside of chests?  Cheese, water, and a green.  That's the hill you want to die on?

I'm already using details for a threat meter, no need to run recount.

I'm fairly restricted on time and I dinged 46 last night. First time wow player and I'm sitting at 7ish /played. 
---
It's not great by any means but I feel middle of the pack.
---
Of course the is the dismount lag as well before you can activate abilities, which you do not get if you do not mount, so you can add about 10 yards to either mount for that.  
---
After dismounting either manually or through addon, you still have a short period of time when you can't cast, this factors into my decision to mount or not.
---
Never done it and dont plan on it lmao I just think it's hilarious how stupid the current situation is. 
---
I knew when I signed up for pvp servers there will be griefers who tbag  and do stupid shit. Let them it's ever more glorious when you tbag them back.
---
Very true. I was even thinking that the goblin room is still relatively nasty. The boat mostly depends on if groups are pulling packs back properly or not, but at least there is the wheel to reset aggro is necessary.
---
I took one that said I had an IQ of 169, but told my friends it was 72 :(
---
Shhh Incendius is the best server stop giving out the secrets.
---
This is great! A small suggestion, you can format the currency as a whole number (rather than a fraction) using a custom number formatter. For the spreadsheet I maintain for my crafting needs, I use the format string `##0"g"00"s"00"c"`. It's not perfect, but it looks like [this](https://imgur.com/x3hmpYh).

Fuck up pussy ass blizzard pawn snitch. Supporting rules from the same company that ruined the game u love. Fucking slave

Seems like you are contacting everyone but the company that can actually offer you assistance
---
This is new to me aswell, 40 hunter here. Thanks for saving me the walk of shame to my corpse!
---
Also it shares your list with people you choose or guild and doesnt put the person on ignore
---
There are only a few times when you should be moving around as much as a tank.
---
1. Facing the boss away from your group.
---
2. Chasing after any mobs or bosses that you lost aggro on.
---
3. Specific fights where you need to move the boss into a specific area.
---
Mobs rarely get confused and unless you are avoiding a swing timer hit your virtually never gonna mitigate damage by running.
---
You can occasionally kite an enemy if you've got mages or someone else to cc them as you run.
---
But 90% of the time you're staying in one place.
---
Everyone talking about loving BRD but ST was my favorite dungeon from vanilla. I remember my first time running it taking a full day clearing all the floors, replacing party members that couldn‚Äôt take the trek and gene they remastered the dungeon for retail I was so disappointed. I‚Äôm currently level 39 and can‚Äôt wait to go back!
---
Hmmm.. or was he?!
---
well we usually rolled for mines and herbs, or took turns, all boils down on the player base
---
Hey, you're on Firemaw EU?
---
The fact gladiator chain dropped and no one can even use it...
---
I really need to start playing classic WoW.
---
Pretty similar situation where I work and live. Still, my commute is about 80 minutes and it's affordable again. There are people who make less and travel farther. It sucks but that's modern reality until we figure out how to get two million people in and out of a 5x5 block area every day in less than ten minutes or people stop building their businesses in the fucking center of giant cities and put them elsewhere.
---
5 less health #nochanges!!
---
This is what makes Classic awesome.
---
I mean, initially, yes. but ultimately no, if I was just handed a full T1 set I would think it awesome at first then just be like "cool...this is just given to me with no effort" and it would just be like meh whatever. But I most certainly wouldn't be showing that off to strangers and the world as a gloating point LOL
---
Have you tried creating a new 19th macro?
---
Both of you are way off. No need to speak up for some salty bittervet whose getting mad because I'm not playing like he thinks I should. 
---
I think getting ganked is fun, even if I get effortlessly wiped out. If I run in to a gank that's going on against a horde buddy I always hop in. If I get ganked by dudes who are way overleveled and/or teaming I try to escalate the action by batphoning guildies. There's nothing at all in my post that makes it sound like I don't wanna/shouldn't be on a PvP server.
---
Why is the best salt always from pvp fratboys trying to police gameplay.
---
This is annoying but calling this an exploit would imply that this person extract benefits from doing this. Apart from the pure joy of making people angry I'm not sure what he gets.
---
Increasing weapon skill allows you to do full damage to higher level enemies, and decreases the chance you will miss or get parried.
---
Defense makes you able to take hits from higher level enemies.
---
You get a 5 skill cap increase for each level.
---
As far as I know, the skill points you get to BM/ Surv/ Marks don't actually mean anything. Only the weapon skill and defense matters.
---
Going from an odd level to an even level is a small powerspike because you can train new ranks of skills at even levels.
---
Your"talent tree" skills are a leftover from the alpha/beta vesion of WoW and mean nothing. Your Weapon and Defense skills translate to ~0.6% hit, crit, dodge, miss, parry each, making you slightly more damaging and considerably more defensive; this is in reference to a fixed level mob, say you at 40 and 41 vs a mob at 39.
---
You at 40 fighting a level 41 mob are going to be ~10% weaker than you at 41 fighting the same mob; depending on your class and gear.
---
There is Rag and Onyxia, no? Seems like plenty to start with.
---
I see this every other PUG.
---
Sometimes I switch to DPS... "No, no, continue governor."

How much was the tip
---
My orginal mob plus one are back and we are having a blast. 
---
Good times
---
It is absolutely not. The problem you face ingame is the following:
---
Something is x yards away, what will get me there the fastest.
---
It is not: Something is x seconds away with the mount, x-2 seconds away with travel from,..., how far is it away?
---
It's a self correcting system, and becoming uninhabitable to humans is it's correcting.
---
 - PvP servers have towns with guards. Abusing game mechanics to essentially remove those guards is still wrong even on a PvP realm.     
---
 - Even if they eventually "fix" the problem, in the interim the current solution (suspend/warn people) is fine.     
---
 - Hopefully they'll give guards guns with a 42 yard range.
---
The thing is it's not reportable for the griefing, it's reportable because you're evading the guards.
---
Get up high like this any where else and the GM's don't care. So it's not exactly a pvp thing.
---
Apparently companies use cookies and your ISP to custom charge you depending on certain factors like how much you spend and what not. Among other reasons like privacy and security.

Is that a carbon neutral mount?

I finally got my first piece of Felheart after 4 runs last night.
---
Just doing what you did.
---
There is a difference between people that want to kill every person of the opposite faction and those that just want the extra bit of fear as they level.
---
What does that have to do with you.
---
Yeah it's absolutely not going to get you millions of gold in a short space of time but it honestly has worked for me so I think it can help others too. It's very much a 'sweat shop' method. Lots of the same product at low profit.
---
Good for you guys! Fuck the private server elitists. Enjoy yourself!
---
Hold on, I don't understand.
---
Shadow: "This BoE epic is an upgrade for me. I'll wear it right away."
---
Group: "No, that's inappropriate. We need to talk about it first."
---
What's there to talk about? Unless it's a bigger upgrade for someone else, I don't see what the problem is.
---
Stopcast doesnt work on wand you need stopattack instead because wand is weapon not a spell
---
americas fucked
---
This a world of Warcraft  sub bro get that generational bullshit out of here.
---
Gonna go with rogue for that total tbh
---
except i have personally seen it from bother anger and the last boss so..... you're wrong
---
JW who is that?
---
Enough of a majority means assuming otherwise is a waste of everyone's time.
---
or this other definition  a software tool designed to take advantage of a flaw in a computer system, typically for malicious purposes (pvp server btw but considered malicious as if you fight back guards attack you not them)
---
Don't auto cast growl.. also claw is a much better focus dump and the difference between bite+claw is negligible.
---
You misinterpreted my comment then lol
---
It's not too bad. As a returning player, there are a couple of instances that I don't remember very well (Uldaman for example) and even as a tank, it could be a lot worse. 
---
Generally, you can use the minimap for navigation, though places like WC make that useless. Most important mobs are casters and if you aren't comfortable without some prior knowledge a lot of sites have guides for all the dungeons now. Just getting into a group as a DPS (or healer if druid) for the first run to get used to it is pretty good. Even if you can't, if you tell the group they  are usually okay with helping keep you on track.
---
I've camped this vendor quite a bit. **Use the scroll!**  
---
My best advice is to bind the buy macro along with a line for "/target Qia" on scroll up and then bind Interact with target on scroll down
---
Then you just scroll and escape
---
For classes like that, I am open to them rolling as much as it would suck to have added competition. If it was explained like the scenario you described they would have my blessing.
---
Blizzard won't do anything about a ninja looter. All we wanted was just to see his guild tell us they wouldn't tolerate that from the members. Failing that I posted on Discord so at least the community could be aware, and the ninja could lose some reputation on the server as ninja's should.
---
As mentioned I would have stopped there until my post was deleted by mods... really not sure how we could have handled this better.
---
Toons is perfectly viable, unlike people who put pineapple on pizza YOU MONSTER!
---
Stay Arms until 50+ raiding, also I am enjoying Warriors too because I always did DPS in Vanilla WoW and wanted to change it up. It is tough to level but I feel it will be worth it in the long run.
---
It's not about who can use it. It's about who can benefit from it the most.
---
I'm not even close to 60, just what I used on private server testing in BGs a could weeks before launch and have such with while leveling. I'll still need to add several more but this is a good start for me.

But that has other issues with it. Where is the energy from that heat going? You know, the laws of thermodynamics and all that.
---
what do you use to manage addons in linux?
---
Not even creating cold from nothing. It's more along the lines of removing heat from certain points and by doing so creating ice from the moisture

Yea no.

Pssst. It was bannable in vanilla too. Not just classic.

Was the main reason for me to install the add-on.

Are you implying people should always sell BoE items? Because BoE drops can definitely be better than what people are currently wearing, and I don't see how turning the items into money is always better than using them for stats.

I leveled to 11 in Elwynn then ran to Dun Morogh and did every quest there and ended at lvl 13. Then ran back to Westfall and got to lvl 15 no problem. Now im thinking of going back to Loch Modan and doing everything I can there and then going back to Westfall

Is Bigglesworth still horde dominant? I'm alliance and the server's first few weeks were clearly dominated by horde but they seem to be less and less apparent in my travels now, and I've started to see a lot more alliance everywhere I go. Anyone else have the same experience?
---
I know this topic comes up a lot and it doesn't seem to be a clear definitive answer that everyone agrees upon. I guess to me I would say you're the a****** in this situation, I understand the argument that every class has its benefits and being able to pick a locked chest is one for the rogue, but I also think when you agree to join a group and do a dungeon run you're also agreeing to use the benefits of your class for the good of the group. I'm a mage and can summon water and food, I don't charge my group members for that service, and when the dungeons over I'll offer to Port them to major city free of charge, these services I don't always offer for free when not in a group so there are different circumstances in my opinion.
---
You don't get that ability until 18th level. Until then, health funnel is the only way to heal your demons. Also, I don't understand how you would not have enough money to buy all your spells anyway. Get a gather profession, sell stuff.
---
I would be open to a paladin rolling on an off heal spec if it was talked about before the dungeon began. Like he made it clear "I'm running tank this dungeon but I do want to heal so I'm going to need on Int gear, is this okay?". But yeah if they just do it and use the explanation "It's for off spec" I'd get peeved as well.
---
Beta tests are not the same thing as marketing. Beta tests exist to find bugs before they make it in the finished product. Marketing exists to spread awareness of the game and sell more copies.
---
They absorb it themselves so they can withstand the cold of thier spells
---
I've heard the term def stancing burst before, but I have no idea what it means. Can you explain or provide a link? I'd like to know more.
---
The issue with it being "a greed roll" is that the Need Before Greed system assumes that the gold price of an item can never be more valuable than the value of equipping the item. People who are saying "All Need" are disputing that assumption. 
---
We are saying that for certain valuable items (purple and blue BoEs) there will always be some fool who will pay more than it's worth on the AH. When they drop it doesn't make sense to defer to those who want to equip rather than sell the item. So you are right, it's exactly high AH price that differentiates these items from the rest. 
---
And yes, communication is vital here. Experienced WoW players are used to Need Before Greed and hyper alert to random people in their groups taking more than their share. You definitely want make sure everyone is on the same page so no feelings are hurt.
---
This mage is objectively doing more than our government
---
It‚Äôs very basic politeness and etiquette. You don‚Äôt post names or other identifying factors of others on the internet without their explicit permission. Yes, even for something insignificant like your characters name on WoW.
---
Bold of you to assume I've got a mount
---
Tauren can‚Äôt ride undead horses so it‚Äôs cool for them I guess
---
Huh. I've always had charge on 1. I've always followed the idea of binding keys from left to right roughly by the order I use them in combat. Obviously start with a charge when possible. :)
---
Pog
---
AH I see, thank you for answering. One more question that I couldnt seem to find; is there a way to see if you are in the same layer as someone? Or do you just have to go to the same spot and check physically?
---
Again, thank you!
---
Dude shut up you‚Äôre a loser lol
---
Yeah, waiting for 6 minutes to rez is a ton of fun. Let me know when world pvp is revamped with short rez timers and NPC's/buffs in cities scaled to balance the faction that may be overwhelming the other. I love pvp but world pvp gets old very quick unless your idea of fun is ganking low levels - which is why i'm on a pve server.
---
Yes, and back in the day it was right around 150g for a crusader enchant if the enchanter provided the materials.
---
Thats really nice. I gave someone 16g for his mount and never heard of him again. Last time I checked he was now lvl 48. Not everyone is so grateful and appreciative.
---
Got a lady in my guild leveling a shaman as resto, does a lot of dungeons and groups with guildies for quests.
---
185 runs for me
---
Thsnjs for this!
---
Argue that all you want, but you are still wrong. Lacking MTT (no mana = no heal = no performance), 4% critical chance for heals, 1 point out of +healing% (no biggie there), no pushback protection and no threat reduction. But seeing that you claim this would not perform less than a standard healing spec, I think I'll rest my case here.
---
And yea, I'll leave imp. WF totem to Enhancement shamans.

When the conga line gets this long you drive them all into the lava.

Shit - I saw a tauren running around asking for silver the other day and I say'd 'GET A JOB' .

These are the type of people that will ruin classic. Shit talk these idiots into the ground. Berate people who report others for getting on roofs as snitches and tell them to reroll pve servers.

&gt;  if you are having fun then that is the only thing that matters.
---
Cannot stress this enough. Playing non meta spec? Doing pvp before max level? Leveling professions before max level? God forbid your RPing? The answer to all those questions is the above.
---
The "Min-max is the only way to play" attitude killed Retail WoW. Don't let Classic go down the same path. Focus on fun, and the game will be great.
---
Just you brotato.

Hey r/iambadass it was bannable n vanilla too, nothing has changed dumbass

Yeah I see that now. Good luck dude!

Theres nothing more cosy than finding an inn at the end of the day to go /sleep in a secluded bed somewhere. I really find myself immersed in this game then. :)

I have a job *and* a wife that doesn't understand the appeal in MMOs.

God, this just reminded me that back in the day my girlfriend and I had a third account that was almost entirely bank alts.  And we used it for stuff like quick transfers between characters, or transferring stuff through the neutral AH.
---
I want to disagree with you because of the way you went about it, but I do think you're right. This sub is full of whiners that should be playing on PvE servers.
---
I'm so glad I picked engineer
---
ƒ∞ am 28 level and i have 49g. ƒ∞ considered myself below average but are you saying that 9g really very much gold at level 22? :/
---
Dual wielding is good for threat generation. Deep prot is generally considered wasted talent points. There is flexibility overall.
---
Admittedly people have and do go a little crazy in their 30s because of the pressure to get a mount at 40 (this is why you saw so much crying about locked chests in dungeons, it was mainly the SM range). Its extremely impactful. But once they get their mount, they chill out.
---
Reddit is like new outlets. You won‚Äôt see wholesome stories near as much as the bad ones. The horror stories get a bigger reaction, so you‚Äôll notice them more. This is why you primarily see stories of people ninja‚Äôing some high value boe drop.
---
There‚Äôs also a lot of people that have a skewed sense of what it means to ninja. Like a rogue complaining about a warrior taking their bis piece, even though it‚Äôs bis for a dps warrior too. They think a warrior *can* wear plate, so they *MUST* wear all plate. As a priest, you‚Äôll encounter this a lot since many cloth pieces are bis for all healer classes.
---
that's what he is referencing.
---
Anyone having a hard time connecting?
---
Whirlwind is fine, just as long as they're not opening with it and they're targeting the same mob as everybody else. I can stack threat on all the side mobs with swipe and keep it under control well enough for them to whirlwind.

No, I'm implying that no matter if they're an upgrade to you or not, winning them made you money equal to their market value.
---
Yes they will if you have screenshots of agreed upon loot rules and then them disregarding those rules. They will take the money/item away from that character.
---
So graphs don't need axis labels? I don't know what maths classes you took mate but, even in the most basic primary school classes, we labelled our axis.

 Yeah current solution is dog shit. The old solution was dog shit. Why are we okay with dog shit solutions? Integrity of the game? Because it's certainly ruins it.
---
Not the best idea, but not terrible.  
---
Find a couple tanks you like and run with them.  You'll make some leveling friends and have a great ride to 60.  
---
I tank and have a regular resto shammy healer that I run dungeons with and quest with.
---
WW is even a good single target spell until mortal strike because it's an extra attack and doesn't replace your auto like cleaves which also means no rage generation. Cleave is just bad and maybe a rage dump
---
So join bg's as you level.
---
thats funny. why cant u take a joke when they at least put an effort to it?
---
Damn did not want to hear that truth so early
---
if your group is REEEALLY lacking CC you can MC a mob and let its friends kill it before u fight the rest of the pack... it's kind of meh because the party can't attack or do anything or it won't work... and if the MC breaks the priest can get rekt from aggro. 
---
MC is definitely cool for some mobs that have good buffs or even good heals. not sure which ones in vanilla have worthwhile spells, but it's great for the few that do. you used to be able to heal your party thru a whole pack with some of the mob heals. another benefit is that they're usually OOM or really low when you let them go lol.
---
Really good for throwing people off of cliffs too... Arathi Basin LM is hilarious. The Great Lift is another mildly entertaining spot.

Sucks that the boat doesn't work anymore... maybe Blizz just thought it was too much troll grief?

Welcome to Reverse Herod, though we fight tooth and nail.

Having Charge not on 1 seems criminal to me.

I'm emotionally unavailable, so yes.
---
Oh, you mean to the WoW server?
---
I think you're overvaluing streamers.
---
Even if they invited every single streamer, they're like going to be less than 1% of the actual playerbase.
---
+1 for AC
---
Well the point is that they're not doing it for the joy of playing an engaging videogame, so it doesn't much matter what you do. It's not like fighting back would make it more interesting for them, they're just waiting for your healthbar to deplete so that you have to run back to your corpse.
---
I suppose sitting repeatedly is a good way to speed it up though, since that'll cause auto crits.
---
I agree with you on a lot of what you said. Ports *do* cost you something and you absolutely **should** be compensated because you've spent your money on the runes. I'm more in the "water is free crowd" but also on the "I don't *have* to give you anything crowd." 
---
Being nice and respectful is fully a two way street and should done regardless of whether or not a service is being performed. If the expectation is that I will give you food/water no matter what just because, then probably no, I won't do it because that person is being a dick. This doesn't mean that mine or their time is more valuable, at least that is not what my decision was based upon.
---
if I'm level 20, and 5 level 20's roll up on me, I will not win that fight. We're each one person. They've invested about as much time into the game as I have. Why do they get to be 5 times as powerful as me? because they paid 5 times the sub fee that I did.
---
I played vanilla very casually, never made it as far as strath. I don't mind a service charge just a bit jealous
---
Question: dual wielding is it arms or fury and should you def stance or berserker stance?
---
How you haven't lost your mind dealing with this Rofo dude yet boggles me. Props to you for staying calm versus someone intentionally being antagonistic.
---
Respawn is 10 minute timer. It respawns a few seconds after it hits 10 minutes server time and the pattern is random. I got plenty of these in the first week of release.

Noone care

The single acceptable use of multiboxing

Earthfury seems fairly balanced. The latest population counts were close to 50/50. And while it can‚Äôt be tracked accurately anymore, open world encounters seem close to 50/50‚Äôas well. As a destination server there was some fear it would end up alliance heavy, but a fair number of us horde from Herod transferred over too. 
---
But yes, based on other reddit posts, it would seem like some servers were negatively impacted.
---
at least 20 with guild numbers... i'm geegee don't kick me i'm not 40 boy
---
That‚Äôs the hardest part about not getting drops, when everyone tells you ‚ÄúI see that drop all the time‚Äù

sweeping strikes is the way to go, arms is still king.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel about the Badlands. Either people are killing Lesser Rock Elementals or they‚Äôre killing the area for non-elite Griggs. Rest of the zone feels empty, so frustrating because there is barely room for more than two people to be doing either of these quests.
---
Yes it's a real thing, I remember I used to fight a rogue with mass spirit and life steal and he'd just bleed you to death and kite

That's enough for me.

Thank you I wasn't aware. We will try this.

If you're set on Healing dungeons on the way up do yourself a favor and split your talents between Ele and Resto. Don't waste talents on things like Healing knockback or threat reduction, you simply won't ever need it unless you were bound to wipe anyhow.

It's kind of rude to open trade and not say anything - you don't know what that person could be trying to do.

Actually setting up and effectively using multiboxing is more effort than leveling up a character and ganking lower levels.
---
I used toons back in the day of vanilla wow. Not often, but occasionally.

I haven‚Äôt referred to my char or character in an MMO as a toon in well over a decade.

Toons is more in line with #NoChanges than many other things.

I have actually used toon ever since vanilla. I say nothing else than toon.

Why has nobody acknowledged that this is per year, so he likely means $16,500?
---
Like how you have some pre-raid bis but no trinkets xD
---
Farm those shellfish!
---
It‚Äôs not a 24hr respawn
---
There are guides for literally everything.
---
There is zero proof that anyone has used any kind of bug in a raid to farm bosses endless times. ZERO. 
---
No ban screenshots, no blizzard post no nothing. Yes dungeons were abused but not Raids. 
---
And nobody can link any proof of you. But keep on downvoting.
---
I hoped for that answer. Zandalar-home
---
Set your auctions to 8 hours and list all your auctions first thing when you log on and last thing before you log off. Works for me
---
The min max strat also says: don‚Äôt use a void walker for leveling.
---
But he was asked to tank not dps...
---
I felt like a weirdo in vanilla for calling them chars/characters everyone I knew/played with said toons.
---
They have a warlock and can summon him back up if they wish.
---
You can't purge WF
---
TBH I‚Äôm still using my Logitech mouse from 2008. It‚Äôs discontinued and I‚Äôm scared of the day it‚Äôll fail on me.
---
Not sure if anyone else in this thread played classic.
---
Rogues get locked chests, they are not required to roll and unlock a chest for the group, though most will anyways.
---
Say that to my 27 mage who has +83 frost damage :)
---

Multiboxing should be bannable. But money
---
Voided doesn‚Äôt even hold agro at level 25, let alone 40+
---
I'm so confused right now..
---
I'm not sure why you're so up in arms against the idea that shamans totems should be the strongest part of their kit.
---
You bring shamans for their totems, if I wanted someone who could spam a quick heal on some targets I'd bring a holy priest.
---
The difference between you and the holy priest is you're able to increase the effectiveness of the raids damage output by a massive fuckton.
---
Increased strength totem, increased strength from windfury procs...
---
You don't need to worry about pushback in raids all that much for the same arguement you don't need dodge or block, if you're not the primary tank then you're not going to suffer unavoidable damage any different from a deep resto spec shaman.
---
4% crit on shaman heals is rather large, I agree but in the mass scheme of things here, if you've got 1 shaman per melee group (roughly 4 melee groups) your increasing your parties effective attack power by roughly 20-35% at the moment.
---
I'm not sure how much this translates into overall raid dps increases but you've got to just imagine how much faster bosses would go down with this much damage. If bosses die faster you don't have to worry about your mana over longer periods of time.
---
Do you play League of legends? If you do, you'll know that they have different sub classes they categorize their supports. Enchanters, healers, guardians.
---
I'd like to think of Shamans as Enchanters because of their ability to imbue their allies with increased properties, if not for their totems you would never bring them to a raid, so why not play to their strength?
---
Who else is going to protect barrens chat?
---
There are dead knights all over the place in scarlet monastry.
---
Blocking reduces the damage by a specific amount. If that amount is larger than the incoming damage, then the incoming damage is fully blocked. Blocking also prevents critical/crushing strikes from happening.
---
Dodges completely negate the damage. So do parries and misses.
---
What I mean is I could only find power levelling guides
---
Well he still can beat the speed record. Being the very first 60 is another competition.
---
Similar to me.  I played solidly from Vanilla through Wrath, then popped in and out for Cataclysm and MoP, then stopped and never looked back. Had a couple kids, and never gave WoW a second thought.
---
Then Classic happened. And for the last month I've been obsessed with the "Will I or Won't I?" question.  Then my wife finally said "Why don't you just play it?"
---
So with her blessing I installed and I've played the last two nights after the kids went to bed. And both nights I stayed up an hour later than I told her I would.
---
or when your mage friend links it to do then says "easy 5 gold".
---
You can do this on any server
---
Reeds extra ginger beer here
---
And Warlocks have Underwater Breathing ability.  One of the earliest skills I acquired.
---
I hope you are trolling cause it's scheduled for phase 2
---
That shit made me laugh honestly
---
Why would I benefit from tanking if I hate it? Warrior dps is the same or better then the rog and I wouldnt have to grind 2 different gearset and buy twice as much enchants etc.. The truth is, if you play a pure dps class you should utilize everything you have that could benefit the group and could make you preferred over others because there is 100 other dps behind you who will accept your role in a second. But I will stop this here since it pointless to continue, if you or other rog will do this in my group you will just make my ignore list larger and reward you with a kick for it even if we are at the last boss.
---
I remember my first time playing classic WoW LOL
---
This isn't an airport, no need to announce your departure.
---
Kinda weird.  
---
You can always wait about 3 more weeks for the rest of the server to catch up. Alternatively, try to make a friend in your target guild for an "in", or bust out Google Translate, brush up on the grammar for their language so you no this like talk, and fake your way in.
---
I was in a number of non-English guilds on private servers (mostly French and Spanish, so some grammar and vocabulary was pretty simple), and they were happy enough to have me if I made an effort in their language.
---
&gt;respect
---
It's a video game...
---
Ninja'ing isn't rolling need for an item you're actually going to use that no one else will.
---
&gt; while one person could get the money and the stats.
---
He doesn't get the money AND the stats, he gets the money then if he chooses to equip the item he spends those money to equip it.
---
You‚Äôre comparing class roles to talents, that‚Äôs illogical and moronic.
---
If I‚Äôm a mining blacksmith, do I roll on your skinning loot?
---
Lockpicking is a talent, it is not necessary to open for group now or back in vanilla. Most do it out of politeness since chests suck anyways.
---
Skeram?
---
U know what the fucking "solution" is? KILL THEM URSELF IF U DONT LIKE IT. It takes 5 fcking seconds to learn how to get up to the spots people are bitching about.
---
U lazy ass fucking "carebears" are going to ruin one of the beat things about vanilla if u keep snitching to gms.
---
Personally what "ruined" retail for me is the constant change in balance. I wouldnt mind it too much and would just carry on playing on my favourite class, but after next patch you suddenly dont get invited for shit because of your spec that youve spent 100+ hours on? Tough luck. Sure, people say "play with friends and guildies", and I did, but that eliminates a huge part of the game for me. And all the score tracking tools, etc. Its a gray area for me whether or not I think they are good or not considering the content is considerably more difficult than vanilla, but unless you play a tank or a healer its a nightmare sometimes. 
---
I got to 1500 io on my disc priest and am now happily throwing shields on people in classic again. I am desired again, yay!
---
Mx518?
---
Isn't dual wielding pretty bad until you get hit rating gear?
---
I have Charge on MB5. You know, the thumb button. 1-5, Q, E, R are all reserved damage abilities.
---
That is a super chill spot.
---
Everyone else is going to use it just as much as you.
---
If your server's ah allows it, reselling skill books is decent passive cash. They're 1g ea, buy like 5 of em, sell for 1.2g ea. I don't really keep up on them myself, but they're nice if you're trying to squeeze out an extra few gold.
---
I don't try to flip mats really, total waste of my time since most are near vendor price atm. I do flip recipes and the occasional cheap BoE (I usually look for ones that are listed near vendor but AHDB tells me they're 10g+, can often sell em in trade chat for well under typical AH price).
---
I do agree with the sentiment that leveling is better for long-term gold making currently. I anticipate that playing the AH will be more viable / have more flipping opportunities once the economy matures a bit.
---
And it was OP all along
---
Oh shit you can check? I‚Äôm level 36 and have played since launch.. i... I think I suck at this game?
---
If you will be exclusively in dungeons, resto is fine. I am leveling a shaman alt with a friend‚Äôs warrior. We play the shaman/warrior exclusively together. I considered going resto, but decided against it. 
---
1. We clear quests and mobs when we duo much faster when I am not resto. I can heal as enhancement or elemental just fine for grinding. 
---
2. I can heal or DPS dungeons. This is huge for groups as we have a tank and healer or two DPS or any combo in between. We don‚Äôt have to wait for a tank or healer. But don‚Äôt have to refuse a priest who wants to heal. Our groups are much more flexible with me as a DPS viable shaman. 
---
3. Resto doesn‚Äôt heal that much better early on. This will change at 45+, and especially 50+. I will eventually swap to resto. But not till probably 50ish. 
---
Now if you are only going to dungeon grind and never plan to DPS, then going resto is fine. But elemental (post 40ish) or enhancement (pre-40ish) can damage great and heal great too.
---
As a shaman I feel left behind
---
What's the 60/28 under your Player frame?

Ok wow thats hilarious

This is who I resell vendor items to in the auction house with ridiculous markups.

How does pet grooming get down votes? Rofl this sub...
---
Yes YATA
---
Locked chests in dungeons are for the group cause you wouldn‚Äôt get there without your group (yeah you can Stealth to it, but if you want to do that, just solo loot the dungeon). 
---
Don‚Äôt be a dick, /roll for the chest and unlock it for whoever wins.
---
I'd like to think there is honor and respect in a video game too yes.

I‚Äôve had a dude do this to me. Not as extreme as with you, but he still purposefully killed me. Then was /ignoring me when I went to yell st him.
---
Sometimes you're just in a corridor or room with mobs off in all directions. Tanks need to be aware of where they are, where their targets could run to before they die, and where their party members are. They gotta position the pack of mobs so they won't run away and pull extra before they die, and they gotta position the mobs so all your team members can get into safe positions too. You have to have room behind the mobs for your melee to get behind them, and you have to be mindful of having enough safe space behind your group for your hunter to operate.
---
They've been druids for a long time. I think they got it a little figured out.
---
Just a poor design early on in the makings if WoW
---
That's the game, dude. I remember getting murdered by a warlock on the roof in duskwood a dozen times in vanilla. It comes with the territory playing on a pvp server. If it really rustles your jimmies that much just report and move on. By posting this to Reddit you're only encouraging the behavior to spread.
---
I‚Äôm only level 42 and saving up for epic mount.
---
Parrying does the same thing as dodging, except it also makes your next attack come faster, this is generally known as "parry haste", and is the main reason why melee dps don't want to sit in front of the boss.
---
Parrying fully negates damage.
---
Oh I got into Vanilla late, but yeah Orb for tank was the norm on our server at the time. I now know why that is the case with this Dun specifically from the other comments in the threat (never played a tank myself so I didn't realize that they usually have no gear to gain from this run.)
---
We are seeing this play out now with Warr/Rogue/Hunters/Shammies looking for ranged (aka caster so they have less competition) DPS for Princess Runs in Mara, lol.
---
Speaking of ranting.....

That's great advice.

Ooo struck a nerve, feed me your tears.

No, betas have for a long time been for marketing and last minute stress testing of servers.
---
While I agree with you, your presumption about Classic being full of vets is wrong. I was surprised at this too, but after consistently asking pugs in my dungeons what they WoW background is. I get the following breakdown:
---
40% returning players (usually last played in Wotlk)
---
20% retail players (don't have any idea of vanilla dungeon culture)
---
40% NEW PLAYERS (never touched WoW)
---
Ya, its insane, but true. Like I couldn't believe it myself. But again and again I meet new players who never touched WoW and don't know even the basic stuff, much less vanilla dungeon culture. Then you have retail players that never touched retail so they don't know anything either about proper dungeon etiquette.
---
No, NEED is for items you NEED to get from there and can't get anywhere else, i.e. bop items.
---
Bets are off if you're In the opposing faction
---
Currently trying to convince my wife to play classic with me!
---
You're god damn retarded please go fucking outside
---
Omg that was so cruel. I'm just imagining a 75 year old trying to leave a spammy guild but now he gets this.
---
As someone who works in QA I can assure you judging people purely by the number of bug reports they file means nothing. 
---
If you want to submit a good bug report then capture all of your environmental variables and provide a reliable way to reproduce the bug. If a bug cant be reproduced then it's 100% getting ignored
---
With streamers like others have mentioned at least they have video evidence which could be of value
---
He was also about farming rep too which it is definitely better in a group to do as you can farm the rep faster.
---
Same :&lt;
---
Look on one side I completely agree it's a pvp server if you dont want to be killed,ganked, griefed go on a pve or rp server 
---
On the other hand I shouldnt have to risk my account just being in the location close to an abuser. 
---
So either fix it or leave it.
---
I'm on Deviate Delight and I love it! It feels really balanced and well populated.
---
On my server, everything below mageweave cloth is usually around vendor price. Hell a few nights ago I was able to buy the almost 20 stacks of silk I needed at 30s/stack just advertising in trade chat.
---
Great! Now i can rp as my mage turning his own piss into water. I drink after every pull and being unable to pee really fuks my immersion.
---
I'm assuming the player puts it on right away. It would be silly to forgo such an upgrade.
---
Does putting on a BoE item decrease its value? If so, I did not know that.
---
I don't consider selling it using it.
---
The game has been out for 15 years and some people still don't understand how the greed/need system works. Amazing.
---
Nothing they said was elitism calm down
---
That is if you have enough rage to use it lol. I hear not enough rage in my sleep now.
---
Ahh, a fellow swtor member!
---
Neither can the other 200 people trying to sell that blue BoE :(
---
It should be noted that the fire and nature resist items are only valuable if they are high level versions. And nature should be hoarded, not sold atm.
---
And this is the reason why warriors resource is rage
---
These guys have sad life. Move on and group up with nice fellas.
---
IIRC, ElvUI has a setting that causes health bars to shift colour to red(?) the lower your health goes. I'm personally not a fan of it because of instances like this where it's harder to tell what class players are at times.
---
thanks man, this completely sucks ass but in the best way
---
You forgot the #1 problem I‚Äôve encountered in dungeon runs thus far: egotistical tanks. Tanks want to do everything, lead everything, make every fight about them, and occasionally want exclusive access to loot. Peacockery.
---
Everyone in the group should feel like they‚Äôre contributing and should have some responsibility.
---
Most of these problems don‚Äôt come up when the group is on Discord. Once people are talking to each other, they treat each other better.
---
I just stumbled upon it and found it funny, joined the guild like 10min before this
---
It's just a game, people are having fun. I don't think there's really much else to it.
---
Drain life healing doesn't cause additional threat iirc.
---
Sure it was - I did X, why can't you.
---
&gt;testing
---
Yep
---
I think you misunderstood me a bit. But regardless, what I mean is there are too many players out there who don't care about 1 little chest. If you want the locked ones  then make urself some keys or be a rogue since u hate tanking. I'm never a dick about the situation when it comes up, i don't ever go into some detailed paragraph, most ppl just say "all yours" or "go for it" .
---
&gt; Just bank it and wait 6 months
---
People who need those low level blues won't be playing classic anymore in 6 months lol.
---
Ok, so saying it isn't viable isn't true.  I just did the math and it ends up being about a 10% increase in physical damage reduction going from phase 1 +healing bis to full t1, assuming both characters are using malistar's defender as a shield.  I'd still rather have t1 for pvp healing, but the physical damage reduction difference isn't quite as bad as I thought it would be. (My calculations were made assuming you have the ancestral healing talent which increases armor by 25% upon getting a critical heal).
---
Wrong. That only applies with master looter
---
I can corroborate this.
---
Some people are just assholes.
---
I 'farmed' the recipe a couple of nights some weeks ago while binge watching a tv-series on a second monitor. It's a super easy way to make gold by spamming two buttons if you actually get the recipies.
---
As a Warlock I have feared everyone away from the vendor every now and then to notice that they stand still in their new location for hours without moving back to the vendor. It also really sucks that you keep seeing them standing next to Qia every night doing the same thing even though you report their AFK-macro behavior or botting.
---
For anyone who wonders how it works I made a tutorial for some reason a week ago:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0IYrYQadO8
---
Attacking players where the guards won't aggro you is treated as griefing so I would not recommend doing that. This can result in warnings or bans to your Battle.net account.
---
All miners, but not everybody who helped them get to the node, which is the logic many are using here to justify why everybody should roll on the chest.
---
I'm also not sure about the class utility part, if mages had to take forever levelling up their food summoning maybe. If there is a locked chest and no rogue in the group, but a blacksmith who has a key, does everybody still get to roll for his work? You're free to your opinion though I disagree.
---
If they "fix" this i will go back to p servers immediately. This isnt a "problem". The oopposing faction can get up to these spots and kill the "exploiters" themselves. The "solution" is player interaction. Being able to do this is a reason many people even want to play classic.
---
Step back and ask yourself if you really think the game would be more fun with this banned. If you think it would be you are nothing but my enemy and if i see you in real life i WILL _____
---
That‚Äôs a great insult üòÇ

3d20h lvl 49

I see no objective evidence of that. Leveling is no indication of skill.

---
I think at Level 48 you should be OK without points in subtlety, please let me know if I'm wrong as then I can advise other people in the future correctly, I do think you'll be fine though

That‚Äôs gross man and illegal.

G9 laser
---
Riposte is super strong definitely worth it. Can save tons of dmg soloing in PvE and sometimes will win you a fight vs melee in PvP.
---
Assuming you took it and havent actioned anything yet. I'd say just sell it and send him half the proceeds with a note. He will respect you more and the surprise will hit his reward centres harder.
---
If the tank cannot keep aggro against heals even though you waited a few seconds, then it is most certainly the tanks fault. Because your other option would be to let him die, and that's not really helpful.
---
I use a weakaura to track my health/mana/rage/energy.
---
Happy to share!
---
Thunderclap is garbage in classic
---
I forgot to add that while also requiring people to provide own materials and your crafting fee, you'll make your money by selling materials on the AH. There is no deposit or fee for enchanting materials, so you can keep a stock listed at all times. Maybe you won't get the tip/crafting fee for an enchant, but at least your rival enchanters will be using your dusts and shards.
---
Thank u for this
---
Come on, man, try to keep up. Each side is not "each one person" in your scenario. They're five people, and you're one person. They *each* paid the same fee that you did. They *each* spent about as much time as you on the game. So yes, they're going to face-roll you, and that's fair because that's how WPVP is actually supposed to work.
---
Of course, I know you're being purposefully obtuse. Do you have any original thoughts on this, or are you content just saying "nuh uh" to whatever my last point was?
---
2 wipes is smooth? That speaks to the sad state of play now in Classic I guess.
---
In vanilla you go slow because you want and got 0 wipes because everyone knew wipes are the worst. Retail influence rotting people's heads that wipes are acceptable part of a "smooth" run.
---
Going for exalted with Darn then winterspring

I've had good luck on Earthfury so far.  The good ones are out there...

Sure dude, you do you. That type of content is fully available on either server

Shut the fuck up you insufferable loser

Because all the horde are 60 and alliance babies are sitting at 40
---
Absolutely play it, whether you‚Äôre new or a wow bet. I‚Äôve played WoW for 11 years and I thought classic would be slow and boring but I actually love it. I think about it all day when I‚Äôm not playing.
---
the Hinterlands has some low 40's quests
---
Rofl.  Although stalagg alliance is not in the best shape due to a lot of people jumping ship, it is far from a ghost town.  And the only people saying HS is balanced are alliance......
---
Frostsaber is a way cooler achievement
---
How can you not know that a boe can be sold on the auction house for more than the vendor pays for it?
---
The study of economics didn't start when a dude wrote a book about it but ok.
---
Says the Alliance SCUM! go run around with your full party creating un fair 5v1 fights ;)
---
no problem!
---
It's clearly against the ToS. If you want to do it anyway, that's fine.
---
I see you have heard the good word of our Lord C'thun as well!
---
&gt; and by then it was nerfed to 25 man raids
---
arguably not a nerf, considering how harder they became mechanically

But.. are the two backpacks also full?!

Imagine being this dumb.
---
Irondorge was always lively on tichondrius during tbc. Half the shit to said is just flat out wrong. AH in shat? Wtf üòÇ
---
Lol okay. I have characters on both servers. Playing Alliance isn‚Äôt fun on Stalagg.
---
def needs a nsfw tag
---
Outside of the limited raid attempts, hard modes only being pre-sets(unlike ulduar/sarth), and separate lockouts between 4 different difficulties, I don't remember people disliking ICC.
---
As you said, it was a great raid, there were just some... systemic choices Blizzard implemented that were a bummer.
---
I'm the same way. I leave people alone, and even help sometimes. I want them to get to 60 and queue BGs. Now if someone ganks me (completely unfair fight) I simply add them to my kos list and I will attack them anywhere anytime, or at least until I feel I've enacted my vengeance at least three-fold. When phase 2 rolls out though, nice guy goes away.
---
1 inch
---
And then you wonder what you been doing with your life lol
---
I am also on a full server (most are well populated, even if they aren't technically populated) and there is always a time during the day where you will be alone.
---
Until you approach 40-50, you actually only get very marginal bonuses from being resto and you can easily heal as either Enh/Ele as long as you keep a set of int/spi gear to slap on for those occasions. The one talent which actually is quite helpful for dungeon healing is the tier 1 which cuts 0.5 sec cast time off of your Healing wave - you could potentially go 5/5 in that and then put the rest of the stuff in a DPS tree. Leveling as resto will be quite slow compared to Enh (most popular) or Ele post-40. I healed as Enh up to level 52, worked just fine when using a healing set.
---
In what it will be used? So o can start stockpilling
---
Two questions I‚Äôd always ask before any instance. 
---
1. What‚Äôs our rolling rule on BOE‚Äôs
---
2. Is anyone rolling on _____ (enter atlas loot item) 
---
If I don‚Äôt like the answers on 1/2 or if no one responds I normally bounce. This is lvl 60 of course.
---
Please do! Weakwauras always scares me a bit, but maybe this will convince me to finally start using it :P
---
1 is always a main rotation ability for me. Charge should not be there ü§¢
---
What is the dust macro used for?
---
Vanilla wasn't just one single set of numbers and talents. Content and specializations were in constant flux, far more so than today. An essential part of the authentic vanilla experience was anticipating new areas and new balance changes for your class. That fundamentally temporal aspect is part of what a "true to its roots" classic needs to replicate, not simply a single moment of that original experience frozen in amber forever.
---
This on Whitemane?
---
Are you looking for guides on the best item to make for your current level?
---
Yeah, I can't believe what I'm seeing. A fire mage.
---
lol probably
---
You think that the gold they make off the sale of that item just sits in their bank? You don't think they put that gold towards their mount, crafting, buying their own gear? I think I'm seeing why you don't understand.
---
That thing called intuition you keep mentioning. You get a feel for distances based on spell casts, ranged weapons, aggro. How do you know how close you can get to a mob without pulling it? You get a feel for it. Now if I told you that distance is 15 yards, I think you'd have a pretty did grasp on what 15 yards looks like in game.

---
What's a Death Knight?
---
Yes most certainly. You will do a lot less damage with a shield equipped, and you do not spec into any of the damage talents. Also there is no need for a warrior to be prot, unless you like doing that. I've just healed a 37 fury warrior in berserk stance through monastery wk and cathedral, and he was "tanking" 3-6 mobs on average and it was pretty easy to do. A prot warrior in this situation would have slowed down the run massively with no other gain.

Do t forget to replace your spells on your bar with your new ones otherwise your running around as a lvl 22 attacking with rank 1 spells

Last check of the census addon showed 55/45 horde favored split. Not terrible. Frankly about what you would expect on a normal server

I didn't think it was around then, but wasn't sure.

And yeah, it isn't on the blue post, but I don't think any of them are. I feel like there have been plenty of discussions and acknowledgement about hunters and their pets, but nothing is ever mentioned about the bugs that Warlock pets have.

Never heard that one before.

The dick was inside us the whole time.
---
&gt;A note to EVERYONE: Train ALL your spells. If you have untrained spells, you DO NOT belong in a dungeon. There are very few exceptions.
---
I mean, this isn't really true. We all need to save 90g for our mount, and I wasn't about to waste money on the latest rank of Mind Blast when I'm a healer.
---
I kept all my heals up to date, naturally, but my point stands that some spells just aren't needed for dungeons. It's up to everyone to find out which ones these are for their class though.
---
yeah unless you're grinding, you need to alternate between two zones around that level range to get sufficient quests. Loch Modan is my favorite zone aesthetically so I usually go there.

AE-tanking is weird in classic. Your shouts actually do the aggro for you and you can spam them. 
---
The alternative is to just do more damage than everyone else, which also speeds up the run.
---
We all had a good laugh at this.
---
I guess so, maybe I'm just more used to looking at graphs than normal people; this graph seemed like good data presentation to me and the labels were at good locations that told you the relevant breakpoints.  If it was any other way it would be confusing to me because of the dependent-independent variable switch.
---
He's saying if he was dinging, and only need 8 exp, he could only possibly gain 8xp, so that is what was displayed, even though discovering is probably about 300 or so
---
Unfortunately that discussion did not happen, at least not while I was in the party. From the sound of it, the party forced the Pally to tank after I inquired as healer, but nothing was brought up to me until after this all happened.
---
No, it's not a huge leap. I'm telling you just linking meters isn't pushing the normal player to do it.

My whole point is that just linking meters doesn't say all this. You're ignoring that and making yourself look like an idiot.

You are really trying to be petty aren't you? üòÇ
---
Right, I think this is what hes after. Its not a terrible idea, as warriors are the most gear dependent class, but other than making 2h weapons to keep your dps as high as possible, I wouldnt waste the ore/bars  making gear thatll be replace. That is unless dont mind the resource costs that comes with it.

Im doing the power leveling guide, but will branch off for the highest 2h wep i can craft for my level until i can get WW axe.

Yep I just hit lvl 60 with 5 days 1 hour played on my warrior and I didn't exp grind any dungeons, I only did stockades, gnome, uldaman, zf, st and brd once each for the quests.
---
On top of what you wrote I'd also recommend to try and avoid quests that are above your level, including the ones which are just 1 or 2 levels above you. Killing mobs of equal level or below you is WAY faster because you get a fraction of the glancing blows, which means more rage and also your crit chance goes up along with everything hitting more often.
---
Your roll based on your role in the group, unless you explicitly state otherwise when forming and everyone agrees on it.
---
You want to know what classes I‚Äôm taking at college?

However teaming with other faction IS against ToS im pretty sure. People get banned for this when farming some leathers i dont see how is this different.

Level 60 druid tank here, so maybe I can assist. I get endless amounts of flak for not being able to hold aggro on 4+ mobs (Strat and Scholo being the typical dungeons where this became an issue).  
---
Pre HoT's do help in having threat, but as a bear tank, I RARELY try to leave bear form, unless absolutely necessary, and my reasoning (may not be correct, it's what works for me) is I pool up rage endlessly. From the first pull to the last, as long as everyone is good, I will sit anywhere between 60 and 100 rage. Once I started doing that, spam tab swipe tends to lock down a lot of the threat I need for the rest of the fight, and then again, last couple kills pool rage again.   
---
Where things get tricky is when I am in groups with mages. (no hate on mages, I think they are great) They tend to absolutely UNLOAD at the beginning of a fight before I've had a chance to get swipes off, for stuff like that, I just try and stay mobile and keep my taunt available to grab whatever ends up pulling to the mage.  
---
I don't know if you want a rotation but its pretty simple, I always open with a Enrage (with improved enrage) let that fall off so you get the free rage, and then Faerie Fire. Then instead of wasting rage on a charge, typically I'll just run up to them, or LoS the pulls. Then Spam Tab Swipe (due to swipe only hitting 3 targets), then I always tab to my original target, or keep an eye out for which one people are attacking, and then maul while throwing a swipe in here or there to just maintain aggro on the others. If one pulls off, and you're paying attention, a taunt easily gets that mob back to you and rinse and repeat.
---
My build is 0/30/21 (HotW (tank build with increased threat and the tank split on like tier 4)/NS) I do a bit of PvP so I love having NS, and I can still heal very effectively with a simple gear switch. 
---
I am still very new to being a druid, but I've tanked since day one, aswell as healing quite a bit, and in a lot of dungeons doing both.

Most probably, massive penalty to hit when dual wielding.

To add to TypicalOranges, and assuming you did label your axes, it is inferior to the original graph. Why? Because the original graph allows us to determine a distance, and follow up the y axis to the first line we hit, giving us the fastest travel method. That right there is how to use a graph.
---
To use your graph, while reading it properly, you would have to look at your object, guess the time it will take to get there per method, and find the one closest to the y axis at the given times.
---
Your graph is great at determining which mount can get the farthest in a certain amount of time. But that's not what we care about. We want to know which method is the fastest to get to a predetermined distance that is relatively close to us.
---
I have a rogue main and bounce between a shaman and warrior alt. I'm unsure if which I prefer more. I would say if you want melee, a warrior would be fun (minus being kited). If you want to cast, either an elemental shaman or mage for blowing people up in pvp. Fun is very subjective.

---
I know for a fact my vanilla warrior got it off emperor. We farmed that dude for an eternity to get two so me and a friend could have one each. I have no idea what patch this was but Im sure it was late as I had tier 0.5 on my Warrior by then. Now however it drops of angerforge

One technicality to get out of the way - silk thread changes priced based on your rep with a particular vendor so you have to be careful about that. It will change what you can buy leather at and still make a profit.
---
Past that, what he listed in the spreadsheet is just the "Break-even point." If you were to buy thick leather at 7s 23c you would only make a 1c profit per piece of leather. Since the recipe takes 7 leather, that's only a 7c profit per craft. It takes over 30 seconds for each craft.
---
So if you bought it at that price you're making ~14 copper per minute or 8 silver per hour.  Unless you are truly doing this with an AFK bot, it's not remotely worth the profit.
---
I usually buy up to ~6s 50c per leather. Because then you're making a profit that's actually somewhat meaningful.
---
Climate Cleave group
---
There will be new recipes coming then and some of the good ones will use plaguebloom. My theory is that it's way underpriced right now and will shoot up once those consumables start being used.
---
My problem is as I level it/not ctaching up with it I cant see what comes in the future like how you cna with class trainers

Shadow priest are good 1v1 ...mages or Hunter if you don't wanna be ganked ..... But your a warlock you shouldn't really be getting ganked that bad dot,fear,pet life tap, healthstones ? Of you can't do it on a warlock it just gets harder on other classes
---
Basically, like what comes in the future like class trainers do
---
Basically all the high end herbs. Id recommend looking  up the alchemy guide  and seeing all the raid consumbables pots/elixirs/etc. Off the top of my head, plaguebloom, moutain silversage, sungrass, dream foil. Id recommend concentrating on the mats req'd for Elixir of the Goose, Greater Arc Elixir, Mana pots
---
I do this as well, but only to horde players. That is, until some other horde wants to just be a dick and attacks me.
---
It's not as bad as people make it out to be.
---
Like sure, if you rely completely on drops and quest rewards then you'll make it tough cuz warrior is so gear dependent. But if you actively try to stay on top of your upgrades it's really not bad at all.
---
Everytime I go to Org I stop at the AH and look for cheap upgrades to keep me on par with mobs.
---
Don't aggressively charge into 15 mobs but pulling 2 or 3 is not guaranteed death like people say. In my 20's I was regularly pulling 2-3 mobs at a time. Once I got SS and WW axe that went to 3-4 mobs at a time. Once I got ravager warrior was stupid easy to level.
---
The problem is I inspect tons of warrior leveling up and they are wearing leather primarily, using a weapon 6 levels lower than them and pulling like they are an AOE mage.
---
Warrior isn't hard to level.
---
1% of the beta population consisted of streamers. I wouldn't call that focusing on them.

I figure it's only gonna get harder to buy it from the vendor as the rest of the playerbase starts getting to lvl 45+

---
I do this after coming over from retail. My classic rotations are so simple, and my brain just naturally looks for filler. I play fighting games, too. With 1-10frame links being common, sometimes you're just used to doing more.

 It can be bad in situations where distance between players matters, so you've gotta be mindful when doing it.

Had a mage last night who wouldn‚Äôt decurse (SFK) and a warrior using blood fury as soon as it was off cooldown...
---
It was rough to heal :/
---
It's because everybody did research in which classes did best DPS in endgame, so everybody who wants to play melee is playing fury warrior, and everybody who is a caster is a mage. I haven't seen much in the way of rogues, hunters, druids or warlocks at all, and anybody who is a priest or a paladin gets to heal. It is unfortunate but it's just kind of the way it is with being able to see all of the data collected about vanilla wow over the years. I'd just revel in the fact that you basically get first dibs on all your leather gear in raids tbh, thats a great position to be in!
---
Are you suggesting that something like 75% of WoW hardcore PvPers should not be able to use their mice with configurable multi-use buttons?
---
Left of ur instant health potion, but i think its the dwarf race instant heal caster spell
---
Nah. Just take a screenshot with your phone and zoom like a pro.
---
Warlocks are kind of renowned for not needing to eat/drink while leveling if they don't want to. They also have a pretty great single target CC.
---
Are you sure you're using good rotations?
---
Your mileage may vary but when you join a group asking if anyone has lockboxes they need opened is a good way for free skill ups
---
Oh shit, are you on skeram?...sorry I ganked you and your warlock friend :(
---
This kind of reaction is why I love doing it. It‚Äôs psychological warfare.
---
Yah ganking is part of the game honestly .... If it bothers you alot just go pve .... No ganking once phase 2 hits you can just do BG's for your PVP fix
---
Thats what happened to the Moonkin Specc, with the Sun/Moon Balance stuff... Not really a fan my self.
---
So, it's a bit counter intuitive, but the most important stats for a druid in PvP are Int and Stam. Realize that the vast majority of your damage on people will come from DOTs (which scale very poorly with spell power), and that shapeshifting costs 25% of your max Mana. So Mana is life. As a druid you win PvP by not dieing, so for your main gear pieces you should look to stack int and Stam, and then like one of the other guys said, look for gear that helps with CC removal so you don't have to use a shapeshift every time. When phase 2 drops there's a good PvP trinket for an early rank (can't remember which, maybe rank 3?), Swift boots, the luffa from Badlands for bleeds, etc. Also, druids especially want engineering to use grenades to help with your burst damage and to add another stun to your lengthy list (roots, bash, charge, pounce, hibernate for Hunter pets) hopefully this helps.
---
You're just making things harder for your healer then, for literally no other reason that that you want your preferences catered to. It doesn't make the run smoother, it's just you insisting on things happening your way.
---
&gt; nothing has changed just because I'm in an instance with a dedicated healer 
---
Yeah, it has. What has changed is that you're in a group with other people. If you're not working with them as a team then you're not a good team member. You keep doing you, but we've told you, as healers, how to make life easier for your healer.
---
You don't have to take our advice, but don't pretend you know how to heal better than we do.

I don't think those things take precedent over gear someone else can use. They got lucky, their item dropped, I'm not taking that away from them. I'm treating others as I'd want to be treated.

It's almost not even worth farming herbs anymore, a stack of herbs to make mana or health pots is only going for a couple of silver at best on my server.

Dot and drain tank with suc. But I heard it gets a lot better at lvl 38 with the new drain. I make sure not to put to many dots out so I‚Äôm not wasting mana and wand when I don‚Äôt need to heal. But I‚Äôm always finding like 3 mobs jumping on me at a time which is no problem to kill but then I have to drink up.
---
Will the item pop up instantly or do you need to interact with the NPC to refresh the inventory?
---
Yeah, mitigating incoming damage like a cast you can't interrupt or an aimed shot by swapping to def. It seriously adds up - I used to run frost mages oom in vanilla.
---
The issue i have with the "macro every ability to swap stance" style is it pushes you into a mindset where you aren't really keeping track of your stances and likely dump a lot of rage - sure, you *can*, but your keybinds don't make it easy.
---
Independent stance control forces you into what I consider the optimal mindset - always aware of your stance and available moveset, and always forced to weigh excess rage vs quick swaps. The situation dictates the stance.
---
For context, I keep all stance-dependent abilities on a bar that pages on stance swap, and keep functionality in the same slot - ie, charge is 5 in battle, intercept is 5 in zerker, etc. Stance-independent abilities go on non-paging bars. The upside is, all of my abilities are hotkeyed, all of the hotkeys are extremely convenient &amp; comfortable, and a fat-finger wont completely wreck me.
---
Hell, I don't tie weaponswap macros to stances or abilities either - I'm constantly swapping, and depending on the situation may want to be in zerker with a shield on using dps abilities (ie, fighting a rogue who hasn't gouged yet and keeping the swap to def for a shield block from triggering a gcd, so i can try to time a blind block).
---
The pvp griefing isn't the issue. Just the guard evading. I don't recall duskwood having guards but as long as it's not guard evading the GM's don't care.
---
That Westfall Deed was a bitch, lemme tell ya
---
Omg.
---
Other then cheaper vendor and repair cost I can't think of anything, so up to you.
---
I'm at 12 days and 53, but all my primary and secondary profs have been maxed since 40 and I've got like 500 gold. No hurry to get to 60, I've already done these raids years ago, just enjoying the ride.
---
Just got home and tried it out. Despite the bugs it has all the features I'm looking for. Thanks again!
---
You could keep pushing and wait till you can use shadoweave+dreamweave stuff.
---
Right now she‚Äôs training to be a nurse so she has lots of homework which means I have my own wow time. Do you wait for her or do y‚Äôall do your own things sometimes.
---
You can read this same graph looking at distance being the variable (which in my opinion is the easier way to gauge this), where for example with cheetah if you are going to run for less than 24 seconds it's not worth it to mount up the 60% speed mount and stay cheetah instead, and 10 seconds for epic mount.
---
How is a hunter supposed to efficiently weave melee in when the entire goal of a hunter is to keep their enemy at max range 100% of the time.
---
What a loser. Why not just group up? Or if he wanted to kill other players why not just do it to Alliance somewhere? People like that don't make much sense to me.
---
I think youre the one confused and are assuming others cant figure out what people are saying when they say slower is generally better.
---
On my server Ironforge is full of high levels, SW is a mix and Darn is empty.
---
I just bought like half of them from the AH. Ain't nobody got time for that
---
Everyone who isn't a rogue?
---
I'm glad I could help you :)
---
What? So basketball is an action, not a game? Because people emulate the best? What about literally any other sport or game? People dont learn from the best in other games? That makes them not "games" ? 
---
You can learn from better people and be playing the game at the same time. You can also have fun. In a multiplayer game, you can expect people to desire your company more if you know how to play well. Sorta like sports, games, or anything else.
---
I know theres a big push against elitism, but come the fuck on. Calling playing correctly "not a game" makes you seem petty and probably abysmal at your class.
---
I switched to another balanced server that all my friends are on. So avoiding the people from that and the other guild that was annoying is just a bonus....
---
That has nothing to do with the addon, that's just the way it is in Vanilla and afaik there's no addon that will show your healing numbers over the actual character models in the the game world. There closest you can get is with something like Miks Scrolling Battle Text, which will allow you to see healing numbers but not directly over the persons character model.
---
Your hearthstone will not take you to a different layer.
---
Yes you can. You can also check wowhead.
---
No. If you dont care about getting the mount, fuck that shit. You get a discount from that cities vendors but thats at honored. So if you dont care about mounts its a complete waste of time.
---
Being on a PVP sever I didn‚Äôt know about this etiquette but I will say that there have been multiple occasions where I have fished with alliance in the same pool. It was actually pretty cool. Just fishing buds
---
Definitely run dps for a few dungeons. Bear tanking was draining my will to play, but nothing is forcing you to tank. Especially if it's stressful, just take a break from the role. We're playing for fun, don't let the game turn into a chore!
---
No,  only very few recipes that either help me level up the skill or are decent gear
---
What 100g item? The gear is all bop isnt it? Most people wont ruin their reputation to get 10g from vendors
---
Thank you, it is, also my friends are all playing on it.
---
How do you know they are cheating though?
---
My advice is to discus roll rules before you start the dungeon. Just ask what the rules are and if you don‚Äôt agree, propose your view on the matter.
---
That said, keep in mind that gearing while leveling one piece of gear does not have a major impact in your overall performance. Plus you can always re-run the dungeon. I‚Äôm assuming it was SM Cathedral, short dungeon, many AoE runs, shouldn‚Äôt be too hard to find a group for this one and farm that mace. Or simply ask a level 60 buddy to run the instance with you.
---
I learned this past level 10 but on the stress test. Stress test was good for that kind of thing.
---
If you are bored at lvl 16 then theres not much hope for you
---
"Will dance for gold!"
---
Chads don‚Äôt start fights.  They finish them.
---
Yeah,  probably these profs are to be blamed.  :(
---
Played Alliance back in vanilla days, but rolled horde for Classic.
---
I miss Ironforge.
---
Go look at all the new players who are confused because people likw you and him say "slower is better". Slower isn't the variable you're interested in, so why even mention it? It's superfluous, unnecessary, and misleading to new players. There's a new warrior in this thread almost daily asking about weapon speed because he heard slower was better. And then people respond on here and say "it is", when you shouldn't even look at weapon speed for any reason on an Arms warrior.
---
Name the items.
---
Free action potion? Needs to be used preemptively.
---
Shadow reflector? Needs to be used preemptively and can't be swapped during combat.
---
You have dwarf fear ward, undead racial, pvp trinket, and some warrior abilities. For most encounters, coil into fear is enough to counter a broken fear. For the times an enemy has stacked fear resists, "no serious warlock is going to spam fear lmao."
---
Fighting a fury warrior with death wish? Just sac VW  to rage starve or pop seduce and kite instead.
---
How do I configure Lorti UI? I can't find the option anywhere.
---
Get Luna unit frames addon
---
This was when mount training was changed to be the expensive part
---
Only matters up to honored
---
Yeah, geese are mean fuckers that will rush right at you.
---
I tank all lvl 60 dungeons as arms and also off tank boss adds in MC as arms spec but with tank gear. You dont need to change unless you want to be a main tank. If tanking dungeons is just a means for you to get good damage gear, then stay arms.
---
Logic doesnt work with entitlement. The gaming community is entitled as shit
---
BuT iT gIvEs Me +4 ArMoUr!!1!!
---
That's pretty much what I did. Quests for a few hours. Buy the missing ones on the ah and get it over with.
---
Can I also say, FIND YOUR CC BUTTON! I know everyone is used to retail's AOE fest, but you can genuinely go pretty fast by single targeting down a pack one at a time while the rest are CC'ed, especially since it's way waaaay more likely that your healer will be able to chain pull rather than requiring a drink after every fight.  If you assign raid marks to each CC it's super quick for a tank to assign them pre-pull.
---
Honestly, I've seen like one mage find his sheep button so far, let alone all the saps, freezing traps, hibernates, banishes, and shackles that could be going out.
---
&gt; its just as fast or slightly faster
---
You are insane.  Lower levels are about doing as much damage as fast as you can to minimize downtime between groups.  Rogues have less downtime because they do a ton of damage, and hunters have less downtime because of their pet.  Warriors have a fair amount of downtime due to dishing out consistent but slow DPS and eating a lot of damage - which they need to eat to get back.
---
I'm leveling up a warrior and it's not as bad as a lot of people say but it's not even in the same ballpark as rogues and hunters.  It's also not nearly as fun as those other classes due to how passive warrior abilities are compared to other classes.
---
Sup was going to put in a ticket because it was a mistake, but your guildie started shouting expletives at him in whispers. Wasn't worth his time. If someone called me with the terms that guy used I wouldn't either.
---
Agreed 1000%
---
It's bannable. Absolutely report and screenshot.
---
I did not make the macro, I have adjusted it a bit though.  I pulled the macro from [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/d4ql3o/rogue_macros_guide_for_wow_classic/).  I am at work so I can't post my version of it but I added so that if I hold shift and press the button I feint.  
---
Another solid source for macros (that was also found in that post) is [Macrohub](www.macrohub.io).
---
It's the same people in retail who complain about getting ganked in War Mode, and then they are offended when you tell them that war mode can be turned off.
---
why wouldnt i like it?
---
It's a good hunter necklace.
---
Of the eagle - pretty much any armor class is worth a lot of this sub armor class.      
---
     
---
Some of the other ones are useful but not as much as the eagle sets. Anything with high stam on it is nice. High intel is also valuable. Weapons with out caster stats, so no spirit/int on things like axes, laces, swords are valuable to melee users. Staffs with caster stats are also valuable that don‚Äôt have melee stats on it. Some very niche specs like feral Druid/enh shaman ‚Äúmight‚Äù grab them for a filler slot but most of the caster weapons come from dungeons.      
---
Any crafting materials that are for lvl 225+ are valuable. For example in tailoring, Linen/Wool/Silk are practically worthless. Mageweave starts to pick up and then Runecloth is end game so either bank that or AH it.       
---
      
---
Things like mid level enchanting mats are super high value since the server will always have low lvls and high lvls, the in between is where the crafting items start to get sparse especially in enchanting and mining. So bank those or AH.      
---
Anything lvl 50+ from disenchanting is highly valuable due to most end game enchants having the mats come from lvl 50+ items.
---
Probably. I stared playing 3 days after launch, and made that guy. Hadn‚Äôt played anyone else pretty much at all. 
---
I don‚Äôt binge play. I do a lot of other stuff. Level 26 was a month of playing for me. I‚Äôd probably quit and come back in 8 months or so.
---
Sorry I don't know much about wow yet but I used that example becuase I seen a post on her about some Olympus guy who told everyone to greed then he needed and then AH the item as it was worth 400g.  
---
 So like i said I have no idea what gear is out there but I imagine there's a dozen or more gear items worth 100g or more. So what stops the master looter from just taking this himself.
---
Don't rogues 1v1 most classes in vanilla if they're good? Are Warriors really a better pvp class in 1.12? Keep in mind I'm including wpvp and bgs.
---
I pop in gnomer when I'm in BB and have vendored 12 sets of those damn shoes.
---
confused about the comment towards talents and their meaning
---
Doesn't matter if you downrank or not, threat mostly depends on how much you actually heal for. I mean sure, you'll heal for less per cast, but you'd have to do the same total healing to keep the tank alive.
---
Downranking is only worth if you have a significant amount (breakpoint is around 230) of healing power. Until then, greater heal 4 has the best mana/hp ratio if you don't overheal.
---
Can confirm. Everytime a member from toxic is in my pug. There's something. Avoid these people if you can
---
&gt; This could have all been avoided if Gnome B indicated to Gnome A that Gnome B was romantically interested in Gnome A.
---
Thankyou. Steps to not have this issue:
---
1. Tell a girl if you're interested.
---
2. Listen if they say no. (No means no, maybe means no, constantly dodging the question means no. Pretty much anything but a very clear yes means no. If you aren't sure that they're interested after expressing interest, it means no.)
---
3. Figure out if you're OK with actually being friends. Like.. real friends, not "I'll wait and see if you drop your guard while pretending I'm your friend". Don't be that a creepy predator hiding as a friend.
---
4. Move the fuck on, enjoy having female friends. They're awesome, give great dating advice, and introduce you to their single friends. 
---
Now if I could go back to when I was 14 and smack myself over the head with a very large book that has this printed inside 1000 times I would, but such is life!
---
Honor system is phase 2, but BGs don‚Äôt release till phase 3
---
Inventory doesn‚Äôt refresh, no.
---
Benediction seems really balanced, at least from a horse perspective. If anything I see more alliance in contested territory than horde. Id say 55-45 A-H
---
If you say so?
---
Does that make the lich king the hero we all need?
---
Nice!  I'm grinding out the last of those stupid elemental charms right now.
---
I can't wait to join one of these! I must have spent hours in those trains back in the day (or the rp-walk choochoo trains) just because it was fun :D
---
Aand of course it got some attention ;).
---
Think our longest one was a little over a quarter of the outer circle in IFüòéüçª
---
Get out of here with your damned reasoning and logic.
---
On the other hand, I was tanking a few nights ago and the run was going easy so the healer was wanding things. Last boss comes around and I get chunked to 50%, healer still wanding, get chunked again and die.
---
Run back, tell the healer to stop DPSing. Try fight again and the same thing happens. This was a hard hitting boss 4 levels higher than me. The healer needed to be focusing all his attention on spamming big heals to keep me up.
---
So rather than run back, I say "healer, you fucked up not once but twice. It's a 7 minute run back, I'm grabbing a drink and taking a leak and when I get back I better be rezzed or I'm out."
---
If the healer is the reason you wipe once, I'll cut you a break, but if the healer is the reason you wipe multiple times, you are now obligated to rez me or gtfo. I didn't sign up to corpse run cuz you decided to not pay attention.
---
I believe it's all on Spotify now.
---
I blame people like this for the Diablo mobile game because all Blizzard sees if they look at these communities is people using their phones.
---
I don‚Äôt pvp. Don‚Äôt like pvp.
---
Joined a pvp server because my friends did.
---
That said, I don‚Äôt have anything to complain about. Play defensively. Quest smart.
---
Yeah mongoose, it's going to be extremely popular with every physical dmg dealer toon
---
Logically speaking, the statement wasn‚Äôt ad hominem, it was a direct and factual statement. It did not disparage anyone. 
---
Your opinion is not complex enough to warrant misunderstanding by anyone able to read and comprehend the English language.
---
The Ravager axe from SM. Only seen it twice and lost to hunters both times. 25+ runs
---
I've given up, but as an Enhancement Shaman it's a big loss
---
Spoder2k. Forgive me but I have no clue what you just said. I understand you have gotten 12 acidic walkers and have AH them?
---
I agree.  Me and a random got owned on a escort quest 3x.  Each time same Druid.   He waited til we almost competed to kill us the last time.  What a chad.  Haha.  Well played sir.  45 mins gone.
---
Took me 76 kills to get HoJ
---
It‚Äôs about the adventure and the friends/ experiences along the way. Not the content.  Definitely not the content
---
Shouldn't you be life tapping and life draining?  I don't see how you have downtime as a warlock.
---
I seen crocodiles do it. With their teeth.
---
Honestly I was ganked by so many people above me while I was leveling. At 60 I live by the rule red is dead.
---
Or they're a pally tank.
---
Much like how dps wont even wait for sunders.
---
Kinda sad how the guild let the player continuously try to leave only to get trolled. Not once, not twice, but multiple times. Give the dude the command and let him go on his way. The first time it‚Äôs funny, but letting it go on is just mean.
---
Feels16:9Man
---
Hahahah what a clown! Doubt you‚Äôll find many folk wanting to group with such an attitude üòÇüòÇ
---
What are you going to do with screenshots though? Reports are just text messages you send via their UI, there's no place to put in screenshots and they should have logs to see what actually happened.
---
I think it‚Äôs more about future phases instead of right now.  Since there isn‚Äôt honor, it‚Äôs more people just being an ass to the majority.
---
&gt; Learn this one simple trick to make 3s an hour!
---
Profit is profit.
---
Leveling enchanting I was buying the Essences for &lt;5s and making the wands for basically at cost (with a small profit).
---
It was like training for free.
---
I'm very excited for the release of Dire Mail, can't wait to do a tribute run again!
---
Why do my SM dungeons reset when my group wipes?
---
du spracht der espanol?
---
Metalheads are (mostly) pretty cool.
---
Swiftmend is definitely better for almost everything.  1/29/21 has a bit more kill power and might be a more "fun" 1v1 spec
---
I think slam is just as bad as heroic strike since (at least in my experience) it resets your auto attack timer.
---
Or blacksmith* its not exclusively the rogues loot
---
Hauptsache damals ein Makro f√ºrs "Muh"
---
&gt; It's all marketing
---
It's not all marketing. They've been built to win the Best Buy show model feel-off since the very beginning.
---
But they haven't been durable since very early on. Logitech, Corsair and Microsoft just make better products.
---
They even use laser ablated plastic all over the mouse for RGB lighting. Even if you repair the mouse repeatedly, that stuff is gonna wear off under your fingers and palm in a decidedly more gross fashion than the paint job on a Logitech.
---
standard icehud isn't exactly like that, but the addon is very customizable so you can do a lot with it
---
I mean, everybody do it, ofc not only you, but at least you can balance out the odds as a group with a toxic player on board
---
Well it was one corpse run and one soulstone res so yeah, why don't you take your head out of your ass and fuck off. It went fine. 
---
You know retail is the version where nobody dies right? No wipes is smooth. The retail way.
---
selling it for money isnt using it just as much as you. It dropped. It's an item I can use. Not a sack of gold.
---
Nah, bruh. CTRL+R is the real deal for Charge.
---
Surely "1 more?" isn't the first thing that was said?
---
Fury is fine, you can still use a 2h and it‚Äôs mostly better than dual wielding because you don‚Äôt miss so much.
---
Real warriors spec arms though :)
---
Trash is on a timer.
---
Too much of a good thing is bad, but that doesn't mean that ANY of the good thing is bad. 
---
Again, there can be a middle ground. It doesn't have to be retail.
---
We've been trying to get his side of the story and a word from your GM since Thursday... 
---
Your GM was contacted quietly. He was pinged on Discord. It's Tuesday now, I did all I could to handle this quietly...
---
haha no but this applies to keyboard as well
---
Later on pvp battlegrounds get added and they're quite fun.  
---
Currently you should aim to try to quest in hillsbrad so you can find some world pvp.  Ashenvale, thousand needles, and stone talon can also be decent at low levels.  
---
You should run Wailing Caverns.  You're just hitting the level range for it and it's the first real dungeon horde side.  All you might have done so far is Ragefire Chasm, but you're still in the level range for that if you haven't run it.
---
what if it was already changing in vanilla?
---
You're describing Wrath of the Lich King in the early months of that expansion.
---
Resto Sham here for nearly 10 years on and off the vanilla scene. Resto is pretty powerful over all, though practically useless at low lvls as the talents that are gained are mediocre at best.     
---
The only real benefit from Resto is having healing way couple with reduced mana cost and reduced cast time. Those are the only viable talents in Resto while lvling with the rest being pretty much useless. Extra armor from crits are nice but not end all do all. The imp mana spring is less than 1mp5/tick at full 5/5. Imp healing spells is mediocre at best with low lvl spells and no spell power. It‚Äôs just an overall bad spec to lvl with.     
---
Though it is super clutch in open world game play. The pushback from healing is super effective when fighting pvp or high lvl mobs along with frost brand weapon, frost shock, watch bond for escape.     
---
Highly recommend going 7 into enh for more mana and reduced casting time for ghost wolf 10points into Resto for mana efficiency and cast time then go where ever from there.      
---
Resto is super strong if you can manage the mana at low lvls but once you get spell power and some decent mana regen in the late 40s and early 50s, they are one of the more powerful healers in that bracket.
---
&gt; making people who like a challenge not find the game engaging
---
I asked someone whether they have cleared mythic (since they wanted a challenge), their response was "well I've already killed the last boss on LFR so there's no need to do mythic."
---
I wasn't sure how to respond to that.
---
There are 3 options when an item drops. Pass, Greed, Need. Pass means you won't roll. Greed means you're going to sell it. Need means you're going to use it. This is the system Blizzard has implemented. 
---
When a BOE drops and someone in the group is going to use it, which one of those 3 options is most appropriate?
---
saw a guild called Sinn Fein if thats any use
---
I‚Äôm curious, why did you choose 54?
---
On Skeram the Horde must've been bored because they killed the flight masters in three adjacent zones.
---
Diminished to 1G
---
My only recommendation would be to find a good guild. That's what makes the difference between a suffering final grind and an enjoyable one. Maybe check your server subreddit? I was really lucky to have a friend invite me to a good one on day 1 and things have gone really smoothly.
---
no handouts son
---
I believe 'CHAR' is a direct result of the Character sheet button in Diablo 1.   
---
Someone might be able to date it back to before D1, but that's where I (as a 13yr old) heard it the most.
---
Your talent tree aias a hunter is "beast mastery" "marksmanship" "survival".
---
When the game was being developed, you had to skill up those trees, just like you do with professions or weapons. That was removed from the game before the game was released.
---
It was easier to dummy out the code than it was to remove or rewrite the code.
---
There is no effect on anything when you gain 5 skill points in "marksmanship""survival" or "beast mastery".
---
It's just leftover code.
---
I have a spotify playlist
---
Yep, WW axe + sweeping strikes + whirlwind was a big milestone.  Things are much easier at that point.  Before that you don't have any efficient ways to spend rage to do damage.
---
Shut up heretic vanilla was perfect and rose colored
---
For liveling Spirit is rly Fine. At lvl 60 and for raiding int is better. ( manapool and crit)
---
At lvl 60 is Hit (until cap) your best stat!
---
&gt; We give loot to people who aren‚Äôt going to flake in 2 months and to people who put effort into their character
---
Getting to 60 and raid ready in the short time since launch isn't proof to you that people aren't flakes and putting in effort? So your loot decision is down to skill. I doubt all the officers are the most skilled in the guild. So will the more skilled player be prioritized over an officer?
---
Well, I don‚Äôt always ‚Äòjust group up‚Äô anymore on kill quests. I play mage, and I had several people who were always barely a high enough level for the quest that simply want you to boost them and kill stuff with AoE spells. They invite you, they barely do anything and then there is the inevitable ‚Äòquestion/demand‚Äô to AoE them down. Or sometimes they just aggro a lot of mobs and expect you to AoE them. If you choose to ignore that, because you don‚Äôt want to die, you get flamed for letting him/her die.
---
I‚Äôm done with that. And it‚Äôs always the ninja inviters.
---
I refer you to my previous comment.
---
Wait what? Don't know how, no organized raids yet
---
I legit had a mage run by me in Western Plaguelands complaining that I didn't sit and eat/drink in between pulls while grinding Argent Dawn rep.  Like I have two mana bars didn't you know?
---
I do miss LAN parties though.
---
Yea this may sound rude, but if you're bored at 16 you won't enjoy the game. It hasn't even started yet, and yes it's a huge grind
---
had a dell 21 inch trinitron.   67 lbs / 30 kg
---
my buddies‚Äô place was up a flight of slippery stairs too.  almost died several times
---
Lately if there‚Äôs been multiple miners in my dungeon groups we all trade off wacking the ore once. Which will at least usually get us all a skill lvl.
---
Hi Un‚ÄôGoro Crater I‚Äôm dad.
---
Thanks for the heads up!
---
I use razer naga. Any mouse with at least 12 buttons on the thumb side and a couple on the top will change the way you game.
---
If you don't need mouse wheel tilt, the corsair Scimitar is a much better mouse.
---
But it is missing that scroll wheel tilt.
---
You can submit reports and tickets with screenshots via email and through the Blizzard website support section.
---
For accomplishment? :)
---
It's okay. I just know to turn it off when playing wow from now on.
---
There is no timeline at all. BGs are phase 3 and honor system is phase 2. Everything is pure speculation at this point. I'm guessing blizzard will mention something about it at blizzcon next month
---
I twitch because I like making it look like my character is gliding.
---
It is an addon called Bagnon
---
Classic classic noob
---
Oh shit I forgot you had to train back in the day
---
Honestly, I'm of the same mindset as you. I 99% will not engage an enemy player unprovoked. And even though I do not make the first move in PvP, having the option is part of the thrill.
---
But again, you say directly in your post, you do not engage and wish you could team up with enemy players. I understand that doesn't mean you are against PvP, but you should also understand how that can sound an awful lot like it.
---
The Twitch client works fine via Lutris. The TukUI client also works if you use the latest version (I've updated the Lutris installer but it's still awaiting moderation).
---
Tauren are already animals and night elves live for hundreds of years. It'd be weirder if they didn't figure out some tricks along the way.
---
Why would they just sit there mounted while you guys stroll up...
---
I know what with bartender when my mouse is over a bar and I use the mousewheel, it changes the skill bar. Maybe play around with that addon
---
I think the key is that if you start out leveling a warrior you dont realize how much easier it is on other classes.  I leveled my warrior first and now that Im dabbling in alts I realize its night and day difference.
---
I don't get how you're a spoil sport for reporting it, they're the ones annoying other players with a glitch.
---
Even then good players / groups will just swap once you break the stealth. Imo the perceived value of shadowmeld is much higher than what you actually get out of it.
---
Just gave up on my 38 resto shaman because the gameplay is so slow and not very fun and it seems like most people in lfg don't like resto shamans as much either. Rerolled a mage and I'm already 28 and having way more fun.. low level resto shamans really kinda suck because you end up ooming pretty quick.  I would say you should roll enh and maybe start saving a healing set in the late 40's so you can switch resto and dungeon to 60 when  you'll probably be burnt on quest anyway probably. I'll get back to my shaman after I get my mage waiting on raids because I still like healing . But
---
Agreed.
---
Almost 10 days played and Im level 38. It's been a blast
---
Honestly I've found that playing with my cousin and his friends can be really addictive and whenever I happen to be invited to a group I love it. So yeah the people is great but I guess I'm a little shy and have been doing things solo lately.
---
I‚Äôm looking to stay on the same skill bar, but like cycle through the different squares on it. Do you know if bartender or ElvUI can do that?
---
Think you‚Äôre a bit past Mara level. Searing gorge?
---
If the content gets votes , that means a lot of people enjoyed that content. It being a phone photo rather than a screen shot doesn‚Äôt kill any joke made within the content. It‚Äôs just either slightly slanted, or a little bit pixelly, but you can still see the joke or statement or thing they were trying to show you.

You‚Äôd just prefer they did it in a certain, more clean, way. Because it‚Äôs 2019 and the technology is there. I get it. But so many people are an absolute ASS about things that really don‚Äôt matter at all..
---
To be fair, the arcane mages are the real threat.
---
Widespread use of arcane magics is widely acknowledged by historians to be behind the fall of the original night elf empire after all.
---
You just... didn't realise?

Big oof

I'm so gutted I missed this, I see tibs everyday!
---
I actually didn't call you a flat earther.  I just pointed out that following your line of thinking, nothing posted here could possibly qualify as evidence for anything.  It was the other guy.
---
I would say the game has become more friendly towards people who don't have as time to spend grinding/farming endlessly. You are handed whatever you need to get into endgame content.

If you're a healing paladin, spam FOL until carpal tunnel sets in or OOM.

I am a hunter and I need that sword that dropped for your tank because I can sell it to a vendor for silver. Thanks how you don't mind hahaha! I KNOOOW it's an upgrade and would make your fights easier but I -need- the silver. I know it's a BoP and I can't sell it on AH but the npc vendor will take it. Thaaaanks
---
Aww I wish people accepted my duels on the zeppelin, I have yet to pass on that misfortune as a priest. Any day now!
---
zzzzzz
---
Can be rough on a pvp server though. The Cold Eye Basilisks near the Arena are also good and a bit easier to do casually. Can also skin 'em!
---
That's not a real solution because that will literally never happen.
---
You're right we have to work together so do it. You're the healer, do what you do best, but don't complain about the way the Warlock class works and don't expect me to change just to make your life easier. That's just as unreasonable.
---
Ask "DPS LFG RFC" in org chat(/1) and LFG chat(/4, you might need to turn it on in a chat window).  Ragefire chasm is in the center of orgrimmar in 'The Drag'.  You should see a cave with a swirling misty entrance.

Most of the time, any dungeon below this lvl, the items will get replaced by pre bis. Anything above this, is ‚Äúgenerally‚Äù extremely useful or even prebis.

I don‚Äôt have a question, just wanted to make a small statement without creating a new post. I am an MMO vet, played EQ, EQ2, WOW, private server WOW, ESO, EvE and Star Trek Online. I spend a lot of my Sunday‚Äôs getting into groups with people and running instances for fun. I moved to the East Coast a few years ago and don‚Äôt have many friends out here, so I use MMOs to socialize and chat with people when I am lonely.  
---
This Sunday (Pagle PvE Eastern US), I was wandering around the Badlands trying to get into a group for Uldaman. I randomly came across a Paladin sitting near the meeting stone, and asked if he was looking for a healer. I then spent just about the best 90 min I have had in Classic WoW running with them. We joked, had fun, everyone was friendly, and we all got some great gear. We came close, but no wipes. So if you are out there and reading this Hamor the Paladin, I hope you and your crew are having a good day, and I hope that your gnome friend got his mount! You guys made my Sunday and I am still happy about it. This is the second time I have grouped with ppl from your guild, and they were all incredibly nice and fun to run with. I am unfortunately in a guild of tryhards that I know IRL, otherwise I would have asked to join you guys. Whoever is in charge of ‚ÄúNat Pagle is My Dad‚Äù is doing a phenomenal job, and I hope you keep up the good work! Hope this helps spread some more positivity and reminds someone else of a good day they had in Classic Wow, because experiences like this one are what MMOs are all about!

When should I respecc to restoration as a shaman? I'm level 52 now and thinking about respeccing for dungeon leveling. But at the same time I have this weird feeling that I won't be finding as many dungeons as I hope to find. Should I stay elemental until the late 50s or should I respecc now?
---
&gt; If you actually cared about people getting better at this game you would take the time to actually help them get better.
---
I don't give a shit if someone else gets better if I don't know them. We just won't bring them next time. I don't know the answers. But what you are suggesting basically amounts to just posting "yo google it retard" after posting the damage meter. Wow, how would they ever have figured that out?
---
if you needed a thing you don't need, I would probably leave group after that, and I think most people would.
---
Which is why you only use it immediately after an AA. A 1s delay on AA is worth MS level damage
---
Different definition of what it means to play on a PVP server. To some people, we are supposed to be at war, and killing anyone of the opposite faction is part of the game. Contested regions are supposed to be dangerous. Group up and defend your weak, take back control of quest objectives.
---
That said, corpse camping in any scenario, unless they initiate the fight when they revive instead of running away, is griefing.
---
going through peoples post history for ammo is cringe.
---
Well when its in the first 20 lvl ok, thats an excuse.
---
From that point on, its not ok to need on everything, unless you actually need it..
---
Doesn't matter. Had a Sony Trinitron 15" and later 17". That thing blew the early LCD right out of the water. The monitor itself was simply glorious and flat ...best shit Sony designed for pc imho.
---
I've been duo leveling with another paladin while speced as holy, and it is totally doable. my partner is playing as ret, and right now at level 35, i'm only doing slightly less dps than he is. having a ret pally partner provide blessing of might, seal of the crusader, and sanctity aura really boosts your damage, and all the spell power gear you take basically compensates for not picking up strength gear.
---
really, the only problem is that you tend to be really really squishy unless you manage to supplement your equipment with a piece or two of mail / plate.
---
It's very simple. Paladin sees item. Paladin needs item. Paladin needs every item. You do not invite paladin.
---
it was an excellent monitor
---
"The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, while expecting different results."
---
If you press key combination once and your game closes, that might have just been a coincidence. When you press the same keys the second time and your game closes, you should see a pattern. The third time you press the same fucking keys and your game closes, you are an actual moron.
---
You talked about 'broken' in the title, none of these things are broken - they are all design choices and intentional. 
---
There are definitely QoL things in retail that are much more enjoyable, but your list would be different to mine, and both to a third guy's. Where Blizzard draw lines will always cause rifts and anger ('why did X class get this tweak and my class got nerfed'), and it's better they don't try imo. If they added new content I'd hope only for instances/raids/quests/reps and nothing in terms of balance or class mechanics. And if anyone disagrees it just proves my point.
---
He‚Äôs dumber than a bag of hammers. His interviews are retarded and he constantly interrupts to ask or say stupid irrelevant crap.
---
Hes thinking of the bigglesworth Boiz of alliance side probably. They're gettin a bad rep
---
This helmet looks dope af equipped. Need to craft mine still. Just made the mission out to azshara for the plans:)
---
There is the immensely popular VanillaFriends website.
---
best question zone at 51. Just run around kill EVERYTHING you see and turn your quests in!
---
I‚Äôm like 51% sure I checked there. You sure?
---
I don‚Äôt know man, there is a LOT of cement/mortar used in Stormwind. All that CO^2 released into the air...
---
the only annoying thing here is your selfish asses
---
It's not lame if it keeps on working.
---
you ask the tank to pull in to the room that was previous and clear.
---
I‚Äôll google it!
---
&gt;  the first 20 levels have been miserable. 
---
Weird; I have a Warrior, and the first 10 levels were actually amazing (after buying some 2H sword from the AH). The "power" wore off towards the end of Goldshire and into Westfall though.
---
It's absolutely not growing, that's for sure. If you have altism and play multiple differently leveled characters you notice pretty quickly.
---
I'm sorry but this is hilarious
---
THEY.... MUG PEOPLE?
---
Ya but it isn't as cool! Loved it when you can almost 1 hit someone from a cool wf crit.
---
I too, hate when people say toons. I know they‚Äôre a boomer.
---
Last night I had to go to STV in order to help a few lowbies from my guild, Horde was chain-killing them and not letting them complete quests or do anything, as a level 60 I went to their quest camp and killed every horde (even the 60s) and NPC on sight, few hours after that I got an e-mail from Blizz saying I could get banned for doing this, and i'm not the only one who got this mail according to some 60s who were in the area at that time.
---
To be honest man I agree. Im only 45 but from all the comments / vids etc i was expecting way way harder time. I have almost maxed cooking / first aid / alchemy and it doesnt feel hard. a bit more time consuming, but not hard.
---
Got a warrior to 60, hunter is 10 and it feels 100% quicker.
---
I didnt know macros could be used for anything other than casting spells. how does a macro for buying something work/look like?
---
They will also have no value on patch release because hundreds of people will save up for them just like you.
---
They'll only be valuable after the initial server-wide stockpile is finally depleted. Which would take some time.
---

I was wracking my brain trying to remember what we called the player character in UO. I was pretty sure it wasn't toon, and I don't recall hearing char until Diablo 1.  
---
Seems so obvious now and I feel like a fool for forgetting.
---
This isn't even Ironforge which has A LOT more Alliance in it ATM.
---
7:50 P.M. on a Tuesday (raid night, I know) Heartseeker-Alliance. 
---
Transfers seem to be closing soon. Horde, please transfer over before it's too late. A LOT of Alliance to kill here.
---
Oh right sorry :S
---
True actually
---
yup! most random world mobs have small chances at dropping purple boes
---
Caution: Remember Windows Key+Ctrl+F4 before continuing. 
---
How about using Windows Key+Ctrl+D instead of Alt+F4? That's one most people aren't used to yet. Try it, I'll wait... It opens a new virtual desktop, so it looks like everything you had open got closed, but it's not. It's like having a whole separate login if you want to, oh, I don't know... surf the internet while you're supposed to be doing homework, so you have one virtual desktop with just your homework open like a good focused student, and another virtual desktop with more interesting things open. Then you can Windows Key+Ctrl+Right and Windows Key+Ctrl+Left to swap between them when dad comes to check on you and make sure you're working. The Windows Key+Ctrl+F4 thing closes the current virtual desktop.
---
The best is people glitching in the corner across from here where they can attack you but you can‚Äôt see or reach them
---
&gt;where you can fish all day, or dance on top of a mailbox if that's what you want to do.
---
In the end you are correct, people can enjoy the game has they want. It also happen that I enjoy mocking some of those ways and I am free to do so :)
---
What add-on is that to make the words all gibberish on the map and chat?
---
Google it. IMDB gave it 5.7/10 and it made me hate IMDB for ratings. Logan was also in The Thinning and The Space Between Us
---
Bro wtf? They told him to do it. He doesn‚Äôt know how to. Then is told to keep trying. You‚Äôre a fucking loser dude. Go away. He asked for help and got continuously trolled. You‚Äôre part of the problem you fuck nut. Go away.
---
Sent me a stack of Nightfin soup on my mage. Was very much appreciated all things considering.
---
I‚Äôve played for years and leveled during tbc and vanilla and because of that era I had to have a healing set and a tanking set.
---
That being said, I knew my main spec is Ret. so I‚Äôm going to roll for Ret. my off spec is holy and prot. But they‚Äôre offspec. Meaning they are secondary. Meaning that if there‚Äôs a mage who needs the int neck then I pass even if I‚Äôm holy. I also state that I will be rolling on off spec if no one needs it for their main.
---
So far no one has had issues with the way I do things. I think it‚Äôs fair. If anything someone may be mad that I‚Äôm healing as ret and taking dps gear lmao
---
If you haven‚Äôt pretended to be a pet, are you even a Druid?
---
See my alt is a warrior and I feed him gear 
---
The first 25 levels were sooooooo easy.
---
He now has a stupid amount of blues from sfk and WC. I'm making him into a level 29 twink and remaking a warrior to level to 60.
---
Idk I agree with OP. Warrior isnt that bad at all.
---
If you just spam as a tank it ain't going to be that slow
---
his bottom right action bar on the right image shows no key modifiers.
---
[LMGTFY](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=classic+wow+warrior+macros)
---
Are you speccing fury and taking the slam talent?
---
Probably just a catch all. People reported the original grieves, so they just sent out a blanket email to everybody involved in the incident
---
It's not irrelevant, IMO - requiring 5 people to commit their time in order to balance out one person's power is bad game balance. And balance is actually important in PVP - maybe more so than in PVE. Power differentials are fine, as long as the person who has more power than you actually earned that power in a way you can aspire to. "Because they paid more" is not a good reason for someone to be more powerful than me in PVP.
---
Clearly we either disagree on what counts as pay-to-win, or on whether p2w is a bad thing. Either way, thanks for actually engaging me rather than just making another "nuh-uh" comment :)
---
What point are you trying to prove with your unbuffed mana pool of the gear I have zero concept of. Sounds like you need intellect from 8 pieces of tier gear.
---
How is me saying I‚Äôm glad that I‚Äôve killed a boss after the games been out for a month ‚Äòoverselling‚Äô
---
lmao... i was tanking and did the same thing. He flamed striked the ground so I was like "oh, i'll just move over to the edge here so i'm not standing in his flamestrike" the second i got to the edge of the platform i got punted into the lava.... lul
---
Is fearing not considered to be an attack?  
---
Also, can't you put the whole process into 1 macro? Something like:  
---
/tar Qia  
---
/press InteractWithTargetHotkey  
---
/run BuyMerchantItem(30,1)  
---
/run MerchantFrame:Hide()  
---
Sorry if the question is stupid, I am new to WoW.
---
No you didn‚Äôt. You distrusted a community. It‚Äôs not a simple ‚ÄúI went and PvP‚Äù because this happens every single night on Sulfuras that some town is raided for over an hour until it‚Äôs defended again by the high lvls. You distrusted game play some how that you‚Äôre not telling and trying to get brownie points for whining about it.
---
Does Lorti even have any configuration options? I installed it recently too and I thought it just made things darker and that was it. I‚Äôm curious if there is an option menu somewhere
---
Oh I understand now, I don't think bartender can do it, but haven't looked into that tbh, sorry that I wasn't of any help.
---
I can agree with that. But assuming they're not just looking for a carry and it is a kill quest or just farming rep, may as well group up.
---
Yeah what a dumbass trusting people fr 
---
This attitude is so fucking toxic holy shit
---
Its great for stirring up the hornets nest, as a 60 if your looking for pvp doing something like slaughtering everyone at nessings then waiting there is almost a guarantee that someone higher level will show up to fight you.
---
Putting a few people down in questing areas also keeps things civil for our lowbie allies :)
---
Also watching them try out run the dots is fun.  When it comes to camping lowbies though thats a shit move.
---
Just fight mobs 1-2 levels lower than you. You wont miss as much and you'll generate tonnes of rage through your fury talents and DW.
---
Now fighting higher level mobs DW? That's a death wish
---
Love these moments :")
---
If you‚Äôre a Tauren you can get away with 0 points in NG.  Warstomp, regrowth, rejuvenate.  Besides NG never procs at convenient times anyway.  It‚Äôs like windfury.  It procs when they have like 2% health.
---
Basicaly, they alow what you did but with a limit, and you went over that limit. At least that is what i  think it happened
---
Did you delete your post?
---
Look at the action bars, shortcuts etc. - you play way more efficient now. I still don't get how you guys are able to play classic. I died of boredome  like 15 lvl in. 
---
Maybe that's because I leveled up like 1-2 chars each xpac and know every damn combination of char and class from the ground and did the fucking quests a thousand times. Cataclysm was so epic in that aspect, as I finally got something new to see and play. Hell, the fucking quest giver quest with dumass, the pussy Dk and Jonny awesome still makes me laught my ass off. 
---
That's also the biggest problem for me now. Wow got to easy. Not in terms of playing the game, but in terms of complexity. I want my reforging, avoid, parry, soft/hard caps etc. Back. Also my skills trees. Give me the active skill stuff (the idea behind it is fine) and a separate passive skill tree, so I can select +3% avoid on my ice dk tank again instead of 3%hp, so I can feel special again, like the small, unique snowflake I wanna be from time to time.
---
You're doing it wrong. Since everyone is selling silk at vendor prices, you should be buying, not selling. Buy the silk for 1s51c, turn it into a silk bandage and sell to vendor for 2s.
---
Say sorry I can't dont have it leveled, come back later when they gone
---
The true way to RP a rogue lol
---
https://xkcd.com/242/
---
Yup, OP got BURNED!
---
Alliance scum.
---
The fact that he is dumb (?), his interviews are retarded (???) and that he interrupts (that I can see) doesn't mean that his, obviously extremely knowledgeable guests, are wrong about their respective classes, in this situation LMGD.
---
They're probably waiting for BG's to be released and helping the opposition get to level. The more 60's there  the better the wpvp is as well.
---
could solo farm ZF GY or SM wings as well
---
Something something lucky ten thousand
---
Not everyone, even WoW players, are extremely online NEETs, believe it or not.
---
We don't have trinkets yet.  Pvp will change a lot when we do.
---
Druids can tank everything.
---
Well, you can use 1 shadow priest to boost warlock's damage output.
---
Thanks for that man. Got me more pumped to get to high level. I'm gunna wowhead some info tonight on BiS gear
---
30 day ban here too using VPN. Figure I‚Äôd be slick leveling while sitting through 4 days of 10 hour video conferences for work.
---
Not to the second smh
---
The spec skill numbers do nothing except flavor as far as I know.
---
The weapon skill difference is pretty important for melee classes, especially since there's virtually no +hit chance gear until high level, and it's why races with weapon skill bonuses almost always try to use that weapon type. Same for party/block.
---
The talent point is self explanatory, though 20, 30, and 40 tend to be especially significant as most specs have a one-point major ability at 10, 20, and 30 points.
---
Hard disagree
---
Whatever horde...
---
This reminds me if Basin, in Razor Hill. They RP'd a magic basin. It was glorious.
---
Unfortunately NE!
---
FUNNIEST part imo is the fact he didnt even care to atleast mail it to an alt or something before throwing it up on the AH
---
Put your pet on passive and do dungeons.  Wolves are great passive pets because they provide a buff.
---
I've seen the pattern for Minor Beastslayer drop, it's available
---
Cheaper repair costs?? You will be spending quite a lot of gold in the AQ+ range for repair costs.. would suggest at least revered
---
I can‚Äôt really speak for the resto build but I‚Äôm rolling the Hotw spec (1/29/21) and I personally don‚Äôt need to ever change it. It‚Äôs allows me to play my Druid how I want to and I can do any 5 man dungeon as whatever I want with it.. I‚Äôm mainly focused on wpvp and bgs when they come out and will keep the same spec most likely
---
Weird they only mentioned NPCs in the email, sounds like bullshit my dude
---
he's right. Why should you be entitled to gear you can't even wear? Makes no sense other than greed.
---
This is almost a necessity for a warrior, gotta link the needed weapons with the specific stance in the macro.
---
Aww, would've been neat if they left that in.
---
you got me ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
---
Cause when you get dismounted by the other faction you wont have your bomb dispenser ready to blow
---
Yes this, or there‚Äôs great grinding to be had in desolace.
---
Like I said, I killed every NPC in the horde STV camp and all players, killing NPCs is bannable now?
---
Combat is pretty bad for PvP, but Riposte can be situationally useful. Getting improved sprint instead is an option... but honestly even with imp sprint, you are still going to get kited and destroyed by ranged without Prep.
---
Improved Sprint is good in some Prep builds, like Sub Daggers.
---
I thought it wasn't bad at all too, until I started leveling a alt. Realized how much easier other classes have it.
---
It's not a solution, because there will always be people like me who would rather just buy a recipe on the AH and carry on with my business than spend hours competing with others while doing nothing. 20-50g is absolutely nothing to many people, and a price I'd be happy to pay to not have to idle in wintergrasp.
