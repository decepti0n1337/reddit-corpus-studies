Hunter or Warrior, absolutely.  Hunter can avoid the burst, Warrior can out-burst you.

I had multiple people tell me yesterday that it's ninja looting and they would try to blacklist for that.
---

---
Like OK m8 you'll be blacklisting half the server
---
STVietnam, and just the options from 32-38 have taken more wow toon lives than anything else.
---
Thats a fact lol. If i need someone to run straight at an elite lvl, i know who to call.
---
Classic is more tedious and the experiences are more social.  If you like a more social and immersive world you might like classic.
---
Safe zones =/= bad. 
---
Anything that incentivizes player action is good. Group duels would do exactly that. It's not going to kill world PvP.
---
Yes. Everything you wish you could have done more if you will need to do in classic
---
Raiders in a serious progression guild always have better gear than someone that just does pvp.
---
guy straight up stole the guide from incorrect XP value speed run on a private server, hardly any hard work was done
---
Seriously, I don‚Äôt get it. Their preference is that everyone greeds, even though they know there are people that will take advantage of that and roll need and sell it and nobody else even gets a chance.
---
Yeah I was confused by this too... not much more you can do to prepare besides knowing what abilities to NOT buy while leveling to 40, and knowing which zones you are going to at certain points.
---
No thanks! Maybe put that in live.
---
Game gets harder late 50s, there are actually a lot of dungeons to do but they are hard. Also far less quests and themepark all but dies. I think this is why most of the drop off occurs at this level range, but its far less impactful than the 30-40 drop off is; imo.
---
Druid. They have a few specs but my favorite two would be heart of the wild 0/30/21 or swiftmend spec with furor and feral charge + nature‚Äôs grasp. You can tank, heal, dps, pve, pvp and farm.
---
I remember our guild leader had a rule the if you started to pvp in brm on the run to a raid you would be kicked from the raid for the night. I always wanted to join in the pvp chaos but we had to quickly go through the mountain like we were a school of fish. I remember the floor just being littered with skeletons and little pvp battles taking places all around the chain to either mc or bwl.
---
OP mouth breather confirmed
---
Not only do you have to communicate, you have to inspect the person to see them equip it. *and even they might want to rather sell it instead*
---
All-need is the only non-communication method that works flawlessly and is always fair. And if someone makes a mistake and passes/greeds? No problem, you just ask for /rolls and proceed. It's a BOE. You can fix mistakes
---
&gt;The issue has been dealt with in retail with modern internet infrastructure.
---
Partially with shading.... so no thanks.
---
Sorry can't hear you over the sound of how wrong you are.  Everyone sitting at major cities is what made wow shit and you're trying to argue that people sitting at massive cities isn't bad.
---
Anyway the whole point is moot, I don't understand how you people don't get it.  NO CHANGES
---
They have to dismount for some doors too, though there is a tiny handful they can mount through that the male tauren cannot.
---
At 60 and  while getting to 60, if you don't plan on having any alts - go gathering.
---
Alchemy will need herbs - herbing is one of the most reliable. 
---
Outside of that, level up fishing.
---
The issue are the quest are low then high so you get wide travel times unless you are higher when you first go there.
---
Which Guild? I'd be impressed to see a Guild full of lionheart helmets within 30 days.
---
Bandwidth isn't the same as latency.  You do not know what you're talking about.
---
could you please explain how is the feature exploitable? is it exploitable by the players?
---
This is exactly how I felt with my guild. We had a core group of 25-30 people who were consistently available and competent, but had to fill in the gaps sometimes with severely undergeared characters and people unfamiliar with raid mechanics. The guild in total had over 100 active members.
---
It took a long time but we did eventually become the second Alliance guild on our server to clear BWL with our ragtag group of misfits.
---
Might be easy and straight forward but every quest past 30 has vastly incorrect XP values, causing you to grind 10 times more than you have to
---
Wearing a shield.  A Prot Warrior can wear a shield and still generate solid threat due to their talents.  A Fury Warrior with a shield is not DW, and thus has no real advantage over a Prot war.
---
Essentially you are saying that a shield is not necessary.  We shall see if thats true or not.
---
Hunter

Truth.  I eventually quit WoW because my guilds raiding schedule was too demanding, but I absolutely cherished the vanilla days and managed to hold down by first professional job without issue.

I used to be a pvp server for life kind of guy back when I played WoW in my teens. Now as an older gamer I think I just want a more relaxing pve server experience where I don't need to worry about being ganked when I just want to log in to do a quest or 2.
---
The idea is that wyvern is your opener. You sleep a non dwarf. It‚Äôs different in concept from concussive‚Äî think of it as an opener vs a self preservation play. I feel like you‚Äôre ignoring the text portion of this post. Tauren and engineer can make up for concussive and sort of renders it redundant‚Äî some of it‚Äî not all of it, making a unique skill like wyvern worthwhile
---
Yes and no. Alliance actually has to go out into the contested territory by level 20 while horde can mostly just stay in the barrens like weak babies and ignore the fact that the crossroads is under attack for much longer.
---
How do you make money off fishing? Vendor all,sell rare fish or what? Only tried it once for about 15 minutes ..
---
Too many RNG items my friend. Your pre-raid list is certainly impressive but farming specific gear with the ‚Äúof the {something}‚Äù for so many slots is going to be tedious to say the least. Maybe some alternatives might come in handy.
---
Yeah, basically the route will be extremely inconsistent and you'll have to grind every single level to reach the correct level for the next area of quests instead of following a guide that actually uses the correct values, giving you less grind time and much faster leveling....
---
For the record, my post had nothing to do with this.
---
Can make it into food if you level cooking, or just put it on the AH, some fish sell better than others.
---
I feel personally attacked
---
Hear hear!
---
It will be interesting to see how these various numbers we've learned about will affect the world buff situation.  Guilds might not want to take the risk of a Fury tank if one wipe is gonna undo a week of buff farming.
---
Perhaps if the net result of all this is harder raiding, world buffs in general are not going to be obsessed over because wipes are going to be normal and it would be pointless to spend inordinate amounts of time farming buffs that might only last for one pull.
---
I guess you wasn't happy with 80% downvotes so you try again?
---
Millions of people enjoyed it without never playing it the first time around.
---
THE DEFILERS
---
Okay you're getting pretty hostile so this'll be my last message.
---
Women served but not in combat roles. Does the game have to be 100% historically accurate to get immersed into it? Medieval Europe was very homogeneous and the developers decided to make their game that way as well. Doesn't mean fans have a problem with black people. I think they got annoyed because people wanted to change the game.
---
Obviously you're much more informed of the drama in the gaming world since I hadn't heard of any of these. I recognize how it might bother people but I'm not convinced it's anything but a few loud neck beards and the media trying to profit from the controversy. In my country we've had more than a few "controversies" that turned out to be one guy tweeting. That teen getting harassed though, that's obviously not cool.
---
To me logically if an all male guild is sexist, then an all woman guild must be as well. Somehow I get the feeling that you don't have a problem with an all woman guild and have an answer ready for why that is. Why not let the boys play in their own little space? There'll still be dozens of guilds to choose from.
---
wait its actually real lmao?
---
That's not entirely true. Its already been proven that you can set up alts in different layers on demand and keep them in that said layer.
---
Once you have your alts setup all in different layers, then you can join any layer you wish on demand bc you join the last layer your account was on. Oh and that layer cooldown does nothing to hinder this. 
---
Source: that video/ streamer who throughly tested this and made a video on how to do this.

&gt; I posted about this a few days ago
---
It wasnt even 24h ago...
---
Appears to be a hunter based on the context. The memes are true, they really do want everything.
---
Duo sheeping happened all the time.
---
It wasn't even 24h ago dude...
---
Priest wasn't that bad.. but lfr in classic?! I'm tempted to make a mage now just to show up on time, do the trick and then log on my main
---
I guess it‚Äôs just a totally different philosophy if you think letting someone have an item that has actually dropped that they are going to use is stealing loot vs taking it to sell for the gold value. It would suck to see something awesome you could really use drop just to have someone else take it for the ah; I‚Äôm not gonna be the guy that does that to someone, and it‚Äôs unfortunate that so many people are totally ok with doing that.
---
Wowhead has a shared cooldown tab for all trinkets.
---
In orgrimmer, outside orgrimmar.  It makes no difference.
---
People interacting isn't what makes vanilla good people interact in all expansions.
---
Rogue Blind is missing. Arguably the most OP combat CC in the game.
---
Oh, you will be.
---
I predict that some karmawhore will remind everyone on July 31st, something like "Tomorrow is August, when WoW Classic Launches! Rejoice". Probably a July 27th one too, "Exactly 1 month away!"
---
Then, another clown will post of August 1st, "At the end of this month Classic Launches!"
---
You'll be reminded a bunch on August 12th and 13th of course.
---
Then, the "just two weeks away", multiple "one week away" posts, those daily countdowns starting from day five or day ten god forbid, and finally the day before you'll be reminded a dozen times.
---
Why not just save yourself the agony and ask if someone needs it, and then roll accordingly?
---
Chances are that BOE rules are set when you cross the instance line, decided on by the group. If you feel strongly about letting someone else win, pass.
---
If the only issue with Cata was that you couldn't farm, classic definitely has that. It's more gritty, slow, rewarding farming. It feels closer to a DND sesh than to current wow with more character identity. 
---
That being said, everything is slower, a LOT slower. Slower actions per minute in combat, slower movement, slower everything. IMO, it makes the world feel bigger and every reward feel more important. But you could get bored. 
---
If after a month you don't feel an itch to get or grind for something, it's probably not for you.
---
&gt;What is the best way for PvP players to gear in Classic?
---
To raid.
---
&gt;at what raid tier do raiders become stronger than PvP players?
---
In first tier - unless we're speaking about nolife 0.1% PvPers who have R14 gear.
---
\-and now I have it stuck in my head without even clicking the link. *Fuck*.

You clear BWL in 30 mins...and you don't even consider the possibility that maybe something isn't quite right with the tuning?

Will of arlokk because it's the coolest looking staff and I used it all through bc with a spirit enchant as my innervate staff.
---
Ok seems like I missed some points you made here and there since we scattered the discussion over the whole Post and replied to different arguments with stuff that got answered at other parts of the discussion. Sure BiS is Troll we can agree on that. During P1 and P2 the best weapon is Perditionsblade. The best tank gloves are T1 which are a few stats better than ACLG, but got 1 less crit. (some armor, some defense, 1 hit and some more str vs 1 crit) In P3 and P4 the best weapon is Crul. The best tank gloves are still T1. So In that period of time a Orc with Crul and T1 is better, thats true. Now going into AQ40 things change, you get GoA, Deathsting, Gauntlets of steadfast and all the items linked to the armament (and you get the dagger from the scepter quest). There it becomes Deathsting+ACLG  vs Crul+GoA in terms of TPS. The difference here is like 2.3speed, 1 hit, 20 Str, 3 stamina 450ish armor vs 1.8 speed, 3 more weaponskill, 2 AP more and 3.6 dps more.  If you dual wield Deathsting+Pugio vs Crul+AQ40 the pugio will push daggers - with 1 more hit and 4 more AP and 3 less stamina. so it basically comes down to 20 str and 485 armor vs 3 weaponskill 3.6 dps (ignoring the few AP and Stamina) and the tauren racial would add 300HP-550HP depending on buffs etc, which converts to 30-55 stamina. Therefore you have 20str 2.3 speed vs 1.8 speed, 3 weaponskill and 3.6 dps on offensive side and 485 armor vs 30-55 stamina on the defensive side. I don't know about you but I'd chose the daggers on a tauren over the axes on an orc looking at these numbers. On top of that Tauren bring the Warstomp which occasionally helps on trash pulls. Therefore Tauren are better in p5 than orcs for tanking. Imo even UD are better since WotF has way too many situations where its useful, even though they do not have the 30-55 stamina. As we both noted at different stages of the discussion: MT going Axes will result in him getting pro since he is the most important person of the raid and should get whatever he deems necessary, but fishing in traditional DPS loot will result in drama, which is as we all know a big guildkiller in wow. We don't need to compare Naxx daggers vs Naxx axes imo since not much changes (if you don't take Kingsfall into account) and I think we can agree on that 36 AP isn't better than 1 hit and 8 stamina and 8 agi and there aren't any TPS Gauntlets added after that. This ofc didn't compare satura gloves with ACLG, but wearing satura gloves will always just widen the gap between the TPS of daggers and Axes - and on fights where you need to wear the satura gloves for max Mitigation, TPS isn't that important and you TPS without the 5 weaponskill will most likely be sufficient. After all you can wear sutra gloves on trash as orc or non-orc since weaponskill isn't as important vs a mob with your lvl as it is against bosses anyways and most trash is taunt able so thats that.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Therefore Daggers on a tauren are better in p1 and p2 (assuming they add ACLG to the loot table from the start) and p5+p6 than axes on a orc. 
---
An Orctank will have an easier time during BWL farm and in AQ40 progression - but at the same time your fury dps are missing out on a Crul and a DB (assuming you took one for tanking in p1&amp;p2) and GoA. And somewhere in between AQ40 and Naxx you can at least start to expect getting a TF which would reduce the discussion to: Warstomp+5%HPvsStunresist of 25%. 
---
You could add that Anihilator and Nightfall both benefit from the orc racial which makes Orcs a little better overall, but in my opinion, it doesn't make them better than tauren  (or UD but I am heavily biased when it comes to UD so just ignore that).
---
My first green weapon. Which means at l 8 it will be either a dagger or mace. Depends on which way I decide to go with my rogue.
---
Thanks for you reply.
---
What values are wrong? Damage values? Irrelevant as I insta kill enemies, and I explained in the video why I do that. But for you again: To reduce the time necessary FOR YOU,THE VIEWER. Noone wants to see me doing a 20mob kill quest for 10minutes 500times over the course from lvl 18-60. Furthermore the traveling time is boring as well. 
---
What other values could be wrong? Experience gained?  
---
Well I have got a shocker for you: I told you guys to do deadmines 6times total to get to 21. Those 6 suggested runs are from CLASSIC BETA FOOTAGE. I have,as explained in the video, watched hundreds of videos of footage from different levels and dungeons to do the math and put the numbers into the guide itself. Need an example?  
---
Deadmines:  
---
 Level 18: Roughly 14-15 Bars per Dungeon
---
Level 19:Roughly 13 Bars per Dungeon
---
Level 20: Roughly 12 Bars per Dungeon
---
Level 21: Roughly 9-10 Bars per dungeon 
---
If you do the math now you will see,again as mentioned in the video, that you will be close to 22 actually in comparison to my suggested level 21after 6runs of DM.
---
Sorry that you didnt have the patience to watch at least 5minutes of the video where I actually explain that stuff :(
---
NE can often use shadowmeld after fearing and running, in a macro to also eat/drink. They can also use this macro after winning Or if they see a gank coming to heal up some. With a 10s CD it can be used often. In BGs (WSG, in particular) after winning a fight you can use this macro to eat/drink and avoid new/range classes from easily stopping your eat/drink. 
---
I agree with Starshards largely, Holy priest do dps in raids on trash and some bosses, guild/farm depending. In this case, starshards may see some use but it is very limited by its cast time.
---
Dwarf is just such a good priest that you cannot beat it. I always suggest if you don't like the look of dwarf (thus are going to role a different class), just go NE. Humans are trash that offer 5% spirit which is fine but a joke compared to what Dwarves offer and shit in pvp.
---
classic is definitely not delaying every spell 400ms.
---
I've got a bridge in Oklahoma to sell you if you actually believe layering on live is going to be the same as it was on the beta a month ago.
---
And there is no Spider Web ability for Hunter pets in Classic.
---
cause fuck people with latency greater than 100?  of which there will be many.
---
Mage was the hardest class to do. Would feel too forced. Theyre straight up op in every way smh.
---
Not hard to ask them to equip it on the spot, and if they don‚Äôt then you know not to group with them again
---
I RP a meth addict so the constant hoping is in character.
---
If you are using a repack, you can change the XP rates in 'mangosd.conf' file to better simulate the beta values:
---
     Rate.XP.Kill    = 0.28
---
     Rate.XP.Kill.Elite = 1.25
---
This is for simulating a 5 man dungeon group XP as a solo player.
---
Hopefully everyone does so its fair lol.
---
Wow what great proof, you totally convinced me. Please don't go Tauren Warrior you will be a PvP god and I want to roll alliance.
---
It's a social game. This means actual players can organize these things themselves.
---
Thinking we need to automate this stuff is what ruined MMORPGs.
---
Well if this is the case then my searches are throwing everyone off. I went from 100% of rolling priest to wanting a human rogue for 2 months and now I'm thinking dwarf hunter.
---
Thunderfury, duh.
---
Mage in vanilla really needs good execution to shine.
---
Thanks man, the idea was just to have the very best there but encourage people to take the greens until they can get the bis. Some people have more time than others so some people will def be able to get these bad boys. Also the lord incendius one can be solod or farmed with a friend which is really nice.
---
It's equal preraid bis.
---
And for the third time, if hunters always passed it to melee, they would literally never get it.
---
I think the word you‚Äôre looking for is wary
---
Pine cone staff. I always wanted one on my shaman for shits and giggles but we didn‚Äôt see many of them. Now I‚Äôm rolling Druid so it‚Äôs obviously necessary
---
Im not enough of a dick to post it but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't thinking the same thing lol
---
It's literally the only preraid trinket with attack power on it (for Alliance)
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
&gt;Why would you EVER want this?
---
Because you have high latency and don't want to be completely unable to compete in pvp?  Or constantly be behind your group in dungeon runs?
---
Even when killing 15 bosses/hour. Wow they must have really nerfed enchanting in the re-release. Hope you make a post showing what is different. Very cool.
---
No you aren't doing it to someone, that is just the way it works. Remove the feels and work from principle. This way when things don't work out magically for you don't have to have your feels suffer (as you have avoided the hunter that Needs on everything steal everything). You don't get mad, you don't have to deal with an ninja looter, you have CREATED an environment /situation that isn't (is less) exploitable.  
---
Don't create moral hazards for people to fall into, pick the logical option.
---
Barrens chat content will change, but it will still exist. Instead of teenagers making chuck norris jokes and whatnot you'll have teenagers talking with twitch emotes and calling people boomers.
---
Remind me why we expect, and base all our recommendations to new players off of end game raiding?
---
You can tell people that they're likely to only find a reliable raid slot as a given spec for a given class, but you shouldn't actively try to dissuade them from playing something they want to play, just give them realistic expectations.  Lets not pretend that you can't bring 15 meme specs to a raid and still do completely fine, you just will have a harder time, and won't be pushing world firsts.  But again, lets not pretend that any majority of people, much less new people who you feel the need to give class/spec recommendations to, are going to be in a guild pushing world/server firsts or super speed farm runs.
---
Let people play whatever, you just aren't obligated to bring them to your groups, and they aren't obligated to conform to your standards.

Girlfriend/wife tells you she's pregnant?  Bubble hearth out.

They don't need it. The druids also will not get it and everyone knows it can help then Resto druids proc OoC.
---
That is correct! Flagged  = PvP.
---
Purging arcane power/presence of mind is always fun
---
Who has better uptime? Who causes the overall raid to lose less dps?
---
Doubtful
---
Your work has crayons? That‚Äôs awesome.
---
A lot of people don't like to level fishing.

You can get lock boxes and trunks that have green or blue items.
---
The rate fish sells good and is used in Cooking and Alchemy.

If you want to make consistent money as a Warrior go Fishing/Cooking/Herbalism/Alchemy.

You can make Potions/Flasks/Food for raids and also sell Transmuted.

Honestly I absolutely love running into new players out in the world. 
---
Seriously people let's get back into the mindset of growing the game.  If you have someone trying tanking out for the first time and maybe not doing the best dont just shout and complain, ask them if they would like some help instead of just telling them what to do.  Offering help goes a lot further than telling
---
I didn't get a chance to play WoW back in vanilla sincr I started in Wrath but I found a pserver and have been practicing on there to get an idea roughly how it feels.  I was also a huge fan of things like skill trees which when they gutted it honestly was one of the things that started to deter me from retail.
---
Ret pally PvP is actually good.
---
Not to the extent that dynamic respawns would since layering is temporary and most people won't even be 60 during that period
---
I think you might be missing the point. I don‚Äôt want to speak for him but it would seem the video outlines your BIS gear and consumables for max dps in phase 1. He said multiple times that those pieces would be hard to get. It‚Äôs more of a proof of concept that balance can hang in there with dps if you put the work in.
---
Too risky, could be a queue to login
---
I love this advice. Make your own way through the world. Make mistakes. Pick up shitty gear. 
---
In the end you will be a better player because of it from having learned yourself.
---
Lots and lots of Manual Crowd Pummelers
---
I feel that you spent way too much time on your intro and picked a bad format.
---
The thing is, there are a ton of shit guides out there. It is reasonable or a person, seeing a new content creator (to them), to expect the same.
---
So how do I know this guide is going to be good? Well, I would have to see something of interest or value. 
---
I got to about 8 minutes and 43 seconds of preamble. And at this point, I have learned that 
---
- bronze tubes are useful
---
- you can buy them at the engineering vendor (good luck doing this at launch). 
---
This seems like you didn't use the first 8 minutes and 43 seconds very well at all. 
---
What makes your guide DIFFERENT? That's what I would focus on in the preamble. Why does this exist? What insight has your testing brought?
---
For example, one angle you could go with is this:
---
"After testing, I realized that you don't get to run low level instances very many times before outleveling them. Therefore, it is essential for gear dependent classes to do high value quests to keep their gear relevant, rather than relying on drops that they will not have the repitition to secure. This guide attempts to path a 5 man party through the zones and dungeons to acccomplish that".
---
I would watch a 23 minute video that did that. A clear mission statement with a relevant goal that is credible. 
---
But that's not what your preamble says. Your preamble is all about "How to use the guide", not enough "Why should I use this guide". 
---
And if you don't have a why, I wouldn't be making guides.
---
I did this bc there was only 2-3 other people I could see.
---
Wouldnt that make ot worse? What if a group of players got to 60 first week and camped 5 layers of resources.
---
Quit your job to hit R14

If you are on an RP server, you can also do an Aladdin Cosplay. But don‚Äôt do that.
---
Look up the fish needed for alchemy. They usually sell well. There are also some fish you can cook for good buffs.
---
Floating debris usually gives you boxes that contain cloth, potions, etc. that are also easy to convert into gold.
---
Lol sorry. If it made the poster happy. Draw on. But jesus
---
&gt;It really wont.
---
Sure it will. You said it yourself:
---
&gt;very late game or with TF
---
We just have different opinions of "very late game." Maladath is available in the first phase, but tanks shouldn't have trouble holding threat until Vael and later raids regardless of race, so Orc feels like it's just limiting options. It there is a shot at Thunderfury, axe spec becomes worthless.
---
I knew but I tempted the gods by omitting that information. Now I have come to atone for my sins.

You don't need to be on an rp server to play with your snake.

Average of 25 attack power.  Also 2% hit for that time and because its a 20sec / 2mCD You can unload for those 20 secs and get even more use than 25 attack power.

The distance between the servers and the users has not changed at all, in the last 15 years.  Latency hasn't changed nearly as much as bandwidth has.
---
&gt; that‚Äôs OK because I don‚Äôt have to join your runs.
---
No shit, no way am I going to join a ML 5 man with items on reserve, fucking dungeon groups arnt that damn rare to deal with that headache. I'll wipe 50 times and stick it out to the end, if I see the shit changed to ML I'll bounce immediately I dont give a damn if were on the last boss.

Traps can sometimes not be triggered if a player moves over them very quickly (i.e. a Warrior‚Äôs Charge ability). This behavior is consistent with the Reference client.

Posts tagged as humour but aren't funny? Bubble hs out
---
Nobody ever accused Vanilla of being perfectly balanced, but hey thats part of the allure in a way.
---
Funny and well-excecuted, well done!
---
In wotlk you could use bladestorm the same time you were sheeped, for a split second you‚Äôd turn into a sheep, and then you‚Äôd return to normal and start spinning. Same goes for any stun (hammer of justice). You‚Äôd see the effect for a brief moment, waste your opponents cd, and cancel the stun.
---
It sounds like it‚Äôs a ‚Äúrare‚Äù event, but if you know what your opponent is planning to do (ex: you can usually tell when a rogue is about to blind) you can react at the same time as them. Similar to two opponents killing each other at the same time in Halo 3. More common than you might think, especially when you get to the people practice PvP every day.
---
You‚Äôll learn bro. You‚Äôll learn things the new game will wish you never learned. Not all of Wisdom brings joy ‚Äî but at least it is the truth.
---
Haha np,just reposted it as I had my answer done and I couldnt reply :D Wasnt meant to bash you or something \^\^
---
Well the estimate PER DUNGEON has so many variables that NOONE can tell. My personal group for the race will take 20-25minutes maximum. But those are heavy pserver neckbeards with training on a modified pserver etc. But you cant take this group as your "average joe" group.
---
So I would think for an average group it would take 40minutes and with an asmongold group it takes 1hour :D Sorry,love you asmon &lt;3 And its not just the skill of the respective players is important, their classes are as well. A Warrior-Warrior-Paladin-Hunter-Priest(heal) group will be likely faster than a caster group as they,done properly have literally no downtime(priest finishes off mobs regularly to get the spirit buff) and no need for a tank(pet tank).
---
What I can say is that up to level 40 my guide is equally fast as Joanas guide(as a hunter solo guide) wich is the world record holder for WoW Vanilla.
---
It‚Äôs like suddenly all of your leather is plate, without needing to go out and find plate gear (as a warrior would)
---
Scatter/Freeze trap sharing DR and traps being able to be charged through is not good at all. I reckon many will reroll away, I'll probably still try a hunter as an alt as I've planned but I did want to do a lot of PVP so...
---
Not the news you wanna hear. 
---
It's cool they're fixing the bugs but some of these decisions don't seem right. Correct me if I'm wrong.
---
I just don't understand people on here who say getting to Rank 14 isn't too hard.  I killed myself just to hit 11.  I'm sure I was playing 40-50 hours a week of just battlegrounds, requeuing like a hampster hitting a lever for a food pellet.  I got my epic mount and was done with that.  The decay formula at the high end is so unforgiving you can't let up at all or you will back slide too much.  Good luck, everyone.
---
There wasn't a single good horde warrior in the beta, Orc or Tauren. How would they, even if they were actually the best PvPers, know which one was better without actually ever facing a good player playing either of the races?
---
I want to be clear for all the people who think this, that layering as it‚Äôs implemented will leave you stranded alone all the time. 
---
Many times in beta I‚Äôve been in org only  seeing 1 or 2 people when who reports 50+ 
---
I think the majority don‚Äôt know how it works bc streamers are always in a populated layer
---
Really, i get saying like look at this pserver but just linking to a forum with data is also not allowed.. seems odd.
---
This was pretty unique man gj. Rogue is so true lol.
---
Quel‚ÄôSerrar!
---
Thanks for the critique. I already thought about making a #00 Video to tackle the points you mentioned as I asked myself basically the same question "Why would you trust me, noname youtuber etc".
---
I can assure you though, that the guide is in line with Joanas Guide(World record holder for Vanilla), but he levels solo as hunter and my guide focuses more on 5man,allthough it is possible to do this guide solo too,you just have to find people on your level to do the dungeons multiple times with.
---
Ill look into making the #00 video though :)
---
Great to see some clarity on the shared DR of scatter/freezing. Pretty big nerf to the already gimped hunter
---
And the past...
---
In more ways than one :)
---
Scared if I change it rule 7 will get me!
---
As a paladin, same.
---
This has probably been the best class picking guide I‚Äôve ever seen. Just straight up call out what sucks about everyone and you‚Äôll see what you hate the least.
---
Haha good point, but all the text is about how you are the brave hero. Not a hired thug. They have soldiers ..that are also not with us. I think we are more like a band of mercenaries that were told a lot of sweets words to get us to play ball
---
&gt;sometimes...very quickly
---
WTF
---
Being a healer is a lot of responsibility... and a lot of fun IMO. 
---
I was a healy priest in a server first raid guild (nothing remotely close to competitive world first wise, just server first) 
---
Our first Rag kill is still my number 1 WoW memory to this day.
---
There is one major downside to playing a healer and thats +healing on gear.  Its ubiquitous, it's impossible not to stack because quite simply it's THE most effective stat by a massive margin, more so for some classes than others but always the best.
---
And it doesn't do SHIT for you solo. 
---
Al your raid buddies are getting gear that makes them betting in raids, and at farming, and at questing, and at pvp.
---
Meanwhie you get better at healing, and nothing BUT healing.
---
You're not going to win 40vs100 even with the element of surprise.  You'd have to kill 60 people with no one noticing just to make it a fair fight.  You would take out a few horde, then the other 90 would slaughter you.  You're not going to establish position when your that outnumbered.
---
Good things it's actually only 45 days 20 hours...
---
You have no idea.
---
https://github.com/shoestare/ClassicSkullActionBar
---
You can always use Savory Deviate Delight to transform into a Human, if you really hate the Gnome appearance.
---
Scatter Shot and Freezing Trap share DR in 1.12.
---
You can only charge through a trap if its like half way between you and the target, which almost never happens in actual pvp.
---
Lol, coming from the person who can't maintain a train of thought to establish a congruent argument.  Just more pitiful trash talk.
---
What happens is I give legitimate advice, then scrubs make pithy statements, prop up poor arguments, switch arguments on the fly to attempt a recovery, fumble that, regurgitate single word statements because they lack any ability to refute.  And then you shuffle that truffle belly on in thinking your slick.  But it's just bad.  Like.  At least other people can dismantle what I've said a little bit, but you just slovenly follow along thinking you're triggering me.  You're not.
---
What makes you think running through traps / running through blizzard doesn‚Äôt have to do with spell batching and batching of position updates?
---
how come u were only rank 8 for a week?
---
Oh look, more paragraphs from the unhinged. If you think im going to read that, you're retarded.
---
They‚Äôve been such a terrible aspect of the game since their addition imo.  I recently played BFA and I‚Äôd guess that for the majority of players that aren‚Äôt raiding, dailies make up the bulk of the gameplay.  People rush through the content just so they can farm dailies.  It‚Äôs a joke!
---
Southshore pvp was always my jam, Goldshire too since it was so close to Stormwind you'd always have low levels running into the city to spam for help
---
Mage Chads win again
---
I agree mostly, but for those that are still hopeful to play something hybrid, the truth is there will potentially be room for you, but with time/gear. You shouldn't EXPECT to be allowed to ret dps when first stepping foot into Molten Core, but heal it a few times, get some gear, everyone else has gotten gear, and as the run gets easier and possible other raiders want to gear/raid as healers, you may very well be allowed to bust out the dank ret items you've been collecting and dps here and there. I dps raided in ZG when it came out and my dps was actually pretty good. ZG was an easy raid, so I'm not saying this will always translate. Your mileage may vary
---
So you claim I can't read while failing to read?
---
If you actually read my post you'll see how I mention that you previously used "I'm just using a unit of culture" and then changed it to "I'm unit of culture" when you realised your argument wasn't working.  
---
And now you're ignoring my entire argument because you think you found a gotcha.
---
I've literally never seen the show and I knew where it was from.
---
&gt;I hate editing my own posts but I've gotten enough messages from private server people saying this isn't plausible because guilds can easily zone out and kill. 
---
lol dumbass people wtf, even if your 2005 computer could handle 400 players in a small area with hundreds fighting (few could) pretty sure the servers themselves would lag with that many people in close proximity. even modern wow servers get bad, which is one reason city raids aren't allowed anymore
---
Well boys, Hunter's back on the menu.
---
The actual sense of community and continuity.
---
Okay so you never let mages and warlocks crowd control? Or hunters kite? Because they all should be dpsing? 
---
And there's only 3 tanking classes (1 or 2 if you listen to some people) should they just be tanking and not dpsing?
---
Yes it is!
---
So wyvern is basically a sleep any non-dwarf, non-paly. Not a problem.
---
My two favorite places to MC jump people were BRM and Boats (after they left the dock).  
---
Third place would probably be the Lumber Mill in Arathi Basin.
---
So you still can't seem to answer how the statement has evolved. Ok moving on, good troll I guess.
---
This was my favorite one lol. To be a fly on the wall for that one...
---
I don't think this is an issue of things looking "too realistic" as some are saying. Some shots really do look great, but so many of these scenes don't have finished shaders and really off shadows. Contrasts soo extreme is looks like a Diablo 2 cinematic, the wood on the houses in elwynn look terrible, the well in darkshire is bugged etc. With a couple nie shadow and shader improvements with a very subtle 'cartoony' filter perhaps, this would look unbelievable
---
Not a fan of Kosak after Blizz hired him to put his goofy shit all over Cata.
---
tons of ppl do it but all the tauren portraits look about the same
---
YES!
---
Asmongold said it best ‚Äúit doesn‚Äôt feel like the World of Warcraft.  It just feels like the game of Warcraft.‚Äù
---
LFR/LFD stripped the soul from the game.  I was actually one of the idiots that was excited for LFR/LFD when it was announced.  My god I didn‚Äôt realize what I was asking for.
---
But you can also use it no?
---
I guess people on this sub are more concerned with "muh maylay" than getting people their preraid BIS.
---
It has the pserver name in the url
---
A competent hunter is going to lose virtually 0% of the time vs a rogue period so I don't know what you think you're saying. 
---
Let me knock out a few of your buzz words for you so we can both save some time. 
---
Yikes. That's a bad look. Who hurt you. You doing okay? Oof. That's a big ol' yikes from me.
---
What does this have to do with taurens? I'm confused...
---
Okay so I really just have to ask since not knowing with these speedruns what the rules are has been bothering me. What's the policy with regards to rested XP? You can't just park your character somewhere and not log off when you sleep since the played timer keeps going, and if you log off even outside an inn you still gain some rested XP which rather skews the played timer (the more Rested you have the faster your levelling time). While 1-40 could **maybe** be done in a single run (though i have my doubts as to how healthy that can be), 1-60 i find very unlikely.
---
Lol
---
It's okay to charge in if you're a feral druid!
---
I sure as fuck always do
---
Yep.  This is exactly what I plan on running.  I do plan on grabbing Leader of the Pack while leveling.  But I‚Äôll probably drop it for NG when I hit 60.
---
I'm going Herb / Alch on my Warrior. Sell herbs, sell flasks, sell transmute cooldowns.
---
Same. All summer whenever I‚Äôm playing a game I‚Äôm wishing I was playing classic
---
[Zero percent chance?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIvyHtU3nrY) I'm still totally confused at what point you're trying to make but either way I hope your night/week turns out better man.
---
I'm not even a horde sympathizer, but I respect this man's conviction. I'll wave at you before we fight ;P
---
Rok'delar, and later nightfall.
---
Man writes essay telling other people how to play a game.  Nobody listens.
---
No matter how emphatically someone responds to your question, bank on the fact that there's no one who can be sure about the total effect of an exploit. Blizzard never could before and we sure can't
---
We dont want ur shitty stream promotion here. thank god for the $30 and cut ur losses
---
As a shaman you should go dragonscale LW, but that's my opinion
---
I think the winning argument you make here is that we should simply be preparing new players for the ask. It's totally fair to say, "be prepared, you will be asked to heal". At the same time, we should also be honest about how fun and rewarding it is to be that rare feral druid or enhance sham, it just takes more work and some emotional resilience. Also, I really don't think a lot of people are gonna hardcore min-maxing which definitely leads to more spots for niche players, it's a small pop of players that will really hold that line, on pservers, the content ends up becoming rather trivial anyways because we have decades of knowledge on these fights and guides for niche specs. But yea, new players, you will 100% be asked to heal and there will absolutely be moments will you will turned away for not wanting to heal, just the way it is but if you want to be that niche player, you will feel pretty cool as that rare species that owns in duels and somehow tops meters now and then to the amazement of others.
---
I‚Äôll play how I want to play. Right now I‚Äôm enjoying optimizing my leveling route/professions/etc. with my leveling buddy.
---
" My point about the satura gloves was that if you really need to drop ACLG for Satura gloves"
---
My point is that since you have 5 Axe skill, Sartura gloves give you better AP, equal crit, +armor,  +stam and +defense to ACLG anyways. So why not wear them?  
---
"9% hit are easy to get p5 onwards". You can have a much nicer 6 hit mitigation set in p5 and going into Naxx. 2.5 Shoulders, 2.5 Legs, Accuria, Crossbow, Cthun Neck. You get up to 2 "free" hit from pugios as well. I say "free" because you could have more AP from an Axe instead. 
---
"maxed out on Mitigation in every other slot - which means you are in one hell of a mitigation heavy encounter"
---
Mitiigation heavy encounter, or in PROGRESSION, or have lost some raid members and are filling with new healers, or someone fucked up and wiped our world buffs, you ran outta consumes, who knows shit happens. Again, my point is that sartura gloves are just better than ACLG, so you don't only wear them for mitigation heavy fights either. But say you are tanking Huhu, in some NR gear early on. You can either be forced to wear your leather gloves in your NR set, or have 3 less hit than someone who simply has an Axe. In progression, this can mean all sorts of different gear options are available to an Orc. Maybe you get Sartura gloves first raid! Maybe you get Veklor's ring! You can easily work these in to better sets. 
---
I mean Ironfoe could also be BiS. Deathbringer could be BiS. We don't know proc rates and if the procs scale off spell power. But Empyrean Demolisher is probably actually BiS off Kazzak, or perhaps the Claw for attack speed. 
---
If I want more TPS, I would rather be trading mitigation pieces for things like Onslaught, Chrom boots, than Sartura gloves for ACLG.
---
We are getting phasing so dont worry about faithful
---
Excuse me, it apparently goes up to 1% with every consumable in the game and 20 minutes worth of CDs. Yawn. 
---
That isn't a good look. Who hurt you?
---
Is there something in the works akin to the current quest system/markers. I seem to remember something like this being around at the back end of vanilla, although I never used it myself.
---
Ah, gotcha. Now it's about honor duels instead of PVP or premade PVP. Cheers :)
---
Ok not a nerf by definition, but going off of most peoples experience with hunter in the past 12 years its a much weaker spec
---
Thing is many classes really do have pretty monotonous rotations. It seemed too generic to only say for one class. Like locks besides curses do the exact same thing as mages, but with shadowbolt for ex.
---
Oh so they're just going to ignore the bug that pets are much more unresponsive than on 1.12? How about they try that one on their reference client.
---
Play how you want I say. I personally will be leveling to 60 asap. I missed out on a lot of end game vanilla content. Not missing out this time.
---
How about you play the game how you want and stop fucking telling other people to play the game how they want?
---
Yeah what‚Äôs the realistic time commitment to get rank 10 (for the full six piece blue PvP set) rather than rank 11? How many hours per week? I‚Äôm an adult with a life outside of WoW and I don‚Äôt plan on playing more than 20 hours a week tops. Is rank 10 achievable within a few months?
---
Reporting for duty!
---
Let's just summarize what's going on here: 
---
&gt;be you
---
&gt;go into thread where people are complaining about trap/scatter DR
---
&gt;talk about how hunters are now going to be worse against rogues 
---
&gt;get butthurt when someone calls you out on it and resort to painful cliches ad nauseam
---
&gt;backtrack and pretend you really meant it was because of leeway, which no one has mentioned up to this point at all
---
&gt;link a video of a rogue winning a singular duel with literal maximum effort and pretend someone else claimed it was literally impossible for a rogue to win
---
&gt;edit all of your posts 4 times
---
and here we are, yet somehow I'm the one who doesn't make sense lol
---
cheers pal :) hope you have a fantastic rest of your week!
---
What about mages? I know there are no mage trainers in Darnassus. Is it still worth it to level in darkshore?
---
Warden staff is a boe world drop and heart of the mountain is easy to nab, along with that quest reward from BRD chain. Those are are all Bis for weapons and trinkets through Naxx and are all available in P1.
---
What?
---
 [https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20581/staff-of-rampant-growth](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=20581/staff-of-rampant-growth)  ?
---
This seemed like one of the biggest issues, how is there no word on this yet?
---
mc can be cleared by 25 people in mara blues and some level 55 greens, it's not going to be as big a deal as people think this time around 
---
yeah...if you are going for optimal speed runs...sure you want perfect raid comp, but ~5 off spec characters aren't going to make or break a raid as long as you have a core
---
No one knows the extent yet. If you trust what Blizzard says, they don't expect there to be more than a few layers at peak times a week after launch.
---
You‚Äôve obviously seen a snippet from the show..
---
Feral has better TPS than a warrior with MCP. If your dps can go full throttle is more damage increase than sunder/nightfall.
---
I fucking love these
---
I love this!
---
I got my Warden staff in Mara. It was probably too early in the game for anyone to realize we were looking at a permanent BIS item, but that group giving it to my druid changed my entire WoW experience, and I'm grateful.
---
&gt; talk about how hunters are now going to be worse against rogues
---
I actually said they're going to be the exact same as 2006, but worse compared to the nost core. 
---
&gt; get butthurt when someone calls you out on it and resort to painful cliches ad nauseam
---
Right.
---
I always sign my art.
---
Spell batching is fine as it is. I am super happy about the recent blue post on Hunter bugs that proved incorrect many of the complaints people had about batching.
---
You are practicing a melee cleave group with a pet, tanking the encounters?
---
I feel like this would be a far more interesting discussion than your leveling route.
---
What sort of dps is the hunter putting out? is the hunter going OOM with the kill rate of the warriors? 
---
How are you finding it to try and gear 3 mail users? does the paladin just pass on everything so the warriors can stay geared? 
---
have you tried just using one of your warriors with a 2 hander as the tank? It seems like a hunters would be poorly suited to this (as they cannot buff the group at all, and are a mana using class with not noteworthy AOE). Beyond that, hunters have the fastest solo leveling time in the game. Is dungeon grinding for you really faster than just solo questing a hunter to 60?
---
What's the motivation behind the composition?
---
&gt; Ashkandi the great sword of the brotherhood
---
...Isn't it? Don't warriors dual wield? Who else would use it?
---
Thanks!
---
This is absolutely fantastic content. Thank you so much for taking the time to write these posts. They make my morning commute on the train so much more enjoyable.
---
right? my memory is apparently not great bc i misremembered him as a warrior, but i want to say he was pretty decent. he said he stacked agility gear and this made him do big dps. i have no idea if this is true or not but it sounds fake. he kept aggro like 90% of the time, rest of the time the rogue would pull (also a problem in the last run i did with the rogue) and then the mob would go to me. i ran out of mana a lot but it was my second time healing so
---
How come? I just meant the emotes, I find them Silly!
---
BLOOD AND THUNDER!
---
Honesty I‚Äôm just gonna have the wow classic wiki on a second monitor. Anytime I have a question about a quest or where something is I‚Äôll look it up on there. No reason to spend money on something you can get online for free
---
My exact thoughts. Never have I ever been so productive around the house to keep me from rolling on a pserver...lol
---
1. Raid gear 
---
2. Almost instantly (esp in classic with phases)
---
The kill quests were always great because they were finite. You can plan out good loops to efficiently kill everything then move on. When you need a mob to drop 5 of something but you dont know if it takes 5 kills or 50 then it becomes much more annoying.
---
I had that experience way back when. Went into BWL in blues and new to a pretty geared guild. Finished the evening with three pieces of tier two, kind of flabbergasted.
---
Nah - you store it the bank and wait for the population to crash and people to earn gold.
---
I feel attacked.
---
Portals you should always refund the reagent minimum I agree
---
Which do you play, warrior or rogue?
---
"Sending Hunter pets into combat with a special ability such as Bite does not also trigger your pet to begin attacking"
---
This one should help in a few cases at least.
---
They got servers on 2005-01-18, a little less than 2 months after the NA release
---
The theory is the kids are all stuck in purgatory. [Shit started to get weird later on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gKKdTlvZ5kI).
---
Real talk: can someone who played a Hunter extensively in Classic, as well as had a chance to play it in the Beta, comment on how this (as well as the leeway controversy) affects their playability?
---
I had a Hunter and vividly remember Warriors charging over traps, as well as Rogues sprinting over it. Not sure about the leeway or diminishing returns.
---
Don't have the game installed atm. Thanks though bossman
---
tl;dr version?
---
Okay? 
---
You lead with: 
---
&gt;It's a lot of pre-release hysteria and hand wringing over nothing. Bored redditors.
---
People have legitimate concerns that the class they want to invest hundreds of hours into is being made weaker than they anticipated and you're saying they're "hysterical and concerned over nothing". Last I checked those weren't exactly nice things to call someone. 
---
I have infinitely less respect for someone who hides behind passive aggressive bullshit than the rest of reddit does. If you want to call people crazy and stupid you don't get to play the "yikes" card too.
---
You can still download the add-on? Put it in a folder that's named "look inside here on classic launch"
---
DPS shamans have always been really great for 5 mans.
---
Mate you're telling people that their parents didn't love them as a child because they're making actual points and not engaging in your shitflinging.
---
If anyone's saying ridiculous shit here it's you.
---
Oh please go and fight a skilled rogue, have fun when you realize that they can completely negate traps via pets/reflector/skull and that they have two of every cooldown. Unless you assume that the hunter is just going to camp sit in his flare and not let the rogue get the opener, in which case you are pretty fucking retarded.
---
What if some people enjoy planning and executing leveling routes to let them get to the content they are most interested in due to already experiencing the leveling once/multiple times before? 
---
People enjoy different things have different playstyles and are comeplely free to play a game they pay for how they wish (within ToS). 
---
Im not going to speed through since i havent done the vanilla leveling since it was retail but i understand how others want to play the game do not effect me in anyway.
---
Yea I had the same feeling, we don't need to know exactly what everyone's wearing with such detail.
---
this is false, correct behaviour should be re-learning extra ranks off the vendor every time. this was still the case in tbc and if im not mistaken also wrath
---
if it is not working like this then it is a bug and will prob be fixed.
---
Heart of the Swarm is the 2nd SC2 xpac.
---
I know that. The title was being intentionally misleading to get clicks.
---
 https://i.imgur.com/iRvxMMm.png
---
I always enjoyed playing the Bonedancer class in DAoC. Lots of undead pets that varied based on how you chose to spec. They could heal, buff, do ranged or melee damage, or tank all to compliment the abilities you got in a given spell specialization.
---
Sure, im with you. Ive felt it would be this way all along. Meme specs would get memer and good classes would get better than most people remember
---
Did you order original recipe or extra crispy?
---
Seriously though, I'm not socially inept, I'm just really bad at remembering names. PEOPLE LOVE ME!   
---
\~Warrior whom everyone asks to tank but never gets help in return.
---
battle shout aggro doesn't work on beta afaik.
---
oh man those vids got my hype, thanks.
---
Corpsemaker because it makes leveling 30-40 a cinch as Enhance.
---
Many of these are perfectly good criticisms of bfa when comparing it with classic. But many of these are also woefully subjective and it's unfair to attribute to just classic.
---
Which did you play?
---
hunter demolishes rogue and it isn't even close
---
Exactly. Sooo annoying. *two months before launch* "They will never fix this" like jesus christ
---
Depends how high you rank on the realm. The early levels you can get something like 3 ranks in a week if you place high.
---
Berserking yes (because it decreases casting time), Rapid Fire and AotH procs, no. Yet another thing the private servers got wrong.
---
I probably decided not to have a life that week.
---
That's the problem people don't realize they implemented it from Legion it's given to ALL units. 
---
Leeway as a general mechanic was not in vanilla at all.
---
[Here]'s a good 15 minutes of rogue/hunter duels between two extremely strong players.
---
dang you're not very attached to wow classic are you
---
I'm okay being the one acting passive aggressive and mostly correct than the one being belligerently aggressive, shifting goalposts and beuing overall confusing.
---
They'll be logging in for raids only in no time flat.
---
No. Leeway was not added in 1.3, and it doesn't compensate for lag. It's a function in the code giving extra range. You've been given misinformation. It's 2.66 extra melee range from Mop+ given to ALL Melee units NPCS and players
---
Also never underestimate the power of concussion blow.
---
[Just before Christmas 2006](https://imgur.com/Ac8uFXv). Technically not Vanilla because we had the TBC pre-patch, but whatever.

This. Cut losses. Develop Warcraft 4 to take place where Warcraft 3 left off. Begin development on WoW 2 to start where Warcraft 4 ends. Warcraft 4 should looks even more realistic than Warcraft 3 reforged. WoW 2 on max graphics needs to look very similar to the cinematics.
---
Because I love you: Frontstabbing existed in Vanilla and maybe should in Classic rerelease.
---
I literally linked a video from 2006. Stop arguing from ignorance.
---
Basically NOT warrior and you are fine.
---
I mentioned batching once, not stating whether or not I wanted it.

I know nobody can be sure what Vanilla was. I know that frontstabbing was a thing (because obviously, whether a target is iin front of you and whether or not you are behind a target are not mutually exclusive in code). Frontstabbing was possible until, afaik, 2012.
---
I'm judging
---
&gt;and just don‚Äôt be an asshole.  Treat others like you want to be treated.
---
Exactly this. 
---
When I played on a private Vanilla server recently, I just wanted to be the nice &amp; patient hunter. I helped random people get their gear and they would help me back out of kindness. Was more than happy to teach newer players to Vanilla and sit thru a few wipes while they learned. 
---
A lot ended up joining our guild and I treated our guild members this exact same way...passed on tier gear that was an upgrade for me, but other hunters want loot too and watching it all go to one guy at a time isn't fun. I wasn't a guild leader or even a class leader, just your friendly neighborhood raider. And even though I insisted on splitting the gear more, every hunter in my guild voted and started feeding me T2 until I was full 8/8 and had the BiS xbow (until naxx).
---
To be fair, it was the better strat to get 1 hunter full 8/8 T2 since you get a raidwide bonus. It was just nice that I got it first :P
---
Tl;Dr: Be nice and help people. Community is the essence of MMOs &amp; retail lacks that aspect pretty hard nowadays. And who knows, you might get free purple pixels out of it.
---
Pretty much plan to, really not concerned about getting put on blacklists since anyone worth playing with won't really care if you need rolled a boe back in phase 1
---
I'm earnest when I say "that's a big ol' Y I K E S from me dawg"
---
Yea this is super true, sorry.  
---
Guess I was just pissed and had no direction in mind.
---
Ok it makes sense that pservers didn't get something that massive wrong for all these years.
---
What holds a candle to it now? Every MMO and their mother tried to be a sucessor to WoW and failed. It's still the king of the genre.
---
The original game was the funnest version arguably. I've played WoW in every expansion extensively except BFA and I would say I had the most fun in classic. Played a private server recently, still just as fun.
---
Definitely best to sort this stuff out before the run starts
---
Healed until mid Cata (resto druid). Healing is just as fun as any other aspect, but if you healed it was pretty much the only thing you did. Until TBC each faction only had 3 classes that could play healer, so they were often in high demand for everything.

The challenge is to make the characters fit into the world and have contact with the ground and not float around.

Notice that you can play a bunch, like I did 6/13, yet have a net loss of points.  To earn 10K points in a week, I probably played 50+ hours.  That's a guess.  I was literally nauseous when I shut down the computer the night before I hit 11.  Of course, I was 36 at the time so maybe you young'uns can handle it.
---
Yup, I was the spriest in our raids back in TBC. Didn't do jack dick for dps but being a mana battery was oddly satisfying for a playstyle.
---
Well leeway is a complex issue. It was in Vanilla but behaved differently to what we are seeing now. Then it made up for bad latency/ping-the way it works now is an artificially created window. Lets say you have two players with 0ms (for example purposes only). They both start running at the same time. The attacking player will be given a +2.6yd melee range increase to compensate for lag that just doesn't exist. Either way it feels like a ridiculous mechanic.
---
As far as the traps go I don't remember having players sprint/charge over them unaffected but then again my memory could be failing me. What I do remember is warrior would charge, he would go over the trap thats halfway between me and him, I would get stunned and the trap would proc resulting in the warrior being frozen right infront of me.
---
What we saw from perplexity (i think thats the name) is two consecutive instances of freezing traps not going off if someone is on a lvl40 mount. What happens if they are on the 100% mount? Is it 100% immunity? 
---
It is something that will have to be tested when it goes live and whether its a consistent behaviour of not proccing ever when moving fast over them, rather than the "chance" to Blizzard claims. Hopefully they will be open to adjustments if it is broken.
---
It was, but it didn't happen anywhere near as quickly as it has with Fortnite, atleast partially because it was before the rise of social media, true, but also because it wasn't tapping into a fad. WoW Vanilla was an evolution of it's genre. Fortnite was a not particularly popular Tower Defense game who's developers saw the success of PUBG and thought 'let's do that but make it f2p so we can get people through the door before microtransactioning the shit out of them'.
---
Having played the shit out of private servers- nope definitely felt every bit as reminiscent of the original experience. Though not as intriguing the second go around being I‚Äôve already covered every inch of Azeroth, every level feels earned, every piece of loot gained feels like an achievement. The world feels dangerous, as a warrior pull more than 2 mobs, and your likely gunna die. 
---
Definitely still remains an awesome experience to this day.
---
Because "wotlk classic". The only classic is just that classic lol.
---
Same for me but replace mana battery with windfury totem bitch.
---
10/10. This is pure gold. I greatly look forward to more of these.

It's almost all I remember playing horde

If it will include Joana's guide, this will be the first addon I will download in August
---
Leeway is behaving exactly as it did in Vanilla and exactly how it does in Retail today. The only difference is your internet speed, which should not be a consideration for Blizzard.
---
Haha I can hence the /s
---
Sorry, not sure what that means
---
Because PServers are incredibly close to bring like original vanilla. It doesn't take a genius to watch the current WR's to see mages efficiently AoE leveling to see that its going to be quicker than someone 15 years ago playing a hunter...
---
Devilsalty proces are already through the roof with this layering business
---
Joana already hired someone but still worth reaching out
---
I might avoid Stranglethorn Vietnam
---
The amount of doomsdaying over this from people who never played actual vanilla hunter is nuts. You just can't spam scatter/trap over again. But it isnt that hard to trap without scatter. I was a wyvern sting hunter for a while and learned to cope.
---
Nice

\&gt; What do I mean by Fortnite effect? I mean the instant gratification of a 20min game. The effect that has ruined gaming for the last decade.

Funny saying that when Vanilla WoW itself was considered the kiddie game MMO that ruined the genre by MMO vets.
---
Okay so I am arguing with an idiot. Thanks for confirming it.
---
This should be higher up
---
&gt;It'd be nice if they were just listed separately in the server menu.
---
I agree.

Glad I could help

Regular mounts come at 40. Battlegrounds don‚Äôt come out til phase 3.

Rank 10 took me two hours of casual, semi afk pvp in AV daily on a certain server.  How do you manage to take 3 months to hit rank 10? :P
---
It‚Äôs a great game, not just nostalgia. The game isn‚Äôt for everyone, and might not be for you. Classic wow launch will be a great time to jump in with plenty of players looking to do things and fill out their friends lists.
---
Actually this discussion is about leeway and spell batching, not about your personal gripes related to  blizzard‚Äôs development consistency.
---
Nothing you‚Äôve reasoned is a logical argument against leeway and/or spell batching being in the game.
---
classicdb.ch seems down tonight, but usually has mob counts for the instances to total up. The base mob exp should be fairly easy to calculate with a spreadsheet, but to be honest, I don't really feel it matters that much that a precise number is super needed. 
---
Really, I think mob density rather than total number of mobs is going to be far more important, and the easiest way by far to figure that out is just to walk into a private server and look around. I would be pretty shocked if there are major differences in the total number of mobs in an area, as I think database info was largely available there. I think the discrepancies are more likely to be with regards to placement, patrol route, and any aggro mechanics, like linked mobs. 
---
Assuming, of course, that you are thinking for the purpose of grinding instances to level.
---
How are you gonna fix hunter dps?
---
Can't wait for Classic. Didn't had the opportunity to play vanilla back then but your writing was inspiring
---
I'll oblige
---
What about cold blood?
---
Or hell just need roll offspec and /yell HYBRID TAX
---
Yeah I'd love to hear the technical explanation for it. I'm a programmer and man... you can mess up shit in the most bizarre ways. It's great and terrifying at the same time.
---
This is the sub for Classic WoW, not rambling call-outs of randos on pirate servers.
---
No, none of the Rogue cooldowns are magic effects.
---
I'm all in too.
---
For the race/class question do you know faction/role you want? Obviously there are no BE. Horde warlocks are Orc or Undead, which comes down to preference. If you ask me the Orc hardiness (stun) racial is pretty OP and I give them the edge imo.
---
That's why there were class leaders.
---
The problem is quite simply this: all classes have dps specs, 3 per faction have healing specs and each side has 1 class traditionally regarded as tank.
---
Okay maybe you had bear tank and someone even tried prot pala, but let's be real, 98% of tanks in vanilla were warriors.
---
So 1 class for all your tanks, 3 for all your healers and meanwhile eeeeeveryone wanted to dps.
---
If you are the raid leader making your setup, where do you fit the hybrid dps in this while having enough tanks and healers to run the raid?
---
Yall are fucked up in the head.
---
It's literally BiS for hunters too in phase 1.
---
It's not good for as long as it is for mele... But after you have all the rest of your pre-raid bis why not run some BRD and farm for it?
---
And who the fuck are you to say he doesn't deserve the time he wants to spend his time farming for?
---
My warrior alt, who I used to run Midnight PuG MC and ZG raids lost rolls on 2 of them which took a fair number of runs to see, and I Never ended up getting one... I never once saw anyone in a party or raid try and claim some kind of moral superiority over another player for rolling on gear they legit wanted to equip on their char.
---
Classic might not be the healthiest game for you.
---
Warning Absolutely Russian Server Other Nations Gone
---
Where are the vids
---
I always preferred horde but I‚Äôll probably try to join up with some friends and pick the same faction as them. I would likely opt for orc in that scenario, I remember when I first played vanilla wow eeeeeeveryone played undead lol!
---
Which ones?
---
Written to a forum of people telling everyone else how to play.
---
I know there are gonna be WoW players rushing to the next tier of the presumptuous telling-people-how-to-play meta, and I just wanna pre-empt those players by rushing one tier higher to tell them to slow down.
---
Fantastic are warlocks viable in pvp and pve?
---
Eh, I did try to rent it once but the idea was shot down by one of my parents. Never got around to looking for it when I got older and then one day it was on TV.
---
what the hell
---
Now you're accurately describing yourself, well done.
---
"Huh, as I'm reading this, this passage does not make sense. I wonder if there's another interpretation that would better fit. Naw, I will just pretend this should be taken literally so that I may spend less effort to mock someone." Take that *weaksauce to retail* (jk jk jk).
---
But seriously, there are so many better things to mock here and abroad that don't involve demonstrating real or pretend issues in reading comprehension.
---
With spell batching it's totally possible to yank PoM even in a Pyro macro, just unlikely.
---
‚ÄúNew to computer games‚Äù ahahahahaha I was playing Vanilla while you were still swimming in your father‚Äôs testicles.
---
Your whiteknighting kind is everything wrong with gaming today. Gtfo
---
Pre 1.12.1 AV is the version of AV the community deserves, but not the one it needs right now
---
Warlock is one of the few classes that can play both at a high level with the same spec - yes, absolutely. Do keep in mind that the vanilla debuff cap means spamming a lot of shadowbolt and life tapping in raidfights with the occasional corruption thrown in if the fight has no adds.
---
It's a very demanded class for teleports, soulstones and with t2 and onward your dps will be very high, whereas starting out it'll be lower than mages e.g but still fine.
---
No-life leveling during the first week is a better option to avoid crowds

\- An autobiography by /u/itssang
---
The thing about PvP rank is you have to slowly build the first half. If you can win 7 rounds a week or one every day leveling up you can become a seargant by 30-40s. Once you start doing AV you can make it to rank 5 or 6. From there the real grind starts where you need to PvP at least 2 hours a day to continuously rank each week. It might be slower but you dont have to kill yourself with steady gains weekly.
---
I was thinking the same. You have a real talent for writing!
---
"I have no idea the tech involved of how it worked back then" is what I heard.
---
He also says it needs to be consistent with vanilla, which Blizzard has compared it to their reference and says it's working like it should.
---
Blizzard has a team of engineers and testers with the 1.12 original reference in their hands. Kevin hasn't worked on the game in almost a decade.
---
Difference is, people are giving guides/advice if they CHOOSE to speed level or want to spec a certain way, these guys are TELLING everyone they must slow down. Big difference.
---
At the same time, there‚Äôs a major difference between progression and farm status. Once you‚Äôre farming a raid, there‚Äôs no reason why a few healers can‚Äôt switch to DPS specs and do hit stuff instead.
---
You can respec for gold just like in tbc, it does get pretty pricey so don't plan on doing it regularly.
---
I'll probably get crucified for this, but I think demo is the best leveling spec? Either that or affliction. Use the imp for efficiency and the voidwalker for safety, especially on pvp servers in contested zones with lots of badguys!

Well, There is your issue. When it comes to vanilla and tbc, people at least are paying attention to chat when it comes to loot and occasional cc talk, if not more so.
---
Gatekeeper, coming through.
---
This is a very extreme "jist" of what you're saying, but a jist of it nonetheless...
---
"Hey, I'm not harming my community. If I don't sell drugs, someone else will."
---
You're basically justifying your self-centered behavior based on the justification that other people might be bad. You're facilitating the unfriendly mindset of PUGs.
---
Since when did games become, "oh, if it's a pug then its fair game fuck everyone else."?
---
It's an unpopular opinion but install wow retail. First 20 level are free. Classes plays almost the same. Same abilities, same spell. It's a watered down version but if you love a class in retail you will have the same experience in vanilla.
---
Eh, it really depends. I put the /s cause I was mostly joking. For casters and melee DPS, there isn't usually much reason to backpedal in PvE. In PvP, I'd never backpedal, like ever. Even while mouse turning, it's basically just hamstringing yourself. 
---
However, there are niche uses to backpedaling for tanks. I've mainly found it useful for tanking if I need to group up multiple mobs in front of me, and I don't want to risk getting hit from behind (to not get dazed, still be able to block/parry, etc). Usually 3-4 steps is all you need, though.
---
Simple.

I found focusing on the cons of each class made the choice a lot easier than focusing on the pros.
---
Well to be fair.. last couple of Blizzard betas did just this. Can't really blame people for having no faith in Blizzard when they fuck you twice in a row.
---
Imagine waiting for sunders in 2019
---
Feral tank is actually very underappreciated especially with 1.12 itemization. They can tank most content except for maybe the last 2 bosses in bwl, and they can absolutely tank all of mc. Since they're also less gear reliant than warriors they might be better at first in mc. 
---
Once a warrior is geared to the teeth he'll pull ahead but y'all need to respect the bears. I agree with the rest, though. Expect to heal if you're a hybrid, most guilds won't take you with them otherwise.
---
Cringey

Going improved thorns over insect swarm and natures grasp, I get it being a PVE build but dang really hindering yourself there outside of raids.

"We hope to have fixes in place for these issues before launch, but please note that we can never guarantee when or if any known issue will be fixed."
---
Sad to see this, old Blizzard was much more about quality.
---
I think the *intensity* of server drama back then is hard to understand if you didn't experience it yourself. We were on a server with a notorious guild of jerks, and when one of our guildmates died in a car accident, they found the actual news story and started linking it whenever we were on a thread on the realm forums. (Blizzard was its usual worthless self about this harassment.) The win-trading for Rank 14 between the top Horde and Alliance guilds was always a hot topic too. Reading your post brought back so many memories of getting to BRM; even those that are painful are still worth remembering. I loved the clashes!

They stated Charge can "**sometimes**" not trigger traps. They were deliberately vague because other Trap interactions are not working as intended.

I would argue that it is a nerf because blizzard themselves called it a bug in 1.10-1.12 that was fixed in the next patch. Essentially they are keeping a known bug that shouldn't have been in the game and was fixed as soon as they got the opportunity. If you played a hunter from 1.0-1.9 you would have never experienced the shared DR.
---
Except I'ma ruin my 40's
---
Yeah. Play like you want guys, all fine. But consider slowing down. You may be surprised how fun game can be this way.
---
What are you talking about? There is no rolling on loot in Retail.
---
This, but they sap the target first so they're paralyzed watching dozens of rogues pour out to rip into them
---
Sounds like a fun dynamic actually, it's just shit talking their skills in a game and what they don't know won't hurt em
---
People were practicing using sprint to run through it on beta, its not only a charge 60% move speed increase (any mount, speed pot + boots, sprint) will also get through it.
---
I already knew I wasn't gonna play Hunter but I still had a glimmer of hope. Final nail in the coffin, goodluck to anyone sticking it out!
---
This!
---
Horde achieving max cringe already. Yikes
---
I haven't played since TBC, but didn't they change spellbatching to be dynamic for the modern client due to increased player ping times?
---
He is 100% right though. Being 15 years old has nothing to do with bugs in this situation. All the bugs mentioned happen BECAUSE the game is 15 years old. Because they take the current client and try to get it into the state of before 15(13) years.
---
They announced the project in 2017, produced a workable demo in 2018 and release it in 2019. That's a completly acceptable timeframe. The game is insanely complicated if you take all those little nifty details that have changed over time and it's absolutely insane to believe they'll find them all internally. The beta revealed a lot of issues and they probably get fixed by priority, and some are left in the dust because they won't make it in time. But again, these bugs are here BECAUSE of the age.
---
I'm not sure if its a bug or is going to be fixed but i tested it during deadmines in the last stress test, the only time it did anything for threat was if someone body pulled and was on the threat table but had no actual threat otherwise it just did way to little.
---
there also seems to be some kind of diminishing penalty when used on more than one party member.
---
it could be a bug tho, apparently demo shout is being reported as not working properly.
---
i guess we will find out when in the next stress test or when it goes live if it is fixed or not.
---
Just use a tunneling service and roll with oceanic na or eu depending on work schedules?
---
Embrace the dress my friend.
---
They completely removed spell batching in MoP.

For those at work:
---
Greetings!
---
Since the beginning of beta, we‚Äôve seen a lot of bug reports around the Hunter class in particular, and we‚Äôve been working diligently over the past weeks to shore up some of the issues that players have been reporting to us. We felt that it would be helpful to post an update on our progress as well as to clear up some confusion around issues that were reported that are behaving consistently with the Reference client and are not considered to be actual bugs.
---
The following issues are behaving as expected and are considered to be ‚ÄúNot a Bug‚Äù (we‚Äôll be updating the Not A Bug list with these issues as well):
---
Hunter ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù is working as expected and is consistent with the Reference Client
---
A wolf pet‚Äôs Howl buff is consumed by anything that causes damage, even if it does not benefit from the buff
---
A Hunter pet‚Äôs Bite and Claw ability damage will not change in the tooltip based on the happiness of the pet. The tooltip will always display the damage as if the pet were Content (yellow). This is consistent with the Reference client
---
Note: This was reported several times to us based on 1.2 patch notes which seem to have been misunderstood. The intent here is simply that damage displayed is what the pet would deal if it were Content, not what it deals based on its current happiness level.
---
Auto Shot does not make a sound when cast during the animation of Hunter‚Äôs Mark and certain other abilities
---
Scatter Shot, Wyvern Sting, and Freezing Trap share diminishing returns
---
A Hunter‚Äôs Frost Trap ground effect will break players out of stealth
---
The following reported issues are either confirmed fixed in recent builds, or we have upcoming fixes currently in testing:
---
Crocolisk pets cause noticeable server lag when summoned
---
Beast lore does not display the targeted creatures armor in the tooltip
---
Feign death does not immediately drop the Hunter from combat in a Battleground
---
Feign Death does not cause the Hunter‚Äôs health and mana bar to zero out as if the Hunter was dead
---
Feign Death does not kill the hunter if they stay feigned the entire duration
---
Hunters are performing a WalkBackwards animation while strafing left during Auto Shot
---
Hunters have the ability to tame pets 2 levels higher than the Hunter‚Äôs level
---
Hunter Pets do not auto-cast Dash or Dive when engaging their target
---
The Bonus Armor from Thick Hide is dropping off of Hunter pets shortly after talenting into it
---
Sending Hunter pets into combat with a special ability such as Bite does not also trigger your pet to begin attacking
---
Multiple instances of Hunter‚Äôs Mark can be applied to a target
---
Hunters are unable to cancel the animation associated with placing a trap by moving
---
Explosive Trap and Frost Trap place the hunter into combat each time they apply their associated effects or deal damage
---
Enemies will ignore collision when in combat with a player
---
Note: This isn‚Äôt hunter specific and was a global issue. This did affect Hunter pets so we listed it here
---
Pets do not display a ‚Äúding‚Äù visual when leveling up
---
Activating a Night Elf Hunter‚Äôs Shadowmeld racial ability at the same time that the Eyes of the Beast cast completes will give the player control over pet movement without snapping to the Pet‚Äôs point of view
---
Ranged attacks cannot be blocked
---
Training pets may cause your client to become unresponsive
---
The spell animation for flare is significantly different than the animation used in 1.12
---
Please note that this list is not comprehensive. There have been many other issues that affect hunters that have been fixed recently, and we are still hard at work fixing other bugs.
---
The following issues have been confirmed as bugs and are still Known Issues as of our current Beta build:
---
Hunter pets that died while the hunter was in a battleground are resurrected in an unhappy state when the battleground ends
---
Auto Shot does not animate or display a missile when it fires immediately after Aimed Shot
---
Aspect of the Pack will sometimes attempt to apply itself to mounted party members
---
When a Quiver or Ammo Pouch is equipped, the tooltip for Aimed Shot incorrectly reflects an attack speed bonus from the Quiver or Ammo Pouch that it does not actually receive
---
When taming a pet that teaches the Hunter a new Beast Training ability, the chat message does not report the ability‚Äôs rank
---
The Hunter‚Äôs quiver may occasionally appear in the Hunter‚Äôs hand instead of the Hunter‚Äôs equipped weapon
---
We hope to have fixes in place for these issues before launch, but please note that we can never guarantee when or if any known issue will be fixed.
---
Thank you all for your reports on the WoW Classic Beta so far!
---
It makes a minuscule difference. Lets say for example you managed to get 1000 int from gear+buffs (Not realistic but I'm using it for convenience sake). At 1000 int a 5% int boost would give you an extra +50 int. With mages its around 59.5int per 1% spell crit.
---
50 int=750 mana and around 0.9% spell crit
---
It is nothing ground breaking but merely a nice boost if you just preferred to play a gnome. Other racials could/should be considered as well-are you going to be playing on a PvP server or doing a lot of BG in general? If so do you prefer escape artist or perception? Also in terms of PVE diplomacy (10% rep boost) is invaluable.
---
Last thing to consider is this-what do you prefer looking at? You will be spending a LOT of time looking at your toon, make it something pleasing to you. Hell, I'm probably going to roll hunter (questionable at this point), and if I do I will be rolling a Nightelf. Why? Well, my guildies have decided to roll alliance and even though dwarves have better racials (in particular stone form) I just prefer the look of a Nightelf.
---
On the latest countdown to classic one of the guests is a beta tester who IIRC stated that battle shout works as intended.
---
I'm just confused now.
---
My thought process here is that some people might have recommendations for better input. Maybe a name for a sick player to look for, etc
---
See username
---
Confirmed "not a bug":
---
...fuuuckin' 'ell, please walk slower over my trap mr. enemy -.-
---
Pvp wise they both have rly high skill ceilings, so if youre into that it might compensate a bit for duller pve rotations.
---
There hasnt been rolling on loot in wow for quite some time now, over a year in fact, so not sure ig you do currently play it.
---
And even when there was, in retail, there wasnt really that often that everyone rolled need, pretty much only on a blue or epic boe that happened to drop, and that happened back in vanilla too, so not much different.
---
I live to win.
---
Damn, yeah I‚Äôm not even remotely interested in putting that much time in. Bummer. Thanks for the heads up though! Appreciated
---
Imagine defending having bugs at launch. The memes about you whiteknights saying ‚Äúits just beta, its just release‚Äù etc were actually legit. lmfao you guys are hopeless
---
Yo man. Where are these vids in suppose to compare to the one you linked? I watch all virtune videos and I cant find anything to replicate/compare your linked video to.
---
Holy fuck you are dumb.
---
I was playing when they added this, you are not correct here.
---
I was a vanilla wow player who used /stopcasting macros to get 10-30% more dps.  
---
The 2.3 patch was the full ability queue system.  It was later renamed and removed the adjustable UI slider.
---
The reason they did this, was because there was no reason to not have the window at the largest possible value.
---
The stupid moron streamer you linked even says this.
---
FUCK OFF WITH YOUR INCORRECT INFO.
---
You are using 3rd party inaccurate knowledge on a subreddit famous for inaccurate 3rd party knowledge.
---
Not saying he's right or wrong, just saying that he's being a dick. Twice in his replies he personally attacked the other dude for no reason.
---
For my druid the staff of rampant growth.
---
The corn shape makes it the most iconic druid staff for your t2 set.
---
Ppl dont realize how much skill it takes to not get arthritis in that 1 finger tho.
---
Sure, if you need an item as an upgrade you should roll need on it. That's what need means. Not "need this more than anyone else in the group." 
---
Am I going to be inviting hunters to my BRD runs with my rogue? Hell no. But if they manage to get into a group though they deserve a fair shot at any loot they need. If you don't want them taking loot, don't make them do the work and help you clear the dungeon.
---
hunters die if they feign death for the whole duration?!
---
For what?  Cuz arms sucks dick in pve
---
Lie detected. Move along
---
Step 1: collect all the gear (ALL)
---
Step 2: learn the mechanics of the fight you are planning to engage
---
Step 3: equip gear that will help you deal with those mechanics
---
There is no simple answer. It depends on what you are fighting, what gear you have available to you, and your raid composition.
---
&gt;The only difference is your internet speed, which should not be a consideration for Blizzard.
---
Why should internet speed be considered in 2006 but not 2019?
---
I AGREE. I LOVE BLIZZARD and they can make no mistake.
---
Mounts were 40/60 in tbc too
---
I LOVE BLIZZARD SO MUCH TOO.
---
I've had similar experiences, especially on yojamba isle in stv while waiting for hakkar buff. World PVP is incredible and often a vital part of the game.
---
I don't think you've played retail. Its been literally years since you could even try to roll need on all items. SWTOR was a terrible game, its why it went F2P so quickly. Have you tried any of the big games like WoW or FF?
---
&gt; They were deliberately vague because other Trap interactions are not working as intended.
---
This is a pretty big stretch. They mentioned nearly every reported hunter "bug" on the spreadsheet. There would be no reason for them to leave one out.
---
&gt; Hunters are unable to cancel the animation associated with placing a trap by moving
---
I really have memories of sliding around while casting trap (as a tauren hunter). Am I reading this wrong? Or do I just not remember right?
---
exactly comrade they can only admire what traditional beauty is they know nothing of the real arts only what theyre told is pretty
---
"You just gotta show up" holy shit
---
LOOK. Did I level enough to get on the Zeppelin (UD) to come to old Org........maybe..............Did I giggle walking through the old gates........mayyyyybe...........Did I jump up on the old bank and then get a tear in my eye...........................yeeeeeeeeeaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhh.
---
I never knew people actually tipped regardless. This is reminding me of all of the "LF BF" [g.i.r.ls](https://g.i.r.ls) in RuneScape
---
I completely agree with you.  It really bummed me out to discover that the prevailing wisdom nowadays  is to all roll need on BOE epics (see the top post in this thread).  
---
"Reducing it to a pile of gold" as you put is 100% anti-fun, and would have been considered ninja looting on my server back in the day.
---
So you think it should change for Classic even though it hasn't changed ever anywhere else? Fuck off.
---
PvE the 5 mans for Wildheart then upgrade to Feralheart.
---
PvE the 5 mans for a healing staff (Staff of Metanoia or Staff of Balzaphon or Amathyst War Staff)
---
PvE the 5 mans for a cat dps weapon (Bone Crusher or Fist of Omokk or Slavedriver's Cane)
---
Note that if you tank or heal, some of the dungeons can be done via a 5 man all druid/rogue stealth run, which lets you farm a couple bosses a couple times in a row. Aka, you'll skip so much stuff that the group will run the same dungeon for a couple of resets.
---
Generally speaking, go with: Wildheart + cat dps jewelry + Smoking Heart of the Mountain tanking trinket + PvP trinket + swapping the weapon depending upon if you need a heal or need to dps.
---
WSG/AV will not be in the game until phase 3, most likely you'll long be lvl 60 by then.
---
 "As much as I would love to play video games for a living, there is definitely a significant half life to it."
---
Dont worrt no one is asking you too .
---
Plus the fact you think its a choice is funny . If you decided to play games for living you would have 3 viewers.
---
Becoming a twitch star is rare and you gotta admit there like entertainers.
---
You probably just sound angrier than you intended. As a complete outsider your just being toxic out of anger. If that isn't your intention you should try to change the style you wring in. Since that's how you come across.
---
Live win to I
---
They actually don't have anything on arms O.O
---
&gt;good
---
Ahh yes, the skill of RNG 25% dice rolls. How did I not see your point before
---
40 man raiding.  Never got to experience it.
---
Till you die
---
Makes my choice between warlock or spriest very difficult.  I've always loved my priest but warlock sounds so fun too, with lots of tools to approach every problem.
---
You answered your own question: if you play on a private server with almost nobody trying to get honor, then it‚Äôs a walk in the park. Now on a popular new classic server with hundreds of hardcore players trying to get high rank? Prepare a very very long grind even for rank 10
---
Yeah, that's the real killer for Honor Ranking - clearing Raids is dependent on the combined performance of forty people. Clearing Honor Ranks depends on the combined performance of *everyone who does PvP on your server's faction*.
---
*And you get ranked based on how well you did compared to them*.
---
If only one person on the server is No Lifing it? They'll get there easy. But the more people pushing for the higher Ranks, the harder it is for everyone to get there.
---
&gt;If you rush to 60 in 2 days, skip every dungeon, death skip every zone, and run to Ony just to get what? World's first...you won't. Server first...sure maybe? But what did you lose? You lost the very thing that made you love Vanilla WoW. 
---
Screw the thing about wow, you've lost your internal organs firing correctly!
---
Go as hard as y'all want - it's just not worth sleeping for 3 hours the first few nights.
---
Retail has level 1 mounts?  Fuck sakes.
---
I do remember warriors charging over traps yes. We however sported with some friends by ganking people. I dis this by laying an trap on the road, so when an unsuspecting Alliance run over it he would get caught.
---
I don't remember ever seeing even a player with a 100% mount run over the freezing trap without triggering it. And we dis this a lot back in the days.
---
Ruining your future! (Our)
---
Sorry, Enha =(
---
Your name is Gbabymonk...
---
Im not sure where your going with the name thing but just wanted to point out tour stupid name aswell.
---
Also wild guess but i think you are insanely jealous of these twitch  streamers  who make more playing video games than you do actually going to work .
---
The faster I get to 60, the faster I can gank those who are taking their time to smell the roses.
---
&gt;If that isn't your intention you should try to change the style you wring in.
---
Would you say that's good advice to someone focusing on weak syntax over the intent of someone's post?
---
This is exactly the kind of Vanilla shit we want to come back.
---
But with Classic, rogue leader would be layered somewhere else and this would never happen I guess.
---
[removed]
---
ill have a listen, my testing was done like a month ago now or whenever the last stress test was could have changed since then.
---
He means it's easy kills vs hunters.
---
You realize nothing in the game is as fast as a charge? The hyperbole in thia sub is actually insane.
---
You obviously didn't play back then or played on a low pop server, so can't do much for you =)
---
Good points other then feral Druid dps. People didn‚Äôt know HOW to feral dps in vanilla because it took specific gear, specific talents, and a non traditional approach where you‚Äôre essentially dancing between forms to shred as much as possible. People knowing that and doing it right can keep up with rogues and be right behind the mages no problem. But as far as competing dps wise that is really the hybrid that you‚Äôll see ‚Äúwork‚Äù. Plus that feral Druid is going to be an off tank anyway with different set of gear so that spot in the raid is really quite valuable.
---
I agree. We are in the same boat, my buddy and I. Craving for great duo co-op game.
---
Right now we are on satisfactory/factorio, hunt showdown, payday. Gonna try outward soon.
---
But yeah we are in need of AAA co-op game.
---
At least classic is returning to the golden age of MMO. Let see how it will evolve
---
My person plan is to level with a friend so we will have complimentary names, that's all I will say on that topic. If that falls through ill have my solo name picked out. Since I use to play vanilla, I'm going to use a name from my original server that i respected.
---
Thought you couldn't do Jaina or popular names.
---
I have a list of 10 or so names to try and grab between 2 accounts - if I don't get any of them I have a fee that people won't use :)
---
Thank you :)
---
Ebbnflow has 2 great videos on that topic!

Yes, I think a calculation ran in 2006 should be ran again in 2019 for a game being implemented in 2019.
---
I'd say its good advice for you since your not coming across at all how you intending, apparently. Though there is just as good of a chance you are just angry and embarrassed to admit it.
---
Incredible story.
---
&gt; Backporting from modern client was a huge unnecessary mistake.
---
No it wasn't. It's the only way Classic was ever going to happen. Blizzard was never going to update the old reference client to 2019 security standards and infrastructure. No company would ever be that stupid.
---
If mechanics are behaving in Classic the exact way they behaved in 1.12, then it's not a bug. Doesn't matter if you disagree. We're not getting Vanilla Remastered, we're getting Vanilla, warts and all.
---
If it WASN'T a bug, they would add it to the NOT A BUG LIST. Blizzard have been very good at setting false information straight, but they didn't do it here. Why? Because it actually IS bugged, and the issue is larger than Freezing trap itself. It's more related to server-tick or spell batching or whatever it is.
---
&gt;which have been handled in various ways and which have nothing to do with me nor my argument
---
You're argument is that it need to remain in the game because PvP was balanced around it. My point is that PvP was balanced around a whole bunch of other things as well. This isn't a stretch. 
---
&gt;This is illogical. Simply put, two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right
---
That's metaphor doesn't work here. The logic is fairly simple. 
---
&gt;I then explained that you are off topic and presenting an illogical argument.
---
This ain't off topic. Bringing up other points in an argument doesn't make it off topic. I will explain it again. You say "we need X because pvp was balanced around X" then I said "then why wouldn't we need Y because PvP was also balanced around Y" 
---
This argument is very easy to follow along. I'm actually amazed you got lost. I don't actually care about 1.1 talents or items being in the game. I'm pointing out that your argument for leeway isn't good enough, because it can easily be applied to other things, which have already been excluded.
---
Respect cost 5g and go up 5g every respec after the first to a hard cap of 50g the price lowers 5g every 30 days if you don‚Äôt respec.
---
Most people just pay 50g to respec or play some garbage 1/2 pve 1/2 pvp talent build because you cannot inspect talents in vanilla.
---
US internet speed has increased 5x from 2007-2019. Brazil increased 2x from 2015-2017.
---
https://www.statista.com/statistics/616210/average-internet-connection-speed-in-the-us/
---
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Internet_connection_speeds
---
Leeway and spellbatching were computed to compensate for average internet speeds. Average internet speeds had risen. The calculation should be reran with modern data.
---
Just because they didn't list every single method of running over a hunter trap without triggering it doesn't give you an argument that some methods of running over a hunter trap without triggering it are the result of a bug.
---
They've said hunter traps won't always trigger due to speed increases. Get over it.
---
Paladins priest shamans sure... but Druid can easily do feral, and if you got your top four mage dps in a group with a oomkin, it will be a net increase in damage with aura compared to having a fifth mage, as well as oomkin having innervate for healer and battle rez for saves it‚Äôs quite a big utility really. Highly doubt any raid takes more then one maybe two but certainly viable.
---
The dude he's replying to is being so kind his messages, isn't he?
---
&gt; Big concerns for Classic's success.
---
The private server population alone will make classic successful.
---
Most of them probably won't stay for long since they don't want to spend $15/month,  but that won't matter because Official servers = more player attraction.
---
Bugs suck and hopefully they get fixed - as long as rag is able to be dropped I don't think anyone cares about small non game breaking bugs.
---
We need more options, I'm tired of those boring gryphons! At least give us some wyverns Blizz!
---
Most excited to feel so bored that i corpsecamp one dude for an hour
---
sure buddy in your 30s spamming "üòÇ"
---
this game not having voice chat is gonna be filled with little shit kids pretending to be old players
---
Fire up a recording program and you will remember the camping of the enemy faction in 10years a lot more than downing another Magmadar. :)
---
Its their poorly design spell batching.
---
&gt;As far as the traps go I don't remember having players sprint/charge over them unaffected but then again my memory could be failing me. What I do remember is warrior would charge, he would go over the trap thats halfway between me and him, I would get stunned and the trap would proc resulting in the warrior being frozen right infront of me. What we saw from perplexity (i think thats the name) is two consecutive instances of freezing traps not going off if someone is on a lvl40 mount. What happens if they are on the 100% mount? Is it 100% immunity? 
---
The Traps thing is bizarre.  I trapped warriors constantly in Vanilla and it worked exactly as you described.
---
Not sure what kind of games you like. I don‚Äôt mind the new version of wow. But classic was far better to me. A sense of community, refreshing feelings of accomplishments from gear. It will be tedious but give it a go

&gt;Patch 1.10  28 March 2006  
---
&gt;lol dude it was in game for over a year of vanilla, i can understand an attempt to distort facts through misrepresentation of data; but its a little harder now days considering we have the internet.
---
You could fill in tons of similar "go hard" roles for retail:
---
-Arenas/RBGs
---
-Playing the auction house is still a thing
---
-Transmog
---
-Twinking
---
-Farming
---
And you can argue what's "meaningful". That's pretty subjective.
---
We started stacking world buffs in BWL and continued to do so throughout our raiding careers. And we weren't the only ones on our server.
---
You can call it cheating all you want, but the only authority on that is Blizzard and they have confirmed it is not cheating. That means you can shut up about it now.
---
Either you don‚Äôt remember a lot or you were playing on an almost dead server with nobody interested in PvP with a hardcore playtime without even realizing it.
---
My point is that on popular server during vanilla, you had to play at least 20 hours of PvP each week for with a competent group to rank around 100th and at this pace, it was 6-8 weeks from rank 6 to 11.
---
I remember that my guild was a lazy bunch, whenever there was summoning needed, no one really stepped outside the instance, but when those summoners reported horde was outside suddenly everyone went outside. and god do I miss those 40 man granktrains towards a raid entrance.
---
Here comes the lying anecdotes.
---
So you don't think it would be good advice for someone who says they want to respond to the meat of a person's post, but only responds to a detail they've misidentified?
---
I mean why does any of this matter when hunters get all the gear anyway.
---
I am outside getting plenty of air. You're still wrong.
---
God bless the queen
---
I recall former WoW developers saying that Spell Batching was a technical limitation. It was limited to 400ms windows in order to keep the servers running optimally.
---
Idk where you're getting this idea that it was implemented in order to make up for bad ping, I haven't encountered any legit sources claiming this.
---
Let's not pretend there were 100s of unique builds out there though. Vast majority of people ran standard setups.
---
What will be different? :|
---
No, if you read the details it's very clear it applies to A TON of stuff. "auras that increase Crit chance such as those I listed in my last post."
---
That includes Rogue's Malice talent and any other Crit modifying talent, any crit from any gear regarless of class, and any crit based off of an ability/spell.
---
I want YOU on my RP.server
---
&gt; That includes Rogue's Malice talent and any other Crit modifying talent.
---
Nope, by your brain, they deliberately left that one out which means it probably doesn't get reduced.
---
You guys where living in 2040 while we had 56k dialup lol.

Please stay on your Russian servers. Along with Chinese you are pure cancer in the private server scene! Waste should stay in the bin.
---
for sure, looking at your progress there, anyone with ideas of rank 10+ while having a life and doing x y and z should get a reality check unless they end up playing on a low pop server. 20000 kills in 5 months is no joke
---
You honestly think that with Warchief's Blessing, Rallying Cry of the Dragonslayer, and Songflower Serenade being in the game since launch that literally no one figured out they stacked until just before TBC? You're fucking delusional.
---
I had 56kbps dialup and thats it haha :)
---
Still to this day there are places in my country where  10mbit speeds are a pipedream haha its a fucking joke.
---
The private server population will largely move back to 1.12 if Classic actually manages to provide a worse experience. Barely anyone cares about a subscription fee.
---
The irony here is just scintillating. Vanilla released in 2004, so between then and patch 1.10 which as you say is March 28 2006, it had no DR. So that's 2 years and over 4 months of no DR, 1 year 0 months of DR. Of course you could have just googled this.
---
&gt; They will just run over it each time
---
No, it takes pretty specific timing that can't easily be predicted. Yes, it will happen, just as it did in Vanilla, but it won't be every time.
---
It was a combination of the two.
---
Well the songflower, which is the 2nd best buff, is absolutely a straight exploit.   The flower is meant to buff 1 person, not an entire raid that clicks on it simultaneously.
---
I liked Idra for the game. He added a villain for you to cheer against. There were higher stakes involve when watching his games. I believe he had a large part in making SC2 popular back in the day.
---
Bugs are part of a release. There are always bugs in games.
---
You're making it an issue when it's not.
---
Exactly and mark my words: on the most popular PvP servers in classic, the competition during phase 2&amp;3 will be very hard and many players who expect the grind to be ok will be hit hard by reality.
---
Yes. If you buy 35 heirlooms, then you get an heirloom achievement that comes with a "chauffeured" mount.
---
All I can say is I had of similar experiences in black rock mountain.
---
Brm is easily my favorite zone in wow, its such a dangerous place, walking in there you really get the feeling your walking into the most dangerous place in Azeroth.
---
Walking around brm literally feels like its 2am walking through a dangerous ghetto.
---
Every corner you expect an enemy or party, no one stands around, when approaching brm you can't help but go full alert mode.
---
Its not uncommon for people to pop invis pots before entering the mountain so safe entry.
---
Oh and when bwl attunement comes out, brm turns into an absolute war zone, since the quest to get attuned is in the mountain, the amount of guilds and players clashing their is absolutely insane, it is amazing.
---
World buff stacking will be in Classic and there's not a god damn thing your whiny ass fearmongering is going to do about it. THAT is checkmate.
---
You are really desperate to keep your crutch, aren't you?  You are terrified that you won't be able to clear content without it.  It's sad and pathetic really.
---
Where is that place of the druid with that many critters?!
---
I don't think it's that complex at all. Perplexity, who did extensive Beta testing on leeway, spell-batching, class mechanics, etc -- [states here than the server updates your location if you change direction, but if you move it one direction it only updates every 400ms](https://www.twitch.tv/perplexitycya/clip/HandsomeDignifiedMartenMau5) which is the current Beta spell-batching window. It may be DIFFICULT, but it is certainly possible to train yourself to auto-run through traps and avoid the 400ms window. **That** is not sometimes.
---
Thats where you lose people. You don't both read and comprehend and it comes off as rude but its probably just you not understanding. Sorry I try not to talk down to the differently abled.
---
It has nothing to do with clearing content. You don't need the world buffs to clear content. They just make it much faster and easier and are essential to speedruns.
---
Using every advantage made available to you is not a crutch. Not using every advantage made available to you is stupidity.
---
If someone asks about druid tank viability and you immediately switch over to talking about warriors, then even though the tanks obviously relate to one another, you still aren't talking about /druid/ tanks anymore. Yes, warr tanking viability is important for understanding druid tank viability but what you're doing is basically hijacking a conversation about the weather to preach about climate change.
---
&gt;Who are you trying to convince?  Me or yourself?
---
Yes, you should skip first week.
---
We don't know that Onyxia and Molten Core are going to have pre-1.3 loot tables in Phase 1. That's just pure speculation. It would mean Majordomo doesn't give any loot at all and that the entire T2 set pieces should drop in MC.
---
It's more likely they will have their 1.4 loot tables.
---

Even your attempted explanation of how your illogical off-topic argument is on-topic and relevant highlights how off-topic, irrelevant and illogical your argument is.
---
You say ‚Äòtwo wrongs don‚Äôt make a right‚Äô is not a statement which applies to this situation and then you proceed to say ‚Äòtwo wrongs make a right‚Äô in this situation.
---
At this point I can only hope that you are a friendly troll and wish you a pleasant day.
---
Trap dr is working as intended though. It was a bug in private servers that they did not have dr with scatter.
---
Check 1.10 balance notes.
---
Neither. I don't need convincing and there's no convincing an idiot of anything.
---
&gt;anything that sounds just a wee bit overpowered you can't remove.
---
Nope. You can remove WORLD BUFFS, the most overpowered shit out there.
---
I'm a bit late to the thread, but I while Blizzard would love for "classic" players to swap over to retail, I also think they aren't going to be willing to make big changes for those players. Retail has changed so much, and the playerbase has changed so much. People want new content more and more, they always want to burn through it.
---
Think about how slowly you acquire things in Classic. There were people in retail complaining that they couldn't get flying in a *week* when it got released. I remember when Blizzard made individual challenges like Mage Tower that gave cool cosmetic skins, and oh how people complained when they couldn't beat it.
---
TLDR
---
Let's leave the two games separate. I'm more than happy to enjoy Classic while others can continue to enjoy retail.
---
&gt;and are essential to speedruns.  
---
&gt; idiot  
---
hmmm
---
What do you mean expected, expected based on private server hunters? Yes that‚Äôs true.
---
But that‚Äôs because they were inadvertently buffed due to the dr‚Äôs. The dr was added intentionally in the 1.10 patch notes.
---
In the spirit of informing people so they don't get the wrong idea, I disagree. HotW is really a spec that is nice for tanking and healing in PvE, especially 5 man content, and is average -ok at pvp. It is a very poor version of an already weak PvE dps spec (no NW or OOC or LotP), and it is bad for flag running and BG'ing in general (although it's decent for duelling). This meme that HotW is a Druid cure all that lets you do everything needs to be corrected.
---
Don't try to 'trick' people into playing with you by playing whatever might be most 'in demand'. Pick a role, and be good at it, and you won't have any issues.
---
Nah, I‚Äôve heard its the same on BFA and has been for a while. Seems to be either low prio or difficult to fix.
---
I started the vanilla GM grind in December 2005 and reached rank 14 in April 2006 and that was constant 14-16 hour days.  What suffered the most was my health. Eating like shit. Sitting in my ass all day consumed by WoW with raiding and PvP but it worked in my life at that time. 
---
I played on Uldum and the horde population was less than alliance so our BG queue times were 1 hour + where horde were 1 minute. Horde required 1.5 million + to rank HWL and our target honor for alliance was roughly 700-900k.  
---
It‚Äôs hard work when your competing against people who account share and we actually formed pre-mades to ensure we had the right comps. 
---
I played a warrior and man with a pocket healer you could destroy everything and honor wasn‚Äôt shared at that time. 
---
I was a clicker mixed with keybindings. It worked for at the time. Haha. 
---

From what I've seen it's that the shadow weaving holy just spams 5x rank1 shadow word pain and be done with it, because mana alotted to DPS spells which aren't improved by +spellpower is basically wasted. 
---
Therefore the dedicated ones try to waste as little mana as possible on shadow weaving.
---
I also ignore people who try to have a discussion with me over silly words and point out my hypocrisy/ignorance. Good luck with classic!
---
?? I mean its BiS :P
---
So Rick &amp; Morty?
---
It‚Äôs going to be your prime leveling spec now that we know sit-crits won‚Äôt trigger talents
---
&gt; what do you guys think about that...
---
I think the chances of it happening are next to zero. The only way Blizzard ever considers developing new content for Classic is if Classic has the same revenue potential as Retail. 
---
That means WoW tokens, level boosts, name changes, faction changes, race changes, guild transfers, cash-only mounts, toys, and pets, and of course a $60 fee to experience any of the new content. 
---
Either Blizzard is going to change other parts of Retail enough to make these things not bother a majority of the Classic playerbase, in which case their goal will be to convert Classic players over to Retail. Or they know Classic players will never accept these changes and will continue with the cheapest route possible, which means TBC.
---
The timing was in line with every raid tier release. Raiding participation fell off a cliff in vanilla after Twin Emps, and then C'thun, and then 4h etc... The 40 player raiding as the only way to advance your character project failed. It was a good experiment, but if they kept that format WoW would never have gotten as popular as it did through subsequent expansions.
---
Thank you for being here, we would never be able to distinct true from false without your feelings as a guide.
---
In pve you usually heal, so you need items with bonus healing. And if you wear bloodvine in pvp, you may be dead during a 3 sec intercept stun (cloth without stamina). So dont go tailoring for the bloodvine.
---
I can recall a weird crocolisk bug from Cataclysm. At release, whenever a crocolisk in Uldum aggroed onto a player, it would put every single player in the zone into combat. Thus until it was fixed and revealed in the patch notes, everyone in the zone was constantly going in and out of combat for no apparent reason. Good luck mounting up like this, in an empty-ass zone designed for flying.
---
*(for a PvE focused )guild who gets them
---
It's been confirmed as not a bug.
---
pretty good video, except for one part.
---
"Mages are good" Ha ha roasted
---
&gt; Scatter Shot, Wyvern Sting, and Freezing Trap share diminishing returns
---
Oh boy, I'm not really a PVPer but isn't this pretty big / bad news?
---
"Can go Protection or Retribution but it's not really Meta" is a funny way to say "Prot and Ret are absolute Garbage specs and no one worth their weight in salt will respect you"
---
I thought this was a roast video??
---
Yeah...I don't what those p server players think.
---
I was 36 in Vanilla, with a lot of time on my hands. Everyday I was on elitist jerks for 2-3 hours, reading and applying what I read on my guild.
---
The guild that I was in never seen Ony and MC when I took it over. They were casuals, doing 5 men and UBRS. Most were in the weird specs, they didn't knew what gear to get, what spells to use. They were the CASUAL player that played for fun.
---
And I got them in BWL in 3 months.
---
Yes, we SUCKED in Vanilla...but for a very short time, because like me, there were enough people, and there were plenty of guilds running Naxx and AQ40.
---
Those guilds would NEVER go past MC without KNOWLEDGE.
---
And that knowledge came from elitist jerks and applying it in game.
---
It's not like we didn't KNEW how to play the fucking game. We didn't, at the start, it was a BRAND NEW game. But we knew all the shit shortly after.
---
Oh, and I am not going into the bonanza of World buffs on p servers (no cooldown) and flasks (no cooldown on Black Lotus).
---
...Are you saying that guilds expecting raiders to research fights before doing them is a bad thing?
---
Thanks for the tips mate. I remember having enchanting back in vanilla and crafting smoking heart of the mountain. It was a great trinket with its resistances even though i was playing healer.
---
It's not optimal. It appeared as a bug in 1.10. In 2.0 it was fixed. This is a weird #nochanges gray zone.
---
Mage, they are the gods of vanilla
---
Im with you, bruttha.
---
I played since launch, but was mostly thinking about people who play retail where now it's a rush to level cap to raid and do end game stuff. You are right, for people who played on private servers it will be more of just the same.
---
See... I mean... we call it classic but then everyone wants to do speed leveling and have quest add-ons and the big talk these days is BIS BIS BIS. But those weren't really native to classic. Yes, quest helpers were added later on, but part of the enjoyment of the game came from discovering things on your own and not having your hand held all the way. I agree immersion is not for everyone, but what's the point of continuing playing then? Get to level cap, raid till you get your gear, then what? Sit and wait for the next expansion or repeat the process with a toon? I guess if that's what you want, then that's okay. Too each their own.
---
Especially these days
---
Ah you mean avoid the combination of mining anf herb. Ok. Got it.
---
If you‚Äôre going to jank somebody‚Äôs build just for the raid the respec cost better be covered by the guild
---
So it's even worse lol
---
They literally pulled devs from diablo and we got rifts (myth+). Coincidence?
---
The irony is he implies I'm misleading people because you can now use the internet to look up facts, when he could have done that exact thing himself to discover that DR was in fact in Vanilla for the minority of the time. This 'intentional balance change' was never mentioned at any time for scatter and freezing trap sharing a DR and it was changed back shortly after. Shortly being relative.
---
SMH that's not enough information in the Blue Post to confirm what you're arguing. You do realize warrior Charge/Intercept speed boost to target is actually slowed by normal Movement Speed slows, right? [HEADPHONE/LOUD WARNING. Source](https://youtu.be/tb6yzXA7DhA?t=1068)

Even the example they give doesn't have the "sometimes" exception all of the time.

"Private server players don't want to pay"
---
Why do people keep coming up with this stupid assumption?
---
We don't play private servers because we're cheap, its because blizzard left us with no other option.
---
Private server players have made it abundantly clear they are willing to pay for the game of blizzard made it, really don't understand the myth that private server players don't want to pay.
---
Pserver etiquette is greed in dungeons buy need on non epics in raids. I think it'll probably stay that way.
---
Well she should have cooked that man some eggs.
---
It is enough information to confirm it's not a bug, anyone that says otherwise is grasping at straws. Warrior Charge was a single example they gave, that's all.
---
this guy gets it :)
---
I honestly want this as a meme for the sub
---
I want to level fast to stay ahead of the gankers. Levelling is not the fun part of the game for me. Christ, as a paladin I have to play a meme spec for the duration of it.
---
When the Beta closes today, it'll be the end of a friend.
---
I played Paladin in Vanilla, but this time I want to hit things in raids so I'll be going Warrior.  I made a character on the Beta to test things out and get used to the class.  She's an Orc female because I had never played one before, so why not?  I never expected to get attached to this character, but the trip to 40 was a lot of fun.  After the last few months I'm sad she's getting deleted.  This will be the first character I've played much which I can't at least go visit on retail.  I'll be rolling a Tauren when classic launches, so she won't be replaced.
---
Goodbye, crazy Orc lady, Lok'tar Ogar!
---
None of those examples are public companies that answer to shareholders.
---
Yes- begin 1 week later, so i might be able to hit that first level quest mob within the first 24hours.
---
ive played since Vanilla but this will be my first Launch day. Im quite excited :) hope it does OK.
---
" She decided on a night elf Druid. " I like your wife. She has great taste.
---
Also as long as they weren't rocking full field marshal or raid gear,a skilled level 52 actually stood a chance against a 60
---
I absolutely agree with you. I‚Äôm appalled by all the greed, selfishness and cynicism in this subreddit.
---
The common argument here is: ‚ÄûI don‚Äôt know if others will be dicks, so I‚Äôll be one just to be safe.‚Äú I‚Äôve played on quite a few servers. I played back during vanilla and later on a few different p-servers. On none of them was ‚Äûall need‚Äú on BoE the norm. And whoever cited that way got shit on. Maybe this is because those were German servers, I don‚Äôt know. But I really hope I won‚Äôt have to deal with this greedy attitude in classic.
---
And when BGs do come out, the brackets start at level 10. There‚Äôs 10-19, 20-29, 30-39, etc
---
Life has many doors, und-ed boy
---
The patch notes say:
---
* Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.
---
There's nothing about them sharing DR with Scattershot.
---
Shadow weaving holy priest is not what I would call visble. It is literally only playable in raids, and even then you might as well just bring a fully invested shadow priest and just have them stay out of shadow form because their healing is honestly not going to be noticeably worse
---
True but I'd argue that these examples are still better than grim tinfoil hat predictions.
---
You do realize you can't have one pally buff prot warriors with Sanctuary and Furies with Salvation, right? They're class buffs...
---
No titanforging. Pretty simple.
---
I get an item and that means I have that item.
---
I will start with what you are missing from the equation : GEAR.
---
Fury tanks, to have the threat that is the ONLY reason to use them as tanks, MUST prioritize gear with : +hit, +crit and + agi. They also must NOT wear a shield.
---
Which means that they are way bellow defense cap (they are wide open to crits and crushes), they have very low parry and dodge and they don't have Shield Block.
---
To AVOID crits and crushes, a tank MUST use Shield Block...hence, they must use a shield. Since nobody knows when a hit is a fucking CRIT or a CRUSHING BLOW...Fury tanks WILL get crit and crushed, ALL THE TIME.
---
They SURVIVE only because Healers have enough MANA to heal them...and they survive on private servers because bosses have almost THREE TIMES less parry, which means THREE TIMES less HASTED hits, that can be CRITS.
---
It's NOT about the talents only, my dear private server player that will hate the month of September 2019, when MC will wipe the floor with every single one of you, thinking it can be cleared in greens, in first week.
---
The TALENTS for Prot are for THREAT. 10% 1 hand damage and Shield Slam.
---
The GEAR is for survivability.
---
And when I talked about Prot Warriors , I talked about SURVIVAL and THREAT, and never I said anything about TALENTS. I was talking about survivability and threat LOSS in Classic, compared to pservers, for Fury, Druid and Prot tanks.
---
&gt; you will realize deep prot is all threat talents, not survival 
---
I know that. And I haven't said anything about survival coming from deep prot spec.
---
Thanks buddy, ill dm you today üòä
---
Questie, bagnon, probably some other aesthetic stuff.
---
"And that 20% loss in damage actually TRANSLATES into probably 40-50% loss in THREAT, because this is how Druid threat works."
---
Nah 20% loss in damage is about 20% loss in threat. It can be a big nerf but druid threat will still be superior (and if the said druid bother to use mcp then it's no contest anyway).  
---
As fot the getting 2shotted, this is bullshit. Elites and boss damage are a lot higher on private server and druid and fury tank survive just fine. A slightly higher chance to be parry hasted won't change that (actually the parry haste is more of a nerf of war (fury and prot) than it is on a druid because druid attack speed is slow (except if you use mcp) and much likely won't get as much spike than a warrior (it can be especially bad for prot survivability because getting multiple parry haste in a row will consume your shield block charge and will make you vulnerable from crush and crit)
---
As for druid tanking in vanilla, here's a few vanilla video :

....did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Nice, I wouldn't even have the enh get imp WF totem. Note - what is being compared here. Its 5 resto shamans and 1 rogue/warrior/mage/lock or 5 resto shamans and 1 enh shaman.  
---
All your linked post did was address what imp WF provides over a resto. That isn't the given scenario. I already stated that if you don't have 6-7 resto shamans; what this indicates is that Resto shamans are preferred and thus better. But you may not be able to find this many resto shamans in this case what does the 6th shaman add dps wise? (its more than just their own dps, its more than just their own dps and say 3% melee crit, its more than just their own dps and 15% more damage from 4 warlocks; yeah it typically is).
---
Furthermore, some of their gear is unwanted by others, they also provide kiting, totems resists, cleansing totems, and more. Making them more than just similar dps. Sure RESTO does all this also, if you can get 6-7 of them in a raid.
---
Rapid fire is a magic buff!?
---
The main reason they were less important from Wrath to pre-BFA was primarily the ever-increasing autarky, which is a separate problem
---
Luckily everything is so long winded the gimpy twitch kids will bore off after a month.
---
Need Blackout stun from Shadow Priests.
---
Shit man I literally played survival hunter in vanilla and could find raid spots with pvp gear on. It was harder to find 5 man groups and pvp premades than it was to get a raid spot. And judging by the general consensus on this subreddit, people are going to be even less picky this time around
---
/r/sonofashepherd

Yea, before if you freeze after scatter, it lasts the full duration. Now it‚Äôs effected by dr so it‚Äôs halfed.
---
Non guitar hero combat, Old combat is pre legion. Slow paced more tactical, less flashy with old uniquene race animations and sounds.
---
[Yep](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=3045/rapid-fire).
---
Hasn't blizzard stated that agreed upon loot rules are enforceable and you can report people who break them. 
---
So if you make sure everyone agrees in party chat to only roll need on things they'll equip then anyone who ninjas can be reported and a GM can fix it.
---
Iirc, the server times where based on the region.  
---
(EU view btw:) For instance London server(s) have 1 hour difference with German server(s)
---
if you could upgrade the dungeon sets in phase 1 it would be broken op
---
Alamo!
---
I too remember sliding around while kneeling to set a trap
---
that's so depressing...that's actually going into Classic... Blizzard is such garbage compared to what they used to be. I'm still playing a hunter and try to enjoy vanilla. I quit retail so long ago, who are the morons working on this game ffs

Don't say die! Hordies never say die!

(scroll down to the warrior specific section - this list is amazing and should be bookmarked by everyone!)
---
Well, this is how I feel, but then you have the "raiding is only one part of the game" bunch when they try to get you healing and be stuck with it.
---
Nice one. 
---
Have you had trouble leveling the warrior in beta? Did it feel tough till 40? I‚Äôm thinking that most players overestimate their level shittiness because they played on a pserver where it is indeed pretty shitty.
---
When you lay a trap your character does the kneel down animation so simulate placing it on the ground. In vanilla you could simply jump quickly as you placed it to hide it in PvP. Somewhere along the way in one of the garbage expansions it was made that you could not cancel the kneel down, to where if you triex you would jump in the air... and be kneeling.
---
Beware, our enemies abound.
---
Ehhh, I think blizzard are still gonna severely underestimate it. Me and 3 RL friends participated in the stress test. However, we have 10+ other friends who will for sure be playing but just couldn‚Äôt be bothered to join the stress test.
---
Honestly, with beta ending, and with the game still being more than a month away, I hope the mods ease up on the meme control. Let us have something to laugh about, memes are a great way to start banter.
---
I mean if you dont want to heal in organized play than  dont play a class that has a healing spec. It isnt hard.
---
I think you don't realize how LONG the fight will be with almost three times less parry and 1/rd less crit.
---
The Fury OR Druid tank will either get one shotted, or the healers will run OOM.
---
You still have several week until REALITY will hit like a fucking truck.
---
Keep DREAMING about Fury and Druid tank meta...It will ALL be over in September.
---
Thanks for the info.
---
Yeah if so it would be amazing making it possible to get that extra hits into a mage who will try and kite me. But I seriously need some approval to be sure to roll that big Beefy-boi for launch.
---
Begging is actually really profitable I‚Äôve found
---
Seriously, the level of detail needed to put this together would take weeks of investigation and interview.
---
very nice looking, though I agree with others it's not necessarily horde
---
a good pairing would be wyverns
---
You forgot charge and intercept landing nowhere near the orc because he resisted the stun.
---
&gt; It's bad. It's a guild killer. That is truly the ultimate reason the best guilds don't invite hybrid dps, because it's unfair to the healers that often grudgingly play the role best for the guild.
---
Brought up this point so many times on this sub.  Usually the response is that plenty of people like healing, and that it's immature for people to be upset about being treated differently.
---
china pengyou nice guys 10/10 would play with them again
---
I will be the one with every single gold on the server in my bank.
---
I said "other warrior charges" I included it. I'm rolling Orc too :)
---
ok take a deep breath and calm down, not everyone is out to get you. Take the angst elsewhere. 
---
i'm really not sure what part of my post you think was me being smug. I'm genuinely shocked that the US were literally in the internet dark ages RE. their access to broadband tech, from what i've read since it does appear that besides a few population centres where states invested in infrastructure the rest of the country were very backwards.
---
As for the rest of your post i genuinely have no idea what you're talking about or how it is relevant to broadband speeds!
---
DPS-wise they are pretty even. In 2h spec rage generates in clumps when comparing to dws more steady rage generation. Ofc in pre-raid gear dw is better because of Dal'Rends but for example Bonereavers and Untamed blade are really viable and compete well with similar iLvl DW-specs. Personally I prefer the 2h build. You just have to be more careful when dumping rage on heroic strikes than in dw. Ofc this can be the case anyways with the new parry ratings of the boss and overall shorter boss fights.
---
Don't forget the tournament was level 40, not 60. I wouldn't choose a class / race based on this.
---
I did the same but at 49! Stayed there way into TBC...
---
Or you let 1 shadow specced priest heal.
---
There are so many better healing weapons available from dungeons than staff of dominance. Staff of dominance is a dps weapon and will go to mages and warlocks.
---
Nobody is going to get to 60 first week.
---
Or you know, someone else who wants to be there will get the spot.
---
Why is it less shitty in classic?
---
I tried leveling one on pserver for a very short time and did not enjoy it at all. What could be better on release?
---
This meme is being spammed to hard.. pls, stop
---
Not sure why you didn't just post there
---
Oh sweet Jesus. I‚Äôd love to see the nameplates further away also.
---
&gt;After playing feral for about a year on private server and raiding (this might be a little different on classic with some different value but i don't expect too much difference)
---
Well, the differences are SIGNIFICANT, but keep dreaming for another several weeks.
---
I don't know why you don't expect much difference, when there are already TWO big-ass diffences between private servers and Classic :
---
\-14% parry and 6.5% dodge in Classic for raid bosses, vs 5.6% parry and 5.6% dodge on private servers
---
\-around 30% LESS crit chance in Classic vs private servers
---
**The above 2 differences are basically making Classic and private servers TWO DIFFERENT games.**
---
**You private server experience is IRRELEVANT, because you played ANOTHER GAME**.
---
Like it not, this is the reality.
---
OH, and we haven't heard about RESISTANCES and ELEMENTAL DAMAGE yet. It will MOST LIKELY be yet ANOTHER private server fiasco, with less elemental resistances and elemental damage.
---
I'm not sure there's anything they could do to make me play retail again.  But things like level squish and making your abilities actually feel like they matter in pvp would be a good start.  The fact everyone has self heals and friggin damage reductions and absorbs up the ass makes it feel pretty shitty when you press a suposedly high damaging ability and their hp bar barely moves.  Compare this to classic, especially early phases and sure things aren't particularly balanced but they sure are a lot more fun.
---
Hey, if that's how it was before the TBC pre-patch, that's how it should be in classic I guess. Warts and all.
---
&gt;Man writes essay telling other people how to play a game.  Nobody listens.

You listened.

Warden Staff. I'm looking forward to not updating my weapon for the entirety of Classic.
---
Get your buddies and go wreak havoc around the world or opposing faction hubs. What you propose will affect the overall PvP aspect of the game. Me and a friend of mine back then used to stir whole open world "battlegrounds" by simply harassing and ruining people fun. If you allow this to happen in a controlled events, it will absolutely affect PvP as a whole.
---
Careful your spirit fedora is slipping out in that first sentence and last two paragraphs.
---
Eh, mages make free consumes. If one of their biggest drawbacks is that ppl want some of their awesome utility, i'd say theyre pretty well off lol.
---
I **would** have receive clarification in the form of that Blue Post if it was working as intended. That didn't happen.
---
The whole point of the Beta was to find bugs and report them and raise attention to the more major ones. People like you who assume the Classic Beta is working 100% correctly are NOT helping the Classic community get the game that it deserves. I don't understand your point whatsoever when I've refuted it **with sources** at every turn.
---
This guy is prepared
---
That druid burn... I need to visit a doctor now...
---
I'm that case I'd usually say something in chat like "hey that's actually an upgrade for me, I'm gonna need it".  Then wait like 10-15 seconds to let people respond before rolling.
---
Yeah, cause routing all your internet traffic through a VPN that ONLY services countries that don't recognize Western law has never resulted in any sort of security issues...
---
The secret racial cuts both ways.  Typically the Tauren would have the advantage because he is used to the increased melee range.  However if you can hit them they can hit you. Also range will be able to hit you 2 yards past max range.  Lastly Tauren make the worst hunters and it makes me sad because I would really like to play it.  Orc hunters are just to good.
---
That's what I've been trying since the first Nost. I am mostly a utility melee player and neither rogue nor warrior fit the bill at all.
---
Nah gotta be a bit more imaginative than that. Though the duo i respected the most on my server was Starsky and Hutch but I won't be taking that either.
---
Good job! Best part is you didnt mention the "vendor machine" meme, which is so overhyped (as the only tiny downside as a mage). Warlock's shardfarming is way more annoying, than stand still and cast conjure food/water.
---
More Layers = More people = More need for resources = no big inflation.
---
I know maybe you chose Tauren because you love looking at them but that stamina buff isn't as good when you consider it so if you want to min/max there are other alternatives
---
Barlow already did this way back in retail vanilla, just in german. Hes still a legend to this day.
---
Worse: its a dress with leather fetish-stuff under and sometimes even over it.
---
You seem to start a lot of your posts with "I really don't mean to be rude" or "I really don't mean to be a douche" and you even started a thread of your own about why you want to play a druid which I thought was ironic given your allergy to lists, lol.
---
Anyway, at some point maybe you will realize that you are, in fact, a rude douche?
---
So...how will you raid when 90% of the server will be blocked?
---
Because, like it or not...you will have to block pretty much EVERYONE.
---
Don't tell me what to do
---
*'Noo! It puts the tannin in the basket, or else it gets the mallet again!'*
---
Amazing work! Will definitely check it out once classic launches. :-)
---
None. But just because I‚Äôm an idiot and never have.
---
I agree that the patch notes aren't very clear, only mentioning "Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.". However, this in combination with the blue-post in the OP saying the interaction is working as intended confirms that it isn't a bug, but an intentional change. The fact that they re-balanced a year after in a completely different expansion with a different meta/previous balance doesn't prove that it was a bug by any means.
---
However I agree that the patch notes leave much clarity to be desired. :)
---
&gt; You have X time
---
You have all the fucking time in the world what the hell. They came up with that timeline by themselves, I rather they fix the issues and then release.

8 yard leeway so good
---
Meanwhile, you have provided no evidence at all. I refuted the vague words of the Blue Post and you had no counter-argument, only to cling to the original statement.
---
If you are happy with the current state of the Beta as it draws to a close, you are the type of player that should stick to retail and not speak on behalf of those who want Classic to succeed.
---
Also your 5 day old Reddit account doesn't speak well for your credibility either.

Not to be rude, but no one wants to read a million reasons why you want to roll a druid.  :)
---
I played a lot of TBC and 2v2 but never realized it have to take a look at that but thanks for your info!!!
---
Pservers tend to make mobs harder. Can‚Äôt find the post but someone mentioned after testing that pserver mobs resist/dodge or get missed way more often than official realms.
---
not right now no.
---
i plan on having at least one guide for alliance and horde 1-60. for horde i still have to find guide creators that would like to contribute.
---
Not sure if you were aware but original Vanilla also had a ton of bugs.  I think almost every game has bugs probably even after release and hot fixes.  As long as they are not game-breaking (which can be interpreted differently depending on who you ask) it is not really a problem.  They are just admitting it ahead of time to cover themselves as best they can for the eventual "outrage" which always comes.  There is a reason almost everything these days seems to come with some kind of disclaimer.
---
Yeah but that would just be a bad mage lol.  I guess you can always hope they're bad.
---
It was a good read and all, but:
---
Is noone gonna adress that in apparently a former "top" raiding guild there was only ONE rogue (the guildleader) capable of disarming traps in the suppression room? 
---
\^ This is the real vanilla feeling, people even from top guilds having no damn clue what they were doing. The fact that they managed to beat razorgore and vael is almost mindblowing. I love how shit like this was the norm back then, nowadays it would be an instant /gkick or dkp-wipe. perfect example of "we just sucked back then".
---
For some people it's just that they never even thought about it. I remember introducing the idea to a friend of mine back in WotLK. His reaction was basically facepalming at not having thought about it.
---
For some it's probably just that they're not used to it and don't want to endure that period of fighting against muscle memory.
---
I've even thought about going for ESDF for movement keys to get more of those good keybinds but that puts shift and ctrl a bit too far for me. Z and X are ones I never found too comfortable for myself too. Z I think was always mount for me regardless, worked well for thatee. But it's been 10 years and I'm not entirely sure.
---
I agree. Play what you think you'll enjoy the most. Don't choose a class that you think will get into groups easiest. You'll get bored and either reroll or quit.
---
Even with those 8 levels between 52 and 60, you can still contribute and be a threat.
---
&gt; World PvP was the actual trigger though and everything else you described was the gunpowder hiding in plain sight
---
this is just a different way of saying the straw that broke the camels back lol
---
1. Running over traps on a level 40 mount without triggering them works in the Beta.
---
2. In a thread listing Hunter bugs and not-bugs, they list being able to run over traps without triggering them as not-a-bug.
---
That's all the evidence I need.
---
You are wrong about frontstabbing. It was only a private server thing. You're blatantly wrong.
---
Yeah let‚Äôs be real only a small amount of people will reach the 100% potential of their class me included but those things can change the outcome of the duel. If on the other hand I‚Äôm fighting Venruki or Ziqo it doesn‚Äôt make a difference your right.
---
YES. Classic is the best version of WoW in the minds and hearts of many. It is what started the WoW franchise and drew millions onto the servers.
---
Everyone should experience it.
---
I've seen a few memes using it.

---
Not to mention the absence of building-sized mounts.
---
??????????
---
Mage rotation in TBC was exactly the same. Arcane Blast Arcane Blast Arcane Blast Arcane Blast Arcane Blast
---
Anyway, you can't really do much more than show up with your consumes, and press Frostbolt. There isn't more to it.
---
&gt;they're keeping true to their word and remaking the game exactly as it works before, what a garbage company  
---
What
---
I actually don‚Äôt feel that bad for hunters because you‚Äôve had your time on private servers and it‚Äôs time to come back to reality.
---
I need to mention something important for alliance ‚Äúboomkins‚Äù. Our guild‚Äôs owl used to wave autoattacks within his spell rotation for two reasons: 1) triggering mp5 rule of not casting for 5 seconds and 2) paladin‚Äôs seal of mana - getting extra mana from autoattacks. He had a fast dagger +off hand  and his dagger had a proc damaging effect which scaled with spell power. You‚Äôll need a won speed of 1.3 and less to squeeze 4 melee attacks in the the 5 second window.
---
Most animated WoW wallpapers in Wallpaper Engine are very cheaply animated. You can see it‚Äôs just the base picture with some simple effects laid on top. What you‚Äôre describing would be a lot of work to animate.
---
Wasn't there also something during WoTLK where heard a global laugh in hellfire peninsula ? I remember something vague about it
---
That's under "Reported issues" so that's an issue. Meaning you will be able to cancel the animation.
---
Questie, extended quest log or similar, Bagnon, Scrolling combat text, Dominoes, Titan Panel, SexyMap, some unitframes, some raidframes (not decided on which of these yet), some tooltip addon, MobInfo, Threatmeter, damage meter, Prat, LazyPig or similar, a cast bar (not sure which yet), Weak Auras, Memoria, omniCC, DBM/BigWigs, Theorycraft/Spellldamage or similar and auctioneer. I think that's the most important ones, in no particular order.
---
Menu? For what ? Most bugged class in the game?
---
It's the same issue as in BfA. Pets are super laggy. Also pets on BfA client also do not auto-cast Dash/Dive, so that issue is also 100% BfA bug.
---
Not going to bother with character creation and names until the 26th or even 27th of August.
---
The so-called "popular" names are so flavorless (besides not being original) and there is no point in chasing them. I am happy that my imagination is good enough to always came up with original and lore friendly names.
---
It shares DR in the 1.12 reference, so therefore it will share DR in Classic.
---
Thanks, you are the real MVP here :)
---
I showed recognition, but not the episode
---
Go read it again and pay more attention, that's under resolved issues.

Oh so a mini bot now I want one too where to buy

---
Holy priest. People saying frost mage have no idea what they're talking about. PvE/PvP/grind specs are all different for frost mages. 
---
Holy priests can put a point in holy nova in their raiding spec and use holy nova to aoe grind lashers in DM and pvp very well in BGs. No respec required, 100% efficiency in raids and gold farming and maybe like 90% of the best spec for pvp. Only missing out on silence iirc, but it's not as big of a deal in group pvp.
---
It depend on what server you played and to reach the top, you need to be the standing 1.
---
Back in the day I reached r11 with probably more than the 40-50 hours per week you said and If I'm remembering well, I only reach standing 45 or something similar, who was standing 1 was playing 24/7, it was the Spanish server Cthun.
---
it is well made, but i will never use anything like this. Why even play then? Just a speedrun?
---
Really depends. For 5 man dungeons healers and tanks are really in demand. For raiding they are not. You only bring 2/3 out of 40 people as tanks and 5-15 healers (depending on how hardcore you are and what raid). Since every hybrid class re-rolls healer once they're 60 there are a lot of healers at that bracket. 
---
This doesn't mean finding a group will be hard, just that it won't be much easier for a healer/tank than a DPS.
---
Why ? I played SPriest and cleaned everthing until C'Thun, without healing a single time.
---
I used an original blue naga  until the same thing happened the right click quit on me after that  jumped around to all diffrent kinds of mice one being the WoW mouse that had this weird shape to it with buttons all over the place actually kinda miss that mouse had alot of good times in Cata with it Finally I landed on the logitech G502 I love this thing fits perfectly to my hands and has plenty of buttons that I mainly use for diffrent pet binds when I play Hunter and on other classes I mainly use them for auto run,open bags,mount up,etc.  Majority of my skills are scattered around WASD like most people who dont use MMO mice
---
Entire server.
---
I have zero faith in Blizzard but they are not quite as dumb and incompetent as you are making them out to be.
---
Overcrowding won't stop if you start late. If you have the opportunity to take time off, start on day 1 and get ahead. That's the only way you'll avoid the crowds. Either that or wait until you're behind the curve, but then you're midway through leveling and half your server is already 60.
---
In vanilla I used to use /who to whisper people, I could usually make a full group in 1-5 min no matter what role I was playing as.
---
Ofc it can be annoying when people whisper but the rejecting replies I got was always like this "No sorry, I am gonna do ...", "I can't now, maybe later", "Thanks for asking but I can't now". Don't think I got a single complaint.
---
If doing that then the rule is to not whisper anyone in areas like bgs/raid/dungeon since they are clearly busy and would get annoyed.
---
Also need to remember who isn't up for doing it so you don't whisper them again in a few hours.
---
"play what you enjoy" is the best advice... if you are fine playing solo
---
If its a boe purple worth 100s of gold you bet your ass im rolling on it
---
if u made this can u pls make with Wyverns? &lt;3
---
this is retail. oneshotting every boss and mob in old dungeons for cosmetic sets... Also mount collections.
---
Can't wait for classic.
---
Worked in beta fine.
---
&gt; There are things in the game more important than gold.
---
Ya, like my epic mount
---
This one i can get by, honestly vanilla experience was one of the greatest moments of my gaming life.
---
Yes I‚Äôve had sex with him
---
&gt;20 minute game
---
&gt;instant gratification
---
Getting my 4 strength 4 stam leather belt
---
same deal with martin and his food porn lol
---
Ah yes I always yell and jump on my bed when I die in WoW.
---
Worked fine in stress tests
---
I wholeheartedly agree! I just want to add that hybrids bring lots of utility to a raid that can substantially buff other players. I remember somebody posting a pretty nice enhancement shaman guide, a few weeks ago. [Here it is](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/c71sh2/a_guide_to_playing_enhancement_shaman/)
---
The point being: Even if a class/spec does not perform individually, they bring something else to the table that will help. That being said, most raids do not require a perfect setup, there is enough wiggle room to include sub-par players or sub-par specs.
---
Totally agree.
---
Don't forget that HoR requires a shit ton of farming. Personally, I could not be bothered with it.
---
nah
---
I need an add-on that will let you open classic wow and play while playing retail. That way I can enjoy the nostalgia of my original characters all while having fun playing an actual MMORPG.
---
Are season 1 and 2 on any streaming service?
---
Still have the bow and staff on the hunter I've had since day one.
---
&gt; We want to spend the least amount of time in raids each week so we can do other things.
---
I disagree. If I like the people in the raid and we are having fun, I am alright if it takes longer. I'd rather have some nice people on sub-optimal specs that I like in my raid than some elitist jerks with the best possible spec.
---
Whirlwind Axe. Im a warrior main, ive had that axe on every warrior ive ever made. Its good looking and awesome. Cant wait to do that questline again.
---
LOL whats wrong buddy? Did i hit a soft spot?
---
bind every key to mortal strike and use a paint roller on your keyboard
---
Bagnon, I dislike the default bag. Atlas Loot, I wanna look at the stuff I can find while on a windrider. Swingtimer, I'm a warrior, I gotta have one of those. Maybe some bartender like addon, although the stacked actionbars are pretty clean and might be enough for me. Zperl or some other unitframe addon just for the target and my frame, I like seeing Hp numbers *and* %numbers if possible. 
---
On the fence on whether I want a questing addon or will just look stuff up if necessary, probably the latter.
---
I feel like every raider should put in the effort to improve their character and their own skill. Being reliably online during raid times should be the absolute baseline for anyone, no matter the class/spec.
---
You want /r/wow
---
This is classic.
---
Hey, you don't need to promise me anything, keep going
---
I always liked the idea of blood elves even back in tbc when everybody was complaining about them. I like the fact that they are a little bit like the undead. From another continent, arrogant and just part of the horde because they need to survive. It gives the horde more dynamic as the alliance because it‚Äòs not a club of super best friends
---
 You can add this to the hunter : melee can outrange theirs traps by using leeway like here :  
---
[https://youtu.be/sjLBa6uIN-o?t=505](https://youtu.be/sjLBa6uIN-o?t=505)
---
They are fighting with at trap between them, the war don‚Äôt even need to pass or get round it to hit him‚Ä¶ I think it's gonna be hard to PvP
---
&gt; its too long considering it was set to that time for the amount of lag we used to have back in 2004. 
---
The 400ms tickrate was the same from Vanilla to Warlords of Draenor pre patch. It's either implemented incorrectly on the beta or people are just too used to playing without spell batching in WoD and beyond.
---
Wow. That‚Äôs not really interesting. I‚Äôm pretty sure you can easily observe the delay between your use of a spell and when it goes off server side.
---
Sorry I am a solo player and I really enjoy Classic without any expiration date. That's nonsense.
---
As far as removing bugs goes, there's never a finished product. You will always have more bugs to find and fix.
---
It's probably working as it did then. The server computes things in those 400ms batches. It does the same for pet commands.
---
Get ganked by a rogue ? Bubble heartstone play a couple of ranked games while you run back to your corpse
---
My brother has the same complaint about how tightly packed the buttons are.  You may notice nothing is on 11 or 12, which is because I can't reach those buttons well.  Mortal Strike is only on 10 because I just got it at 40 and I couldn't be bothered to move it.
---
"14% parry and 6.5% dodge in Classic for raid bosses, vs 5.6% parry and 5.6% dodge on private servers"
---
This will make druid threat slightly more unreliable in the first few seconds, but it's not a big deal either.
---
"around 30% LESS crit chance in Classic vs private servers" 
---
The only thing i have seen is that there is a different modifier on crit aura and this is seem nowhere near 30%. This make leader of the pack talent slightly less valuable but this is more a warrior nerf than druid because warrior have alot of talents that are affected by this.
---
This might be a pretty signifiant dps loss for cat dps tho because crit gave cat 2 combo points instead of one. On the other hand powershifting is buffed on beta compared to private server (because no global cd while shifting) so the dps might be about the same.
---
"I mean, tanking Ony without fire resists gear on private servers, when in Vanilla it was SUICIDAL to do it?" There is literally a shadow priest with pvp set that have tanked Ony on vanilla.
---
Looks like Pitbull UF
---
The idea didn't start with "I'm gonna make a guide to make shit ton of money"..
---
Nothing wrong with selling his own guide if he wants to. Good for him for being able to make money of it.
---
no layering/phasing please
---
Right on brother,
---
May the winds guide you.
---
I wish more people took this approach. There needs to be a reset on the current MMORPG thought process where everyone plows to endgame as fast as possible, knocks out all of the content, pisses and moans on the forums about nothing left to do, and then quits the game until the next patch.
---
I've been looking at the Steelseries Rival 500. Out of all the MMO mice replacements I've looked at, that seems to have the most easily pressed buttons.
---
Now theres even less. Back in the day there were countless great MMOs, today there are 0. Yes, 0.
---
I always find HS method doesn‚Äôt work on every mob and also kills slower, I guess it‚Äôs a trade off, slower but much less downtime
---
&gt;Too each their own.
---
Yes, but you're determining what's fun for people. 
---
&gt;but part of the enjoyment of the game came from discovering things on your own and not having your hand held all the way.
---
That's not universal. You're determining what's enjoyable for people. 
---
&gt;but what's the point of continuing playing then? Get to level cap, raid till you get your gear, then what?
---
I did that during Legion as mythic raider. We ran Argus until the last reset. I kept doing the WQs for the chest everyday. I kept trying to find gaps in my rotation to improve. My fun comes from pushing myself and getting better and better. For Classic, I want to hit level 60 as soon as possible and gear up as fast as I can so I can play with similarly-minded people and raid all the way to Naxxramas. That's fun for me. Plus, PVP, which is a whole new world of content, especially during phase 2 before phase 3.
---
"only", id say the most annoying ones to get, especially as alliance. I cant recall anyone i know that got dispelled, "oh well, its only DMT and songflower". 
---
I do remember them cursing like sailors.
---
That is irrelevant, I mean polished/finished as in, thorough testing and no known issues, or only very very minor issues.
---
Really well written, and I‚Äôm sorry OP. That‚Äôs such a bittersweet feeling. Your experience sounds amazing, but soon you‚Äôll create a permanent friend to re experience the world again :)
---
I think the main question here is; how insanely overpopulated this class will be in classic?
---
Hey ho,
---
Can someone tell me how many deebuff slots deadly poison and rapture take on bosses, if multiple rogues use it?
---
...in case of Sunder Armor iirc warris share the slot, thats not the case with deadly poison right?
---
sorry quit the game in wotlk, so its been a long time...
---
and i know, i can and will only use rapture/ deadly if there are less than 16 debuffs.
---
Cheers
---
It's how big companies work. Management decides on the timeline. The dev team fixes bugs. The dev team doesn't get to decide when the game launches.
---
When in doubt always spell it ROUGE.
---
FF8 &gt; FF7
---
Agree 100%
---
But you just said it's the most depressing zone in the entire game lol
---
My brother, who hates the 12 pad, just got one that has them spread around like that.  The mouse also had an adjuster to move the buttons forward and back relative to your hand which I thought was neat.  On the g600, 11 and 12 are basically out of reach for me and 8 and 10 aren't brilliant.
---
I was a huge noob in vanilla and ended every day with spending all my gold on the AH buying shiny new upgrades.
---
Please don't go dagger, just for your own sanity don't go dagger.

To obtain max rank in a profession (skill 300), your character will need to be level 35.
---
My personal plan is to level an alt to 35 for max alchemy relatively soon in Classic. Feeding it herbs from my main.
---
Its not an argument. Its replicateable and ive done it, all im asking is for you to do the same. I sadly cant do it for you, but i did it for myself. You can keep writing stuff here about you and me and how we should argue, or you could go test this stuff for yourself. You dont even need to have a friend, just make 2 accounts on any private servers and go test it? Create 2 characters and run to ratchet, place the characters precisely as perplexity did in his video and watch the result.   
---
Im not going down your road, with 15 yr old videos with lag/desync and whatever as "proof". Im asking you to take the scientific method road, go replicate the fucking test and come back with your results.   
---
Its kinda ironic and funny that you see a video from some random on the internet about leeway, following it blindly as a sheep, without testing it yourself, and then when asked to test it, you refuse? Why? You dont want the truth?
---
Imagine thinking posting this for the 1000th time today was funny.
---
I love the lighting. I would probably enjoy the game with updated graphics, but I can imagine if done properly, WoW would push way over 1TB of space, which would be digital distribution nightmare. Not to mention it would push people with mid tier hardware out.
---
Where do you get the drop % from ?  
---
Has the mob been killed 10000 times and it only dropped once ? There's no hard numbers on this and we most likely will never know the exact drop chance, unless there are millions of tries.
---
If it works how its supposed to we shouldn't be on different layers anymore by that point.
---
I agree with everything but... Isn't prat or a chat add on built into elv UI like it is with of UI?
---
I got lavaruns down to 10 minutes on private servers, not sure how fast it can be done on Classic though.
---
As a player who had played rogue in pservers. I wouldn‚Äôt stun lock you if there were other threats. Only if you were the only one which was the situation to whom I was referring to.
---
It will prob be different in classic which I‚Äôm excited about. People fighting over things like this. But I was assuming a 1v5 scenario. With one lv 60 or something.
---
11 was for the mount right? I got that in vanilla. 
---
I must have spent a ton of time on it although I don‚Äôt remember. The amount I was able to do in WoW is crazy to me sometimes. I don‚Äôt know where I found the time.
---
These meme adaptations are great and further prove my bias belief the Horde is full of creative outsiders, while the Alliance is full of unimaginative normies.
---
This. Sooo much this.
---
Well...it‚Äôs not an issue of them being dumb. I‚Äôm saying the data they are coming up with isn‚Äôt gonna match what happens when classic actually releases
---
You and everybody else. And that's the downside to being a mage.
---
&gt; Game is around 8 GB installed on beta client, for what it's worth. 
---
Thanks for the info, looks like I am good then. Basically only have Windows 10 on it. Have around 30 GB I can use without filling up the SSD over 90%. Not sure if it's accurate but my understanding is that for optimal speed  you should have like 10-15% or so of free space left on an SSD.
---
You should know how to type without looking at the keyboard, friend.
---
Yes, the world is bigger, a lot bigger. And people are nicer, more friendly. Sometimes, vanilla feels like beautiful chat app, but in a good way :)
---
Don't forget the mageblade so you can switch your weapon for arcane shots
---
No. Escape artist is though.
---
Storm wind is a better designed city don‚Äôt @ me
---
Same here
---
PvP you dork.
---
Private servers are not vanilla. 
---
You CAN do your test and document it if you feel for it. Whats stopping you? Competence?
---
Current implementation has been tested with around 300ms and is still wrong. The smaller melee ranges in PvE is not reproducible with lag. 
---
This is not a debate, its a beat down, but im afraid you dont really appreciate it, so i guess i have tried the best i can. Have fun in your little bubble.
---

That's about it - just a little more info displayed to help me make decisions.
---
How do you remember all that so clearly?  
---
I played since original beta+launch. Did MC -&gt; BWL -&gt; AQ40 + a few Nax bosses, and I don't remember shit, even though I did nothing but play back then :D  
---
I mostly remember AQ40 stuff, but it's very limited.
---
4x warrior + healshamie
---
And a Tazdingo! to you my green comrade
---
I would go Arms instead of Fury for the warrior. Nice to have tactical mastery tanking dungeons. Also using /sit to trigger enrage will not work in classic unlike private servers.
---
For some reason I thought windfury only applied to main hand weapons. Do off hand attacks get the chance to proc as well? For what it's worth I didn't even know poisons overwrote the totem in vanilla, the farthest my rogue made it was as a 49 twink.
---
I told my girl friend awhile ago that i'm breaking up with her for 2 weeks. Already taken off work for that time frame haha.
---
A huuuundred percent. You need the...achievement of already completing the raid... To do the raid? How does anyone get it in the first place? Oh right, it's okay for the elitists to do the raid without the achievement. Once they don't need the gear, only BiS players can do it
---
It is very relevant, because by extending development time you also extend the time to find new bugs or introduce new bugs trying to fix the old ones. There's never a point in a release of a big game where there's 0 documented bugs in the current build.
---
In a small indie game, sure. But not in a game of this scale, especially trying to replicate 15 years old code.
---
Sure, let's pop all CD's on my warlock, amplify curse! That'll teach you.
---
Oh let's pop all CD's on a Druid? Barkskin! That'll teach you while I afk here while it reduces my damage as well.
---
Mages has cooldowns, other classes doesn't.

Zugzug friends of the Horde
---
Dude, there is like a million times when you want to have a trap down before you engage, not only after they are already in melee range. Have you played hunter in vanilla before?
---
Joana is a very very bad player unfortunately. Great Guy tho.
---
&gt; Who needs to start a war to do that? 
---
Everyone. Just because.
---
Horde hates Alliance.
---
Alliance hates Horde.
---
This is Classic.
---
Not Retail.
---
Wars start for FAR LESS in Classic.
---
But this was a top guild leader, and guild rivalries in Classic are a thing.
---
More than enough of a reason to stir the shit and provoke a war.
---
The shadow priest wont be able to maintain healing through damage as it would be to mana intensive. Paladin/shaman healer are the n1 choice as they provide the best dmg buffs. A full melee grp will also have an advantage since they can't go oom.
---
Staff of shadow flame can't wait to rock it on my future lock
---
Work is da poop! NO MORE!
---
Fury is way better for tanking and furys also pick tactical mastery.
---
Not really. It arguably was to recreate things without the bad social features of current retail. People don't necessarily want a clunkier and uglier game. If the game is more reactive and crisp, it's better for everyone, we're not even talking about QoL changes here. Really performance based things.
---
If you just want a bad looking and bad performing game at all costs, just buy very bad computer hardware, and there are probably ways to artificially increase latency so change your experience up to what you like.
---
But imposing that to every single player? That's not cool. Specially since again we're only talking about performance. Not balance / QoL changes.
---
If you mean leveling you probably want two mages, two warlocks and a priest pre 40 but post 40 probably 2 warriors two rogues and a shaman. Basically for optimal dungeon runs you just want aoe and cleave. Melee have ass aoe early so they wont be quite as strong. 
---
If you mean at 60, just a tank 3 dps and a healer with a but of cc thrown in.
---
I think you‚Äôll enjoy it.  Just try it out when it launches and see what you think.  You‚Äôll know if it‚Äôs the game for you after your first month.  If it‚Äôs not, you‚Äôre only out $15.
---
Funny how some of them want world buffs pulled and dungeons/raids returned to be harder as well. 
---
#nochangesfromprivateservers
---
Shit, well I'll there is always the next one.
---
&gt; And in your story this lag (which I certainly didn't experience myself in vanilla BRM raiding, including when we had to fight our way to the portal)
---
In 2004, my computer would lag to about 3-5 FPS just clearing trash in MC on minimum settings. Open world PvP like this would give my computer a brain aneurism.
---
Why Tauren?
---
I litterally just told you how to figure this stuff out yourself. Its not feelings, its a replicateable test. I really dont understand how you dont get that.
---
If you bothered to remember your Statistics 180 course, the sample size ( if truly random) only needs to be around 27. You never need to do anything thousands of times. 
---

---
Well for starters your comparing Pirates with real WoW. Secondly, of course there will be.
---
The game wasn't balanced. Whether it's around those factors or others.
---
For endgame raiding and PvP, if you decided to play a dagger spec, when did you do this and how strong was it in comparison to combat swords?
---
Yeah but it takes a long time before you get tactical mastery as fury. My post was in regards to leveling through dungeons not late game. Maybe I misunderstood the thread question though.
---
Something need doing?
---
&gt; I'd bet a really good shadow priest today does as much, or even more damage than a warlock did 15 years ago.
---
You would lose that bet.
---
It's never been a better time to roll a Paladin!
---
Stamina, stomp, melee range.
---
Seriously. I did premades with my more-than-competent guild and it still took me ages "just" to get rank 10.
---
But it's the same uploader behind all of them. Typical bias.
---
Show me the data! Seriously though how many BRD emp runs have they done in classic beta?
---
It's fine to grenade and sapper and use tea. Pot? Damm u!
---
I hope.
---
As a "veteran" (I wouldn't call myself that, just someone who played before, that's it) I would love for new blood to try the game and enjoy it as much as I do.
---
A game can never sustain itself without a flow of new players.

See, I always thought flying mounts made sense, since we already have flight paths, so clearly we've tamem wind riders and gryphons, the next logical step is from specialized flight masters with trained flying beasts who go from point A to point B, to max level characters being trained to fly their own mount.
---
Like I said before, in the relatively contained area of Outland, I never thought this to be a big deal, there we're ground based WPvP objectives that required you to be on foot or a ground mount to capture, it was only for max level characters, and let's be real, outdoor non instanced world content isn't even half of the game.  If you wanted to, aside from leveling, you could play the entire game from a city, even back then.  Worst case scenario you're out and vulnerable from the meeting stone to the dungeon portal if you can't get summoned directly inside.
---
Once we had flying across the entire game, old world and all, I totally agree it was bad for the game.
---
Consider warlock instead, more spells to use when raiding, gear still takes a while and every raid you become more and more competitive üí™

Even right now so close to Classic?

Any other info you may need feel free to ask
---
Great and engaging read - and very accurate. I clearly remember this from my vanilla days as well. Thankfully we mostly had gentleman's agreements in place, but sometimes (as you also mention) it did happen that we'd have to just zerg through the morass and ress/run to the portal.
---
Also agree with your edit. :-)
---
I always choose horse.

It‚Äôs annoying AF we can‚Äôt fight back because we got no healer and they‚Äôve got 1-3

Which addons is he using?
---
I have no idea where this "boe everybody need" comes from.
---
In my experience it was always:
---
BOE everybody greed, if you roll need you have to equip it right there. 
---
If you don't equip it you will be on everybodys ignore list from now on.
---
I... don‚Äôt know.
---
shiny simple colorful people?
---
jelous?
---
only plate dps available to either of the factions. ftfy.
---
just kidding. ret pallies are ok.
---
That doesn't make any sense. The pyro will already have gone off if you macro it even if it is in the same batch as the purge.
---
Great addon. Will take a look again in August. I hope there will be atleast one horde guide also
---
I'll leave on holidays with 15 friends on 12 aug, for a two-weeks long rest in an abandoned abbey. Will be doing board games, roleplay games, LARP's and chill. To me, I'll 12 to 27 will pass very quickly !
---
Just a healing one akin to vuhdo
---
I unfortunately expect there to be a good economy for selling tank/healing services for dungeons.
---
Back then official server forums were a thing - I'm sure they'd been a lot of posts and comments on it, as well as some available on official guild sites. 
---
I'm sure OP added some made-up details for the sake of the story-telling, but all-in-all it really does not seem far-fetched at all.
---
I remember posting our guild's kill videos to the forums (server firsts, fuck yeah), and a lot of other server discussions taking place between horde/alli and different active members of the server community pitching in.
---
I just heard someone say party members don't share honor when killing players in Classic WoW?
---
A lot of us didn't had good connectivity during Vanilla, so leeway didn't feel like it do now. At least in my case. 
---
And probably because i was discovering the game and not looking at every technical aspects of the game too, i can't deny this too.
---
This was asked yesterday. Yes.
---
My first world epic.
---
I still remember the day I found my first back in TBC in STV. Every time in in that area I ALWAYS got back to that location and always have to kill that mob - Glorious
---
Every server and guild had their share of guild drama ending in midraid cancels and /gquits, LOVE this nostalgic post!
---
Which is a lie.
---
Sure but there's not that much incentive to do it unless you're gonna respec. The R12-13 gear isn't suited for healers. The weapons are fine but really not that much better than what you'll find in BWL, which should be open by the time people start hitting R14.
---
just play bfa, be lv120 and go back to vanilla with your lv120 and kill everyone, its not that hard
---
because it was desinged, and it is a city
---
orgrimmar is literally a canyon with some huts in it
---
Tell that to Blizzard. I'm pretty sure they've stated that the goal is to recreate as much from the old client as possible. Meaning we *are* going to see Leeway and spell batching, whether you want it or not.
---
With the ‚Äûnerf‚Äú to the quest / chest on the poison quest for rogues on horde side, how do you plan on levelling your lockpicking from around 70+?
---
No. They're a disorganised rabble. Proven by their tired slogans and shithole dwellings. They are literally called 'the horde'. The concept of tactics and team play is lost on them.
---
So I've been testing this exact thing in a private server, and so far the best for me has been rushing feline swift was, then putting 5 in furor, then continuing with the feral tree.
---
A MMO populated with people who know how to play... Sounds horrible!
---
Are you playing on a server beginning with N? If so I'm wondering if I'm just incredibly unlucky to never be with another healer!
---
**Kalimdor's Revenge** from Twin Emperors. I got that on my warrior back in the day, and I felt on top of the world! Honorable mentions to **The Untamed Blade** because it looks awesome and **Obsidian Edged Blade** because it literally IS awesome.
---
On my pserver, there are no such problems. We always find a healer quickly for some reason. Even I'm playing a priest and a druid and am going to play shaman next. I wish it will stay the same on classic. Well I'm gonna be a healer anyway.
---
What the fuck is this setup.
---
Can't agree more. My guild back in the day was only 43 so it was a baseline for us but for many, that wasn't the case. But I think it will be different for classic, we know pretty much everything to know about raids and can easily see Hybrid builds being useful to make things easier at least for the more casual guilds.
---
Dude (dudette?) I am so looking forward to that!
---
Anyone that serious about PvP isn't going to be a "pure" healer. If you want to run around healing people as your primary source of honor, you will probably be spending every waking moment queuing for BG's or other group PvP events.
---
If I remember correctly I changed to dagger spec when I got perditions(spelling?) blade and remained that until I got ripper from AQ40. Which I believe was more bad luck on weapon drops rather then choice. 
---
I never had an issue topping or being near top of the charts on most fights as dagger spec.
---
On pservers healers generally did not hit R14, because once the 1hander caster items released, it was already around AQ40 in which you got roughly equivalent or better caster items such as C'thun healing mace or Gavel of Infinite Wisdom.
---
In vanilla back then it was even later at patch 1.11.  
---
However in WoW Classic it seems everything gets released with Phase 2, therefore the High Warlord's Battle Mace and the spelldamage dagger will be released from the getgo and shamans, paladins etc. will want to hit R14 as well.
---
Same. 
---
I have a list, in a hermetically sealed envelope, locked in a fireproof safe. Shielded from all the elements and prying eyes.
---
How.
---
You drive a hard bagain. I'll agree to 200 because it's you.
---
Reminds me of the first time I got to go to Black rock mountain in a raiding party. Everyone forming up in kargath, buffing up, making sure no one was afk, mounting up and riding into BRM ready to kill any ally on sight just to make it into the instance unscathed. Some of the most immersive, anxiety inducing, and exciting gaming I've ever been a part of. And to think that kind of shit doesnt happen on a PVE server makes me sad. Theres just a different feeling that comes along with the consequences of a PVP server. Cant wait to experience raid night in BRM again.
---
Pick your poison: Male Orc or Female Orc?
---
Or a ret paladin üòÖ
---
Azuresong mageblade.
---
Elemental Shaman in AV was so fun, Chain Lightnings for days.
---
Only played rogue in Cata but I plan on maining rogue in Classic, mostly for the PVP (world PVP especially). Stealth just adds such a fun element to the game for me.
---
Jaina like other NPC and dev names are on the reserved list and cannot be used.
---
Dont think you're remembering classic correctly. There are drops within dungeons and raids that are worse than picking up greens. Their only value in life is to be sharded or vendored, thats how bad they are.
---
It's more like as a healer, I always bring a premade team with me. Need folks who can peel, randos just dont defend me well!
---
This guy is smarter then we all realize.  Probably doesnt have enough vacation for the launch of classic so hes slowly working on getting himself fired prior to aug 26th so he can collect unemployment and play wow while he sends out his resumes.
---
I'm playing on the beta and leeway is way diffrent. It's also just the fact that mobs are delayed, to give you an example i'm a speedrunner. When i run to point A to point B i will run &amp; towards the direction and still kill the mob (a bit like back pedeling with full speed towards where i wanna go, i do this with strafing and jumping to face the mob to attack it) 
---
On private server the mob always follows my movement speed, so i never miss any attacks, this is because it constantly updates and keeps trying to chase me.
---
On beta this does not happen, when i try to kite like this it "stops" moving when i move away, i believe this has something to do with spellbatching and leeway put together, it litterly stands still and then i get far enough away that we both stops attacking eachother. This means that either i have to stop moving so it can catch up (or i end up losing 2-3 seconds worth of damage) or i have to stop moving so it can catch up.
---
Btw this happend 1000+ times to me, it happens bassicly every single mob.
---
It's even worse in starting zone where mobs have less movement speed then your own.
---
Still have the Wraith Blade in my main's bank 13 years later.
---
Im 27 now but Im right there with ya.
---
Yeah sure, let me just watch few videos on how to perform a heart surgery and I am good to go to operate on someone without any prior experience or practice!
---
You really splurged for your 13th birthday, nice.
---
And join a guild/make friends. If you have questions, someone has an answer.
---
I totally agree here, if I'm suggesting anything it'll be Sub spec. It's my absolute favorite to level. She's pretty intimidated by the trees so far but I should maybe try to get an idea of where she's going, or at the least offer to give a simplified style of each.
---
I wish you luck. I've only ever seen one drop and I lost the roll to a hunter.
---
Private server leeway is not the exact same as classic's leeway. On PS you gain 2.66 yards additional range to attacks and abilities while moving, same as on classic. The difference is classic has batching which sometimes lets you attack people from narnia if your attack was batched before the enemy moved out of range.
---
Do you really expect anyone to be able to farm in the most contested  zone in the game? Its being called STVietnam for a reason. Its even worse on launch of a new server. This is terrible advice.
---
Been playing since BC yet I've always used 1-9 and F1-F9 and I don't plan switching anytime soon. Honestly I don't understand how people have trouble using the keys farther to the right. You can just move your hand very quickly? Though my

The Horde will always get my upvote
---
I really don't see it this time around. Most people besides a few could give a damn about speed clears and world firsts. Its already been done before wtf is the point of efficiency this time around?
---
I think most just want to have fun and interact this time around. Add that with how much better players we are now compared to back then I just dont see any sort of meta being used by 90% of raiding guilds.
---
Classic is about that social interaction and making friends again, friends could give a damn about what  you play as long as you show up and put in the effort.
---
You must play.
---
Yep, I remember the dilemma when they launched the Russian servers - I was perfectly happy playing on the English client, and the translations in Russian were often cringy and awkwardly long. But pretty much the whole of my guild wanted to transfer, so in the end I gave in. I got used to it in the end, but if I had a choice - there would be no hesitation in picking the English client on Russian servers.
---
So while I don't believe there will be Warsong 2.0 (the majority of Russian players don't care that much, or are not that comfortable with English anyway), this would be a really welcome thing indeed. As OP said - there is no downside to this, and it can't be that hard of a thing to implement.
---
Until they hit level 60 or join a guild. Karma is a bitch.
---
This is the reason I don't tank even though it's by far my favourite role.
---
40 people in a raid, eight five man groups. At least two tanks. Figure at least 8 healers, probably more. So that‚Äôs over 25% of the raid. 3/8 classes can heal, that‚Äôs a little over 25%. But, most people want to DPS and play DPS classes. 
---
Just by the numbers, if you can heal you probably have to. At best, you can do a little support DPS. 
---
That said, I will spec and play shadow and feral... but I‚Äôm fine not raiding beyond 20 man if that. Except for a few pieces, that gear doesn‚Äôt really take off until Naxx / AQ anyway.
---
So you played a priest yet you suggested a shadow priest as healer?
---
This video is way too long and rambles too much.  Its a 23 minute video.  The first 5 minutes is you explaining what should have been covered in the first sentence or the video title.  The next 3 minutes is going on about that bronze tube.  Next 2 minutes, pserver controls.  Next 3 minutes, grabbing the easy to miss Deadmines quests and more rambling about the guide on the discord.  Next 4 minutes is running to the dungeon, followed by being told "don't bother with the miner cards if someone is already doing it", and the rest of the video being you killing stuff with the gm command.
---
I'd recommend tightening these up to 10 minutes tops, and not pushing your discord so much.   Good to know that's where some basic information is.  Not going to join without thinking there is some information there I can't get anywhere else.  Also tone down the Pserver hijinx.  No one needs to see you moving at 5x movement speed spamming .die.    Run per level was a nice stat though.
---
Couldn't grind as much as you wanted?! You'll love vanilla lol. WoW is basically cheap lore decorating the only funded MMO in existence.

Nope.

Moar work?

&gt;**The following issues are behaving *as expected* and are considered to be ‚ÄúNot a Bug‚Äù** (we‚Äôll be updating the Not A Bug list with these issues as well):
---
&gt;Hunter ‚Äúdead zone‚Äù is working as expected and is consistent with the Reference Client
---
&gt;A wolf pet‚Äôs Howl buff is consumed by anything that causes damage, even if it does not benefit from the buff
---
&gt;A Hunter pet‚Äôs Bite and Claw ability damage will not change in the tooltip based on the happiness of the pet. The tooltip will always display the damage as if the pet were Content (yellow). This is consistent with the Reference client
---
&gt;Note: This was reported several times to us based on 1.2 patch notes which seem to have been misunderstood. The intent here is simply that damage displayed is what the pet would deal if it were Content, not what it deals based on its current happiness level.
---
&gt;**Traps can sometimes not be triggered if a player moves over them very quickly (i.e. a Warrior‚Äôs Charge ability). This behavior is consistent with the Reference client.**
---
&gt;Auto Shot does not make a sound when cast during the animation of Hunter‚Äôs Mark and certain other abilities
---
&gt;A Hunter‚Äôs Frost Trap ground effect will break players out of stealth
---
I agree that Pve situations are different. It may be spell batching or leeway as you mention, or it may just be new pathing system. Its hard to tell.   
---
Nonetheless, in pvp situations its exactly the same. Sorry i didnt clarify that.
---
Where are you getting that 25% base spell resistance from?  
---
Assuming the caster and target are the same level that resistance should be 4%.
---
It's a must see.
---
Good idea. I'll be playing lock/tailor/alch so I'll encourage her to keep her cloth and express the importance. Soulstones won't always cut it. I think she'll be skinning/herb for money and saving leather. I'll make her alchemy stuff and help with her mount since Warlock.
---
Please stick to the new thread :)
---
There's a lot of subtle cues like that between the factions to push people towards one side or the other aesthically. The Horde doesn't fall in line with each other, they're prune to instability, and go against traditionalism, overall as a faction. Whereas the Alliance is the opposite, orderly, falls in line, a stable cohesive unit, and very heavy handed on traditionalism and fear of the unknown. I think it makes sense slightly more people seen to gravitate towards Alliance, they have the familiar traditional pretty fantasy races and everything, whereas the Horde have all the traditionally evil races in fantasy that are brutish, which is where the misconception that the Horde are the bad guys comes from for new players in part I think. My opinion is that the Alliance are more often than not the aggressors and ones in the wrong in the lore, inadvertently, but still.
---
That's because they sound more than just a wee bit overpowered.
---
Almost forgot about the WC3 remaster, where's the date Blizz?
---
Maybe you should too. 
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15473/shadowform](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=15473/shadowform)
---
&gt;However, you may not cast Holy spells while in this form.
---
Classic will be a lot easier, 1.12 gear stats on molten core, at vanilla mc era spell power didnt even exist, on classic blue gear from 5man dungeons are better than mc gear itself
---
Performance changes balance though. Mostly in favour of rogues but still. Without batching you can't vanish a Death Coil for example so it does change gameplay
---
Me223l3l3l
---
Leeway mechanics only apply to pvp.
---
I would prefer a healing priest, thank youuu.
---
Nice set up i like the meshify C back there. I call my PC Windfury lol.
---
Well... they will have great farm alt in any case ;)
---
I meant that naxx released so close to TBC that many guilds took breaks after just a few attempts at it. Most guilds didn‚Äôt even have the gear to even try it because they‚Äôd been stuck in AQ40 forever so they took a break.  
---
My guild for instance never made it past twin emps in vanilla....guild leader basically came out and said that we are doing 1 raid night a week and it would be casual and open to alts if people rerolled for tbc etc.
---
Op,  your details are a little sketchy. Can you post a vid?
---
I hate quest addons like these, I think they should be banned, questie and all of them.
---
‚ÄúWith one extra button‚Äù casually forgetting to mention that it‚Äôs the spec defining button that you gear around and the sole reason you are brought to the raid. You come across as someone who think they know TBC/priest, because you sure as fuck haven‚Äôt played itüòÇ
---
Nah. Fuck that race. I'll never play one.
---
That‚Äôs not how it works, though. So it‚Äôs not interesting. You could watch beta streams and see that‚Äôs not how it works.
---
I do not find your analogy fitting really. Because "pulling the leaver for a chance to give you [something]" is going to the dungeon, killing the boss or whatever. Because that is the action that gives you the chance of something dropping that you need.
---
More fitting would be "I pull the leaver at a chance I win, and if I lose I'll still try to take it because others might have the same idea."
---
Advocating for a system that turns everyone into the thing you don't want does not seem very smart.
---
Thats a fair point
---
Nah. 400.
---
Did you read the patch notes? It says  ' Freezing Traps are now affected by diminishing returns.'
---
Now if polymorph had the same text what would you think? That Polymorph now dr with scatter? No, you would think it means that polymorph now has dr with itself.
---
So this text should mean that Freezing trap now has dr with itself. It doesn't state anywhere that it has dr with scatter or wyvern
---
"However you may not cast holy spell while in this form"
---
Yeah but oftentimes it‚Äôll work and that beats getting 50 ap from marksman
---
Spell batching is without a doubt the dumbest issue people made a big deal about bringing back. And anyone who says it adds skill to the game is full of shit.
---
See. This is the problem with you folks.
---
People in a not so skilled based game like vanilla WoW *want* to learn on their own and find stuff by themselves.
---
If someone would tell me I can find the DragonSlayerSword3000 in the next cave in the Witcher3 it would spoil my fun. 
---
Dont assume everyone plays the game to enlarge his e-peen. Some legit play this game for its RP elements which you substract from by telling them stuff. 
---
Even miniscule aspects like inventory control, keybinds, bank alts etc.
---
Where are the addons available these days? Curseforge (or Twitch Desktop) only seem to show current retail addons.
---
People will be 60 on day 4-5. There will be multiple 60s end of week 1.
---
Yes messing around in  bgs yesterday on retail. In 3 matches alliance had at least 4 healers while the horde had 1 at most. I logged off my alliance toon and queued up on horde, got in a game and alliance had zero healers and horde had 4. 
---
I wouldn‚Äôt worry.
---
Well yeah thanks for the feedback anyway
---
Why not just not use it then?
---
Ok fair enough..
---
Bad spelling..
---
Unnecessarily being a prick.
---
Post provides nothing of value, reported.
---
I am on *fire* today
---
Farming downvotes are we?
---
Female for rogue, as I feel like the gigantous shoulders on males don't fit the class.
---
I'm trying to find the note that fixes it, but you can just look at game files if you'd like. [here](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=14309&amp;page=1) is the spell categorization for Freezing Trap, the important part is "Mechanic Type 13" which is the CC type. Only one other spell shares mechanic 13 in the entire game (Ice Block). If you look at [Scatter Shot](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=19503&amp;page=1) you can clearly see that it has Mechanic Type 2 or "disorient" it shares a mechanic type with [Blind](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=2094&amp;page=1) for example.
---
!remindme 2 months
---
That's what I believe. The batching is off somehow, due to reimplementation, and they don't have a clue why yet.
---
&gt; You can heal in shadow form, do your research.
---
Well, you are not going to keep ppl up with vamperic embrace. a shadowpriest dpsing max out (to single target to heal) will A) pull aggro and B) spend so much time drinking.
---
&gt;are not going to wait for it.
---
And we're not gonna get it either. That is software. Always is and always will be.
---
The "Hello World" program is free of bugs though.
---
Sorry im not home atm. I will post a video tonight or tommorow. Otherwise the fastest way to test yourself, is to create a character on retro-wow. Make 2 accounts, you start in orgrimmar and already have FP to Ratchet.   
---
If not, stick around and ill post the video soon.
---
Did you just assume a word's gender?
---
You sure are flaming I agree
---
Op, I recommend you search this board a little. There have been several really helpful Druid threads this week with some solid links on builds.
---
Back then me and my friends reasoning for joining the horde was "alliance is kids wanting to be the "good guys"" or pretty much just called them weebs.
---
Undercity is more comparable to Ironforge in layout and design really, and yes UC is far superior because its a smaller ring instead of a giant confusing one.
---
But overall, TB is the best city. Alliance just get a badly layed out tree in the middle of nowhere instead, what a horrible trade off.
---
Well seeing as I am not a 40 year old man child living in his parents basement looking for adoration, da hell do I care about upvotes?
---
If we have 2 Warriors and level 33 Shaman in SM Arm and you need roll on Shoulders with 15 stamina as a shaman you are piece of shit, even if its upgrade for you in 7 levels.
---

Why would anyone bring Hunter to wsg, when melee dominates it, very easy to kill a Hunter in wsg, it has no where to run, AV  would give you way more honor.
---
FOR THE HORSE
---
Remember, always throw the enemy priests in the lava first.
---
He dies all the time (not on purpose), thinks very slow and his is own route is poorly executed as well. (lots of ppl beat him by 10+ hours 1-40 on the beta).
---
I am playing a Rogue for the first time and going to be Orc. IM HYPED!!!!!!  
---
Hemo looks really cool so goonna play combat until I can get that and then switch then rock that till 60 and diving into WPVP as much as possible! I dont know if I can PVE with that spec too but I really dont care Im gonna try.
---
Just came here to say im excited to play Rogue
---
I prefer suppression due to not wanting to miss fear or dots.. Difference for the hit 10% is for higher lvl mobs and players, will help on that
---
What do you mean? Is Arena a bad design gamemode?
---
You‚Äôll need a beta tester. Perhaps one will post here. 
---
There have been a number of yt videos about this. Blizz has also mentioned in a blue post that this is the case.
---
I've been on private servers since 07?
---
I dont think its wise to assume they all work the same.
---
That‚Äôs my next step once I get geared up to where I want. I‚Äôve dived right into all the sub Reddits and have been doing my own research here and there. Real big lore guy.
---
But Mgmt says to devs, guys, when will it be ready. We need a release in summer. Devs are pressured, say give us 3 months, should be enough. (It's never enough, but devs have to give mgmt some bones). Then, beta happens and devs really are in trouble.
---
It was not a smart move to anounce release together with Beta. But this was probably a mgmt decision.
---
I'd take suppression over imp life tap even, if you look at non-miss as mana generated, it puts out more value than imp life tap.
---
Months

Orc, easy choice
---
care to elaborate?
---
Plot twist: OP will play Alliance
---
Dont get over your head. If you catch a snigle dude on raidnight going in instance you will camp him . Possibility of other faction caring about your guild leader is very very small
---
Better hope your Boss doesn‚Äôt have a Blackjack...
---
&gt; ‚ÄúWith one extra button‚Äù casually forgetting to mention that it‚Äôs the spec defining button that you gear around and the sole reason you are brought to the raid. You come across as someone who think they know TBC/priest, because you sure as fuck haven‚Äôt played itüòÇ
---
I didn't heal at the raid level, because I got totally jack of healing dungeons at 70, went full-time shadow and raided as DPS. Got server second on Nightbane, Gruul and Magtheridon I *think* (not 100% sure if an Alliance guild sniped us, I know we were Horde second).
---
Look, if eventually after months of progression raiding you finally got gear that made CoH worthwhile and finally found a boss fight or two where you got to click it lots, I am happy for you. Well done you. I hope you had lots of fun.
---
But I stand by the plain truth that what holy priests got in TBC 61-70 was deeply lame compared to cool stuff other people got like exploding doom seeds, cloak of shadows, invisibility, newfound endgame viability, bloodthirst or all the sexiness shadow priests got.
---
&gt; You dont know this shit, why do you even pretend? Just go to bed mate, you‚Äôve embarrassed yourself enough already...
---
I am guessing you do not have anything meaningful in your life to feel good about, and the faint hope that you might have managed to be right about something on the internet is all your self-esteem has to cling to. I am sorry that this was not a thing you were right about. But I do believe that if you keep calling people retards and shouting stupid things on the internet that one day you will get lucky and be right about something. So you have that going for you.
---
The wowhead list is incorrect. I don't know for strat specifically, but it also lists scholo and 48 required, but it actually is 45.
---
How many do Druids use?  Quite a lot.
---
She played.
---
She enjoyed.
---
She is excited for what comes next.
---
Everything people are arguing for already occurred.  In fact, that was my exact advice on his original post the day before.  Imagine that.  But now he wants to know what comes next.  And providing a novice player with the framework of proper keybinding is not, no matter how many wood tier caliber people want to chime in, a task which will daunt a new player into not enjoying the game.  
---
Again, a significant other leaving their lover alone to play, them excited and enjoying it, saying "now let me show you some things", is not now, nor will it ever be a deterrent.  There just isn't a world in which giving a new player bare bones control advice is the straw that gets them to stop playing.  People are treating the situation like this is a Discovery Channel Nerd Special, in which he watches from afar the elusive GamerWife in new territory.  It's frankly fucking ridiculous.
---
I would tell my wife, who has never gamed a day in her life, not even mobile, the same thing if she had played to level 10.  And I guarantee she would engage with me about the reasoning, say "okay that makes sense", and then do it or not do it.  But that wouldn't be what would keep her from being engaged with the world.  An ability auto-populating to "R" instead of "7" isn't going to confound anyone.  Stop with that nonsense.
---
I would tell my child the same thing.
---
I would tell my friend the same thing.
---
I would tell the hot chick at yoga who only started playing because of her boyfriend the same thing.
---
The argument has never been about whether or not this was optimal.  Never once have I said that if she doesn't do this she will be a shitty healbot.  Not once.  I've said, this is excellent advice to give a new player, which it most certainly is.  However, the counter argument every fool has brought forth, either in mediocre quips, or laborious snips, has been that telling a new player this will overwhelm them.  Preposterous.  
---
Absolutely fucking bollocks.  
---
And, my parents were Uber end game raiders in Everquest, and they were the ones showing me some shit and basically walking my dumb ass through the steps to get my monk epic.
---
¬∑ Xperl (probably. I'd love to keep the classic ui but I think for tanking it might be just a bit too dated and missing too much info for me)
---
¬∑ AtlasLoot (too damn handy not to have. I hope it gets updated for Classic)
---
¬∑ Threat Meters (goes without saying. Required for raiding.)
---
¬∑ Auctionator (so I know the worth of the stuff I find out in the world)
---
¬∑ Postal (just a better mailbox. Nuf said)
---
Not a huge amount of stuff. But mostly QoL fixers that dont interfere with the classic atmosphere
---
I WISH it had taken me 50, literally did 100 before giving up.
---
Well I would do PVP server. Humans lack of stoneform/escape artist would negate them, and I prefer the small race look. But yea, if you want to min/max with swords for pve then human. 
---
I think I‚Äôll go combat for leveling, and then switch to daggers later if I can acquire a quality one for those nice ambush crits
---
The idea is NEVER to stop. And from my experience (as playing a) paladin healing in lowlevel instances is really underwhelming. Dont see many leveling as holy, illumination when you dont have ANY crit gear isnt that great.
---
And i did say its alternative, but just not as good as a priest.
---
The more I read your posts, the more I believe you're actually Alexensual. You repeat his shit nearly word for word everytime he makes a tweet.
---
This is so narrowminded, do you even realise how many russians you encountered and had social interaction with ? There are just as many "bad" people in russia as in other country, we have a saying that roughly translates to "There are no bad nations, just bad people". I understand than you think its our mentality or something, but its not, its just a matter of being a decent human being. And dont think you're any better, im SO tired of your "cyka blyat xDDDDD", maybe you dont do it personally but as soon as people realise im russian every other person says it.
---
&gt;cyka
---
—Å—É–∫–∞ is not the same thing as "cyka". Write "suka" instead next time :)
---
If you‚Äôre just starting out, don‚Äôt worry about raiding at all, that is a far off future problem for you to worry about. Just focus on leveling and getting preraid BIS gear.
---
If you mean playing 2-3 hours per day once you are level 60 you should have no issues. Those are plenty to collect the consumables you need and there are always people that go without those and just log for the 3-4 hours raid sessions each week.
---
Well yeah but i believe you spend 5/x/11, where x is the rest of your points, i forgot how many points you get, as im a noob :D
---
any idea what time the closing event is?
---
I don't think it'll be too common outside of the most hardcore guilds.
---
I remember being one of the top guilds back in Vanilla (I think ranked #2 for Alliance) on our server, and we never used world buffs.
---
Welcome back to waiting with the rest of us plebs.
---
Fuck your hyperboles, it's absolutely possible to extend deadlines to fix goddamn class bugs without making it infinite development.
---
But this item (or a more useful one) can be "brought back to existence" from that same pile of gold. And when a BoE is rolled for - it's rolled for by everyone - how exactly can this be considered ninja looting?
---
Imho it's bad manners to even ask for such item - in these situations I always offered to buy it on market price from the winner (they were usually happy to give a 25-30% discount).
---
If you want to be kind to a stranger - then win the item and just give it to the person after the run.
---
They just seem so harmless though. I do want to do lots of world pvp, so guess I better learn to hate them if I roll Orc
---
trying to rank solo by pugging is a bad idea
---
Okay, that makes sense. I just wanted to know more or less if I am limiting myself in the grand scheme of things because of having a life.. well, kind of having a life!
---
Okay, sweet! Thanks man!
---
You don‚Äôt ever need to stop lol, that‚Äôs my point. The group doesn‚Äôt stop just because the healer might need some mana, no one‚Äôs going to die, this is dungeoning 101
---
It's a nice high resolution image, though I did upscale and denoise it a bit..
---
Overall the wallpaper is 8160x4320.
---
I understand what you say but : if he ran to far the war will just charge him. And he can't run too far anyway because of hamstring.
---
The best way for him is to turn around the trap. But leeway allow the warrior to hit him anyway
---
UI scaling pulls in the action bars. The hp/mp is pitbull.

---
This is what I was sent in another post and I thought it was a great way to go!
---
Now that was more gregarious of you.
---
Yeah, I completely agree with you on that. My main issue is sitting at the computer for 8-10 hours a day for work and then sitting for 2-4 at night on WoW. I just got my first real job, as I was a baseball player by trade until this point in my life, and the excessive sitting at the computer for work really kills my motivation to sit and play anything after work.
---
Don't forget swiftness potions!
---
That's why I play horde
---
Lolll
---
Batching doesn't change the way casting spells works, it just dictates when the spell takes effect. For example, if you cast fireball, scorch, fireblast as a mage, it could look like this:
---
In milliseconds:
---
0000: Start casting fireball
---
3000: Finish casting fireball (1800 millisecond flight time)
---
3100: Start casting scorch
---
4500: Spell batching: Nothing to process (Next at 4900)
---
4600: Finish casting scorch (no flight time)
---
4700: Cast fireblast (instant, no flight time)
---
4800: Fireball lands
---
4900: Spell batching: Fireball, scorch and fireblast all apply damage at the same time
---
Global cooldown is 1500 milliseconds for spells, so let's say you spam moonfire, it'd look like this:
---
0000: Cast moonfire
---
0400: Spell batching: Moonfire lands
---
0800/1200: Spell batching: Nothing to process
---
1500: Cast moonfire
---
1600: Spell batching: Moonfire lands
---
2000/2400/2800: Spell batching: Nothing to process
---
3000: Cast moonfire 
---
3200: Spell batching: Moonfire lands 
---
In short, for a straight up damage scenarios, spell batching doesn't really impact balance an awful lot. It just adds a bit of delays depending how lucky you are (averages at 200ms). The really interesting bits are when CCs are used as you can have multiple effects kick in simultaneously, which is extremely rare in retail.
---
You‚Äôll find a group. Since the generation is older (and I assume have RL priorities) they aren‚Äôt going to dedicate time they did back in the days.
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler, it's a 2h mace from a boss in Gnomer with a use effect that increases attack speed by 50% for 30 seconds. Since Bear threat is basically made up solely of white attacks and maul it GREATLY increases threat generation. Druids also only gain stats from a weapon, so on hit effects, weapon damage, weapon speed, none of that matters.
---
Hunter will get you killed, no hunters
---
 Tarren mill/southshore pre-battleground was hosnestly the form of PvP WoW ever had. And ever will. Even PvE server were having such battles.
---
Hopefully! I know my priorities have definitely changed since the days in which vanilla was out. Except I was a CoD playing loser at the time!
---
Dude. Yes the big bad had that wc3 vibe more than anything.
---
Its viable in the sense that if you get a set bonus from ZG that increase holy spells range combined with holy reach talent you get a whooping 41 yard range on your smites and holy fires, meaning you outrange hunters... also smite is not a missile so its difficult to trace it back for your enemies. You can litterally abuse terrain with this.. spamming some high damage spells from a safe and concealed distance
---
If someone rolls need on an item that would be an upgrade for me just to sell it: welcome to my blacklist.
---
When I'm on my healing character I can become quit a diva. And yes, in the past DDs were kicked out of groups because I refused to heal. Worked every time.üòà
---
This may be known, but definitely look up some macro guides, because that will likely be your best friend. A gaming pad may be better than a keyboard due to less hand and finger movement. Utilize being able to turn the number 1 button into 3 or more buttons by shift-1, alt-1, etc. Keybinds.
---
Nice projecting?
---
Im trying out leveling a warrior and paladin at the same time. Its nice to never have any downtime (paladin heals) but it is more taxing in my mind, so I dont know if I can keep it up for hours on end.
---
Ha, I have the same issue with sitting too much at work. I ended up getting a standing desk for home, so that my playtime at home is mostly standing after a day of sitting at work.
---
It's not possible to extend deadlines once a release date has been announced. Some companies may do it but it's generally not something that happens in the industry at all.
---
I don't understand how you equate "playing in Russian guilds" and "not caring about reputation"? Assholes don't care about reputation. There are assholes in Russian guilds. But also in English, French, Spanish, Chinese. It's not wise to extrapolate your limited experience (enforce by group-think) on a whole subset of people, be it nation, or culture, or country, or skin color, or whatever.
---
In any case, anti-Russian rhetoric has become quite mainstream lately, but if you want to be honest about racism - an easy check is just to substitute "Russians" with "Jews" or "Blacks" in your comments, see how well they read then:)
---
That's... Pretty awesome.
---
Should probably wait to see how your server pop evens out after phase one.
---
If it is your first time playing and you will only play 2-3 hours per day then I don't really really think you will be heavily desired by most guilds.
---
You will still have a magical time playing WoW but with no experience to fall back on, you will take more than 3 months just to get to level 60. And then considering all the gear grind, I think your ceiling will be BWL for a very long time.
---
The issue is, the good progression guilds will have filled their rosters months before you even do your first UBRS, you won't even get a spot on their B team or C team. So you are left with the other "casual" guilds that likely do not have a lot of talented raiders so you guys will hit some sort of hardcap in your progression in BWL or so. I don't think the vast majority of guilds filling their ranks so late will really touch AQ40 or Naxx.
---
Factions are the same except horde think they‚Äôre edgy.
---
Awesome yeah thanks! I have never played shaman in Classic just Mage/Rogue/Priest so its nice to have as much info as I can get. its easy to forget how much knowlege went into classic and knowing your class in depth can make worlds of difference!
---
Depends on what you like, personally I love healing. You have to be engaged 100% of the time, because when you make mistakes somebody dies. Groups can feel like everybody is your puppet dancing for them. You have constant opportunity to make clutch plays since the healing classes all pack a ton of utility as well.
---
Healing in pvp is fun as well, in a game where the goal is to make the other players hp go to 0, healing is the single most powerful skill there is.
---
Now imagine that in classic the leader will just be able to swap layer to avoid the ganking :)
---
How is it like arena other than it‚Äôs 2v2, 3v3, 4v4 5v5? What I suggest isn‚Äôt cross realm, doesn‚Äôt involve queuing, doesn‚Äôt involve seasons or gear awards.
---
Very viable.
---
Improved revive pet, improved aspect of the pack/cheetah, improved mend pet, bestial swiftness, indimidation, improved aspect of the hawk.
---
These are all amazing PvP talents. Your pet dies all the time and it doesn't get automatically revived when it does - you need to revive it and revive pet costs a bunch of mana. 13% dodge from aspect of the monkey. 36% movement speed pack which is an important group buff when you're on offense. Being able to cleanse your pet is huge because it lets you remove polymorph, frost nova, curse of weakness, warlock fear/dots from your pet...
---
I've PvP'd at 60 as a hunter, trust me these talents are really good.
---
Yeah world PVP as a rogue is so much fun, you choose when to engage and you can absolutely ruin people's day haha
---
That is a great idea! I'll have to look into that. My only issue is that my desk in my home office is absolutely massive. I have my professional printer sitting on one end for photo's (aspiring wedding photographer) and then my dual monitors (27" and 32") and my computer on the middle and other end. I'd need a really strong standing support!
---
That actually looks awesome, thanks so much!
---
In my experience young children and working adults played Alliance, and edgy teenage and early twenties kids played Horde and talked the most shit.
---
I played both, and the Horde guilds were most definitely more cringefest than Alliance guilds.
---
Eh, that's unfortunate. Oh well. I can't really complain if it is myself being the limiting factor!
---
Intel on a mage is valuable. But bro, you play the race you want. This is your subscription!
---
Cheers!
---
Well an obvious idea would be to use a [foot switch](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/HTB1PtUGIeGSBuNjSspbq6AiipXar/FS3-P-USB-Triple-Foot-Switch-Pedal-Control-Keyboard-Mouse-PC-Game-Plastic-Triple-USB-Foot.jpg) for your ctrl+alt+shift modifiers. Then you have trippled the amount of stuff you can do with your Razer Pro controller.
---
Yeah figured. I‚Äôll just use sisnter strike on raid nights and sneak around banking rest of days
---
This is very sad, i guess someone working at Blizzard has a thing against hunters. Fucking clowns
---
Such a long stun. I shiver in fear.
---
I've done it before and there is great satisfaction that comes from the time efficiency later in the game plus I enjoy the pace of managing both at once.
---
You get into a rhythm.
---
I absolutely fucking love it, especially since I'm at work right now.
---
Well my resto Tauren druid is going to rock bgs.
---
It's actually the reason I decided on a druid, instead on the priest. 
---
Priest doesn't feel good in bgs.
---
pservers have harder mobs, usually with really high respawn rates, who aggro from further away, almost never drop gear and the natural health regen is like half of what it's supposed to be
---
Mage will get ice block to wait ut out..
---
Thats awesome, I will have to try it some more later üòÉ
---
awe, I was sad to see that only two areas have been programmed into the guides. Looking forward to more!
---
Honestly that's why I loved raiding with Spiritual Attunement and Spirit Tap in my build. I gave up DS but that was okay since we had a disc priest who got it anyways. Prioritize all the high spirit gear that the other healers are less thrilled about, then go to down when soloing.
---
So that‚Äòs basically cybermobbing ...
---
Macros.  I had a friend with a similar situation who I PvPed with in the 2500s during Wrath, and he used a RazerNaga.  It will feel clunky at first but you'll get used to it once it's all set up.
---
That will be a concern but I definitely know I can't wait that long.  I would like to get my consumables up and running for raids asap.
---
Rank 8 is doable as a raider...if WoW is the only game you play. I did it on a PServer while clearing Naxx weekly. Have a full time job but no other commitments, so depends on your irl situation
---
\&gt; 4 massive giraffe monitors
---
\&gt;inky dinky keyboard without numpad.
---
Feral Charge is useful for tanking but not strictly necessary. 
---
The ability closes the distance between you and a mob and interrupts it if it's casting.
---
Unlike the warrior charge which generates rage, Druid charge costs rage.
---
Generally you'll be pulling groups with moonfire, faerie fire or simply body pulling so it's not required for these situations.
---
You‚Äôre definitely in the minority if you did it this way.
---
Right which is fine, but thats the correct play/counter to do. Im not mad.
---
Such a destructive mindset but ok
---
Do ESF (forward, strafe, strafe). It really does add a bunch of keybjnds. I have so many available binds that I rarely use ctrl except for non high priority spells.
---
If you have a guild or a group aiming for doing MC before week #2 raid reset then of course it's more important to rush to 60 first.
---
I would do a single account during the beginning, because of the ridiculous overpopulation in areas with quest tagging, and then level two accounts together a month in.  It will be more beneficial to make friends in the beginning and easier to just do your own thing with two accounts later on.
---
I guess we need to start a new topic about this problem on forums. This one is from december!
---
No problem! You're making a good choice with druid. I've been having a blast in the pserver. Saved my dungeon groups countless times by healing when the healer goes oom on a big pull, off tanking if we pull too much, etc. So versatile!
---
That's the mentality a person has to take if they choose a hybrid dps spec. The supply of such players is simply higher than the demand, so sure you'd love to raid, but if you can't find a raid you have to be willing to either respec or become a dedicated pvper.
---
Herb/alch between you two is a cute idea. GL!
---
more like a lean sneaky body type, I got you
---
You should get a raise, perhaps a promotion.
---
I did the wise thing to say last 4-5 yrs, meaning the majority of players have been on nost, kronos, lh and so on.
---
Finding a mage infront of the AH to buy water off of only to have him give it to you for free.
---
DONT PANIC
---
Not a problem as a druid since the other druids already have the set :)
---
I've been considering multiboxing with 2 accounts, but man, 10 Seems nuts.
---
Luckily I fucking love pvp. 
---
And if they ever announce TBC servers, I‚Äôll get to raid then I guess. Mana b82rez 4 life
---
I‚Äôd love this and think it‚Äôd be a great feature.  A lot of potential for player made content in the form of tournaments, etc. Hell, I‚Äôd have fun with it with just my collection of RL friends.
---
Luna. Best addon ever. Showing incoming heals is OP.
---
You really should be going down affliction while leveling and not demonology. Max out improv corruption and suppression, skip all the 2nd tier talents, none of them are better than suppression for leveling.
---
Go with amp curse, improv CoA, and put a point into improv life tap. Make sure to use amp curse whenever the cooldown is up while leveling. Efficiency is key.
---
Grim reach, nightfall, another point in improved life tap. Get siphon life and fill out the rest of the affliction tree until you get dark pact.
---
Affliction is the most efficient way to solo level.
---
Top tier posts, im always looking forward to you next one :)
---
Both of those specs are pretty fail for a raiding feral though. One of the key things you bring along is your ability to buff the melee group when you're not doing tank duty, and LotP's crit buff is just more threat you can generate, which is kinda the point of a feral tank.
---
Depends of the boss. Some really don't hit hard and you can take even 3 crush in a row without heal and without dying.
---
I am sure they will follow the same way as they handling live issues. I am expecting to see a lot of hotfixes in the first few weeks.
---
Saying SHotM is easy to craft is a tiny misleading.
---
To raise enchanting from 1-265 is like... 300g. Plus, getting the mats for SHotM is no easy feat either. Blood of the Mountain has a 0.02% drop chance and usually goes for a lot of money on the AH.
---
As long as you don't mind the massive gold sink and you are 100% certain you want to tank raids, go for it. Otherwise there really isn't a need and I'd rather use that early 300 or more gold to save towards my epic mount.
---
While what you said may be true, John Staats (vanilla designer) has said many times that he intentionally made things non-symmetrical.
---
Join a guild as a social (people who don't get raid spots) to have people to talk to, ask for guidance, chat in Discord. It will take you probably two to three months to level up to 60 since you haven't played WoW before. After you have your pre-raid bis gear sorted you can join a raiding guild. If it's a good guild they can clear MC+Onyxia in one night (2-4 hours). Otherwise it will take two raid days to clear the Phase 1 raid content.
---
Nothing. I will build my ui with add-ons, when I'm 60.
---
If you only pve, sure. But if you are a pvper like myself, you know warriors and priests are going to suffer. Suffer greatly while leveling because neither get some speed boost at lvl 20 like us shamans, hunters, druids, mages blink, and rogues sprint do.
---
Exactamundo. Further kills player agency, class fantasy and any RPG itemization elements as well. 
---
In my humble opinion...
---
Classic = MMORPG (role playing game)
---
Retail = MMOGaaS (game as a service)
---
&gt;for me
---
not for everyone else tho
---
Raiding is completely viable for individuals who have real life schedules.
---
In TBC I raided in a guild with working adults.  Three to four nights a week we would raid for maybe 3 hours each night.  Others would play more, but most of the raiders had families and professional lives, lawyers, physicians, etc.  With that little time invested in raiding we were a 6/6 sunwell guild, clearing all of TBC raid content before WoTLK released.  It is completely viable to play for small amounts and be successful in raiding, even for Classic.
---
There will be casual guilds, there will be PUGs.  Your only hurdle is the time it will take you to reach 60, getting a bit of gear (you don't need pre raid BiS to raid, that is a fable), and making a smidgen of coin.
---
I wouldn't worry.
---
World of Warcraft has, by far, some of the most interesting bugs I‚Äôve ever seen in a game.

Apparently when your character is rooted - you‚Äôre not actually affected by gravity mechanics (this is why sometimes you can be rooted above the ground if it casts while you‚Äôre jumping) - this has interesting effects on displacement equations when gravity is set to zero. For instance there was a bug with a boss in the underbog I believe in TBC where it would kind of death grip your character and throw them around - however, because the gravity portion of the equation was not taken into account it would VIOLENTLY throw your character around at like Mach 3 and result in motion sickness for player so bad that one of the QA guys nearly threw up from testing it a few times. 
---
Also some funny ass bugs based on what things were client side and what things were server side.
---
What keyboard is that?
---
&gt; leeway is way diffrent.
---
So it's just different from you pserver experience? Then doesn't that just mean pserver were wrong? 
---
I'm not here to argue about how it should be in 2019 nor do I really care that much about #nochanges, but different from pservers doesn't mean it's wrong. And stuff like this, if it makes into classic on launch, will just mean players may have to adjust their strategies since the pserver's people practiced on were different.
---
Majority of the guilds wont have these.
---
Yeah it's basically impossible to solo any quests where you have to go into a cave or something because by the time you're done (if you're even able to pull everything one at a time) you'll have the entire thing respawned.
---
Oh yeah, rogue alt 100%.
---
If your codebase is so shit that every bug that pops up can introduce 2 new bugs you should burn it down and stop developing software. Your point is really out of touch with how software development happens.
---
Mate, did you even read the post? These are the bugs they're still trying to fix. 
---
&gt;The following issues have been confirmed as bugs and are still Known Issues as of our current Beta build:
---
&gt;* Hunter pets that died while the hunter was in a battleground are resurrected in an unhappy state when the battleground ends
---
&gt;* Auto Shot does not animate or display a missile when it fires immediately after Aimed Shot
---
&gt;* Aspect of the Pack will sometimes attempt to apply itself to mounted party members
---
&gt;* When a Quiver or Ammo Pouch is equipped, the tooltip for Aimed Shot incorrectly reflects an attack speed bonus from the Quiver or Ammo &gt;Pouch that it does not actually receive
---
&gt;* When taming a pet that teaches the Hunter a new Beast Training ability, the chat message does not report the ability‚Äôs rank
---
&gt;* The Hunter‚Äôs quiver may occasionally appear in the Hunter‚Äôs hand instead of the Hunter‚Äôs equipped weapon
---
Everything else is how it's supposed to be, because that's how it was back then.
---
You can't just cry "I WAN'T Scatter Shot, Wyvern Sting, and Freezing Trap to NOT share diminishing returns!" 
---
You're literally asking for your class to be buffed. What happened to #nochanges?
---
Can confirm, am using the same https://imgur.com/a/T0SON0L
---
I'll use them and expect it to be required in the guild I'm in. You just do a quick DM and use heads before raid. You're making it a huge deal when it really isn't.
---
I remember my first 40 man MC in vanilla. As a healer i felt it was personally responsible to keep all 39 alive. I went in an absolutely healing frenzy, popping potions and cooldowns until the Raid Leader posted some healing stats in the raidchat and everyone had a good laugh about my ridiculous overhealing.
---
I need to wait to actually play myself before I form a proper opinion on it.
---
The answer is basically the reason TBC had pvp gear
---
I think that it's more likely that they keep launching fresh servers that start at the beginning of the cycle again, and most of the players move to the fresh servers.
---
Sure, lets hope the classic dev team continious their work after lunch. Again a mgmt decision, if they keep up the ressources of a side project.
---
According to all the sources (wowhead and such) vanilla had 200ms batching. Where would they get the 400ms number from.
---

Assuming there aren't any cross-server BG's, which existed in 1.12 - if they implement cross-server, then the power of any one premade group to set an honor cap is diminished.
---
Ranking comes out in Phase 2.
---
Went from edgy teen to working adult. But still wanna play horde, but in all honesty I'll play whatever, just wanna play WoW with my friends again. 
---
Need to add a poll to my discord or something, there are few new people to our group that prefers alliance it seems, need to see if it's just a minority.
---
I was just trying to trick everybody into playing a gnome!
---
Thats funny this happened in Europre too, because Warsong-US was little Brazil by the middle of vanilla - free transfers to GuruBRashi didnt help either.
---
As far as I'm concerned this is one anecdote away from proof.
---
classic isn't even out yet, slow down
---
For single duels maybe, but you know scatter and trap will be on same DR, so there is no point to scatter trap. And how are you going to 2v1 when you can't even pre-trap, you will need it of cd asap. There is so many situations where this is a problem
---
So you‚Äôre a racists ?
---
It‚Äôs not a bug. It was intentional.
---
Rupture
---
Vanilla expansions would be great, keeping the core gameplay design the same but introducing new raids and content possibly expanding the vanilla lore. More stuff on the old god's, etc.
---
You might want to add region...
---
Can you please let people play the game how they would like to instead of telling them how to play?
---
Would you like me to pull out my pocket so you can hold onto it before we cross the street?
---
You could still vanish death coil or anything else because at some point during early vanilla, they implemented the "vanish immunity", a very short window of complete invulnerability after a vanish. This was done mainly in an attempt to reduce the amount of times rogues would immediately get hit out of stealth again right after vanishing, exactly due to lags &amp; batching.
---
And I would argue that rogues are among the ones benefitting most from spellbatching and leeway, since they get much better chances at f.e. just walking right through a hunters flare or a paladins consecration for their stealth opener without getting destealthed, which is just broken.
---
Didn't know there was so much hatred against this concept. Slow down dudes. It's not that big of a deal, just a discussion.
---
Mages are, along with hunters, the single strongest rogue counter in the game. What are you talking about?
---
I just play both, and gank my friends on either side.
---
I could swear when I first played, there was a Dishonorable Kill system, and on one of my first horde toons, I saw a Tauren fighting Brill guards. Might've just been an Orb of Deception, but I can't say for certain.
---
Falling behind the pack is one of my main concerns.  I think you have settled this for me once and for all.
---
Gotcha, thanks for the advice man! I appreciate it!

Low effort post. Posted 1000000 times. Reported.
---
Awesome! Thanks man. I've heard conflicting things regarding my question so this answer helps a lot!
---
They were a well made class, best DPS class IMO. By contrast some other classes felt unfinished.
---
Mages kinda sucked for PVP though, well 1 vs 1 anyhow.
---
Because we want to fight for inches.
---
They're both 1 button rotations in raids. Though I guess Warlocks have a curse they need to reapply every 5 minutes.
---
I realize lots of people will not be happy about some of these things being shared, but most hardcore players know of them and plan to employ them already - I'm not a fan of keeping information privatized.
---
I'm sure you could play. Your current setup is a good start. Using something like a foot switch will help as well. In addition to that I think you should roll on a pve server and consider playing something that isn't shaman. Shaman seems to be one of the most keybind heavy classes in the game. However if you are focused, I'm sure you could pull off any class.

Silverhand was launched after beta and you can find in lh Discord #announcement they said they used data from beta so thats why
---
Have been waffling between paladin and drood. And every time I see judgement it makes me 100% want to play pala.
---
&gt; So why is it suddenly a problem now?
---
1. They caved on language specific servers.
---
2. Layering has been lamented to death and some are even content they promised to alleviate its issues with timeouts or something.
---
3. Hunter bugs are getting adressed one by one.
---
What else should people do? Stop complaining?
---
Be careful with this, if keyboards have anti-ghosting features it will almost always be for WASD. Simply because it's the standard.

Ele/resto really works out ok for raid healing?

Magi are the only class I can think of that can reliably beat SPriests. They smash hunters and shaman. Can't speak to Paladins, but I can't imagine how you'd lose to them. Ferals might be tough, I guess, but they're really rare anyway.

Doesn't have to be secret. People have been theorcrafting and playing Classic WoW for years. Not condoning it ... but it is fully known, and acknowledged that they -do- it ... and it's still challenging, and enjoyable.

Very much 2006, keyboard turning, mouse clicking abilities :D
---
My wife and kids don't play purely because of the bugs. What bothers them the most is the spiders but they're really not keen on any of the other types either.
---
Is there a setting to specifically limit the number of steps to 1-2 instead of just the size of the box?  Some steps may require more space than others which I could see being problematic if the only control is size.
---
Caution: I started during BC so *slightly* different than vanilla/classic.
---
Mage was my first class. I LOVED it. I spent a ton of time at level 19 when I discovered BGs were a thing and didn't want to level up to 20 where I would be useless in WSG. 
---
In early level dungeons, I remember arguing with tanks because I would pull mobs before he/she was ready and just crowd control them. 
---
In Tanaris, I remember AoE farming hordes of pirates on the coast and selling cloth. 
---
I would say I was *really* good with my mage. Not the best. Not someone who would dominate the arena, but I *KNEW* where my frost nova would land; I *KNEW* if I had enough time to cast, etc. 
---
This happened slowly. I slowly became more and more comfortable with the mechanics. To be honest, I just messed around a lot and became more comfortable. That's my point. Go try things. Have fun. Don't try to be the best. Just do fun things that are out of your comfort zone. If things go south, pop ice block, blink, barrier, etc. Get out of there. 
---
The biggest thing you might be doing wrong, besides not playing more, is you might have inefficient keyboard/mouse control. Are you a keyboard turner? Are your spellbinds bound all around your left hand so you don't have to reach? Do you use macros?
---
I love your posts, keep em coming!

I love you both

Soul Reaper or whatever the warlock quest scythe was called.

Being a super cool edgy 14 year old who was super into Children of Bodom I thought that was the coolest thing ever.

Sure...... but you won't have three other classes competing for your like like warriors and mages do.

However I've owned multiple scimitars and nagas and all of them are frail and generally clunky.

I've switched to a logitech g502 and never looking back, 7 extra easy to reach buttons are more valuable to me than 12 small clunky ones.

No, once you put at least 5 talent points in any healing tree you're locked to R13

---
Not sure how many other games you play, but I just got the Razer naga trinity and it is awesome.  On the side it has a detachable that lets you choose whether you want it to be an mmo mouse or a mouse with only two buttons or a mouse with like 6 buttons in a circle. 
---
I use it so I can swap out for MMOs and FPS games on the fly.
---
It is still sold, went to logitech homepage and there were an add to cart button.
---
We didnt, he ran out of mana though.
---
Yup.
---
Just curious.
---
That's not really true, you can go to raids with any un-optimal spec you want as long as you join a casual raiding guild.
---
Not every guild is all about min maxing.
---
Maybe 5% buff to HP or bigger swing distance or WARSTOMP!! I mean, maybe be likes to pick flowers and be one with the Earthmother.
---
Just pfUI (it includes pretty much all the QoL stuff like map cords or one inventory etc.) and Questie.
---
The game isn‚Äôt all about raiding, I‚Äôm not talking about just raiding I mean in general you should play what you like not what‚Äôs meta but I understand what you mean I‚Äôve never been good at wording things well lol
---
Can we start removing these posts? There are new one's every day. Dame shit over and over
---
Razer Naga Trinity
---
My line up for Classic is the same as it was in vanilla:
---
Mage undead female
---
Rogue undead female
---
Warrior undead female
---
Priest undead female
---
Druid tauron male
---
Hunter troll female
---
Back in vanilla I never heard of anyone giving a damn about the gender of a fictional character.
---
However, times have changed and so has society. But, that does not affect my choise to recreate my line up in any way. I like the way the characters look and move. And even though I'm into RP, but I sometimes like to imagine that my characters had some kind of backstory.
---
If you start living WoW or put a sexual thoughts into your characters, or the characters of other players, you might want take a step back and talk to someone.
---
what is that like $150 a month?? for what?
---
thanks bro! How do you plan to level? if u have 5 characters are u going to spam dungeons?
---
Is 2 characters questing leveling fast? I have grinding..
---
I literally bought one and received it from Amazon this week. Got it for $29.39 with prime.
---
Camp out at zul farak lol.

Put your faith in the light!

Because the night is dark and full of terrors.  
---
Am I doing this right?
---
i didnt say scatter trap, just scatter
---
It isn't a bug in such that it is working as it does in their reference client of 1.12. But that doesn't change the evidence in favour of it being a bug. There's a comment in this thread where a guy explains the different types of CC and that scatter and freezing are in different categories. Along with it changing in the following patch and no other classes DRs. It's just unfortunate for hunters that classic is being based on a patch where this was a thing.
---
I have the same mouse but i dont recommend using it for FPS. Better get a second mouse for that. The trinity is a brick.
---
Same here friend.
---
Tha'ts true.
---
Im fully using troll rogue.
---
You missed the point again. I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs all about raiding. I‚Äôm showing you that to say ‚Äúyou can play any spec and do anything and it‚Äôll be great‚Äù is just misleading.  
---
Certain specs will absolutely have a bad time depending on what they try to do.
---
Enjoy having melee attacks reset your auto shot timer too. Kind of a big deal
---
I dont play male casters, its simple.
---
Really?  I thought compared to normal mmo mice it is insanely small!  I actually prefer it for my fps games now personally.
---
What is even more insane is if you look at the Mechanic Type of each ability they are different.
---
HOrDE hATES aLlIAnce.
---
It‚Äôs all about the animations you like. I‚Äôm doing an undead female because it‚Äôs what I did back in vanilla , ive played all males since so I‚Äôm ready to go back . That‚Äôs all there is to it. Anyone who thinks otherwise of picking a female might not be right in the head.
---
What class are you going to play? Let me guess... melee hunter?
---
Thank you. This feature was made possible be u/terozen and his quests database: [https://github.com/TyrsDev/WoW-Classic-Quests/](https://github.com/TyrsDev/WoW-Classic-Quests/) 
---
Can recommend highly for addon developers.
---
Regen is bonkers compared to pservers. It was a whole "thing" early in the beta, everyone called it a bug but it turned out to be as it should be. You basically never have to eat until like level 20.
---
I'll probably just start off with some sort of leveling guide addon/questie type of thing, Gatherer (or its equivalent), and an auctionhouse addon.  I can see an actionbar addon being pretty useful if only to clear up screen space.  I kind of like having the default bags because I can organize better than one big bag, but if there is an Ark Inventory like addon (what I used in TBC/WOTLK) which lets me make filters and such to organize then I'll probably grab that, too.  I'm really liking luna unit frames on pserver right now, but from watching streams the existing raid frames in classic look pretty great and may be totally fine. 
---
I'll pick up everything else as I play and find a need for it as I mostly just want to hop right into the game and not spend a bunch of time setting up addons.
---
Lol I mean you can make one yourself if you want. No one‚Äôs holding you back.
---
Lol, if you think you can make any meaningful distance with only scatter you are delusional
---
Male because I feel my character represents me in the game. That's right, a small green haired midget lobbing fire bombs at people.
---
I join this topic, I want to play on the English client in the Russian region. I am a player since 2006 and started the classics in English, but I want to play in the Russian region. Please solve this problem!
---
Yes, definitely.  I raided in college and did MC and BWL, and 2-3 hours a day is fine, you will just need like 4-5 hours on raid nights.  We were a semi-hardcore raiding guild, and were well behind the higher tier raiding guilds on the server in terms of progression, but we still had a lot of fun.
---
...and get back to spamming frostbolt
---
Super cutting edge pc, Inifite- core processors, unlimited overclocking , fusion-powered reactor, 5000 monitors... plays tetris.

Always found it a bit funny why people spend such absurd amounts on unnecessary things tbh, I know it looks cool and i'm not here trying to disrespect you or anything but how many people are actually going to step in that room and see it ? outside of posting screenshots on reddit to showcase your stuff feels like such a waste imo.

Yeah you‚Äôre right. I just made a quick title but I can‚Äôt change it now.
---
Oh thats right, Patch 0.6: [Kick]. It now has a 75% of working, similar to other interrupts.
---
You can write a pretty simple macro that will shift you out and cast that healing spell in one click. 
---
That is unless shifting out of form triggers the global cooldown.
---
Does anyone know if shifting out of form triggers the GCD?
---
It‚Äôs shadowbolt spam vs frostbolt spam
---
Playing as priest healer on horde side is much more boring in bg than on alliance side. On alliance side paladins does the defencive job that a priest has to do on horde side. Paladins are better suited for the job as well, so it is a better experience being a defencive paladin than a defencive priest.

It‚Äôs actually Luna.

World buffs are going to be super rare in Classic WoW.  Only the top raiding guilds will save turn ins for progression nights.  You definitely don't need world buffs to raid in Classic, only if you are trying to push pass how geared your guild is.
---
you can't but u still have trap. it just shares dr
---
Was on a medium pop server and it took about a month to go from 8 to 10 working a full time job and having a life. Depending on the class, might not be worth it.
---
Those armored boars from razorfen kraul(?) where actually tamable. My oinker turned quite a few heads back then, and he had that horrible scream when charging.
---
What does DR stand for?
---
It's a good guide. It's a downvote for other reasons
---
They might be bound to other actions not visible on his taskbar. For instance I use the R and F keys to cycle through targeting group members for healing.
---
Can‚Äôt check talents in vanilla right?

Here is the spell categorization for [Freezing Trap](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=14309&amp;page=1), the important part is "Mechanic Type 13" which is the CC type. Only one other spell shares mechanic 13 in the entire game (Ice Block). If you look at [Scatter Shot](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=19503&amp;page=1) you can clearly see that it has Mechanic Type 2 or "disorient" it shares a mechanic type with [Blind](https://wow.tools/dbc/?dbc=spellcategories&amp;build=1.13.2.30901#search=2094&amp;page=1) for example.

As a guy not interested in the other drama, I liked the guide. Good job, saw it two days ago on YouTube flow and watched it  2-3 times. 
---
Checking for your next video about farming.
---
You need to be specced in frost in the right way to aoe mobs down at that level. If you are already then consider looking up guides and checking that you're following the correct tactic.
---
Yeah, I saw it too. Post is edited now.
---
I play female chars in almost all games.
---
It started years ago in Ultimate Online and Asheron's call.  Me and the wife would be playing and dudes would just walk up and give her awesome crap. Blessed sandals, powerful weapons, etc.
---
Then in PvP, dudes would just get straight up destroyed that they got "beat by a girl".
---
Add in the fact they are better looking, smaller hit frames,  and have none of the disadvantages that real females have (periods, lower pay for equal work, etc),  I really don't see why anyone would play anything but female chars.
---
So that's where lit majors go when the graduate.

The guy above actually put ninja looting on the same level as donating to charity. He's a saint.

This is fantastic! Was about to read your latest post but realised I had missed 1 and 2! going for 2 next, this actually makes me excited to raid in classic for some reason haha
---
I've always been a casual player and I've barely ever raided (I've done a bit of kara on a very old rogue and a bit of naxx I believe during wotlk, it was so long ago I barely remember!)
---
Gonna be rolling a shadow priest this time round but I've heard there's never many during raids so makes me anxious if I'll ever get into raiding but I'd love to!
---
Ensure they differentiate between bug and insect.
---
Yep.  Spell batching and right-click reporting (NOT AUTO SQUELCH, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME THING) are the two dumbest things I've ever seen people screech about.
---
Dang indeed man, lucky! I'm going on a LARP too but much earlier, end of july, I won't have that luck :')
---
The community has a choice regarding the norms we adopt.  It saddens me that the prevailing loot policy has a built in assumption that people will screw you over if given the chance.
---
There's a reason why there are two options, need and greed.  Need means you can use it, greed means you can sell or auction it for gold.  The greed icon is even a little coin.  You can earn gold in a million different ways, while you might only see an Epic BOE drop once in a hundred hours of play.  It's a pretty shitty thing in my opinion to reduce that rare, exciting opportunity to just another pile of gold.
---
I missed your first post but first off, let me state that I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre excited about a project and also say that it takes a lot of courage to present something for feedback on a public forum like this. Keep it up and stay passionate about programming; that will get you far! I‚Äôve worked in tech for awhile now and wanted to provide some feedback.
---
&gt;	security wasn‚Äôt my concern because it shouldn‚Äôt at this point in the development
---
Security should be a concern from the beginning of a project, especially if handling user data. The ‚ÄúI‚Äôll address it later‚Äù attitude is all too pervasive in the industry and more often than not, means the bug, issue, ticket, etc. will never be tackled. As a project grows, your backlog of work will too and the less likely you are to tackle ‚Äúboring‚Äù issues. This holds true whether you‚Äôre a developer, IT, operations, or management.
---
A good place to start is [Secure Coding](https://developers.redhat.com/topics/secure-coding//) 
---
and [Defensive programming](https://enterprisecraftsmanship.com/2016/04/27/defensive-programming-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly/).
---
&gt;	this is the ALPHA of the BETA of the version 0
---
If a developer came to me stating this, I would turn him away. You should be confident in your product and at the very least be presenting a [minimum viable product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product). When in early stages, user feedback is often useless as the product could change drastically in the next few versions. 
---
Keep it up though, and keep submitting your tool for feedback! That will make it the best it can be. I‚Äôll be happy to help test come Classic launch.
---
Alrigty.
---
Some* signs. They also had better access to world buffs, and they were missing mechanics that reduce raid dps (newly discovered crit suppression and higher boss parry chance to limit threat gen, being two examples)
---
Stau way from Teldrassil and Tirisfal then wew lad.
---
There was a maze in WC?
---
What actually is the pickpocketing strategy? Never played rogue in classic
---
the biggest spots weren't even available in beta lmao
---
Yes.  This dude has a bunch of doubled up stuff with ElvUI; however, he probably prefers these versions over ElvUI's versions.  
---
For example, on live I use ElvUI, but I don't like the unit frames, so I replaced Elv's unit frames with ShadowedUF (essentially Luna).
---
I learned that too.  Kind of a FML moment given the number of times I‚Äôve run WC.
---
Hunters and Druids are annoying for their flare and Farie fire. Also grasp of the wild and thorns are a minor nuisance as well.
---
Exactly. This is just a horrible decision. And to the #nochanges brigade: you can choose either to have shared DR or not. Both are part of vanilla.
---
Just give the winners the money.
---
I will probably meal prep for 2 weeks for the both of us so she will leave me alone.
---
Glad there are people like you to balance things out, this guy almost made me think I was indeed being a dick :') his post was so disrepectful and then he's surprised when I answer in the same tone...
---
Probably just some quest tracker similar to the new one (in terms of auto-tracking, map locations), Details, TMW. Simple enough I guess.
---
Are either, both, or neither working in the Classic Beta as you would like?
---
I've only been in the stress tests, and from my limited experience there everything was fine. Keep in mind i started WoW in TBC, so i base my view from this angle.
---
If yes, why? If no, why not?
---
Yes. Combat felt like old WoW, and that's all i care about.
---
How could the current implementation of either be modified to improve their behavior?
---
Are the current implementations authentic to Vanilla (or "the Vanilla experience")?
---
I don't think i can say how to improve it, because i just barely remember how it was in TBC, but based off my memory it seemed all good when i played. Others may be able to more accurately remember how it was in Vanilla specifically. To me this particular thing felt authentic.
---
same i hit 11 as a no life 14 year old.  was easily playing 10 hours a day my premade group turned out 3 rank 14s (2 warriors, 1 mage) 
---
I think i just wanted the commander mount because the gear i was getting from pve at the same was just as good? I spent lots of time in aq40 
---
seen a lot of comments about rank 10 being easy to get and i dont say anything because reality will hit them soon
---
It sounds like a cool idea to me. If they did classic + for a patch or two then went to BC and did BC + there would be room for them to add it.
---
Salad Fingers plays WoW
---
100 gold per person that has to do some shit like this...
---
Not saying it absolutely won't happen, but prepare to be disappointed lol
---
Stop poking me!
---
G602 and never look back
---
Sounds like I got out while the gettin was good.
---
The trouble I see would be in being trusted enough to avoid trouble and griefing of planned events.
---
That means explaining things a lot and being willing to move shop to a less accessible area.
---
I don't see winning lockouts being well received.
---
I'd also try to keep rewards as consistent as possible to avoid entry price whining.
---
It's Mr. Unimaginative normie to you! And I'll let you know my Tolkien based RP is out of this world (of warcraft)
---
Will be using.... none! Just me, and WoW. Until I reach end game, where I know I'll need stuff to work with groups.
---
This looks to be a wrath expansion picture. The zepling in OG was added to go to Northrands. Plus I see a blood elf.
---
You're right, Stormwind is much better designed. There's a good reason for that. =]
---
I'm not sure if it's referenced in any books or publications that talk about the design and beginnings of WOW, but it must be referenced somewhere since it's a common question.
---
But way back when WOW was being designed, they had a ton of source material and assets to work from for Stormwind. SW was also the first city they built, so the level designers poured most of their effort and passion into this first project.
---
It was even clearly evident when you looked at the quests, their locations, total number of quests, number of zones available to Alliance vs Horde, and the intended player progression from zone-to-zone which was more focused and better designed. They received a ton more attention and polish.
---
Org, on the other hand, was treated more like an afterthought and was thrown together much later in the project. It got to a point where there wasn't really an official plan (just a basic design), so team members were allowed to construct it based on their own whims and imagination. 
---
Essentially, most Alliance content was built first during their burst of excitement, but then Horde was addressed during the later exhaustion periods. So, a lot of Horde zones were causalities.
---
False.
---
Funny how this gets downvoted because that's exactly what happens.
---
I am in the same boat, I hope I can reach 60 before X-mas... Once you are 60 don't worry, work towards your pre-bis, epic mount and some gold. 
---
If you are in a guild - you should join one during leveling - you should be fine since most guilds will at some point at least do some MC/Ony. Once you get a couple of items (mind you that can take a long time!) you can always get into another guild if needed. 
---
Once ZG launches things get even better since the loot (like bloodvine tailoring set) is mostly way better than MC stuff and you only need 20 instead of 40 people on a shorter lockout timer (the hard part about raiding in classic is NOT the mechanics and in the begining it is not about the gear requirements apart from passing the initial gear check in pugs) but getting 40 people together...
---
Fair play!
---
kek
---
It would be silly to have rewards like this on a weekly tournament. The only real purpose of the tournaments at all is a bit of a laugh. There's certain classes who will literally never win the tournament, and there's other classes who border on being guaranteed to win or at least get into the late rounds.
---
1v1 is about the worst balanced bracket possible, to make a repeatable high reward event every week.
---
As a Swede, i'm also very curious to why we wont notice anything.
---
Thanks i need to show this to my wife.
---
This the one from sunknen temple? If so, I had actually had this on my warrior and it was pretty great.
---
Makes sense to me! Thanks for the info man!
---
The son of a shepherd will not be denied.
---
Thanks for gold man! I very much miss those days of wow, im looking forward to it all starting again
---
Ya that doesn't sound like a bug. If it spied double DR after one application or something, that would be a bug.
---
Me too. It is glorious, isn't it? Bask in the light of the Ed-boys.
---
Bruh.
---
A WoW engineer told a story at BlizzCon in a small engineering panel about how art teams don't always understand the implications of their actions. An engineer buddy of his would frequently fly around in-development zones, checking performance in various areas. He found a certain spot where his FPS \*TANKED\* rapidly. He looked into it, and discovered that a designer wanted to use full-size trees as tiny Night Elf tree decorations in taverns/houses. The designer had no concept of why taking a model designed to be 100x bigger and just scaling it down with a slider, then packing several into a small space, would cause performance issues.
---
I fucking told you people. This is how Vanilla was! Private servers are not accurate. Your memories are bad.
---
You need to take a breath, sit back and analyze this conversation and the answers, watch some vids about game dev if needed, watch interviews about how they struggled to make Classic even possible, and then you can come back and tell me I need help just because I'm defending people working their asses off to offer a brat like you a good game with the least bugs possible in the time they have.
---
David, ty!
---
Yes, the modern API is very kind to shapeshifting. Apparently you can one click macro to shift out-&gt;take a potion-&gt;shift in.
---
My aoe farming got really good from doing alot of dire maul farming, especially lashers in east, its really the perfect training ground for it.
---
I remember my first time doing it, I sucked so bad  and barely made gold for weeks, if you stuff up alot the time wasted with gy run and repairs adds up quickly.
---
After a while I noticed I was improving a lot more, less deaths, faster runs, started pulling extra packs, got better at working my ice block and cold snap in the rotation for bigger pulls with less damage, landing novas and cones without taking damage.
---
It took a while but eventually I could do it without feeling like I was in any kind of danger, dm training really paid off in pvp environments to its just the perfect practice.
---
You'll definitely need a fair bit of practice, most the mages doing the aoe levelling likely have spent countless hours farming dm and have it down to an art.
---
I'm having a hard time placing it. Does sound fake though
---
you're thinking of quel'delar.
---
&gt;Thats not even close to the same thing but nice try. Donating to charity has to be the polar opposite of taking things you dont need from people that do. Keep on trying to rationalize your shitty behavior.
---
I suggest you practice reading comprehension, before engaging in an argument :)
---
I'll help you out this time:
---
1) you, saying that everybody, who doesn't donate a BoE item to a random player, is an thief, dirtback and selfish jerk
---
2) people who donate to charity and then go around saying that everybody who didn't donate are assholes
---
Obvious comparison is obvious.
---
Oh yeah. My first character ever was a troll shaman and I got lost in fucking Durotar in that craggy area around level 12.  Hearth? Nah. Look up a map? Nah. 
---
Deleted the bitch and started over. 
---
Younger version of me was a fucking idiot.
---
Right?  This guy leaps up, squeals, and starts jumping on the bed.  And the Streamer Razzie goes to....
---
Imo you can get away with that build if it‚Äôs a very casual guild
---
Haha because it was a VERY bad breakup on our server.  And I personally felt pretty bad for that guild leader.  It was still pretty early in Vanilla so it was basically the first time I saw a guild completely implode.  Weird moments stuck to me like that.
---
Did I get everything 100% accurate? Probably not, but the theme of the story was that the GL got ganked, camped, and his guild later imploded that night.
---
Got something you want to share man?
---
Weakauras and import an aura for mana regeneration ticks.
---
I stopped using ISBoxer when it decided to hijack ‚Äú\‚Äú and I couldn‚Äôt figure out why.  Cleared all the keybinds, turned off everything in config, nothing worked. 
---
Ended up going back to autohotkey, which isn‚Äôt perfect but at least I know everything it‚Äôs doing and I‚Äôm not at the mercy of whatever update ISBoxer decides to push out.
---
The only reason I would argue that warriors are a better dps class is because warriors dont have to drink. Warriors also do much better numbers until mages can roll fire. Mages are definitely NOT shit in pvp, they are just insanely squishy. Because they are so frail, they have a very low margin of error. Mages are very strong against warriors and rogues but struggle against hunters, shamans, warlocks and spriest. They do always have the option of resetting a fight with polymorph and running away. Their aoe also makes them insane in world pvp.
---
Hey bro. As you‚Äôve seen with the above replies, it can clearly go either way. 
---
IMO, a lot of the core players, the ones who played this game on release, were around the demographic of anywhere between 14 to 25, meaning that right now, 15ish years on, we‚Äôre all very established in our lives with full time jobs, mortgages, kids.
---
What I‚Äôm getting at is - a lot of us are going to be in the same boat, with only 2-3 hours per night up our sleeves (as opposed to back in the day when it was 8-10 hours a night).
---
I wouldn‚Äôt stress too much - you‚Äôll find a guild that‚Äôll mesh with your current lifestyle. Like everyone‚Äôs saying, just level your main, have fun, gear up with your pre-raid BiS... you‚Äôll find the place that‚Äôs right for you with no stress (just roll a healer IMO, that way you‚Äôre always in high demand).
---
If I'm going to stare at my characters ass for hours at a time, you can bet it's going to be a female.
---
I used a Naga back when they first came out (maybe around wrath?)
---
I was the best God damn holy paladin alive with all those buttons on my mouse.
---
The second half of the video wasn't really that important but holy shit the sitting for regeneration of health makes the entire video worth it.
---
Someone literally streamed a single sitting 1-40 run in the last week or two.
---
Not donating to charity isnt taking something from someone else. The better comparison would be saying if you dont give random people mount money you're a bad person because that is basically charity work. What you're suggesting is actually taking something from someone so you can sell it. This is the equivalent of stealing your grandmother's medicine so you can sell it, because your need for money is like a need for the meds. That makes you a shitty person AND an idiot. But this form of argument is terrible because I never said anything about charity and you never said anything about granny's drugs but you blow the position out to an onscene level then defeat this outrageous position easily, its a really terrible way to form an argument because it doesnt address the actual issue. But hey maybe one day you'll learn how to form an argument.
---
Yes, but battery life with a pair of Duracell is 30+ days, longer if you turn it off when not using it.
---
Avoided wireless for that very reason. Now I have 3 g602s in case mine ever gets loose buttons or stops working. I absolutely love this mouse.
---
I only play male undead.  All other races are stupid.
---
Can you not lock pick that chest on beta?
---
I want to add: I bought a Logitech g502 and left click broke after &lt;5000 clicks. Very disappointing.
---
I'm back to using a kinzu v2 pro but probably not the best mouse in terms of available button macros.
---
Rokkat nyth, swappable buttons.
---
Alch herb is good. Both can make money and you'll save yourself some cost in being able to pick your own ability reagents.
---
Everyone talks about eng being mandatory but this is coming from people with a money flow and playing alts, using as many consumables as possible to min max.. It's best to have, eventually. it's nice to have grenades and stuff, but it's More fun to have mounts and gear first. You can help your raid with aoe explosives but just showing up with potions and being raid ready is expensive in the first place.
---
But od course we have to use extremes right?
---
If anyone rather spend 6 hours in a raid, just waiting on people using the bathroom and "getting water", that's great!
---
I just don't see many wanting to spend several hours on a Saturday doing a raid.
---
In a DnD session I absolutely hate it. In WoW I really don't care.
---
It's 6 hours, and not rumored, but official.
---
Ony/Nef and Hakkar heads are on CD.
---
Rest of the buffs, DM, Songflower, DMF are not on CD.
---
I'm a big fan of the Naga Hex.
---
On my second one in the last 8 years or so. I find that the 7 thumb buttons are just the right amount around the thumb pad to be easily accessible without having to worry about accidentally hitting the wrong button. I've seen the 12 thumb-button mice, but it just seems to be too much.
---
I'd prefer they just enable Arena in Classic without titles and rewards.
---
Absolutely, best of luck in your endeavor. Projects like this are what employers want to see on your resume. It shows commitment and that you are a self-starter. I‚Äôve got it bookmarked for launch :)
---
And that's why I said you need to do your research, because you're still talking out of your ass. Just because they have a reference didn't mean they had the manpower to test this. They had to make this beta, and for this they had to set it up, find who to invite according to what, make decisions for global things like spell batching and all.
---
Your argument about their history of fucking up is also screwed, because this team is not the same as the one working on the current game. This beta was the first with the report bug being more fleshed out, they organized stress tests with fun events, they communicated what was happening way more.
---
So either research the process or keep using the wrong hole to express yourself, but I'm out.
---
YES!  Thank you for picking up on that.
---
As I said in a different reply..... it's possible that other rogues were capable, but the details were hazy. Maybe they just didn't have enough rogues that night.  Maybe the GL was always in charge of certain traps? IDK.
---
Point being (like I tried to describe in my first BWL post) was that BWl was a guild breaker because it easily broadcasted your weakest links in your guild.  MC wasn't necessarily like that.
---
The fact that any of us would subject ourselves to that is ridiculous and funny. We get s second chance now üòÜ. 
---
A buddy of mine who I played with in vanilla and still game with today is got GM on two characters, priest and rogue. He actually did it on own.  Now that‚Äôs insane.
---
One of my vacations (I get 5 a year so nbd using one for WoW) falls on the release date, and at first I was excited, but decided to actually push it 2 weeks later to avoid the mass fuckery. I'll still be playing quite a bit after work those 2 weeks before, but I'll save the long grinding sessions for when the game can handle long grinding sessions.
---
That was my plan! Roll healer so everyone is my frand :) But thanks for those reassuring words!
---
bruh?
---
Requires macros. Druid streamers Ebn and Stormx both said it seems smoother then Pservers did.
---
Most of the direct posts, not really, some of the comments seem to be more on the level though.
---
hey I'm a hunter :'( (shit I just cried)
---
It's strange though, how selective they are with "blizzlike" things like this, even if it's a completely negative thing.
---
What next, are they gonna make C'thun bugged and unkillable for 4 weeks after AQ40 releases too?
---
It‚Äôs just not good. You‚Äôre a worse healer and worse dps.
---
All the real bugs are being fixed. All the contentious stuff is being confirmed as true. 10 years of private servers have warped peoples minds of how mechanics worked. 
---
Hunters will be weaker in classic than private servers (relative to themselves), but will be just how they were back in 2006.
---
Hunter is fine to play if that's what you want to play.
---
Interesting I didn‚Äôt know that. Thanks for the information.
---
That is the level 60 mount, why does that bother me so much.
---
STRONK BULL CHINA T2 TONK ROOOOOOAR
---
HL2 still holds up fairly well imo.
---
&gt;No, it takes pretty specific timing that can't easily be predicted. Yes, it will happen, just as it did in Vanilla, but it won't be every time.
---
so don't run too far.
---
Make some friends, or make your own groups....
---
My personal experience with logitech has been rather good. If something broke down they have changed the product for free.
---
you think this isnt going to happen any way...haaaaaaaa
---
even getting to the instance with the group was sort of a bonding experience in classic.
---
This is the one I used back in TBC and wrath and I loved it. It broke sometime after cata launched so the lifespan of these mice are not great. But I recently bought a new one because of the muscle memory I developed for it.
---
The best feature of this mouse is the curvature of the side button panel and the 'home row' bumps on the 5 and 8 buttons. It makes it much easier to know where your thumb is and reduces the learning curve for thumb memory.
---
Undead Priest healer reporting in.
---
I think female tauren, gnome &amp; orc look cooler than their male counterparts, but that's about it.
---
Leeway wasn't implemented until later in vanilla. I'm not saying 100 % this is the reason, but it could possibly explain a difference.
---
You're mumbling a bunch of gibberish on what they've done so far to date whiteknight - you're not tackling the issue which is the fact there's a chance we'll have a bugged class on release, which is not fine at all.
---
I know what they've done in details more than you ever will because I actually care about this.
---
Here's some homework for ya - go research how Blizzard has gone to shit and it all reflects in their games ever since Activision merger happened. Maybe you'll get your head out of your ass one day.
---
Don't think a good mage or any hunter has problems with rogues in wpvp.
---
Most of it is easy to navigate.  The beginning of the right section with Skum and Pythus before the jump can be a pain.  It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôre ever lost, there‚Äôs just so much extra trash you can end up clearing.  Following the mushrooms is ‚Äúoh, there‚Äôs skum.  Oh, there‚Äôs pythus.  Oh, there‚Äôs the dreadfangs before the jump.  Why did I kill way more stuff than I had to before?‚Äù
---
People often underestimate the social aspect of guilds when talking about things that would improve a raid group. If the guild is stuck on something the top performers in the guild will often start to question why other people are doing a lot less than them. This is either solved by improving the underachievers or the top people looking into joining another guild.
---
you and the ed,edd,eddy guy are keeping this sub alive... top quality meme game
---
You mean more unresponsive than private servers?
---
Seal twisting isn't going to be viable on blizzard classic. Paladins don't have the mana to spam.
---
That's some bullshit right there, you can get it, yes drop chance is low, but you can get the item.
---
Same with blade of iternall darkness from princess, takes 50-100 runs but you can get it.
---
Meanwhile sheep lasts like 25seconds lol. This is really a gamebreaker for me, my memory of Hunter was long traps.
---
This reminds me why I shouldn‚Äôt take for granted that what I know is not common knowledge as a raid leader.  (goes the other way around as well). Especially the parry on bosses can cause wipes since hunters and melee classes can be oblivious of this mechanic.
---
Really really not a big deal. The people that get upset at someone for playing a character of the opposite gender are far more abnormal than that person.
---
Because that's how the game worked back then even if you had 20 ms ping, which many people had. It's accurate. They're going for accuracy. Changing it would affect gameplay and class balance.
---
The only reason people asking for this to change bothers me is because so many of you keep trying to frame it in a way that tries to pretend that it wouldn't be a change. It 100% would be a change. It would make the game feel better and more responsive, but it would be a change. Stop lying to yourselves and coming up with excuses for why you think it wouldn't be a change due to some bullshit any 56k modems that doesn't even reflect how the majority of people likely played WoW (while many people in North America were still on dialup in general, most gamers were on broadband, and while Australians didn't have their own local servers yet, they were a small minority, and the entire reason they argued for local servers back then was because they had already been used to getting 15-60 ms ping in games like Quake and Counter-Strike where they could run local servers). 
---
Most WoW players likely didn't have high ping back then. Even though the game's systems were built at the time to accommodate high ping players, those systems affected all players. Changing those systems would affected all players again. It's a change. Just say "I want this to change so the game will feel better." Just say that. You don't have to feel bad about it. Just be honest. You'll feel so much better being honest with yourselves. You don't have to lie about ping times.
---
Eh no, specially the scatter + frozen trap DR thing...
---
Yeah for the EXTREMELY small amount of people that rush to 60 to raid.....MOST people making there way to MC in the LATER part of phase 1 (when layering is taken out) wont be able to exploit layering.
---
No, they won't because of crossrealm BG's.
---
My very first ever character was a nelf druid.
---
My main attack was melee attack. I sometimes used wrath - rarely.
---
I couldnt kill the bear spirit i needed to kill for level 10 bear form quest, so i quit, and made a new character :p
---
Warriors have better DPS than mages.
---
Only 1 mage gets to top DPS per fight due to the way ignite works and that's not REALLY their DPS. It would be akin to Deep Wounds stacking and whomever hit the biggest Deep Wounds gets all the damage.
---
As you can see they start in TBC
---
quick and dirty back of the napkin math using some known splits of other speed runs says this 1-40 time would be on pace for about 3 days and 20 hours /played. Impressive.
---
Im pretty sure its gonna be a Rogue. Running ubrs 5000 times for truestrike shoulders is my dream.
---
Good thing that 31 point talent shares DR with that 21 point talent. Wouldn't want two hunters to group up with each other and use both on the same guy... Those double hunter teams were just too strong /s
---
This nerf was only for a few patch and got reversed later. This is not how Hunter worked in most of vanilla.
---
i never claimed it wasn't the right way? I Just said that OP is wrong about it being the same as private :p Atleast thats what i meant
---
There's no cooldowns on DMT,  DMF, or Songflower.
---
Rogues and Warriors can level at an ok pace if played right. But they are certainly a step down from every other class.
---
but isnt questing with 2 characters faster because you are killing everything twice as fast??
---
doesn't really work consistently since its only "sometimes" based on spellbatching or server ticks i believe
---
Not to mention a much more compelling playstyle
---
Yes and? - What is your point? - Of course I am talking about BfA, as Classic is not even out yet.
---
This is what I do, today, in current WoW. I figured the other comment where I said I've been doing this for 10+ years would have alluded to that.
---
While funny, every poll conducted shows Rogues being the 5th or even 6th most played class.
---
You're going to be seeing a lot more Mages, Hunters, and Warriors than Rogues.
---
Breaks easily, buttons are too small and they stick, the mouse as a whole is very small. Mouse wheels are always faulty on these mice I don't know why but the internet is full of people complaining their mouse wheels don't register anymore. I've had to send 3 of the 4 naga/scimitar mice I owned back to warranty and just gave up on the 4th when it inevitably broke. Out of them though, the scimitar is more durable and if you insist on the thumb-pad, I'd recommend it over razer mice.
---
Sounds accurate to Vanilla.
---
Got proof? No? Then go sit in the corner and think about how your life choices ruined your chances at any decent career.
---
&gt;What makes you think running through traps / running through blizzard doesn‚Äôt have to do with spell batching
---
Spell batching adds a brief delay after a spell hits. With the traps/blizzard issue, the spell never hits to begin with. Also, how does "batching of position updates" even relate to spell batching? Not even sure what you mean by that
---
Yeah the really big one for me - in which I want to run early is just wailing caverns for the staff so I can crush lower level stuff for a while. There aren‚Äôt many(might not be any) other two handed rewards that I need to rush to get an instance done - quest wise.
---
You get coverage of every blessing by bringing ~3 paladin healers. Which, considering their strength, you should be doing anyways.
---
Ofc one one would his professions in a duell, imagine telling a blacksmith to unequip his crafts? So ofc ingi stuff is legal in duells. Anyone but alchemists using pots in duells are lame.
---
Does anyone know how to gif the gnome at the 7 second mark? It looks just my friends and I'm sure she'll love it
---
lol that skinning post is ultra tryhard. There's barely a difference, he just says don't bother skinning once you've leveled the skill enough, until you can do thick leather.
---
In BC you have much more of a case..
---
Shoutout till lundgrens.
---
They will literally never fix "all the bugs." It's a matter of getting the highest impact and most visible bugs as quickly as possible.
---
BoE items can be exchanged for gold via AH/trade, and vice-versa, so they are interchangeable. So when you say "I give a BoE to a random player" - it's the same as saying "I give x amount of gold to a random player". That's charity in my book. That's to the discussion about arguments. 
---
And please explain me, how can I take something from another, when that something never belonged to them in the first place? Is it theirs only because they need it more? If you win a lottery - must you give the winnings to a random person, who needs it more? You can, sure, and you'll be awesome for doing it. But you're arguing that anybody who doesn't do it is an asshole, which is just lidacris.
---
Yeah i really didnt wanna reach for Mages on something silly like that. Having free consumes is not a net loss just cuz ppl want em.
---
I just hope people realize that "Casual Guilds" = MC/Ony/ZG.
---
Aint no casual guild that allows meme specs clearing BWL, AQ, or Naxx.
---
on point
---
And yet, we all loved it for what it was
---
Hey this "1.12 reference client" sounds like a good time. Can we have that instead of this Legion/BfA Frankenstein client? Thx Blizz
---
I would not underestimate them when it comes to this. They have decades of experience in precisely this and learned from their mistakes.
---
If they can do one thing then it is estimating likelihoods for the potential release outcomes.
---
We tend to forget that they have much much more info available than we do. Info that is not available to the public.
---
Even if their prognosis has to be inherently biased, they know very well it is. And they can estimate the bias and come up with boundaries for it.
---
Doesn't say anything about scatter, it added a separate school of DR which only freezing trap was apart of, i assume to prevent multiple hunters holding you hostage with infinite freezing traps. If it was an intentional change to scatter/trap why wouldn't they add freezing to scatter's table or vice versa like they have for every other DR related nerf?(such as blind/fear in mid wotlk to put cull the power of rogue/priest).
---
I can't think of a single other time in the history of WoW where two abilities outside of eachother's DR would DR eachother, that kind of breaks the rules of the system at that point.
---
Also the guy above with 8 upvotes quotes the dr/trap being off dr as happening in Patch 2.0.12 3 April 2007
---

---
don't see anything about related to freezing trap there at all? did he just link something and reddit just believed it without even checking? lol'd
---
Rogue is actually the 5th or even 6th most popular choice. Horde side Shamans are even higher.
---
It'll be interesting to see if this holds true.
---
Another fantastic post, these are really making my work break a lot more entertaining!

The honor system is one thing I wouldn't mind if they revamped or changed it for classic, considering it was removed completely in later patches I'd like to think that blizzard wasn't completely happy with it, would be awesome to see the honor grind still but maybe being able to keep ranks would keep the grind feeling less grindy? For myself personally I definitely won't have time to get rank 14 (however much I'd love to) and it would make things like honor cartels redundant, you'd still have the community but anyone could hit rank 14 without having to sink their whole month in just bg's, and you wouldn't have someone telling you when you can hit that rank
---
I don't know really just spit balling, I'd guess they'd have it just as it was though.
---
Worst enemy very good mage, or just warriors in general. Easiest prey, bad or even decent mages, other rogues, non sl locks, priests, hunters. Best friends other rogues, mage.
---
Wow so strange lol I'm doing opposite, mage main and warlock alt :)
---
I plan on doing it day 1 (solo on my main would be faster) but I don't care about hitting 60 asap, been there and done it. MC and Ony will be cleared soon enough and phase 3 isn't until 2020 (purely a guess)
---
So while I want to be efficient while leveling- I'm choosing to go slower, dualbox and have both my mage and warlock leveled to 60 well before phase 2 hits.
---
There is nothing about traps in patch 2.0.12....
---
Hi friend! I understand your frustration, there were indeed issues with the \ key before. \ is a special character used for escaping text, and this caused the bug you ran into at the time. The reason you couldn't figure it out is probably just that it was a bug, not something you configured wrong or something that ISBoxer "hijacks".
---
Part of what you get from paying for ISBoxer is support, from paid support staff! You can come and talk to us about why "\" was broken for you and you couldn't figure out why. You can also choose not to apply updates when things are working fine for you, and you can choose to revert to a previous version. 
---
There's no "at the mercy of whatever update ISBoxer decides to push out" any more than there is "at the mercy of whatever update autohotkey decides to push out."
---
Have a good one. :)
---
Oh. I see! So like 1, 2 and 3 levels higher? Not them being orange, red and skull?
---
Yes, your pet clawing instead of growling makes your pet never have aggro and youre always running away
---
And the people doing all that theory crafting will play classic regardless, but the diehards arent what carry a games population.
---
Basically a Tauren Warriors can hit ranged classes from melee range if they use the leeway technique properly.
---
 üéµ you used to call me on your hearthstone üéµ

Sitting while being hit will still cause you to be crit, but the crit won't proc talent-based effects. Official Blizzard reference [here](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-not-a-bug-list/175887):
---
&gt; The following is a list of commonly-reported gameplay in WoW Classic that is not actually a bug, and is working as we expect it to:
---
&gt;
---
&gt; Being critically struck while using /sit to sit does not cause abilities like Enrage, Blood Craze, and Reckoning to activate.
---
Full clear  mc, bwl, ony tales 2-3 hours.
---
Zg About an hour 
---
Ubrs  About an hour 
---
Thats what i had time to do as a dad with limited time to play.
---
Yes.
---
And that‚Äôs completely fine. I do believe you can set ml to blue+ in vanilla still. And it won‚Äôt take 2-3 minutes to do loot. Iirc a lot of 5 mans I did in vanilla with even pugs were ml.
---
Honestly
---
Logging in because I enjoy the game, not because I have to accomplish "xyz" or check a daily box.
---
Never really enjoyed leveling that much so I always look forward to max level. (Same goes for other mmo's I've played)
---
thank you dad &lt;3
---
idk..
---
animations for me are kinda split decision. I like the 360, stealth walk male is better, female dodge.
---
male big shoulder depends on the set. 
---
female size fits rogue.
---

Hmm by the looks of it, i think pserver
---
That is until you discover the G502 is superior in every way.
---
* Wired (and you're only going to get 1 month out of the G602 batteries if you leave it in the low-precision Endurance mode)
---
* Higher DPI range
---
* Surface tuning
---
* Metal fast scroll wheel (as opposed to the shitty rubber one on the G602)
---
* Customizable weight
---
* Customizable color options
---
What do you feel like spamming, healing touch or chain heal ?  
---
In pvp druids carry/defend flags, they don't heal others as well as they heal themselves.
---
So you‚Äôre a Druid then... What makes you want to be a Druid? I‚Äôve been considering it as I played one as my alt, but idk if I want to be a healer endgame and then never get the feral gear I want because rogues. Also bothers me the tier sets aren‚Äôt setup to make you bad ass at feral. The fun of shifting and healing and outlasting and having lots of tools is appealing though. Thoughts? (Sorry to bombard your comment lol)
---
https://www.twitch.tv/ahmpy/clip/VictoriousCoweringPelicanPhilosoraptor
---
Is this expected behavior for traps as well? I don't ever remember an NPC running through my trap.
---
Its always worth using rapid fire on cooldown since its always a dps increase.
---
I have Steelseries Rival 500. It has a good grip and lots of buttons reachable with your thump
---
6th most popular choice is the same thing as 3rd least popular choice... There are 9 classes in the game mate.
---
So we agree.  It will only be an acceptable practice for the highest end guilds in Naxx, and a requirement for woke guilds who want to pretend to be hardcore and requiring it for MC/BWL. lol
---
Mages have options if they survive the initial combo. Hunters need to rely on FD/trap shenanigans if they're opened on. In both cases as long as you have the stamina to withstand the initial combo it's workable but otherwise it's possibly a death sentence.
---
Not an entire year lol
---
Ony/Nef might turn out to be a massive pain if Blizzard actually decide to put it on a multi-hour CD. Even with some cooldown-tracking tool, this would force me to grab DMT days early and log on whenever the respawn overlaps with my playtime window - making me not play my main character in the mean time.
---
I really hope this turns out differently, either removing wbuffs altogether, or removing that cooldown time. I would prefer a solution that does not greatly incentivize account sharing.
---
Right, because vanilla theorycrafting is such a complex body of knowledge... Lmao.
---
Even if it's a rare occurence, I'd still rather not leave it to chance whether or not my tank will get insta-merked. Warriors can tank every boss a druid can tank, but not the other way around. I agree, it wouldn't be bad to bring them as offtank, if it weren't for the fact that they can't keep armor shatter or nightfall up.
---
Outside of maybe the first 2 weeks in MC before your warrior MT gets raid gear, feral druids are redundant.
---
Voice makes it almost impossible to understand but with subtitles it is great !
---
I am glad that I watched - many good tips ! Thank you !
---
&gt;Having always been a casual PvPer through the lifespan of retail, I've decided I want to take PvP more serious this time. 
---
Do you see yourself farming AV for 12+ hours a day? With not missing a single day for months on end?
---
Just try and hit rank 10 or 11 for the mount and call it a day - will still take a lot of pvp but more doable.
---
It wasnt tho.
---
Jesus Christ these kind of comments are so cringe.
---
Show us the patchnotes that says Scatter (disorient) shares DR with Freezing Trap (freeze)
---
I had 50-70 ms from Florida to the Texas server cluster before it got consolidated into Chicago. I knew people in SoCal who got 20 ms to the West Coast servers. Most Euros reported sub 30 ping to their local servers in Vanilla.
---
Paladin is not an option. Horde for life!
---
But chain heal is a fun way to heal and I like being in high demand. I just wonder if a druid would be a better choice because of less competition.
---
Things to consider, but your input is appreciated!
---
It‚Äôs the guy‚Äôs tag line at the end of all his videos! This comment actually made me want to watch it because he does a good job.
---
Good to know ISBoxer will work. I was pretty sure it would since it's pretty much game homogeneous. I love the VFX option, it makes healing so much easier. I also enjoy the in-depth videos/tutorials from Mirai.
---
There is a more simple solution - roll orc warrior. Not only you will win rogues even faster , but you will probably never be attacked by one in wpvp
---
I'd rate rogues above warriors for leveling mainly thanks to getting +hit from talents and having a reliable escape option. With good weapons, both classes can surpass priests and paladins in terms of leveling from what I've seen.
---
It is slower but not too much slower. Kill quests and quests that drop for everyone is way faster.
---
Xp is shared between characters (2 characters gives no bonus xp, a 5 man group get 140% xp split between the group).
---
Xp from killing mobs is slower when multiboxing because of travel time.
---
If a mob gives 100 xp and you kill it in 10 seconds and move to another mob in 5 seconds, then you got 6.77 xp per second. If you have 2 characters you maybe kill it in 5 seconds and move to another mob in 5 seconds so 3.33 xp per second per character.
---
Same thing when doing quests that need to kill an amount of mobs that increase with the amount of characters. Losing xp because of travel time and respawn time.
---
I think that is where most of the xp is reduced.
---
Going Horde. I see you had a mixup but got it corrected.
---
Druids are a class that just straight up are not sexy, which I think drove a lot of people away from them in vanilla. While they had a defined role as a healer, they were not the best single target healer (that's a priest/paladin), nor were they fantastic multi target healers (rejuv spam works, but HoTs don't stack in vanilla). They bring a lot of utility, but a lot of people like to top meters, which a good druid certainly can do, but they aren't really designed for it. In 5-man groups, you don't have a basic rez ability, so the connotation is that you're not a 'real healer', and if you want to tank, you have to fight the stigma that only warriors can tank.
---
Feral spec in vanilla was really a meme, so was moonkin, so I think the appeal wasn't there. However finding a good druid was something that was like finding a gold mine. Someone that knew how to squeeze the most out of the class was hard to find - but incredibly useful in a raid environment. 
---
It seems the community is much more open these days to druids, so we may see a resurgence. Just echoing some of the thoughts and remembrances I had from playing back in vanilla.
---
I've been trying to convince myself to go alliance this time through, but I don't know if I can play anything that isn't forsaken :/
---
I mean maybe I was terrible, but 100g a week was way more gold than I possibly could generate in a week while having anything resembling fun playing the game. I did do a lot of respeccing, but at some point when you've got 4-5 hours of non-raid game play time a week, its just not remotely feasible to be trying to respec and farm up that 100g plus basically any other gold at all.
---
I expect the outcome there to be the same as this video. Gonna be the biggest raid wipe in history.
---
Create a guild called &lt;Fish Vendor&gt;, RP walk around in your leather gear and ask people politely, if they want to buy some self caught fish to prepare for their adventure. Also dont forget camp fire while fishing. 
---
I made the best bucks in Booty Bay and Ratchet. I even had a RP hood in Booty Bay. 
---
Man those times.
---
Thanks for the info
---
I am going to enjoy causing drama with money from anonymous alts.
---
"I'll give you 10,000g on any server of your choice and pay for your server transfer (where you'll be able to change your name). All you have to do is ninja your guild's first TF Binding drop."
---
Thanks for this!
---
Agreed. 14 requires you to no-life the game hardcore for a pretty long time. 
---
10/11 is much more reasonable, and still gives solid rewards.
---

Its like with title president you will always have that title
---
Yes female does have a better dodge, it's really cool. But it's about the only animation the female orc has that looks better I would say. Especially the stealth walk bothers me.
---
Funny, cus thats literally all we need against warriors.
---
Not a single patch note ever says that scatter and freezing trap should share DR and the patch he linked 2.0.12 where it was supposably fixed, doesnt mention anything about trap or scatter, he picked the latest patch 2.0 he could just to make it seem that people are unreasonable.
---
Jesus Christ is so cringe.
---
Whoa,  got em!
---
Alright, best of luck to you two!
---
I would probably heal exclusively. Tanking does have some appeal, but not enough to lose my healing status.
---
Good to know all of this. I know a lot of critics of the class say druids are "doomed to heal". But considering that's what I want to do, I don't see it as a flaw. I just don't want someone to always replace me with another healer.
---
And what do you mean, Hots don't stack? Can I not put Rejuv on more than 1 target at a time?
---
Thanks
---
Like a non raiding guild? I mean if all you want to do at end game is sit outside a raid sure.
---
Show us the patch notes that says scatter and freezing share DR.
---
Except those experiences weren't Vanilla.
---
If it even vaguely looks female it can be distracting, wow models are a huge step up from Egyptian hieroglyphics or ancient cave paintings of a naked woman and those certainly passed for visually stimulating, nature just wants to reproduce THAT badly. Shame on the internet for trying to over psychologize that simple fact into "mostly men" being losers for admitting it. It was true with all the alien chicks in Star Trek and Star Wars, I heard a woman once say the blue avatar creatures were hot, the list goes on, if it looks vaguely human, some brave man will go where no man has gone before.
---
Show us how they "CLEARLY" put in the 1.10 patch, ill wait. Show us the part about Scatter.
---
I have a cataclysm mouse that I like a lot. Only concern is I couldn‚Äôt get any of my extra buttons to map in the beta. It‚Äôs funny but I got to figure out how to make that mouse work.
---
Right, I know that grouping is far more efficient, but for the times that I'm alone, I was asking which stats would give me the most damage.
---
yea im guessing he got in his own head and he was already defeated by the guild stalling on a old easy boss
---
Until the main tank wonders why he can't reapply sunder stacks because the boss doesn't have anymore debuff slots.
---
For real? Thought it was less than 1%
---
Hahaha
---
Oh that's actually great to hear. I feel like some of the wild critters on the pserver I'm on are spawning too quickly - while I was trying to clear troggs last night, I'd get through 4 or 5 before they'd start spawning on me and adding onto my pulls.
---
No, Scatter + freezing trap DR is a bug. Never ever mentioned in any patch notes.
---
With macros yes but no power shifting.
---
FTH! I did. I gonna go shammy this time. I always pick hunter in all games, so imma shake it up this time. Good luck!
---
Viable does mean "viable in raids" in the context of the conversation. Not sure what makes you say that their healing is so much worse - 30 points in holy gets you all of the useful healing talents. What you're going to lack is mana regen from disc, and that can be made up with potions. This is very different from a shadow priest.
---
You can use a totem bar addon. In most situations you will always use the same totem per element so if you prepare the totem sequence ahead of time you can potentially reduce totems to one single keybind. Here is an example of such an addon https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/project-1228.
---
Ofc this approach is a little less flexible than having keybinds on all totems but a Shaman that plants totems is already 70% better than a Shaman who doesn't(which there will be plenty).
---
Paladins wear plate in pvp :)
---
Sunken Temple is a shtshow.
---
Yeah, if the chats were combined. The question isn‚Äôt looking for the Alliance Barens equivalent, it‚Äôs looking for the Alliance Barens CHAT equivalent
---
Yeah, there was a holy bomber spec (disc up to power infusion and holy up to the DPS talents) that put out some eyecatching numbers. It was something of a joke build because casting times were long and interrupts on the holy tree shut out heals *and* dps. In practice, even with the spec you were still more useful slinging heals than dps.
---
Also, I might be remembering this incorrectly, but outside normal resist chances there is no holy resistance in the game. There is an holy damage absorb potion, though.
---
MC doesnt 'drop', its available from Minute 1
---
You can easily tell that it isn‚Äôt always 400ms as you proposed. Well maybe not you personally.

#&lt;The Honour Guard&gt;[EU-PvP][Horde][Social/Raiding]
---
**About Us:**
---
Coming into Classic with zero experience we aim to recreate the same experimentalist look on the game as was used at the time.
---
Our goal is to create a guild where everyone feels welcome, an environment where even leaders can learn new skills since we hope to tackle raid content we will be looking to learn as a group both leadership skills and individual skills as players.
---
What we want the most out of this is to jump back to 2005 where PvP happened everywhere and at any time and getting to level 60 was as much a show of determination as it is skill at avoiding or surviving PvP encounters out in the world. We hope to form groups often with the sole purpose of hunting players in the world and protecting players also.
---
We wish to create and foster an environment where anyone can learn new things without judgement and mistakes are encouraged! So we hope you are as willing and able to take some good natured banter as well as dish it out.
---
You will be joining with long time friends Aetherr and Kodlaken and we‚Äôll be learning the art of guild leadership, raid leadership, World PvP and Classic in general so know that if you are in the same situation you are in good hands! (or bad, life is a wild journey!)
---
**What we expect of you:**
---
* 18+
---
* Willing and able to help new/inexperienced players
---
* People who would prefer to group and offer profession services in the guild before going to others!
---
* Active recruiters who will show a good face to the community
---
* People looking to advance to roles important to our goals and needs!
---
* Good microphone
---
* Active on Discord
---
* Friendly and mature
---
* Fluent in English
---
* Tough skin
---
* Willingness to learn
---
* Social both in-game and out of game
---
* We hope that you will make it to max level with us asap (around a month would be perfect!)
---
**First Stage:**
---
The First Stage of the guild will be social/leveling where we will be online daily forming groups to run dungeons and complete quests, all quests big and small. We also encourage people to pick up a variety of professions so that we can all have a good chance of getting the equipment we need to learn the raiding scene in relative comfort.
---
**Second Stage:**
---
The Second Stage of the guild will be a mix of raiding (times to be decided) and PvP both World PvP where we will mount up and look for people farming and questing! Or we will be making groups to join Battlegrounds we aim to ensure everyone has attunements, quests, gear all squared away while progressing through the game at our own pace and depending on the success of our modest guild, we hope to form a main raid team and a secondary team for people who have fallen behind (the main team will likely be lead by Aetherr as he  attempts to learn and improve as a raid leader)
---
Me and my friend will be co-leading the guild and we both come from a background of experience and maturity in handling projects of this nature.
---
**Raid Schedule:**
---
Monday and Thursday 9pm-12am GMT
---
The female UD special for 2 handers was sleeper, they do a flip in the air.
---
Right but isn‚Äôt it vanilla like to not be able to cancel it?
---
https://gph.is/g/aNzyWxv
---
I kinda made it? I think, I'm not so good with gifs!
---
I played a furry warrior on a pserver, I loved the playstyle but I hated that all the tier sets were strictly for tanking. I'm going rogue this time around so I can actually collect and use my tier sets even if I have a harder time getting a raid spot.
---
For what I've read doing quick google it's """allowed""" but not supported. And only allowed because it's hard to ban them, but it's not ethical stuff anyway.
---
And this guy planning to multibox 10 accounts.. what do you think he'll do? lol
---
Ez dismount addon?
---
Are you sure? I remember healing in bg's and not getting any honor for kills by my party members on my druid back then. Maybe it was changed in some patch or I'm missremembering.
---
Lol yea you‚Äôre probably right. I wouldn‚Äôt pay as much. 
---
I‚Äôm financially fairly stable so I‚Äôd buy one for like 300$ - 500$. But yea, now that you say that, I should‚Äôve known that.
---
Might of Menethil on my Ret Pally.... :)
---
I played a tauren hunter for the entirety of vanilla wow and spent a large portion of my time pvping and dueling outside org, and I never had someone whacking me around a trap like that.  It has nothing to do with latency, the range on the beta leeway simply isn't correct.  I am starting to not put much weight on what blizzard 'confirms' to be working correctly.
---
No, it really does not matter if you are world first or a pugging player.
---
The mindset remains: People do not like to carry others who are not willing to carry their own weight.
---
As already mentioned there are different hybrids who do actually are an asset like a Crowd Pummeler Spamming feral druid. 
---
But classes like enhancement shamans and retris who are generally below the tank's DPS will always be in for a hard time.
---
Even more so when trying to pug because you cant play the sympathy card meaning some people might like you and bring your useless class for your real life character.
---
Yes, the tryhard attitude on pservers is generally higher, but I knew a couple enhancers I kept in touch with, because I thought about it too at one time and they got into an AQ20 pug every 10th lock out or so, because melee spots are filled first and by pretty well geared players, therefore enhancers practically never got a spot in pugs.
---
Just put yourself in the steps of an attending warrior's shoes: You bring consumes maybe worth 20g, you are specced right, you do everything accordingly, Quickstrike Ring drops and some enhancer you never seen before wins it, even though his spot might as well been empty for how little he contributed to the raid. 
---
Lots of hybrids are dead weight and no matter the tier he's raiding, people will not want to carry them.
---
I'll sell you a r14 geared account right now. PM me for paypal. Friends and Family payment only and will be made immediately, delivery will be scheduled for late december. /s
---
I didn‚Äôt even know WC could be considered a maze, I‚Äôve never had an issue just... walking forward?
---
yep! [As he gets close to the dungeon entrance,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BngS6ojTFf0&amp;t=4m) you can see the mushrooms. He just solves the maze using the classic "Keep a had against the wall" method.

&gt; salty american who thinks it was standard to have over 100 ping becaus he had it.

* Questie (Shows you where to go, who to kill)
---
* Extended Quest Log (Shows your quest text and quest list at the same time)
---
* XPerl Unit Frames + Mob Health
---
* Bongos / Bartender
---
* AutoMate (This addon was written for 1.12 clients; unsure if it will get an update. It would do a lot of tedious tasks for you. Every time you opened a trade window with a repair vendor, it repaired and sold greys. If you were spamming an attack spell, it would dismount you. Pressing "B" would open all your bags.)

* Postal
---
* Atlas + AtlasLoot (Shows dungeon loot)
---
* Some threat meter. Not sure which one will work.
---
* Recount
---
* Decursive (not sure if this addon will work anymore?) - Works like healbot, but instead it's for decursing

* Atlasloot
---
* Decursive

---
Its even less viable because the class requirements in gear is attached to raids being attuned for them. You need the set bonuses.
---
Not horde, this is kinda undead but even then it‚Äôs a bit too edgy
---
I'm reading a lot of the amazon reviews and people are having a tough time with the button plates responding/getting stuck/breaking.
---
Any feedback regarding this issue?
---
$500 is unlikely to even buy you an account with a single fresh level 60.
---
I never tried to optimize damage like this on my paladin back in the day, but my guess is that spell damage will be better when you can get it, but I doubt there will be that meaningful of a difference between the two approaches.  Meaningful as in- killing a mob in 38 seconds is a lot like killing one in 34 when you are grinding mindlessly while watching Netflix or whatever. I'll be curious to see if someone comes here with the math to back something up though.
---
Also note that you will have access to different gear throughout your play time so you will have to be flexible. And your healing gear should have + healing, not + spell damage.  So any spell damage set would be off-spec stuff you pick up along the way, same as the strength gear.
---
First
---
200k BOYS LET'S GO
---
$300-$500 will maybe get you a lvl 60 with pre-raid gear. It depends which phase you're looking to buy in.
---
It‚Äôs also just the worst fun you can have in a raid as a priest.
---
That line at the bottom is too small and has terrible punctuation so I'm just going to take offense to this entire post.
---
I cant continue this. You're a fool and a thief. If you do not understand this you cant be helped.
---
But then you guys will make the memes of this isn‚Äôt classic wow it‚Äôs to hard, I can‚Äôt find 40 people to raid with... this game sucks
---
Rogue in vanilla is the one class that I love playing alone more than anything. The class fantasy is just too good not to enjoy some solo questing and leveling, especially on a pvp server.
---
I would just reiterate the moderation of all the shitposts and reposts is greatly appreciated. 
---
The 4-day discussions will hopefully continue to funnel those conversations about layering, leeway, etc.
---
If I have to look at a butt for that meny hours, you can bet that it's gonna be a female butt!
---
You need to research how the ranking system works because it matters a lot even with xrealm
---
Haven‚Äôt looked into it too much, sorry. Maybe someone else does?
---
Your getting down votes disturbs me that's like using a 12 hour cooldown in a duel.
---
&gt;security wasn‚Äôt my concern because** it shouldn‚Äôt at this point in the development**
---
hope you don't do this for a living.
---
Again another all round well written and thought out piece, you're smashing this!
---
I've never really been in a raiding guild or raided(very briefly during the end of bc/wotlk didn't get very far though and barely remember it) but I do remember one of my guilds from my very first wow account (I've had multiple accounts over the years)	and it was from the account I played classic on in '04
---
Very brief recollection, a set few from a guild I was in headed over to barrens to just basically fuck about in world pvp with some noobs (I was a low level noob rogue myself and the others was a lot higher than me) we dicked about, the players I was with being higher level, killed a lot of lower levels until a group of larger horde just basically came and camped the fuck out of us, there was literally no way we could get out or escape, I was only there because a friend promised he'd help me out if I attended this shit show for some reason haha
---
I think in the end a lot of people just logged out, the guild didn't implode or anything but I got annoyed at my friend because he never did help me out leveling (was a mega noob but was so determined to get into wow, was my first mmo and had literally no experience)
---
I stopped talking to him and eventually just left the guild and stopped playing until years later where I created a new account
---
Nothing crazy but that world pvp experience has always stuck with me, if I ever world pvp I know to get a move on before a group of mains form haha
---
Alright, so you aren't interested in PvP at all or any of the things where batching and leeway will be relevant, and therefore don't mind if it's possibly completely broken.
---
Right. I seem to remember gear that had both +healing and +spell damage, but can't recall if that was in Vanilla or later expansions.
---
Remember when I got this on my hunter, it was amazing.  I had it before the normalization nerf.
---
Appreciate the informative response!
---
&gt; That line at the bottom is too small
---
#Please understand there is significant sarcasm implied in this post.
---
how do you get lazy pig to not auto go into vendor at an inn, i can't set my hearth!
---
My experience as a Guild Master prepared me for the professional world more than my college degree.
---
What‚Äôs that white bar under his Player Character?
---
What is this Area 51 thing?
---
To be fair when two people rotate to tower dive and gank you and all three die and you live, the question mark is perfect.
---
Paladins where cake walk as a MIGHTY shaman like fuck your bubble hearth shit bitch.
---
Why not? Many suboptimal specs can still do enough dmg to clear naxx
---
It just requires good players and some more time.
---
It's getting annoying to see pserver players keep pretending vanilla is as hard as retail
---
Guess what, there are going to be guilds that clear naxx with memespecs
---
ISBoxer was quite literally keeping ‚Äú\‚Äù from registering in any windows, so don‚Äôt tell me ISBoxer wasn‚Äôt what was causing the issue.  It was either a bug (which has since been pointed out how that would arise), or it was reserved for who knows what, which seemed the likely case given the amount of stuff ISBoxer tries to configure for you.   I‚Äôve had that key bound to accept quest/party/etc for 12 years, so no, I wasn‚Äôt about to just bind it to something else when I had alternatives.  
---
Why didn‚Äôt I ask for support?  This.  Right here.  Make a post on dualboxing.com?  Mirai jumps on you for not posting in the right section or not searching for the answer yourself or how dare I suggest a key was hijacked because ISBoxer has worked flawlessly for you for years.  
---
Even normal support I‚Äôd expect I‚Äôd go over all the same things I just spent 4 hours doing.  Check your hardware, check your keybinds in WoW, check your keybinds to make sure you didn‚Äôt accidentally bind it in ISboxer.  Quite simply, I had spent enough time trying to fix it myself, I had an alternative, so I went with that.  Maybe it‚Äôs been fixed since I tried it last month.  If it has, great.  I‚Äôll come edit my initial reply and sing the praises of ISboxer.
---
I mean I‚Äôm not sure my retail experience or any of my experience 15 years ago should answer this question. In retail the dungeon pops up in dungeon finder and you can tank it immediately.
---
The game is 15 years old and not everyone has been playing pservers which is why I asked the question.
---
Yep. The G600 is still available on Amazon.
---
i'll be doing the same.
---
Speed is not latency, they are not very related.  Speed/bandwidth is pretty cheap and easy to increase since it's mostly a function of "pipe size" and encoding, while latency is mostly a function of path length and super hard and expensive to reduce.
---
Plenty of people are still for it, just in a way that creates similar conditions to vanilla WoW.  The current implementation does not.
---
Not gonna lie... a part of me envies you for having the money to spare for doing that...another part is sort of sad...because if you are dedicated enough to play 10 characters at the same time, that probably means you dont have much else going on. I hope you find what you are looking for and enjoy the experience.
---
You jump in the lava right after fire boss that starts with I and you skip most of dungeon and end up at the lyceum area.
---
Great story, but I doubt it is true. Some aspects of it may be true, but this is def a made up story. 
---
I highly doubt a GM of a top PvE guild who consistently went to BRM didn‚Äôt go stealth prior to entering. There was always people at the entrance back in the day and you would be an idiot to just run past the entrance unstealthed as a rogue. 
---
Also, I highly doubt this guy was getting consistently camped on his way inside. A rogue should have ZERO issue sneaking around and getting into BRM. He must have been a complete idiot if he couldn‚Äôt rez stealth and sprint away. 
---
I could believe this story if it was a shit tier rouge but the guy was a GM of a PvE guild that must have dealt with shit like this all the time. 
---
I know I‚Äôm going to get downvoted, but this just isn‚Äôt realistic.
---
A wrath server? Disc should be trash against a rogue.
---
Who know's the order? Nobody...Nobody knows the order.
---
Tl;dr  
---
Level how ever you want - know that when you hit end game your spec is going to probably change based off what your guild / team needs for your classes role not necessarily what role YOU want because its a team effort at that point. 
---
Example: I wanted to go Spriest and my guild leader just PSA'd that during PvE progression content its likely id have to switch to heals for the good of the team as they might not need me as an Spriest. At that point I decieded to make my spriest my solo/alt guy so I can do a hybrid spec of what ever the fuck I want (he wont be raiding) and ill have my mage be my main.   
---
Food for thought. Not all your characters need to raid =P
---
IIRC it was a 1% drop in vanilla, was it raised in a later patch?
---
Is there a way to actively check where you rank?
---
Hardly a maze still.  There were no twisty side corridors or other ways to traverse forward.  You could maybe get turned around in a pool room but hardly a maze.
---
I played Vanilla only, I don't know what private servers are like, but I mained a mage and never got to consistently raid as a DPS every guild I was in was full on DPS for raids. I occasionally would get to run a public raid that always disbanded after a few bosses in MC. DPS is EVERYWHERE and easy to get. The only time I got to see end game content BWL, AQ40 was when my friend would ask me to heal on his pally. I will be maining a healer this time around for just that reason.
---
I'm stubborn. I stick to brands I've never had to RMA. I'm sure Logitech is great but I crossed it off.
---
Amen to my druid brother from another mother.
---
Very good info, it does look like instance farming with a good group a low level is viable as substitute to questing
---
Oh yeah, they do the spin with 2 handers and a cool flip with 1 handers. I was just putting my input in but i guess the discussion is too inclusive for that.
---
I keep screenshoting memes from this page but have no one to show them to.
---
It‚Äôs balanced the way it is, shortening the time to achieve anything is very pointless, why make yet 1 month instead of 3? It makes the game shorter and not as intriguing.
---
Feelings are irrelevant.
---
It's unlikely there will be any horde healers what so ever.
---
2 kinds of people. Those who use DM and those who are wrong.
---
Didn't look into it much but from what i know there is a facebook group that had 250k followers (i think it's up to 800k now) that are going to go to area 51 and walk in to free the aliens.
---
You'll obviously level 2 faster.  Things only get tricky when PvP starts, or running instances.
---
I will corpse camp you in Hillsbrad.
---
I played a ret paladin in Vanilla,  never again..
---
I still have 3 unopened G502 (original pre-RGB version) in my closet, on my 2nd now after the cat destroyed the cable on #1.
---
Keyboards I'm not so worried about since I typically build my own anyways... although I do wish I had a few Razer Lycosa laying around since that was my favorite keyboard during my vanilla days.
---
Reducing the weekly reduction may as well lead to a MUCH larger amount of players attempting to reach high ranks, meaning that weekly honor might be pushed to force players to play a lot more per week.
---
It solves a problem that doesn't exist anymore, and since it doesn't seem to actually work the same as vanilla it's even worse.
---
I don't know why some people want the game to feel clunky and buggy. Even vanilla felt pretty smooth and consistent no matter your connection.
---
As far as actual impact, it just makes things easier for melee (as if it's not easy enough with smooth internet)
---
We resto shamans dont need to make pointless posts. We know what we are.
---
wat
---
I have tv in my name because i stream casually and snowjob was taken...
---
Thanks. For a while there I thought I actually was going crazy. I'm not a big supporter of leeway and batching but I'll be fine with it either way. 
---
I do want them to try and get it as blizzlike as possible, but I'm glad we aren't getting half the armour in bear form to start. It would just crush certain classes now that people know more about the game. I was just using it as an example. Using 1.12 talents/skills is the right choice imo.
---
Mained a female orc warrior on retail for years - my favorite character ever I think.  Same exact look and hair.  The best!
---
With policy changes to /r/wow allowing classic content, it's clear that the tenuous pact between the subreddits has all but evaporated. I would like to open the discussion on how best to combat the scoundrels that wish to abscond with our beloved low-effort memes.

---
Yeah but also don‚Äôt play a class or spec that people aren‚Äôt gonna accept unless you‚Äôre willing to try really hard to gear and farm consumables. As. Casual player that took 4 and a half months to level to 60  on an unofficial server and then went full feral my guild wouldn‚Äôt even let me into raids as feral dps. They said I could heal if I wanted. Was very disappointed as I didn‚Äôt want to heal because i healed retail -wrath of the Lich king.
---
I know that extra attacks from combat swords will proc off of SS, so my guess is that anything that deals weapon damage (SS, BS, Ambush, Hemo) will proc poisons/ weapon enchants. Someone correct me if I'm wrong, though.

&lt;5000 clicks is less than a day if you're playing something like a MOBA..  Sounds like it was defective.

The benefit to our wellness and consciousness of a video game is: taking control of a powerful and/or *attractive* avatar results in a large boost of energy, confidence, I call it ego repletion - for very little attention / brain-power cost.

---
People think correcting bugs is as easy as "whoops, I set isHunterPetResponsive to false. Better change it to true and push a build to the users. Should take 5 minutes"
---
Accurate Ping data would only be available to blizzard. They have it, and have acknowledged in a blue post that more people have lower ping today as compared to vanilla times. (Its in the not a bug forum reply talking about leeway and how its behaving how they expect). Like I said, this would contribute to average ping disparity definitely being different.
---
Global latency is different than latency within NA. We had some of the worst internet in 2004-2006 compared to places like south korea and some euro countries.
---
Of course PvP is still in the game, that is why i point out that we do not have access to the C++ code and the scripts that implement leeway these days. It used to be a check on the client (from what reverse engineering has proven) and I think it still might be. But we have absolutely no idea what the logic looks like server side and how it decides to manage targeting and leeway these days. Because of the beefier servers these days I would not be surprised if there is a lot more "magic" going on there to increase performance of the game.
---
Additionally, the PvP feel of the game is so different, its apples and oranges. A leeway implementation (in any form) is going to affect modern WoW gameplay differently than vanilla.
---
This brings us to spellbatching. They definitely changed it in modern WoW because 400ms batching is trash and we all know that.
---
If the eleeway is super long in modern WoW, the classes could have been adjusted to fit that gameplay style as well. Which might be why they decided not to eliminate it? They changed up the classes instead so the minor extra range did not give melee as much of an edge. This might have been easier and a work around for the fact that they still needed leeway due to latency issues. Again, we are not the network programmers in the room so we cant know.
---
Again, this comparison is apples and oranges. You clearly feel pretty strongly about this topic. Post your own reply to the discussion. I think you will clearly see the majority of people agree here. Leeway and spell batching need to be tuned. We can agree to disagree on leeway, I think we both agree on spell batching though.
---
Lol 400ms try 2k
---
Depends on whether quest drops are easily picked up by parties, which depends on whether you are hardware or software boxing and how the live client reacts.  You‚Äôll probably take 50%-ish longer because your kill xp is halved.
---
Isnt shred cost 48 energy that is with talent spec on shred ? You can't double shred without waiting for another tick
---
Lmao why would anyone care.. I only think it's "normal" to choose your own gender if you are gonna RP, but i never tried so not sure
---
Been a mage main my whole life, I'm suuuuper excited to change it up for Classic!
---
This world has really gone bat shit crazy
---
I think it's not a great system overall and they made the right choice in moving away from it in later expansions. I think the Arena rating system was a good baseline to work from and maybe implement a version of that system into Battlegrounds and Wpvp where someone can obtain a high rating through smaller time frames of high skill play rather than the rank system requiring even a highly skilled player to play a huge number of hours to reach. But, I don't pvp much so I haven't really given it much thought beyond that.
---
All that being said, the rank system was obviously a huge part of vanilla and should remain in it's vanilla state for Classic, which, thankfully, appears to be the case.
---
I said it before and will say it again. While i do agree that no changes should be made to the game design or philosophy behind vanilla wow, they should have tuned the numbers on weak classes without changing any spell effect or add/removing spells.
---
So for example like hunter, they should have increased the damage from the last rank of aimed shot (the one acquired from the book in AQ) or increase the dps on their T3 level weapons to around 80-85 as this is how much 2h weapons have, and not the current 57 dps on their strongest weapon. Even 1h weapons from naxx that are used by dual wielding classes do 65-70 dps each.
---
Thats what i mean by tuning the numbers. Like reducing the insane mana cost on ehn shaman stormstrike or shadow priests mind blast and shadow word pain or increase and increase the damage on elemental shaman lightning bolt and balance druids wrath or ret pala seal of command.
---
Very small tuning would make them viable and break the monotony of classes and specs that we will be seeing in classic.
---
I don't mind it either way, but that would make it far more interesting rather than having all raid comps being warriors and rogues in t1 t2 and mages with warriors in t3.
---
Yup, people don't understand the community that was built using server forums and always being around interacting with and seeing the same people over and over.  This is very doable.
---
Bad players
---
Ban multiboxing pls
---
Yes in patch 1.1
---
Its simple if your new roll alliance they are the bestest
---
Not as bad as mage/warr/hunter
---
Tauren shaman - you want to help nature. So zones with elementals, or nature/corruption. Badlands, Desolace, Felwood, Un'Goro
---
UD Warlock - death, demons. Literally all Forsaken zones (so most of northern Eastern Kingdoms), Felwood, some Ashenvale
---
Orc Hunter - tracking, beasts, hunting. Barrens, STV, Ashenvale, Un'Goro, Hillsbrad
---
UD Priest - no idea
---
I've considered it, but I don't think I can go back to a time where Shaman's healing spells have reverted back to green/nature cosmetically identical to Druids. 
---
I've spent years and years wanting Shamans to have a different healing animation theme and the current watery animations are so much better.
---
At least I have chicken
---
It's a bad system that demonstrates account sharing skill, or Charlie Sheen levels of cocaine addiction skill, more than PvP ability.  Give me an arena system any day over the Vanilla ranking.
---
I've said it in Modmail, and I'll repeat it here - the moderation on the sub has been quite solid from my perspective. As a frequent F5'er, I see a lot of the shit that gets posted and how quickly it manages to get removed. 
---
Additionally, I think the 4-day chats are a good way to both consolidate discussions, and drive some unique discussions. I would encourage users to use the modmail feature to suggest topics - I did and am pleased with the responsiveness of the team, and the outcome as well.
---
/u/SoupaSoka do you have any metrics on reports that were issued?
---
Ebay
---
Thank you for that link!
---
Better than me because it's perfect, thx a ton :)
---
If it was a fix then it would have appeared in the 1.10 patch notes, no?
---
Hell yeah brother üòéüá∏üá™
---
Your name perfectly reflects your comments.
---
The beauty of the Honor System is that it doesn't have a set time commitment and is instead determined by the time willingly invested by others on your faction.
---
The only reason you *need* to play 12+ hours a day to reach rank 14 is because others are willing to play that much too and you need to stay ahead of them.
---
That being said, I don't give a fuck about anything beyond keeping Rank 3 for the 10% discount, which I'll have no trouble maintaining as I get all the BG reputations to exalted. If I click really well with a solid premade and am having fun, I *might* push for Rank 11 sometime around Phase 4, but it's very unlikely I'll care enough. If I want to ride a black mount that badly, I'll just swap the skins in the game files.
---
For many classes, the R14 weapons aren't any better than their Phase 3 best-in-slot. No thanks.
---
All you really need to clear ST is the atlasloot map of it, I always pretend to know exactly where to go and just use that map to guide me works wonders, though I still dislike ST
---
Client side, leeway was not added until 1.10.  That video was uploaded to WCM a little less than a month after 1.10 dropped in the US (no idea when it was released in EU), so it's possible that specific interaction was prior to 1.10.  Really no way to know unless you ask the person in the video.
---
Private servers are hosted in Europe aka there is latency aka leeway is needed.
---
Classic beta was hosted state-side, so most of the US playerbase had no lag or latency issues, so leeway felt vomical... especially in combination wth the custom-made spell-batching they engineered which seems to have too wide of a window.
---
I think an increase of 30-50% playtime. Maybe more maybe less.
---
Saves a little time on kill quests and quests that drops items for both characters.
---
Can reduce downtime a little by having a heal for melee classes or water for mana classes.
---
Time is lost when killing mobs because of travel time and respawn. Takes half as long to kill mob but each character gets half xp and they still have to do the same travel time.
---
Also losing time when looting items in the world (I think I read they made items respawn faster so might not be so bad, normally I think it can be 1-5 min respawn for items in the world).
---
&gt;&gt;&gt; Scatter Shot, Wyvern Sting, and **Freezing Trap** share diminishing returns
---
Ruin how? 
---
Back in the day we never knew what the meta would change to in the next balancing patch. We are getting 1.12. We know the meta. We know what works and what is sub par trash. Why encourage people to play specs that will never perform well? 
---
Yes Ret CAN do damage just no where near what an equally geared warrior or rogue can do in that melee slot. 
---
But as a hybrid healer they are  one of the best HPS healers in the game. They are WAY more of an asset to the team as Holy. 
---
PVP Ret is fine as long as you play your whole tool kit. PVE you are literally asking 39 other people to be okay with sub par performance. If none of them care it‚Äôs a non issue. But no top tier progression guilds will be taking Ret on progression fights. 
---
It would be like a mage asking to be arcane fire in MC. Yes you CAN still do damage but you would be doing WAY more as frost in MC. 
---
Yes play what you want but be realistic about your expectations of what you can and can‚Äôt do. A Ret will never out perform an equally geared Warrior or Rogue ever. We know the meta now. Play what you want for sure but know you are asking the rest of your guild to carry you. If they don‚Äôt care then cool. But they are carrying you. 
---
This goes for all hybrids and other meme specs not just Ret paladins. Just seems like Rets are the most vocal about ‚ÄúI will play what I want‚Äù which when I see that I hear ‚ÄúI‚Äôm cool with being carried‚Äù.
---
Classic is a team game. Each class is good at filling some roles but not all of them. You wouldn‚Äôt take a wide receiver and put them on the defensive line.
---
They were on Laughing Skull.
---
Yeah, and still broken in BFA to clarify, which means they have no solution or even cause. Hopefully its a big enough hit to classic that it gets resolved for both.
---
Might be the next thing we need to get real loud and vocal about, though... especially since it impacts warlocks, too.
---
And risk mountain dew mouth? (Don't google that, NSFL)
---
Nah I'm good fam.
---
You only look at abilities at a surface level, so there is no point in this discussion. The priest toolkit was fucking top notch in TBC, just because they had better luggage going in from vanilla doesn‚Äôt change that. 
---
You make it seem like priest was some forgone opportunity in TBC. Clearly, and I mean this, clearly, you didn‚Äôt play at a high level. The class was fucking on point.
---
If it's really so easy for you to tell, then just link a clip or vod where the delay is less than 400ms? And I mean the spell batching window, not how long it takes for the server to display the spell animation and combat text or aura.
---
It was a recreation
---
No sorry I didn't explain it very well.
---
Basically they can hit from a casters range. So if a mage is spinning up a firebolt at casting range (which is too far for melee to hit them normally) a Tauren Warrior would be able to hit them (I think they need to be within a yard less than casting range, so its not technically the full distance of a caster).
---
What it boils down to is that casting classes can't get out melee range.
---
Classic community upraoars lead to priority changes on fixes. This impacts warlocks too, maybe we should be more vocal about it.
---
Its just how much
---
 i hate drake! Im am from wisconsin so especially after the nba ecf!
---
No manufacturer of any product and certainly not complex electronics can guarantee a 0 PPM defect rate. You purchased a defective product, it happens. If it happens more than once, I'd understand you writing off the company, but you clearly didn't look into all the complaints of Steelseries defective products, as there are far more of them for that specific mouse than any Logitech equivalent.
---
Idk man. The game came out in like 2004 or something. Probably gonna be too much for your piece of crap computer to handle. Your computer is sooooo old
---
There are bugs in BfA that have been around since the game launched (random blink DCs for example).
---
For me it was not only time based. It was also a commitment in terms of keeping your place in your PvP group, organising it and keeping up your PvP grinds for multiple weeks similar to raiding over a long period of time. Also, the commitment was compared to other players of your faction.
---
Making the PvP system more skill based (and lets be honest, there is only a limited skill range in classic ;)) would bring classic more to a Battle-for-Azeroth style game, awarding you with rewards without a real commitment (in terms of time, organization and so on). Don't get me wrong, I think skill should always play a part when the system determines your rewards, but a system that uses skill as only measurement is for an MMO not enough imo. Therefore, for me, I much more like the old honor system, because it combines skill and commitment in a way that is good for an MMO. 
---
E.g. the arena system was kind of funny, but tbh everybody tried to gather a party that was known to be the strongest group composition to increase their chances to win instead of commiting their MMO-time to it.
---
They do, and these procs from instant attacks (abilities) have a higher % proc chance on slower weapons, even though the attack is instant on a weapon of any speed.
---
Due to this, slower weapons have a slightly higher procs per minute.
---
 RemindMe! August 26

and thanks lol

I remember in TBC there was a super small patch that was only supposed to change something related to the mailbox system, and for some reason it affected the shoulders for all orcs, making them super tiny lol
---
Implement comment thread layering please
---
It's mentioned there. Freezing trap now has a DR. Blizzard chaged many things and never said a word about it. Are those all also not intended? Like normalizing pet attack speed in tbc. Nothing was ever said about that in the patchnotes.
---
Whats your instagram page tho?
---
Most of the time people will still be caught by the trap. You'd have to pass over the trap perfectly in sync with the server not receiving new information from your client. The faster you go, the more likely that will occur. But with that said, according to other users any turning and moving forward updates more frequently, so if they aren't running perfectly straight it's even less likely that they will not trigger the trap.
---
Will the client allow you to modify files like that?
---
U dont know what you talking about, its highly unlikely but possible.
---
It literally just occurred to me that in addition to Horde red and Alliance blue, they could be considered health and mana potions as well.
---
Holy/prot paladin:
---
Tank/heal any dungeon
---
Heal any raid
---
Heal any BG + flag carrier
---
Naah, it will be changed once blizzard realizes its a mistake.
---
Mutanus? You don‚Äôt need to kill him to complete the dungeon, he doesn‚Äôt drop any fang pieces. But I agree, that‚Äôs the only thing that can possibly throw someone off, but even then you take the waterfall down and walk up the first path to him.
---
Luckyyy
---
Well undead rogues are certainly cool, but the reason we were only talking about orc rogues is that we were already set on picking orc for the racials. The question just is, male or female orc.
---
Link to any other dungeons? My family was always diehard EQ players and I just started DMing for them on a homebrew. I would love to make the live the magic I had when I first encountered these dungeons in vanilla.
---
Are they going to do cross-realm BGs? I think that was added at the very end of vanilla? I feel like whether that is the case or not will make a huge difference in how all that plays out.
---
mage in bc was purely a resource management game, how to hit 0% mana as the boss dies while using consumables and evo at the optimal times
---
Two problems: 
---
1)  "no known issues" is an impossible goal in software development.   Hell, in life in general, too.   Have you never heard the expression, "Don't let perfect be the enemy of good."
---
2) The definition of "very very minor issues" is subjective and varies *wildly* from person to person,  making this not a relevant metric.
---
Actually a really good video, I never knew about the majority of things here.
---
Yo but /u/spearmints said [this](https://i.imgur.com/7NS0Is2.png) wasn't wow enough, so clearly they must be *some retail noob.*
---
I like 4 day chats because they seem to be a deliberate attempt to corral the most trollish hot button debates into one space so the sub front page doesn't get clogged with post about layering.
---
laughing through your nose
---
Can't roll ignites with -6% crit on all your mages ;)
---
For pvp, I'd recommend getting frostbite and burning soul in there. The freeze proc is amazing in PvP. Burning soul is nice because you can cast fire spells without push back even if your ice block is down.
---

when I saw you type just buy the book from the AH for whatever reason i thought you meant the battered hilt and was confusing it with quel serrar's quest chain that starts from foror's compendium

So you're saying you did not read it properly?

I wouldn't have had kids if I couldn't cope with being around them.

This is where the fun RPG part comes into your adventure.   
---
youll get suggestions for sure but - just let your character take you for a ride. Keep an eye out for areas that match your description and dont spend too long in ones that dont. You get to write your OWN story -- thats going to be half the fun!
---
I hand drew the map and wrote the adventure in InDesign
---
It was definitely intended as confirmed by blizzard.
---
Humans should all go to Durnholde Keep in Hillsbrad and Lordamere in Alterac so they can better understand their Nazi roots.
---
The first two and because I like the looks.
---
I hope you‚Äôve come to your senses and realized how dumb it is what you‚Äôre typing.
---
On a pvp server, you will probably lose time. On a pve i might gain a bit, not as much as you think, mobs die faster but u got more clicking to do and your travel need extra careful to not pull unnecessary agro
---
Or a bear lol

Druids are rare because they can only be two races, tauren or night elf.  On top of that, for whatever reason, a *good* druid is relatively hard to find.  So if you are good at the class you will be in high demand.  A resto shaman will be in demand, doesn't really matter how good you are.  Drop totems and spam chain heal.  Druids are a bit more versatile, having access to two instant cast heals, and 2 hots.  Transquility, while on a cooldown, provides massive healing to the group.  Healing Touch also provides the biggest heal in the game.  Shaman are better at group buffing and sustained aoe healing.  While the lack of a resurrection spell hurts druids in 5 man instances, their battle rez is more helpful in raids.  Druids really became insane healers in the burning crusade with tree form and lifebloom, but they can still hold their own in vanilla.  
---
&amp;nbsp;
---
As for PvP, shaman are a bit more suited to it.  If you are a druid in caster form you are a prime target for a rogue to come up and kill you, or you will spend most of your time running flags.  Shaman, being able to wear mail, are tankier.  However as a druid if you get geared enough and can survive initial burst damage you can recover very effectively with instant heals, roots, and bear/travel  form utility.
---
You can't get freezing trap and scattershot? Or freezing trap and wyvern sting?
---
People say getting to Rank 14 isn't hard in terms of *skill.* It's almost entirely a time grind.
---
Maraudon can definitely be farmed, I did it as a hunter to grind gold back in vanilla. But the only I can see getting in the way is the leeway while trying to kite, I‚Äôm not sure if that will have any effect on legit kite farming, or farming in general.
---
So this is my experience at least...... I'll start out by saying I like to speed level and min/max. I find that whenever I fall short of knowledge on how to do my quest route or just get lost on what to do I kind of lose motivation to play that specific character. 1-30 was always pretty simple for me, but 30-50 was terrifyingly awful and I would quit a character and re-roll. However, once I got a good questing path down, 30-50 wasn't nearly as bad. I don't even touch STVietnam until I'm 35 (which the constant ganking can really kill the leveling motivation if you go too early). This might just be my personal experience though :)
---
TL;DR - Preparation on leveling plans can create a smooth and enjoyable leveling experience that doesn't cause burnout.
---
Can someone explain to me a dumb down version of what this means?
---
I'd love to roll with a druid. They're so slippery and have heals and stealth, could be a lot of fun.
---
They reworked the dungeon in Cata and removed most of the maze.   Did the same to ST.
---
Yeah.  If we got to keep the characters somewhere I'd probably play Orc for awhile!
---
My whole post was just a sarcastic joke about two abilities you can't get at the same time sharing DR (scatter shot and wyvern sting since they are a 31 and 31 point talent) 
---
I was just being silly. They only share DR because they are in the same group as freezing trap.
---
Actual start : 
---
big fat cow standing on quest giver, can't get quest. 
---
Abort.
---
&gt; Yes i actually do, Thanks for the kind words ! :)
---
Nice passive / aggressive. You shouldn't. Do you pay attention to what is happening at all in IT?
---
You'll have less things to do. Not a bad thing.
---
Not sure.  I'll probably be at work.  That's when they've done the stress test ones.
---
hahahaa
---
I kind of want the armour, I love the rogue shoulders lol. Sucks about the way the system Is.
---
I'd love to see them!
---
Logitech g600. Best mouse in my opinion, and you won't break the bank buying it.
---
Can you please stop talking about a dead game?
---
If you're going to do herbing that 15 makes the leveling way smoother.  It's no sword specialization, but it isn't totally useless.
---
I personally thought it was very easy to pick up but that‚Äôs just me.  The little groove on the right side of the mouse is perfect to place my ring finger on to grip, plus with the two button attachment there is extra rubber to hold your thumb on.
---
At one point you have to go up and then back down to get to the next floor up.  That's enough.
---
 They reworked WC for Cata, removing most of the maze and introducing the dungeon map.
---
I love the idea of making WoW Dungeons in a D&amp;D context, neat.
---
Do you have a higher-res version of your image? At 612x792 it's hard to even read the text.
---
I agree that bear tanks are 100% viable. There are some bosses that will just require warriors, but every guild should have one feral tank imo.
---
I think we need to be realistic with the general population though. That's 1/40 raid slots where feral is ideal. Don't want to give too many aspiring ferals hope only to leave them with no raid spots.
---
No, you need 5 paladins.  Kings, Might/Wis, Light, Salv, Sanc.
---
All I know is I have spoken to people who were in the beta and they told me it was working.
---
NO!  
---
WATER!
---
Mara can be farmed as a mage.  You will be killing bosses more than aoe groups though.  The dagger is great for aoe farming if you can get it to drop.
---
Good money before dire maul West is rfd.  Small radiant shards will always sell for a bunch, the entire length of the server's life and is generally not flooded on the ah as they are kind of tough to come by unless you are a lvl 60 specifically farming for them.  (Used for minor speed to boots)
---
A hunter spamming wingclip does less damage than even a partially consumable buffed ret.  At least up through BWL.   We tested it in our raid team on ND.  I was the ret, and I consistently crushed the NF hunter.
---
So, in theory, a ret actually hurts the raid's DPS less than a hunter for swinging nightfall because a hunter with a "real" spec does more dmg than a ret and you *must* bring hunters.
---
We didnt' get to test it against a NF swinging warrior spamming hamstring, but I have a feeling that the numbers would be similar b/c hamstring does fuckall for damage, and you can consider that said NF warrior should be doing *even more* extra damage in a "real" spec over NF swinging than a hunter in a "real" spec does over a NF swinging hunter.
---
Obviously the former, since that's literally what OP is asking about. Nobody is talking about the 'of Elements' set in here at all.
---
I think my hunter friend in wow's favorite thing about the class was 100% uptime on flare being the perfect manifestation for his paranoia.
---
I've been playing since Vanilla. I was a raid leader of a guild that cleared all BC content before nerds except the last few sunwell bosses. Also cleared all wrath content including hard modes, I completed the leg healing mace. Dont assume just because I dont want to spoil the new content that I'm bad. How old are you? How long have you been playing?
---
If you don't care about speed then do whatever.
---
Spirit Tap will be your most valuable talent though, whether you are using a wand or not. In terms of bag space and gold it saves, even if you don't care about speed/efficiency
---
The average private server player is probably quite a bit more hardcore than the average non private server player, just saying.
---
Cropping Skills: 100
---
Thumbs up for the Corsair Scimitar!  What sold me is the reliability vs Razer and the ability to adjust the side button positioning to fit my hand size.  I love this mouse.
---
Hello and welcome to world pvp.
---
None of the BG reputation rewards are particularly useful if you do any sort of raiding, but I'm a completionist.
---
May have been said already, but you are not considering the fact that you'll have rested xp for everything you do.  It would be surprising if it took you anywhere near 9 days played to hit 60.
---
For raiding the Wilford Brimley boss. [https://tenor.com/sYQC.gif](https://tenor.com/sYQC.gif)
---
He said he's gonna use sinister strike
---
No.
---
Bear in min mind people are way more educated about the game these days than earlier. A warlock running optimal talents, with equal gear and knowledge will own you
---
I think PvP ranks are kind of hilarious. People only have to grind 90 hours a week because the other guy grinds 89. All so you can bully people with gear at the cost of your health and finances.
---
Great system. Plan on r12.
---
As it should be. #nochanges
---
Honestly the most important skill of a successful rogue is the patience to lead groups/guilds.
---
The question is, should we start questing, grinding mobs, or run an "Exploration Adventure" to level 4?
---
Remember, a bunch of quests become enabled at level 4 and we can start 2nd zones (Mobs level 5-6) easily with all classes.
---
You got it with the ferals. Both bears and cats are competitive, but it requires them farming up 20x pummelers in Gnomer before every raid.
---
Some people love the extra challenge, and are happy to do this farming. If a feral wants to tag along without the associated farming though, I'd have to give someone else their slot.
---
Is farming soul shards before raid bad too? What about pots/flasks? Should I call out the other mages in my guild for making water while we summon people? You may as well do lfr since that'll let you see the content without having to prepare for it right?
---
Pretty shit argument tbh.
---
Number 3 in the list about power leveling using mob tagging, they fixed that during Vanilla at some point because I remember boosting one last 60 before the patch came out. Surely that was before or included in 1.12? Has anyone tested mob tagging in the beta?
---
Rush to feline swiftness then 5/5 into furor then back  into feral.
---
Just farm Barman Shanker for pre-raid stuff
---
Sanctuary is meh and salv/light can be done by the same person. At most you'd need 4 for light coverage on everyone and one on sanct/salv.
---
This is the dungeon layout in vanilla.   Keep in mind that there are no dungeon maps except the mini map in game. 
---
https://s.blogcdn.com/wow.joystiq.com/media/2012/09/wc-map.jpg
---
but sometimes you need that text above too
---
Apply this rule on the Internet: always assume its a guy unless proven otherwise.
---
Getting threat means more rage... OP
---
Always take the left
---
Honestly, what's happening in beta from your description is what I remember from vanilla.
---
Zero outside of hardcore guilds or maybe aq40/naxx
---
Play in PVE server.  Or Play as a Rogue.  Stay in stealth  until the bad guys are gone.  Or just sneak up on them and  take them out.
---
We'll put first 5 points into shadow Mana Regen on kill.
---
Spam any skill you want after that, didn't matter.
---
But shadow is the way to go, if you want to level outside dungeons and do quests, your warrior friends won't be with you all the time.
---
Btw you can heal 5 man's when your shadow, you just don't stay in shadow form.
---
Pretty much noone. There was noone autistic enough to carefully catalogue every minute detail from classic. That's why the private servers had to wing it with some mechanics.
---
General knowledge still holds up though, what the best specs are etc., but new simulations will have to be run with the classic client.
---
Society can change.  It has changed; like I said it wasn't that way back when I played vanilla.
---
Look, I'm not arguing that your strategy isn't the safest from the perspective of minimizing each individual's chances of getting screwed over.  However, it also goes against the original intent of need/greed. It also denies people an opportunity to improve (or ruin) their reputation among other players on their server.  Most importantly, it takes away from the fun and excitement of lucking into an amazing piece of loot by reducing it to a commodity. 
---
The commodification of everything in WoW, from gear to gold to levels to time spend waiting, was what pushed retail into the shitter over the last 10 years.  It doesn't have to be that way.  Our community could do it differently if we had the will.
---
Yes
---
Hunters can go anywhere. beast, giants, humanoids, dragons, undead, demons, and elementals is what you can put tracking points into, but you‚Äôll most likely won‚Äôt be using them for awhile
---
Rogues are great, I just think they are a bit overhyped due to highlight reels. It's like enhance shaman or destro lock, yea *sometimes* they absolutely wreck face and 1 shot everything and are gods, but those are few and far between. A rogue is amazing with all its CD's but the rest of the time it's just a very solid support melee class. Obviously warriors with recklessness and full buffs is not the average experience either, but they are much less of a gap between their peak and their valley.
---
You literally can‚Äôt organize a group vs group duel.  That‚Äôs what the suggestion is for...
---
A prepared non-SL lock would also give them a run for money, but it's really super up to how that fight opens and what demon you have out.
---
I played all throughout Vanilla, TBC and Wrath... I‚Äôve just never had a problem with WC.
---
Any ETA on documentation for making guides? Seems like it would be easy to port something like Joanna's just to have a baseline guide at launch.
---
My solution: **ALWAYS GO LEFT**.  The trick to any maze is to pick a direction (left or right) and default to that choice, and work your way straight, and then the other (right or left).  In WC, Left always works.
---
* At the first fork, when you have to find Lady Anacondria, go left (the same direction the escort will go).  More often than not, this will be the fastest way to get to her.
---
* Once you have defeated her (or cleared to the escort if you want to do that now), jump down and go Left.  More specifically, Left if you were coming from the entrance.  This is the shorter side, which is easier to navigate and has easier pulls.
---
* When you do the right half of the instance, at every fork, go left.  There may be more direct routes, but always left is easier to remember.  You will hit all of the bosses, and you will not backtrack.
---
Why would not use a wand?
---
Hand of Rag was just seen as a burden in our guild. You'll end up with way more eyes than you'll have Sulfuron Ingots to actually craft the hammer with. Our guild got five eyes, and only completed three Hands of Rag. There just weren't enough ingots, and very few were interested in farming all of that arcanite.
---
Plus by the time you're in BWL, Ashkandi is just flat out a better weapon. HoR just doesn't hold up long term, and isn't worth the time investment for most.
---
I wasn't sure, sorry.
---
I started playing in TBC, so for all I knew they were added in the same patch.
---
Holy priest is solid and underappreciated. **But** 5/5 wands is non negotiable. I could see you getting away with fewer than 5/5 in spirit tap (I don‚Äôt see why you would though unless you are leveling casually in a grp).
---
5/10/5 is a super solid spec base. And if you want to be good in dungeons you gain 3/3 inspiration at 32 which is basically like cheating.
---
As holy priest you really want disc anyway. 14 points in disc is super strong (14/*x*/5).
---
That's gonna slow you down, I'm gonna steal all your names
---
I'm in the same boat, people suck IRL.
---
My HS is actually set to Shattrath. So I‚Äôm bubble HS‚Äôing IN baby.
---
This is awesome!  I've been wanting to do the same thing as well, particularly for BRD...would be one hell of a dungeon crawl.
---
Exactly, a warrior replaces it as early as BWL with Ashkandi, but HoR is pally/shaman BIS forever. We preferred giving them to the "meme" specs. For a legendary weapon, it just doesn't hold up long term.
---
&gt; Are there any hints/tips that I should actually guide her on in the class without interfering with a mostly organic experience
---
No.  If she asks questions certainly provide your feedback, but otherwise being overbearing is the number one way I know to make someone disinterested in a game super fast.
---
Combat is a blast for leveling, and she'll feel way stronger. Multiple mobs is a breeze if you've got blade flurry and/or evasion up. You grab that +hit talent, reduce the CDs on evasion/sprint which is nice, and sword spec'll be real handy when it gets there.
---
Yep! There's a PDF up in my Patreon page that has the Adventure and map bundled together. If you search Tiny Dungeons it should be the latest post on there!
---
Nah you don‚Äôt need account sharing to get to 14, you just need to have an established pvp mafia who controls who gets to r14
---
[Me right now](https://gfycat.com/lastopenhectorsdolphin)
---
You‚Äôll find most people will label you a ninja.
---
For the Alliance, yeah. For Horde, 2h fury is very competitive in MC/BWL/early AQ40. DW doesn't pull ahead decisively until near Naxx.
---
Cool.  That's not how it works in any raid I've done on a pserv, and tbh there isn't a difference between pservs and classic that would change that which I can think of.  Might/wis gets done by one person.  EVERYONE gets light and EVERYONE gets salv.  Sanc is the only one we sometimes didn't have, and that was rare.
---
Didn't matter, if you want to do dungeons do dungeons, you don't have to PvP, but the option is there..
---
There is zero good reason to not use wands.
---
That is actually really good idea, thank you! \^\^
---
I think a lot of people have problems visualizing space in 3D. Most dungeons are 2D layouts, or can trivially map to such. Once you start bringing in a relevant 3rd dimension that people have to visualize all bets are off.
---
I feel like in the 29 bracket, too, there were shit-loads of rogues
---
I'm not sure why they'd ever switch back to talent trees. The current "talent stick" was made to eliminate the nuances that came with the former. They wanted to thin the gap between someone who picks whatever they deem most useful to themselves, and cookie-cutter meta builds which talent trees aggressively promoted.
---
I find epic bosses work best when I cheat and give them new actions on the fly. Not like the players are gonna know, and it makes the fights more exciting for them than just kiting someone and dunking them in two turns.
---
Warriors are easy. Any rogue who thinks warrior is hard in 1v1 sucks, warrior is absolutely terrible without healers. You just have to kite use bleeds on them and kite, not facetank.
---
Ha! The legendary Holy Nuker priest spec!  
---
The cool thing with Vanilla was that a specific item drop could sometimes define a spec.  
---
With my priest I got lucky to drop the Draconic Infused Emblem on Drakkisath and got the Heart of Hakkar for the Zandalarian Hero Charm. Used together, this trinkets gave on use, something like +300 spell damage.  
---
I remember it being quite decent for farming and world pvp.  
---
Holy fire, Smite, Smite, Smite and you have a quite good advantage :)  
---
All this +3 pieces ZG set + Holy reach talent (to increase the range of your holy spells), you could start the fight at long range and get a significant advantage on your target.  
---
Also no holy spells resistance in the game as mentioned in this thread.
---
Didn't even wash the bottles
---
The only content creator i would trust currently, not including some pvpers would be skarm
---
Yeah,  the east section of the vanilla version is pretty linear... /s
---
Wait, Bobby B works outside of free folk?
---
What about Tyrion the Imp? Queen Cersei? Lord Snow?
---
Wow sweet dude ! 
---
I'm curently preparing DM adventure for my friends :D
---
If you suck at something get good at it. I‚Äôm 24 and just learned how to throw a football
---
Yeah, mad bad with the tiny image. There's a full PDF available for everyone up in my Patreon Page along with a high res scan of the map. Just search Tiny Dungeons and you can download it!
---
SEVEN HELLS, NED, I WANT TO HIT SOMEONE!
---
Not OP, but...
---
Pservers seem to calculate things differently than classic wow. When I rerolled a warrior in 2005, I thought it was pretty easy to level. More boring than anything. 
---
I rolled a warrior on the fresh LH to get some practice in since I didn't get beta. It was challenging. 
---
I feel like weapon skill doesn't level fast enough on pservers. Even with int buffs. At lvl 48 I am 8 points below max. I am fairly certain I always capped weapon skill before leveling up back in 2005. Especially once I hit 40.
---
Mobs hit harder in general. Back in 2005, I timed quests so that I had retaliation up if I had to kill an elite. I could solo just about any equal level elite without worry. Simply not the case on pservers. Regular caster mobs hit hard as hell too. They use spells on cool down as well. They were more sporatic on vanilla iirc.
---
Miss/Parry/dodge seems way too high. My guess is that blizzard uses pseudo random while pservers use a normal rng calculation. I think with blizzard if you get a miss, the chances of getting a consecutive miss goes down significantly. On Pserver, there were numerous times where I got 4+ misses in a row. I just never remember that happening back in the day.
---
Respawn rates are ridiculous on pservers. They also aggro upon respawn faster. In vanilla, if a mob spawned on top of me while in combat, I had enough time to drag the mob away before getting aggro. Less successful on pservers.
---
Maybe I've become a worse gamer since 2005 or don't remember things as accurately.. but pservers def seem more challenging. One thing that helped me back in 2005 was that I had my mage to fund my warrior. Plus all my friends to run me though instances. I always had best possible gear. This still doesn't resolve most of the issues listed, though.
---
You've got a point. Cat/Bear druids basically only succeed because of Manual Crowd Pummelers. If you have a feral that is willing to do the farming, then they've earned a raid slot.
---
Prot pally, ret pally, spriest, are all wasted raid slots. They don't have any "broken" items to make them competitive.
---
Started playing towards the end of vanilla. Started raiding semi seriously in early wrath, stopped using boss mods by the end of wrath and kept trimming down on the fluff add-ons used by bad players to compensate. Initially played as a tank, cleared ICC25HC in decent timing in a semi casual guild. Swapped to mage in cataclysm, was second best mage on my server right behind a very famous mage known for his in depth theory crafting and knowledge of the class by the second patch.
---
Peaked more or less in WoD parsing 99th percentile on every fight over hundreds of logged encounters as well as holding a rank 1 dps on one specific fight for months as well as multiple top 200 rankings.
---
People who rely on addons are bad. People who can't handle 3-4 button rotations are bad. The only way to differentiate a good dps from a bad dps in vanilla is on mechanics heavy fights. On patchwerk, gear wins every time because of how easy it is to run dps rotations. That's a bad thing, not a good thing.
---
I don't see how my "credentials" matter, though. Anyone with two brain cells will agree with what I'm saying because it's obvious.
---
Somehow both previous replies to this post missed the fact that he‚Äôs asking about aoe leveling as a mage. 
---
In theory, Mara can be farmed 46-52 but you need to do a full quest run to acquire the sceptre and from what I hear you want to bring a lesser invisibility potion to skip the first boss. I‚Äôve heard some say that it‚Äôs impossible to solo this boss at a low level and I‚Äôve heard others say that it‚Äôs possible but takes a really long time. Then there are several packs that can be AOE‚Äôd down. 
---
It‚Äôs possible that leeway makes some of these pulls more difficult &amp; personally I would wait until I get confirmation from anyone who tries it on launch before attempting it. &amp; if you managed to get so far ahead that there‚Äôs no one you can ask then non-instanced aoe farming will be better at that level range.
---
Try spamming arcane blast without going oom.
---
Well for one it makes the leveling experience more enjoyable which blizzard has been trying ro do for a while
---
I'm right there with you. The Monster Manual is a good starting point, but creating a more dynamic fight is usually more fun.
---
No,  it was the original eastern section.   https://s.blogcdn.com/wow.joystiq.com/media/2012/09/wc-map.jpg
---
I played in Vanilla through Cata, I have no memory of any maze.
---
Really man, the best way is to learn to make them yourself. If you just copy a macro online, you won't be able to fix it if it doesn't do what you want, or customize it if you want it to work differently. The modern macro language is super simple. I recommend [Wowpedia's macro guide](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Making_a_macro), and I use their [conditionals](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_conditionals) and [commands](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Macro_commands) lists all the time. 
---
In your case. you can do an awful lot for totems with cast sequences and modifiers. So, a really simple example:
---
    /castsequence reset=combat Stoneskin Totem, Searing Totem, Mana Spring Totem, Grace of Air Totem
---
This is one button that you can repeatedly press to cast the totems in order. It will reset to the top of the order when you leave combat (reset=combat). You can add multiple cast sequences to the same button, differentiated based on conditions like whether you're in combat or not, or are holding a modifier key. 
---
Here's a practical example for totem twisting during a raid.
---
    #show
---
    /castsequence [group:raid,noPvP] reset=7 Windfury Totem, Grace of Air Totem
---
You can include this as part of other totem sequence buttons, because it only triggers if you're in a raid and not flagged for PvP. It will drop a Windfury Totem, then a Grace of Air Totem, and reset after 7 seconds. When it resets, the icon will change back to Windfury Totem, and you'll know you need to press it to keep the buff up.
---
Disagree:  Don Julio's gets used by a huge number of mdps for a very long time.   Lei of the Lifegiver is absolute BIS for hpals until Naxx I believe...I can't remember if AQ40 gives something better or not.
---
That's awesome! What are you planning to run?
---
Of course. But WPvP is still dependent on who gets the jump.
---
Maradon turtles and snakes around lv 47 you can do it.
---
I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs worse! Haha
---
That sounds nice, how do you enforce it?
---
OTOH, they'd compete with the tank and other melee dps for weapons.  Still, as a caster, I wouldn't mind more melee guys in my group, but I think the tank would not be happy.
---
Not to mention it shrinks your testicles.
---
 O O G A
---
Next one's going to be a quick and easy gear acquisition guide while leveling actually. I'll make the farming one's later as a lot of my old spots are "patched out" in the beta.
---
Oh absolutely, there is a much higher time investment involved. I think the gold grind will be faster using a Hunter or Mage, but now we're talking about leveling another character to 40+
---
For me, I think that will be possible, even preferable, to having my Shaman locked into raid spec
---
Without looking up exact items, I can tell you in general what you will run into difficulty is farming low-percentage drops.  Quests are easy, because you can pretty much do them at the minimum level requirement as long as you have a 60 friend run you through the content.  It's starting the farming for drops early enough and getting them before you hit your level limit that's the problem.
---
BWL is very early game. Late game theres absolutely 0 contest. Also, you have to bring hunters, so their slot is already filled. If you fill a ret slot with a warrior, mage, rogue, lock you gain quite a bit more DPS
---
No offense but just Git gud, pvp is fun even if you are bad at it, and you can learn it fairly quickly just give it a try? 
---
Imo just roll a pvp server and take it slow, have fun with it and learn it over time.
---
I always do right side first, because people quit after you kill 2 gem bosses.
---
So I rather complete the hard area first.
---
Then do the easy sides 2nd run.
---
I had always someone quit....
---
AFloppyZipper is just a typical retail elitist who unironically thinks the game is harder there. Common mistake, but the truth is that vanilla is harder except for raid bosses.
---
Typical retail mentality to think raids are the entire game, since BfA has no other content whatsoever. But raids are a minor aspect of real WoW, and if we compare full game to full game - no one can deny that BfA is the casual and easy one.
---
leveled as holy back in vanilla.
---
Get the wand spec, keep inner fire up, sw:pain on the mob and weaver your wand hits and staff autoattacks. Easy life.
---
You need wand spec.
---
That may sound fun right now but in experience you will want to kill yourself before level 10 from being oom in general questing.
---
Strict holy wasn't even needed on pserver despite the combat being over tuned. All the more reason you can free up points to wand and shadow spec in classic since it will be less punishing. Holy certainly makes you a much better healer in dungeons, it depends on how much leveling you will do in dungeons. 
---
In wrath and on recently past pserver I leveled as holy because I love healing and I did a lot of 5 mans. But come classic I will finally break down and do the proper priest leveling spec, mostly because I want to level quickly. I'll probably respec to holy in low 50s to be a better healer in endgame dungeons.
---
Not entirely sure you know what edgy means
---
Title. When Classic opens up, I'm gonna rush it to the bank roof! I miss that damn thing so much.
---
He is basically saying Warriors and Rogues are better on P-Servers and that's why they got it wrong.  Druids will be better in vanilla than p-servers but not by a lot.  Either way, it comes soon enough... Well not soon enough imo.
---
I agree.  Shorten both spell batching and leeway.  Potentially also make the distance measurement from player's location rather than the edge of their hit box.  It was necessary back then because of the latency but it has improved so much over the last 14 years that it seems broken now.
---
Definitely a 2/5 difficulty not 3
---
On private servers (and most of vanilla wow outside of this 1 patch) freezing trap and scatter shot did not share a DR. So you got the full length of the CC for both. Now, if I scatter shot you into a freezing trap the freezing trap length will be halved. It makes resetting as a hunter much harder
---
Yeah after Cata the only enjoyment I got from the game was farming old sets and getting The Insane title, which is just a lot of farming rep
---
Yeah, I would do the same.
---
I've played since BC. Can't teach an old dog new tricks (?)
---
It's funny you think so, must one buy meaningless things to show their wealth ? how fucking shallow.

So Bobby B, Tyrion Lannister the Imp isn‚Äôt allowed out of r/freefolk? Why? Did you also prevent Queen Cersei Lannister from escaping?!

CAREFUL, NED! CAREFUL NOW!

I thought it was just assumed everyone knew the shortest path. I can see alliance players not knowing it, but no excuse for horde players.

But hey til there are also apparently mushrooms.
---
Is this as big of a nerf as people are making it out to be? Is it worth re-rolling if you plan on playing high level pvp?

Wtf

Edit: disregard I suck... what will I miss by not pvp'n? Better gear, xp, etc?

I used to do this in the barrens! I thought I was the only one.

If you have a 60 friend low drop rates arent a problem either.

If they banned everything people hate (memes, questions, classic+, etc) this sub would have as much content as /r/wowclassic
---
Meant to link it to someone else who didn't remember a maze and claimed it was linear.
---
Sure you can
---
I mean, scatter and freezing didn't share a DR in any patch except 1.12.
---
You need to work on your math if you think it‚Äôs anywhere close to 90%. More like 5-10% at most. But that doesn‚Äôt work for you narrative I guess. So use an ass pull number instead.

This is what I have been telling people too. I said since the date is planned and so public there will probably riot control and if that fails or the people make it to far, it will be kill on sight.

But the spicy gouge backstab
---
I've always been about PvP everything, and PvE was something I was usually pulled into by my PvP buddies who also did PvE. Since WoD though I've started to enjoy PvE more, and I expect I'll be participating in more of it when Classic is out. Of the old content though I do remember enjoying my UBRS runs and attempts at 45min Strath.
---
If you prefer not torturing yourself, just level with Shadow. Fast, effective and you can still heal your friends in dungeons.
---
&gt; Edit. I was under the impression that wow classic players are adults.
---
Im 37, i own a company and i love memes, whats wrong with people enjoying things that light up their days like jokes?
---
which...
---
&gt; I'm not here to argue about
---
Other arguments can be more solid and rely on evidence, the "right or better on its own merit" is really just a preference argument. It's why I stay out of it and will just go with whatever the devs decide. I'd only like to point out things that differ from vanilla only. The devs seem like they are mostly on the #nochanges side of things(good or bad), although they have already made a couple minor changes.
---
Took me a while, like what fits best on mobile?  This and that...

It may sound strange, but it's annoying to constantly be pressing a non functional mouse button with your ring finger so I try to train myself to not put any pressure on my ring finger. The fact that I even have to be careful about that is also annoying.

But yes, i believe it is just a clicking sound and sensation without any binding on it.

ITT: people pretending nobody ever took a wrong turn in WC.
---
Ya, you could learn the right path pretty easily but if you were with a group where noone had been there you'd most like end up on an unoptimal path. Sometimes you could loop around and end up back at an intersection you were at previously. The correct path even involved a jump (yes you had to jump or use some sort of movement speed boost) to make it across a gap that some people wanted to turn around at thinking it was a dead end. If you are saying you went in and knew which way was the right way to go with no foreknowledge or outside reference you're lying, and I don't really understand it. It's okay that it took you one dungeon run to learn what the right path is. You don't have to lie about being perfect.
---
I think one of my favorite things about priests is the fact that they wand the living hell out of everything.
---
Remember, respect the priest wands.

---
Ironfoe was never farmable back then. Some people did try to farm it, most of them for no success. Until some people run to Emperor for their 300th time , BWL and ZG will be there with interesting and (debatable) better and easier to obtain alternatives.
---
You think every single melee will have Accuria? You think all 20 melee get the nef head ring when it opens? Takes 20x weeks for that man, you are deluded.

Lokamir+Lei is bis for priest in BWL patch too, and Lei is bis for druid and pala healers.

People were *really* bad back then too. A good chunk of the top 1% of players in vanilla might make the middle of the pack today, when you factor in hardware/internet improvements and the availability of information for optimizing your class.
---
If you would ban all the low effort nonsense people joining would get a wrong picture of the community.

Nice caps

You realize most of this people aren't actually going to do it.
---
Not gonna be faster than someone solo leveling - your question can't be answered without knowing how layering is going to be at launch and different classes will have different time. 
---
For example a dualbox warrior and priest will go quicker than one of those on their own.
---
2 characters on the same account would take 300 hours, leveling 2 characters with dual box won't take 300 hours. 
---
Dualbox will only be a little slower than solo.

It's actually entertaining to me you asked for proof.  I tried explaining that the P-Servers aren't accurate, but the try hard elitists were just to full of themselves to believe it.  Recently some proof surfaced that coincides with my old man experience.    I am still working on the other defensive math to provide in a way that cannot be disputed, but it's a WIP.  In the mean time, here is a blue post highlighting one of the differences, particularly for melee crit.

Yes. I do. But I do believe they will take precautions. The government that is. My scenario was basically a worst case.

The burning crusade is 100% my favorite expansion but the last two times I leveled on a pserver they ended up busting. RIP Nightbane

This actually still happens in that one WotLK dungeon that leads up to the Eye raid. That one arcane mage bosses has a phases where she just throws everyone around the room.

Cool! BRD spam? Quests ?
---
Soul Harvester. 
---
My one long term goal for my Pally alt is Ashkandi though, but that's no time frame. Hopefully full t2 also but I'm focusing a lot more on my Warlock main for teir sets.
---
Mobs have much less armor in the Classic. And the hit rating system works differently than on Private servers, I miss far less in the beta than I did in Pservers.
---
This wasn't fixed until wrath of the lich king when athenes group used it to become world 1st level 80 and got suspended for it.
---
When it comes to bis items that you can buy, there's like 1 in 10000000 chance of even seeing it drop before it's outdated. Seeing a bis item drop is rare, let alone your specific one is even more rare. As a Druid who needs an early wardens staff, it's fair game for everyone to roll on it, it's just the same amount of gold no matter how, and if we can split it 5 ways (by everyone rolling need on it) then that's fair.
---
Do yourself a favor and watch some of Skarm's videos about bear tanks in 1.12.
---
I really hope we eventually grow Classic into BC but they just let us clone characters and keep them separate instead of true progression. It would split the population, but then stabilize and let there be a handful of vanilla and a handful of BC.
---
Depending on the monitors, you could get this monitor setup for 1500 bucks. Not exactly ground breaking amounts of money. My single monitor was almost 800.
---
In vanilla. Quest items only drop for one character, regardless of party.
---
Yeah, so about that...  [Here are my talents so far.](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#oZZMhMIMzh)  Really, from tier 4 talent points, I want ALL of them.  But, I'm putting them in mostly evenly.  My next point will be for Frost Channeling.

The way I've got it set up seems to be the standard.  Do you agree?

I manage to find one of my oldest friend playing wow back in the day 12 years ago, got him added on [battle.net](https://battle.net). Wish I could find my other oldest friends :(

I'm not saying that pserver ARE accurate, but if you are going to point out inaccuracies you better be sure they are actually there.

but this is indeed intersting, but at most it's 3-5 % crit, could be significant.

Yup and use the bottles afterwards during bio break. Win win

That's what they told me about drugs in school.

I stopped playing mid TBC, has there been any testing on mob tagging in the beta?
---
Lok and Lei has more than 30 healing over benediction, do you even play the game?
---
Can you link a video of this?
---
Mage Portal Roulette . 
---
At the end of a dungeon or raid, typically if there is a Mage in the party, they open a portal to Org or IF/SW.
---
Make sure you start casting the portal spells when people are looking at the boss loot, so when they are done drooling over their new weapon there are 4 city portals going. 
---
Also make sure you don‚Äôt change your characters position so all portals appear in same spot. When you mouse over them, the City names are scrolling super fast and players end up all over Azeroth.
---
Fun stuff right there.
---
Can someone explain to me how mob tagging works? As i recall, a mob turns grey when tagged so why would people keep fighting a tagged mob?
---
I'm sure it has been tested, but I have no idea if it works.
---
These kind of things is why I personally didn't want a #NoChanges Classic, but instead a #BestVersion Classic.
---
Take Vanilla as the starting place, and make it as good as you can.  High-level design philosophy should stay the same (Horde Shammy vs Alliance Pally, spec and class design, no LFG/flying, etc.) but make it the best vanilla experience possible for 2019.  No need to recreate things that replicate workarounds from 2004 (spell batching, leeway, etc.).  Small QoL changes (auction prices showing per-item on mouseover, for example) that exist in retail are fine or even preferable in Classic, IMO.  Give us the updated models and graphics (though I'm totally fine with the toggle that they ended up with - almost never a downside in letting the player choose).
---
All that said, I get why that's not viable.  One persons' acceptable small QoL change is game breaking to another person.  That plus the "slippery slope" concept is enough to have settled the design philosophy where they did.  I just can't help shake the feeling that there's a small aspect of "You think you do but you don't" rebellion in the recreation of things like spell batching where they (or at least some designers) want to go so hard-core #NoChanges that they are reintroducing things that will be an irritant to the player base.
---
I don't remember it being any different back in vanilla days. Anecdotal anyway... I also agree with you on the original intent of the need/greed system. But people are people... 
---
And in any case, I'm not arguing against giving a BoE drop to the person who needs it. All I'm saying - it should be the decision of the one, who wins it. In a group of 5, at least a couple would always be against giving out BoE drops without a roll (they may be not vocal about it and only begrudgingly agree). This doesn't lead to a positive atmosphere. But rolling for it, offering to buy it from the winner, gifting - all the things I'm proposing promote fairness, communication, cooperation. And everybody's happy.
---
I've never been a apart of a team that's successfully killed the murlock...
---
You‚Äôre in for a shock when Classic launches. Melee dps will be a lot stronger in Classic than they were on Private servers.
---
Hmm, I like this idea. I might try that. The right sized piece of something plus a dab of super glue should do the trick.
---
Pretty much this dudes answer ^
---
Nah, it‚Äôs fucking horrible, I had 1 week left until r14 in vanilla, and then the pvp mafia formed, and they reset the progress of almost every pvper.
---
No, just about everything in Vanilla can be done with 25 people or fewer, it's only towards Phase 5 and 6 where bringing 40 to every raid is desired.
---
Bringing 15 extra people is certainly a different challenge, but it's still a lesser challenge than what BFA has to offer. And there's absolutely nothing in Classic that offers anything close to Mythic Dungeons.
---
Holy shit your a mod? Ive watched your vids since your first warlock series on Nost. Glad to see this sub is in good hands.
---
Isn't that what flairs are for? You can ignore humor
---
You're kidding right? I'm not even arguing about whether the guy is wealthy or not, if he is good for him.
---
I'm talking about getting unnecessary things for the sake of showing off , it's not practical and you know it, if you were a streamer you'd need 1 extra screen at most , anything more than that is just silly and clearly only made for aesthetics.
---
Just for the record since you said :
---
&gt; OP goal is to show off his cool setup, not his wealth. 
---
That's also not true, if his intention was to show-off his rig on reddit then he is seeking attention for what he has and a man's wealth can be measured by what he owns, so basically his "cool setup" = part of his wealth.
---
Yeah this whole thread has me scratching my head. I always went right first, and never had a group get lost.
---
At the time I was playing WC I was probably fucking terrible at the game too.
---
Yea, I do this too and haven't had anyone get annoyed. Works really well and ensures that the group is class/level appropriate for the dungeon.
---
You're right. I suppose what I meant was, that's what flairs *should* be for, so you can uncheck the humor box on the sidebar and see only the type of posts you're interested in.
---
I'm definitely far from tryhard and min/max. I'm the epitome of "filthy casual". So I'd like to see them try.
---
I think it's the bee's knees that some guilds are more casual-friendly and let some sub-par specs take up raid slots, it's just not all guilds and it's not going to be more than a few DPS slots and probably only if they can't recruit better DPS.
---
Otherwise, probably I'd guess maybe 20% faster total. Still need the quest items, and the running, kill speed is faster but still.
---
They will move them in advance. Duh
---
You can PVE with a combat PVP spec. Better for group pvp and BGs, where pressure dmg helps more than burst.
---
I think that's fair. There's a big difference between raiding and 5-mans, farming, etc. And guilds with raids on farm are another ballgame, too. But even then, those slots will probably go to guild members/established team players who healed through progression. It's less likely that they will recruit a random ret paladin over one of their healadins who wants to try DPSing.
---
Real raiders have no time for that

I mean the joke is based on when the top rank of mage water only conjured 2 water at a time.  So a mage would literally go through like 3 mana bars worth of water sending it out to the raid.  We are doing 1.12 which at least has the 10 water per cast stack.

---
Proceeds to wipe on Lucifron because you have 8 Druids spamming Wrath instead of decurse
---
Selfcast spells didn't have to wait for the 0.4 sec delay in vanilla either. The client just assumed that everything was alright and started casting them instantly.
---
The problem is that back in the day less than 1% of players cleared Naxx. Pretty sure like less than 5% even entered it. 
---
Yes, players these days are better and more informed but you're not going to see 20% of people clearing it. And even if you did that's still 1/5 of the population.

Benediction:

---
* + 8 Spirit
---
* + 192 Healing
---
* + 3 Mp5
---
Do you even theorycraft? The 13 Int, 4 Spirit, and 2% crit outclasses the 31 Healing and 3 Mp5. Not by much and not in all scenarios, but by enough to not want to take the mace from other inferior healing classes that don't have access to the same items.
---
Pandaria? Why would that affect classic drop rates then?
---
There is another stress test coming up July 25 - 26 (I think? can't check my sources because work computer)
---
&gt;it's just not all guilds and it's not going to be more than a few DPS slots and probably only if they can't recruit better DPS.
---
That's what I'm saying, yes.
---
Very few guilds will accept hybrid DPS, and if they do, it's because they're super casual and don't care, or they're struggling to get 40 people, or whatever else.
---
I came here to say that! +1
---
Good one. Never gets old.
---
"If the subreddit supports filters, you can choose them from the side bar then"
---
Guess it's not possible on that sub?
---
I raided hard in vanilla, know exactly where they stood then.  But it's the private servers that are inflating the DPS.  The item I linked before is another example of that.  There are also additional Parry and Block stats on retail classic over P-Servers.    Both of which damage classic DPS versus private.  Why on Earth would private servers have lower DPS short of broken mechanics?  Then of mechanics are broken how can those servers even be used as an example?
---
To make her feel ok with her race/class choice, or guilt her into picking dwarf?
---
My original response was about how unnecessary it is to have such a rig for playing games that don't even use a quarter of the power the machine has, even if wants to multi-box it can be done on a single screen, unless his goal was have a screen for each character which isn't necessary.
---
So as you can see , it was built for aesthetics which is fine until he posted it on reddit to showoff.
---
I abhor showing off in any form, it's not due to jealousy or anything of the sort, i just believe a person's worth should not be valued by what they own or how successful they are, but by their character. Flaunting possessions in other people's faces in order to elevate said worth's value using wealth as a medium only reduces one's worth in my eyes.
---
You can be a dick about it and argue all you want but you cannot dispute the fact that he posted a picture of his physical possession on reddit for the attention and nothing else, whether he is aware of it or not is entirely irrelevant to the conversation.

Most of my group got rank14, then took a few weeks break because of the grind, leaving me to go for it by myself, you can‚Äôt compete with pvp mafia solo. Social pressure has nothing to do with anything
---
I'm not trying to be snarky, forgive me - but how do we know that? what's your source
---
Guess you didn't read my comment.
---
It's a shame feral druids are so hard to optimize but if you really are up to the challenge check shedothedruid on youtube.
---
I was thinking of rolling Troll priest but I'm rolling shammy instead.
---
We had those guides back in 2005/2006, so your argument is invalid:

---
Just because you did not know about them, doesnt mean they didnt exist \^\^ The internet wasnt the same platform back then, making your own homepage and paying for a website to hold guide information was costly, so most speedrunners kept the guides to their own.
---
A neat story I have been telling thousands of times was the following:
---
I had a friend that went to a new zone..lets say loch modan, accepted all quests he could find in that zone, post all those quests to me in a whisper, and I would reply with the same quests just in the order he had to do them to be min/maxing, even putting in stuff like "after quest 2 theres a bottle on the ground that starts quest xy that you should do after quest 12".
---
I wanna play in org but I can‚Äôt stand any vanilla horde races
---
Fury warriors are gonna have way less threat generation than on pservers
---
Having cross real does not make premades diminished. You still need to bring the most honor which is done by winning fast games. If you think someone is doing this without a premade, you are wrong.
---
Warlocks were basically free honor kills throughout all of TBC.
---
I have that exact foot pedal setup because I only have use of my right hand and it works great now that I have it configured properly. I use the right one for shift middle is control and left alt.
---
I've reconnected with 1 of my vanilla friends recently. Still looking for another one, Deathbloom/Bloodstaind on Earthen Ring US. Man we had such great times together.

---
 Of course. But WPvP is still dependent on who gets the jump.
---
Nah. Most groups I‚Äôve been in understood that everyone should roll need on BoEs. I‚Äôve never personally experienced someone calling me a ninja for that and if it does happen, it‚Äôs the exception, not the rule.
---
Thanks for the tip. I looked him up just now and it seems most of his videos focus on feral cat DPS in raids. I am much more interested in tanking and healing on my feral personally. Didn't see any content on his channel pertaining to that.
---
Lazor chickens everywhere
---
I don't understand why memes are low effort even the simplest joke can be very creative not everyone is a music or painting prodigy...
---
Yeah, which if memory serves was not a common problem for competent guilds. I'd be wary of a guild hemorrhaging members at such a rate that they start recruiting literally any DPS they can get. It's a better bet to get into a guild healing (or even off-tanking as a druid) and then DPSing farmed content.
---
I've been in super casual guilds, they're out there, but in my experience, it's just not realistic to expect to find one, especially if you've an eye toward progression. Guilds on that level don't get far. In Wrath we didn't even finish Naxx lol.
---
They are basing boss armor on what Maexxna had in naxx. Turns out that armor wasn't normalized but rather thematic. Maexxna was a low armor boss (since it doesn't have any armor and spidee skin is soft) so even with the "jacked up" armor values there will be a lot of bosses in Classic with much higher armor than people are used to. Dragon scales are pretty hard so Onyxia will have more armor, rock is definitely harder so Garr will have massive amounts of armor.
---
You'd have a better argument if you didn't start it with an exaggerated made up statistic.
---
I would avoid the assumption that these raids are going to be any harder. Everything is still going to get cleared day 1. With or without world buffs or fury tanks etc.
---
I've never pvp'd seriously...what does getting rank 14 entail exactly? It's more than just running BGs and getting honor kills?
---
This is why even though I hate my old username I'm going to use it again on my main, I think
---
"All you need is 2 nights a week to get gear"
---
That's just not true. Sure you will eventually get gear but getting 1 piece every 4 raids you attend is NOT going to be consistent and is NOT going to keep you competitive in the PvP scene.
---
Raiding only 2 nights a week you'll be lucky to get 2 items a month, depending on your class.
---
I kept groups up just fine with VE in vanilla...

---
Just have 1000's of them and keep them all unlisted. Chances are we'd be discovering them months into the game. No realm-wide announcement, just a little acknowledgement that you were the first person ever to do *that* thing in Classic.
---
That's actually a pretty neat achievement.
---
I wanted classic with as little changes as possible. However, I still expected some technical things to be better, such as:  
---
\-Widescreen / Resolution support
---
\-Faster servers
---
\-A little less bugs (I played from like week 1 of vanilla, and it was all over the place for a year)  
---
I absolutely hate delay and lag, and I can't for the life of me comprehend why the hell people would want to emulate spell-batching from back in the day. When we say no changes, yeah, I get it, probably more than most people. But my computer and internet and modern servers don't need spell batching. Nothing about it feels good. It just feels laggy and slow, and I am not a fan of it at all.
---
And he didn‚Äôt refresh mana fast enough before he could re-shield? Even without shield at that lvl he should be dodging and resisting most of their attacks. Something doesn‚Äôt add up here
---
I think the release is at 4PM PDT (7PM EST) on the 27th. Am I wrong?
---
Shadow Oil
---
1) The condition checks if target is within attack range based on the  player positions and spell ranges clientside, no matter what attack. 20 yd test on 1.12 client: [https://streamable.com/j9t2g](https://streamable.com/j9t2g), same test on an unmodified client: [https://streamable.com/wo372](https://streamable.com/wo372). It seems to be identical to the beta *client side*. However, your target is an npc, and you're both running, and the 2.66 yd range is added ***on the NPC's range,*** then it's clear the beta client has it wrong. ( I haven't seen evidence of this yet ).
---
2) That statement does not disprove that a leeway was a mechanic present in vanilla. Not to shy away from the fact the Blizzard has stated that it's as intended, you do not provide any source If wether it was added in MoP+.  
---
Leeway was perfectly reasonable for 2004 game when players had on average higher MS. In other games, having snapshots in time which the server can go back to "check for wether something was true" (e.g an attack made) was also common, however this would be extremely expensive to do with WoW because of the shear amount of data, so again; it's reasonable to think an added range was added on the server side, ***though I'm not stating it is identical or correct from what we've seen in the beta***. Not to mention the statement from the 1.3 patch: "*Spells in PvP now have a slight increase in range and area of effect when  targets are moving. This should improve the overall usability of spells  and ranged attacks."* 
---
3) This is a rather weak argument, there's been people stating the exact opposite. It should not be counted as fact either way. This could also mean that leeway is not implemented correctly in the beta.
---
4) I'm guessing you mean extrapolated client side? This is true, it's hard to judge a server sided mechanic from videos, however blindly stating attacks from old videos which seem to have added range is the cause of interpolation/extrapolaion, you have to atleast provide a theory/argument for it. 
---
5) I'm not sure what you're saying here, latency was never really a factor wether leeway is *induced*, but it's effect should be more "vanilla like" client/server have a bigger delay between packets.
---
After reading more about this topic the past week, I can agree that my first post is not really correct, either. However the evidence suggests that it indeed was a mechanic present in vanilla. If you are going to state it was added in MoP+, please add sources. I'm only interested in evidence, and for the record; leeway in the beta seems very off imho, so I'm not taking a stance here.
---
To be competitive in PvP you'll need to have BWL and AQ on farm to get gear that will allow you to keep above everyone else and remain competitive.
---
It doesn't take die hard progression to raid those raids, but to have them on farm you need to be pretty PvE oriented for a while. 
---
Getting One or Two pieces from those raids isn't going to keep you competitive in the PvP scene.
---
I did. By waiting you‚Äôll be one of the majority of people stuck in the zerg. The normal pace levellers who don‚Äôt go all in. Meanwhile people who started day 1 and went nolife will be ahead of the pack.
---
EU here!

Today is the last day in the beta. Someone linked me a website to track them. I missed 5 in the last 24 hours. That's my real issue with the sub. Pertinent info are buried under the memes.

Guffaws in stoneform

TBC was the greatest version of WoW everything that came after was garbage and Vanilla was just TBC beta, hell even in the Dev dairies they talked about how at least parts of TBC were in the original plan for Vanilla. I have called/texted/discordmsg/emailed/regular mailed EVERYONE I knew from Vanilla through Wrath in an attempt to get them to play Classic. When Classic blows Blizz mind with its reception it will create a driver for Blizz to release a Classic TBC server. Ill be there at the Dark Portal, Horde banner tied to my big bear ass ready to relive the GREATEST WoW experience to be had.

I'm on NW right now and it's great scripting but the pop is still tiny during NA hours. It's sad that BC has never had a project as popular as Nost, it's such a great expansion.
---
I know all that. I see what you're saying now, you're saying that this new honor farm team reset the queue of all the people on the grind at the time when it formed. I thought you were saying Blizz actually reset the ladder over this.
---
Social pressure has everything to do with this. They don't have some literal power over your character; they can't actually *force* people not to break cap. What they can do is an awful lot of toxic social shit to make sure nobody groups with the person who doesn't toe the line. That's exactly what I mean by "drastic social pressure." Don't get me wrong, it is a godawful system and I think it will be the first thing on the chopping block when people actually come to understand how bad it is.
---
Yeah.. PvP Arms warriors with Death Wish and Improved Intercept lol.
---
PvE Fury warriors with sword or axe specialization...
---
just work on your nen bro
---
I don't think people were "clueless", the idea that players back then didn't know how to min/max for some reason is more than a bit silly.
---
Everybody also knew that Jeff Kaplan and the other devs deliberately gimped hybrid DPS. They were turned into support and utility, and people trying to make them something they're not need to be realistic about this. People took them didn't take them because they didn't understand game balance and theorycrafting, and I don't think they had much better odds of finding a group than they do now on pservers anyway. I remember these specs being a bit of a joke back in vanilla, on my server at least, and while we all probably knew somebody who got to raid at least occasionally as one, we knew a lot more who had to heal or didn't raid.
---
Fappy, was always my favorite of the 7 dwarves
---
I know the underbog one was fixed and it throws you around properly. There was a developer interview where one of the encounter designers was explaining it. It‚Äôs pretty funny
---
I think it's best to keep it #nochanges. If they start buffing one class they'll have to start buffing all of them and then it's no longer 1.12 like we asked for.
---
I don't see how Fortnite can be blamed for the "instant gratification" effect when games with short round times have always existed, and twenty minutes is actually a long round compared to a game like Street Fighter where the rounds are typically under five minutes.
---
seen loads of people complaining about toxicity and elitism.
---
Try semi-high ranked CS:GO gameplay like I did after a long break with only WoW. That shit is true toxicity.
---
The small amount of trolls on Classic WoW are only making themselves heard louder, not really being a lot of them. 
---
Also you can‚Äôt really expect less on the internet.
---
They will be ahead of the pack for a few days till they burnout and have to sleep/work. 
---
Also, even if they No-life at the very start, so will literally everyone else for the first few days, so the No-Lifers will be competing against everyone at the start regardless, that's not even mentioning all the server distruptions and maintenance resets that will happen. 
---
I'll be playing from the moment it launches but I won't bother going HAM on leveling until the initial mass of players have done there 3 day No-Life binge.
---
I'll level fishing, farm resources and prepare my character/bank/proffesion alts for leveling during the initial craze. Once the initial rush dies down I'll focus on leveling with my week off starting 3 days after launch.
---
Either way you look at it, No-Lifer or not, you will be competing against players for mobs at some point in the leveling process, no matter how good or fast you are. Anyone who thinks otherwise is delusional.
---
Only imbiciles will be leveling where the majority of the Zerg is anyways. The first week of launch will be all about how to effectively use your time.
---
Not what you want to hear but as someone who has leveled a few Druids through Pserver and played one in Vanilla, save yourself loads of ass pain and level as Feral. You really dont want to be wondering all over the talent trees while leveling in Classic, its a recipe for hardship. You should speed down to HotW ASAP, its a MEGA boss to damage as a Cat, really fluffs your mana pool and gives you a lot more butt in Bear. The nicest thing you can do for an OOM healer is give them innervate, Druid healing spells cost quite a bit of mana and have long casts, not to mention shifting is quite expensive for mana also. If you find a DUO leveling partner then Resto is awesome but on your own its not that nice to level as.
---
Don't claim something you know nothing about next time and you won't get downvoted.
---
Why on earth were you downvoted for asking a simple question? JFC this sub sometimes.
---
Really? I never had an issue with it... guess that's what I get for playing a druid and I am able to cc the god damn raptors
---
Warrior with MS and concussion blow
---
No not particularly.
---
We warriors can relate - we get the Whirlwind Axe at 30 and it isn't until some of the stuff from Maraudon in the late 40s that it finally gets replaced.
---
I was stupid and vendored it in Vanilla and was sad about it years later. It deserves that bank slot.
---
Naxx was released on June 20, 2006. TBC was released on January 16, 2007. That was 7 months my dude. 
---
How long was Blizzard supposed to wait?
---
Because we are eager to see it flop before even it launches.
---
Basically, we all here are from r/wow, in disguise, artificially hyping up Classic.
---
So when it flops, we can all go back to r/wow.
---
But until that happens, we are still here, F5-ing the main page.

Armed military with shoot to kill rights are not exactly who I'd want to play chicken with.  Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Maybe I'll buy another Logitech mouse?  Maybe not?  It's not brand hatred, it's "I've owned more faulty Logitech products than any other brand thus I tend to stay away from them."
---
I'm willing to bet that the vast majority of the complaints are from people who are simply used to the feel of modern WoW.  I remember not knowing these mechanics existed and I didn't learn about them til I came back after a long hiatus only to find the game felt different and I had to search for what happened.
---
Typically people think of things like class overhauls, talents, ect.. when they think about how WoW has changed but I feel people underestimate the impact that "under the hood" changes have had on how WoW plays and feels
---
It made 1-60 content and all your progress in it irrelevant. Same thing that every future expansion would do. Not only it made you no longer felt invested in progress of your character, but it also made the game's world smaller, despite adding new content.
---
It was when the game started being all about endgame, leveling was no longer a journey. It was just something you had to grind through before "the real game begins". 
---
Daily Quests, which played a huge part in making the game a chore. Maybe it wasn't that bad on launch, but by the time Qul'Danas was released the game basically became  job.
---
Flying Mounts, that should be self explainatory. But even without them the outdoor world was nowhere near as dangerous as in vanilla. Aside from the pvp towers and hlaala, i don't even remember having any pvp encounters while leveling to 70. And i played on a High pop PVP realm.
---
Badges and catch-up mechanics. Why wait to make your progression irrelevant until the next expansion, when it can happen the next patch?
---
Copypaste dungeon design. Dungeons became linear themeparks, all with standarized length and difficulty. In vanilla you had variety, there were 15 minute shorties like stockades and SM wings, and basically undeground zones that take hours to fully explore like BRD. 
---
I liked the Heroic difficulty, but if that was the price to pay for them, then it's not worth it.
---
I could probably go on, but these are the major issues that i could remember (i never played on a PS so its been a while), i don't want want to get into subjective stuff or nitpick too much. It's still the best expansion along with wrath (which is 90% like retail, it's just the content was better),  but Vanilla is the best version of the game for me, and TBC just changed the game too much for me to enjoy it.
---
It's allowed and ethical.  Just like bank alts are allowed and ethical.  It's potentially against the spirit of the game so not specifically supported.  But it was how it was done in vanilla completely legally and is really just another way to play the game.
---
The rules are well defined on what's not allowed and multiboxing is not specified as against TOS in any legitimate form.
---
That is beautiful
---
Oh yeah, I couldn't even imagine the time it would take to do all that. There's a lot involved. I know Matt Mercer ran a WoW themed one shot Terry Crews and a few others. Might be able to take some inspiration from that. I haven't watched it though.
---
Are you referring to the winding chasm? iirc you just hugged left its been so many years, I never got lost in there though, I didn't realize that was a thing that happened to people lol.
---
Sure, but you definitely killed more packs then you had to
---
You want a different game than what was promised. You're not getting it.
---
I think those nolifers will be the minority. You‚Äôd still be competing with less people. Probably a lot less. And honestly there‚Äôs no avoiding the zerg because in vanilla you need every zone, or at least part of it. And every zone will be crowded.
---
I think a lot of these should be really firsts
---
oh wow. I would be curious to see the end result!
---
I started using them after my buddy showed me his and having everything so close together was very appealing to me. I practicing with a cheaper Dravo one from Amazon and so far I love them.
---
My guess would be from back then would be rank ~5-6.  
---
I was doing solo 6-8 hours daily back then and hit rank 11 iirc but higher were harder to get, whereas lower ones could be gained stupid easy. I think I had like 100 HKs to my name total when I got rank 3-4 or so (but that was at sub-60).
---
Just think it's sad when people have to give their judgmental opinion on how others spend their money.
---
Hey there yung\_pupper, thank you for your feedback!  Yes it seems like elitism and toxicity are a big problem when it comes to guild recruitment throughout the main guild recruitment channels, although I haven't heard anything regarding that with my community (yet!).  One feature request I've heard a few times is to add an option to allow guilds to designate themselves as "hardcore", "casual", "semi-core", "min-max", etc and the same goes for players.  I'll be adding that feature in the coming days so this should help you avoid elitism if you choose to!
---
FUCK YES, love that, i love his videos but if i had a guide that i didn't have to stop, watch the vid, and play again it would be so much better.
---
I'd rather be just behind the Zerg and No Lifers but have my Fishing/Cooking/Proffesions max for my level then just ahead of the curve and have none of that even touched.
---
Anyone that is hardcore no-lifing it will beat me to 60 anyways. I just care about avoiding the Zerg/average levelers.
---
Hey, I don't mind. Someone's gotta buy all the mid-tier products or the top-tier manufacturers wouldn't have to keep pushing themselves. Good on you for taking one for the team.
---
This is how I see it. If somebody wants to raid as a meme spec that's all fine and dandy as long as they're realistic and willing to either respec or switch to content where they're more viable and likely to succeed.
---
Because you can run through blizzard without it slowing you?
---
Tbc was the beginning of the end. Vanilla for life. No changes.
---
I think nades are a disorient effect, rather than stun.
---
I would love to see the healing numbers in green above target heads as a toggle.  Minor change from vanilla (was added in tbc) and almost certainly doable with the modern client.
---
So you asked him for his 5 year plan?
---
I don‚Äôt quite understand your point. The point I am making, to put in language that you‚Äôre using, is that scattershot has a diminishing returns if you roll Tauren And go engineer
---
Wow, a mouse that costs EUR‚Ç¨239.00.
---
Whatever makes you sleep at night bud.
---
And retail bosses today suffer the same thing. Blizzard just fixes them faster.
---
I'm not sure it's that simple for models. Textures and sounds, yeah. Adding additional sounds? Nope, gotta edit the database files. I think making the new models work on the 1.12.1. client required database edits as well. I don't think the new client allows this.
---
Don‚Äôt tell them what to do unless they ask.
---
There's one I had not heard of, thank you.

This is just natural selection. The weak hunters reroll, but the strong stay and feast.

Not OP in the slightest...
---
Be aware that there's no guild bank and no auto-generation of guild bank gold based on player activity. You have to solicit donations from members for whatever you deem to be guild expenses.
---
Officer structure tends to reflect loot system. In particular with loot council you probably want every class to have a representative on the council.
---
belf is such qt üòç
---
Nobody here posting to the root question here.  Why is this all of sudden a problem now?
---
Answer:  Mob mentality, and group think.  If Perplexity says it's outdated, then everyone must agree with him.
---
Enjoy your bottom of the barrel dps noob
---
Considering how unbalanced Vanilla was (and we love it for that), I'm not sure you can say it was designed to be cleared as long as you had people and gear.  There are some HARD dps checks in Naxx.
---
Let me give you a mythic plus example.  Say your regular raid force has a couple people missing and you have to PUG them (from your own guild I'm sure).  
---
Do you have an item level requirement to join you in Mythic plus?  I bet you probably do (if I'm wrong you have my apologies).  The reason is because no matter how good they are and how well they perform, they just won't be able to bring the right amount of healing/mitigation/dps without the proper Item level.  
---
That is how you should think of sub-optimal specs as a retail player.  No matter how good they perform, their spec (item level for mythic plus) prevent them from pulling their weight.
---
If you want to bring sub-optimal specs in Vanilla, I hope you bring people with garbage Item level to Mythic plus.
---
Having leveled 4 60s, 2 on each side I can confidently state that I prefer the horde zones and cities. Alliance has a great 1-30 flow but after that horde takes over imo. Starting with STV, Grom Gol is a way better hub than the alliance camp up north, and it just continues from there.
---
+1 for dwarf priest named Doc
---
Someone played too many pservers. This was classic my friend
---
There‚Äôs a great blog online titled ‚Äò8 Years in Azeroth‚Äô, the first section is all about running a guild during vanilla. It might give you some insight into the joys of managing 40 people... Also, it is a really good read!
---
Prepare yourself for loot drama and be ready to mitigate issues with people that result.  This is likely to be one of the biggest problems you will face.  With 2-3 drops per 40 man raid groups, there‚Äôs gonna be friction even in a perfectly fair system.
---
PvE build with a 2h Weapon, MS, Death Wish, and 4/5 flurry sounds pretty insane, too.
---
I can't see wanting to go back go retail, so it just depends on whether we enjoy classic as much as we think we might. 
---
I loved it when it was current, but i was 11... so im not sure if I'm remembering correct haha.
---
&gt; the idea that players back then didn't know how to min/max for some reason is more than a bit silly.
---
A majority of players didn't.
---
&gt;devs deliberately gimped hybrid DPS. They were turned into support and utility
---
They were "support and utility" from the game's launch, due to the talent system being so last-minute and broken.
---
The opposite of what you said, happened. Over the course of vanilla, with the talent revamps, the hybrid classes' dps/tanking capabilities got better, not worse. But they were still intended to be "support" classes, and thus, "pure" dps classes and Warriors remained better at dps/tanking. This philosophy continued all the way until Cataclysm, being referred to as the "hybrid tax".
---
Are you sure SoR can be twisted with SoC?
---
Just the announcement of BC was a death sentence for a lot of vanilla guilds before BC released also.
---
you must not have played a hunter first time around..

Perhaps vanilla hunter isn't for you.
---
Tailoring is pretty easy to get to 300, all you need is cloth, and that drops from every humanoid.
---
So if you want it, it's very easy to get, get it then drop tailoring for alchemy.

Don't be afraid to minus their DKP when they get out of line

It confirmed works in beta
---
Maybe you're just not that likeable? I don't hold back, and I've also never been kicked out of a guild. I've said a lot of shit tbh, so maybe you should do some self reflection on the subject.
---
I too, spent too much money to play a 15 year old game.
---
I am very on the fence youre right.
---
I'm excited to play classic, and excited to play with my friends, but im unsure as to if i know enough about what im getting myself into vis a vis GMing before i feel fully comfortable.
---
Good point with the familiarity, i guess it makes sense to start with what were used to and adapt if needs be.
---
DND 5e is considered the ‚ÄúWoW‚Äù if pnp rulesets.
---
And Fury Warriors gaining Sweeping Strikes, and can also sneak 1 Talent Point into Sword Spec.
---
Thanks I'll check it out!
---
nice lisps sps ps psps
---
This is what people have always done for mob tagging. Gather up instance aoe them down.
---
Oh man you misspelled "Alliance" and you are colorblind. Poor thing.
---
It's neither. When I was in middle school, the rumor was that it made you impotent. It's all aspartame-hype-hysteria.
---
Definitely not. I buy pretty shitty clothing, never pay much for a haircut, and don't drive the latest-and-greatest. There are just certain things I'm passionate about and PC peripherals happens to be one of them. 
---
And because of that, I own a few thousand shares in LOGI, meaning it's my duty to defend them from people that have no idea what they're talking about. But it is up 500% over the last 5 years, so you've got your work cut out for you.
---
Yeah im gonna set up a bank alt quickly. 
---
I hadnt thought about soliciting money from the guild, how did people tend to go about this in the past?
---
Oh my god... and it lasted MONTHS!
---
Worst bug ever.
---
LBRS is way harder to navigate in my opinion.
---
Ventrilo?! What year is it?
---
congratulations!
---
I remember having a great time with my UD Warrior back then chopping away at their pets and then pummeling one school only to reflect the other one and then Sweeping Strikes them both down, mmmmmemories
---
48-55 raiders is a good number to have, if you don't have incredibly dedicated folks who can make every raid. I remember carrying 60 at one point, when going through some attendance turmoil, but we always settled around the 52 mark. You can certainly do MC, Onyxia and most of BWL without a full raid group, so lower attendance sometimes won't necessarily cripple the raid.
---
Class officers help a ton, and will help reduce the load on you for recruiting. As a shaman class officer in vanilla, I made a point to get to know most of the shamans in the raiding guilds on the server, as well as keeping an eye on the up-and-comers in the feeder guilds (obviously they weren't built as feeder guilds, but we all knew what they were there for, to gear our raiders for us).
---
We had similar roles in our guild to what you mention, our GM was our Rogue class leader, our main raid leader was also our Mage class leader. I was the healing lead, on top of being the shaman class lead. Class leaders were mostly there to be recruiters/coordinators, while still maintaining the other roles that you mentioned. We had one person who was 'elected' by the non-officers to be a 'community officer'.
---
It seems like a lot of officers, but when you break it down, we ended up with 1 officer per 7/8 raiders. Everyone felt like they had a voice in the officer group, an advocate in the loot council, someone that was speaking up for them, and the ratio feels very similar to what you had in retail based on the reduced number of raiders.
---
Brush my triple setup with a 4k in the middle is only $600 total
---
Dopey should be the hunter, because huntard of course. 
---
Sleepy should be the Paladin, because if how damn boring they are.
---
Yes. GL.
---
Well no one has been banned for them.  That‚Äôs about the best you‚Äôre going to get.  You get the occasional random who says ‚ÄúI got banned multiboxing‚Äù but usually they were doing something else that was worth the ban, which of course they won‚Äôt tell you.
---
I find it really funny that your name is TheRealRecollector and you only make arguments based on your recollection of a 15 year old game. 
---
Here is a video of an actual top guild just messing around having a DPS warrior dual wield tank Nefarian in Vanilla.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6l-s0b8oe2w
---
He isn't world buffed to shit, he isn't super overgeared. And his hp doesn't even come close to death. So this is real evidence that contradicts your completely anecdotal claims.
---
Zug zug
---
&gt; Heroic Strike threat does not SCALE with damage
---
Wrong. It scales with crit. It scales with AP. It 100% scales with damage.   
---
" A Fury Warrior that losses 1/3rd of it's CRIT, will lose probably HALF the THREAT, because this is how it works, for them. Druids will lose probably 35-40% THREAT. "  
---
You literally made this whole thing up. Noone is losing 13 of their crit. 1/3 of their crit is not half their threat. That doesn't make any sense if you even think about it for a minute with no math. Do a real analysis if you want to make an argument.  
---
People do not have 30% less crit. Again. They do not.  
---
" IS IT ANY LOGICAL REASON TO USE A FURY OR DRUID TANK, for 10% MORE THREAT, "  
---
Where did you get 10%? O, out of your ass, I see.   
---
Don't talk about "logical" reasons when you are just spewing nonsense and don't use any logic at all.
---
Can someone do this for rogue
---
Might be time to take a break from reddit, dude.
---
Yes, this allows potions, sapper charges, healthstones, and some other things to be used "in form" with an instant shift macro.
---
and is leveling in dungeon with 5 characters faster than say questing /solo/2 chars??
---
Wait you think owning something costing 1000-1500 bucks means you are rich.
---
? That's not even half my mortgage+car payment.
---
Rolling ignite was a thing in vanilla, so...
---
Playing devils advocate, there is a drastic difference between a bug fix and a buff.
---
I think that's a fair assumption. Dwarf is a good counter to the extra range of melee/poisons. It also gives some armour and removes bleeds. Both very good against melee. 
---
I feel like more people will be rolling both dwarf and gnome this time around.
---
If it's the same dungeon I'm thinking, there used to be stairs up and down to other halls like a ring shape. The quickest pattern was something like up, up, down, up, down, down and then repeat. It's been so long I really don't remember, but back in the day I had it memorized and would lead groups through.
---
Good news already for the AddOn side of things:  
---
I have a guy that already made an AddOn where I can implement my guide "easily"(still like a couple hundred hours of work\^\^):  
---
Look at a preview of his AddOn and a first Demo Guide (My guide will be implemented in that AddOn by default)
---

I mentioned this is another post - create or buy water walking elixirs and check out waterish zones. My favorite to check out was STV, desolate, feralas, and Hillsbrad. You get a really different perspective on the zone from the ocean. You also dont have to suffer from slow swim speed.
---
I love how they make fun of WoW (and other RPGs) but yet honor it at the same time. Just like they do with PUBG.
---
&gt;A 5/31/15  Fury Warrior with a shield generate less threat than a 17/3/31 Prot Warrior.  
---
&gt;The only reason to use Fury tanks is if they DW.
---
Wrong.  
---
" The GAME is designed to DESTROY tanks that don't have Shields and Def cap. It is HOW IT WORKS. "   
---
Hahahaha you are a joke.
---
Warriors would be op...
---
We definitely try to remove any posts/comments we see (or, more likely, that are reported) that "Gate-keep" aka, "GO BACK TO BFA" etc. That type of post is always removed if we see it / it is reported.
---
Beyond that, yeah, we try to remove abusive language (Rule #2 type of stuff) as best as we can / when appropriate. I personally dislike the anti-BFA crowd's approach to things, not because I think BFA is some pinnacle of game design (read: it isn't), but because I really want the sub to be a place of open discussion. It's not always easy to discuss things if you're constantly on edge from being verbally assaulted.
---
So, tl;dr: yeah, we're aware and on the same page with you. No immediate plans to change rule enforcement, but the entire situation is something we've discussed.
---
Yeah, exactly. Cooldowns and consumables enhance the game; it's about preperation and investment. If I wanted a game exclusively about twitch-reaction with no investment or cooldowns, I'd play either a MOBA, or I'd play COD.
---
I used the site and ended up talking with my old alliance GM from my first guild for like 30 minutes.  Was cool just catching up, even though I doubt I'll be playing with him.
---
i recommend trying out combat daggers, swords, seal fate swords and daggers, hemo/expose too possibly for pve. rogue raid life is boring. might aswell play different things but it hardly matters what buttons or in which order you press them. play horde if you want atleast a bit more challenge.
---
An no one gives a flying fuck about world seconds. Quit trying so hard and play the game, no one cares about your redone pixel accomplishments.
---
Yeah I understand. I have no complaints about the modding here. I enjoyed the space to be unanticipated controversial. Thanks for that. I wonder if you guys ever get contacted by community managers about post or request?
---
Hunters are easy to play, hard to master.
---
Make her an alt. You get 50 character slots for classic.
---
Yeah, me too. I also like their Bored series. ^ ^
---
I love this haha there show called Roll Need that i watch. Its a DND adventure taking place in classic wow. Starts a bit slow but it's current arc is awesome they are doing deadmines! Using this show to fill my classic itch https://youtu.be/yCriigZ3FMs
---
So you can export the textures from the game itself and edit them in Photoshop, or you can download the ones you need from here: 
---
https://github.com/Gethe/wow-ui-textures/tree/classic?files=1
---
Then just make sure the picture you export is a .blp file. There‚Äôs Photoshop extensions you can get that allow you to import and export BLP files. Just be aware that BFA loads different actionbar textures than Classic, and to check out the live branch on that Github page if you wanna test it out in BFA.
---
I feel like Snow White should be a human priest or a paladin...
---
Lighten up, chuckles, it's a game.
---
I‚Äôve been using a Reddragon M901 and M908 over that past couple years. They are cheap but work. Being cheap you may run into reliability issues but I have had better luck with them vs. the Corsair Scimitar or the Naga series.
---
Agreed when one guild does it with no punishment every other guild does aswell to keep up. Lame and cheesy way to get bis ony loot for every class. Ive done this myself on pservers but only because every other guild did and we had to keep up. Also fcks the economy when u get like 4 ony bags each reset and also every guild member is guaranteed to Get their cloak for nefarian
---
What is the current state of leeway?
---
&gt; less people competing for my already eztoget gear. lul.
---
Don't hunters need all of the gear? That sounds like it would be harder.
---
I was just joking. It's from this popular video from back in the day - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5lo9kmcEw0w
---
You can currently hit people from stupid far away with melee abilities if you are both running the same direction
---
+1, after leveling most classes I would say Priest surprised me the most in how painless it was.
---
Solo questing I would be taking on 2-3 mobs at a time, with no downtime due to Wand being mana-free and Spirit Tap. As a Mage or Warrior I would need to recover after even a mob or two. In the early dungeons I would be 1st or 2nd in damage while also Healing the group.
---
Not having to rely on people is great. And then when you're grouped up you're an unstoppable wrecking machine since you're already dealing so much damage which doesn't entirely depend on mana, or standing still to cast.
---
It makes a lot of sense to level as Disc for anyone planning on doing more of a Healing bend, since Holy doesn't really have many beneficial points besides the first +5% crit. But really, I find it way more useful to put first talents into Spirit Tap &gt; Wands &gt; Martyrdom &gt; etc &gt; to get up to Inner Focus and Meditation ASAP. And then you will probably tilt toward getting to Divine Spirit to enhance your Spirit Tap points.
---
Just run your standard PvE DPS spec. Your team in PvP won't really notice. They just need you to lock down a healer. 
---
On the other hand, if you try to raid with PvP talents, then everyone will notice your lower damage. And Rogues don't bring anything to the table other than damage.
---
I‚Äôll put up with dresses during dungeons and raids to get that sweet sweet Judgement set
---
Ha, no you were right the first time.
---
The upvotes are inexplicable, though.
---
What is there to talk about?
---
People are already deciding best racial and class pairings, discussing whether to level professions while leveling characters or wait until 60, and how underwhelming some early raid gear may be because of the PVP gear present in version 1.12.
---
And then you have people who wont stop talking about layering and streamers.
---
Got a death bringer.
---
That sounds awesome! I'll check that out
---
!remindme 40 days
---
Except ilvl isn't as important as someone who can follow mechanics. You can't fail mechanics no matter your gear - because mythic is actually difficult and many mechanics are designed to one-shot you or wipe your raid 9 times/10
---
I had multiple people in my guild who had lesser viable specs and it didn't cause problems. We'd fix actual problems first 
---
In vanilla you can mess up some mechanics and do less than optimal dps and it's still good enough. It's just easier.
---
!remindme 43 days
---
It really depents on who is asking.
---
If a guy sais "I love paladin tanking and raiding, can paladins tank?"
---
Can paladins tank... yes
---
Can paladins tank dungeons... yes
---
Can paladins tank group quests... yes
---
Can paladins aoe tank for gold farming... yes
---
But to give the heads up that paladins can't raid tank is nice to know before hand. No one says he should not pick paladin, people just give the thruth, wich isn't always what they want to hear. But if they are asking for it, people awnser honestly.
---
New? Dwarf was always the best hunter for PvP.
---
They have one of each class represented, druids can only be night elves so you have to either make snow white the night elf or make one of the 7 dwarves a night elf.
---
Derp obviously hahaha
---
Nah there will still be a lot of Legolas‚Äôs out there. Shadow meld in AB/WSG PVP flag guarding will still be OP.
---
Damn son why not just get a 50" oled at this point
---
And that was enough money? I guess the guild can only provide out what people give it. So if they want us to give more back they gotta put more in.
---
Orc shaman. Previously nelf/gnome priest all my life. Did a tauren shaman to 80 back in wrath once. Gonna go full horde flavor and do shaman.   
---
   
---
Orc because I can do the braided pony tail and it has a spinning effect when casting. No joke.
---
I think X-Perl is defunct. Z-Perl was the latest iteration as far as I can remember.
---
Well, what are they saying?
---
I know they are working on bug fixes up until the final stress test before launch.
---
Apparently leeway doesn't go into effect if the person is slowed.
---
What is a lava run btw?
---
The only case I can make for spell batching and leeway is that my internet is the same shitty DSL that I had in 2006 and Centurylink has a monopoly on my area  and has deeemed it not cost effective to ever improve it.

I can not and will not speak about Leeway in PvP as I am not a PvPer, so that part is thrown out for me
---
But as for leeway in PvE, REMOVE IT, I've seen a few people in the tests try to run away from a group of NPCs only to get cracked over the head from the moon and die because of this. This is super punishing and frankly just anti-fun. 
---
As for spell batching, that needs to flat out change. We are not playing in 2004 anymore. Back in 2004 Comcast offered a new lighting fast 4Mbps, today the average connection speed in the USA is around 96Mbps. The speed of data communications has improved greatly over the years. July 21st 2004 the world speed record was shattered at a blazing fast 4.23Gbps. Today people have home connections of 1 Gbps or higher. There are connections to businesses of over 10Gbps. 
---
Spell batching is bad for the simple fact that its an outdated method of dealing with slow connections and high latency. As of right now anyone can pop a movement speed buff and run right through a hunter's ice trap or a mage's blizzard AND AVOID IT. Mages can polly each other and warrior can charge each other, this is fun for the first few times it happens, but after that it becomes annoying. It is no longer a game of speed and skill, but rather a game of luck. Did your polly get pushed into the last spell batch or did it get stuck in the new spell batch where the enemy polly got grouped into? Did you get your iceblock off before the spell batch was sent or are you going to get into the new spell batch and get hit and die because of the sell batch? Did that rogue set off your ice trap or did he just run right through it?
---
Spell batching is outdated and needs to be changed. We don't play on Athlon 64 or Pentium Ds because they are old and outdated. The idea that we should have to group together everything that happened in the last 200ms is wrong, it's an artificial latency, we all might as well be playing on servers that have pings of 200ms or more.
---
*laughs in rogue fall damage immunity*
---
...oh wait, we don‚Äôt work like that anymoreüò¢
---
Find warrior to heal bot is your best bet as holy
---
I like the election idea, and rolling the other officer roles into class roles thats smart.
---
&gt;Do you feel deceived that the hot night elf Druid in your guild that you‚Äôve been giving gold to is actually just another sweaty turbonerd named Craig? 
---
People who actually give gold to other people online because they play an attractive female character are unfathomably stupid. If you give gold to the hot druid in your guild because you think it's a cute girl, you're a fucking idiot.
---
A dude playing a female character is fine. It doesn't mean anything. Either you like the hypersexualized female features more than the male power fantasy male characters, or armor looks better and/or they have better animations. There is zero need to justify this to other players.
---
People who give others a hard time or try to psychoanalyze somebody for playing opposite-sex characters are insufferably insecure morons.
---
When I was 14-15 I was only allowed to play 3-4 hours a day because I had to share a computer. I was able to raid MC, ZG, and AQ20 in a casual raiding guild.
---
Hell yeah! My prediction is first level 60 is done within 80 hours and then they get banned!
---
Ah okay. I thought it was about "stealing" kills from other players. Thanks for the clarification.
---
Forgot to mention, class officers generally decided who got to raid vs who didnt. Raid leader would tell us how many of each class for each fight, and we would determine the participants based on gear needed, performance etc... This kept hte raid moving, since we were making those decisions in our own chat vs having one raid leader make the call individually.
---
Yeah, if you suck at pet management and let your demon stand next to you while you both get chopped up in sweeping strikes like a moron.
---
Yeah, that's way better.
---
You do not need strength specific gear as Seal of Command is the only spell with ap scaling. It's not a bad stat in general since you do a lot of white damage and it helps with shield block but most plate spell damage has enough strength on it anyway to fit your needs. Stuff like plate of the shaman king, pvp gear, T2, ect. Before all that Lightforge is solid since it's plate with well rounded stats, and I think there's a couple mail spell dmg pieces worth looking at. T1 is more of a utility set but obviously it has more stats than lightforge so it's good for the same reason.  
---
AoE is the best way to maximize your class' solo farming capability. Reckoning is very nice for this purpose as the farming playstyle involves using seal of light/wisdom and every proc helps.   
---
Engi/Enchanting is life. Engi will give you a way to pull more mobs from distance to group up quicker, more on demand AoE, a great shield, and some fun tools. Enchanting will allow you to disenchant stuff from your solo runs, dungeon runs, as well as 2man DM:E jump runs, and farming out some nice patterns could prove lucrative.
---
SL/SL Warlock is the clear winner.
---
Enough money for what? Its not like we could afford respeccs for people or anything else. What is guild money used for these days? I stopped playing when MOP was announced.
---
I was able to, with my own farming, provide a couple of fire protection pots for people. If someone showed some interest in crafting resistance gear I provided the necessary raid drops.
---
After TBC launched I joined a server first raiding guild and quickly learned that the overwhelming majority of players in my previous guild were utterly lazy and expected things to be handed to them. At the time I farmed so much for the guild and thought it was my fault when people played horribly. Nope.
---
What site???
---
Yep
---
Using it on some pserver and I love it
---
Smart.
---
I was thinking the raid leader role would be different due to generally less mechanics to micromanage. So having the raid leader be the top tier of other people in like a management tier thing makes sense.
---
No new talents / rebalanced talents and no 41 talents tree. Plus it's 5 talent points not 10.  So no not at all.
---
They are both pretty easy to get I'd say. Everyone that posted pretty much covered everything, but one thing to also take into consideration is that bosses in BWL always drop tier gear. It's not a chance item like trinkets or weapons. It's basically guaranteed that everyone will have it within 2-3 months. In some situations you will have it very quickly like if your comp doesn't bring a lot of shamans. 
---
The other set can be acquired through pugging dungeons with some solo questing.
---
I'm confused about how you gave a qualitative answer to your own quantitative question. Was your inteded question "How will people who don't retain...?"
---
I can relate to this. I recently tried timing my own speedlevelling skills with a theme to my char names: https://imgur.com/gallery/D78VYQH
---
Nuke can refer to any of your damage spells, this guy was referring to frostbolt since he didn't understand that you were talking about aoe.
---
If you actually played you'd know that crit is borderline useless for a healer, it's overheal. 31 healing over 2 crit every day of the week. 
---
Sure if you want to be efficient you wouldn't prio them to every priest, but you came in with a bunch of misinformed comments about the pvp gear not being useful for raiding. 
---
Don't go misleading players when you know fuck all about the classes.
---
Okay once again, I am not responding to ANYTHING you have said. You could be completely correct for all I care, but my point still remains 100% logical. If you hate classic wow, and prefer retail, why are you on a classic wow subreddit to spread hate? I honestly feel bad for your family and anyone else that encounters you on a day to day basis, good luck to you.
---
You can create lesser wands prior to 10 - he probably just solo gathered mats to make one by level 10.
---
If you pool resources, someone can make wands for everyone sooner than 10 - especially if layering is terrible at launch and we are all overcrowded.

Well no, I'm acknowledging that you can't give a quantitative answer to the question I posed, so my answer was a tongue-in-cheek reference to begging for gold.
---
Can only reserve 3 names, how they going to get them all?
---
Is it fair for the inverse to be true? That's rather OP's entire point - there is spoon-feeding of memes and low effort posts.
---
If the answer is "just leave the sub" then that's really a terrible solution, at least in my eyes. The sub is clearly titled Classic WoW, and is referred to as the discussion forum for the game on both the retail WoW forum and in this sub's own description. It's not unreasonable to carry an expectation of becoming more informed about the subject matter for a specialized subreddit.
---
That‚Äôs how I feel about all the Vanilla zones in cataclysm.  It was so crazy how bad the old zones were ruined.  I‚Äôd have understood a sideways comment here and there about ‚Äúthis thing moved because of the cataclysm‚Äù or ‚Äúoh yeah, now you can take this path because of the cataclysm‚Äù, not half the zones replaced with full on CSI memes or A-team references.

If you are doing any higher level stuff I would love to see it, I have been running an Azeroth homebrew 5E campaign for about a year but at lvl 10 they're a well past Stocks.  They should be getting into ZG in the next few weeks though!
---
fantastic!
---
The only zone I like more post cata is desolace, I hated that place in vanilla(I still hate it, just a little bit less now)
---
Totally doable if you focus on the quest lines as soon as they are available without going over.
---
I guess your never planning to leave a city without a tank then.
---
I'm well aware they don't parry from behind.  The metrics aren't just about that.  They also land into the elites and trash and world mobs etc.  All seeing bonuses detrimental to the results.  It's not just limited to bosses. You don't always have a tank, unless you are the tank.  
---
Go back into your hole.
---
I don't know?
---
Tiny? How about guarding national secrets that could result in the deaths of millions if lost?
---
Nope. If they break the perimeter I have zero sympathy for whatever is done to them. Why? Because there are millions of other people‚Äôs lives at risk. Theirs ceases to matter the moment they willingly, knowingly cross that line.
---
Great question. I'd go to a subreddit for that. Perhaps r/classicwow. Surely they've got plenty of discussion posts about it. You won't have to wade through erroneous content to find it!

I main tanked MC, Ony, BWL, Naxx back in the day.  I started not long before TBC dropped, so my vanilla tanking was limited.  Main Tanked all through TBC and Lich King as a raid leader for a large guild and eventually forming my own raiding guild during late Lich King.  Dropped out during Cataclysm, came back during Pandaria and rolled a healing monk.  Played pretty solid through Legion, but lost interest after a few weeks of BFA.  Haven't played since, but with Classic, I'm looking to really get back into playing to fill that MMO itch I've had for years.
---
I have a lot of experience as a Prot Warrior, even leveling 1-60 100% prot Spec in vanilla, even though my guildies said I was crazy.  I've also spent a whole lot of time as a Disc/Holy Priest in TBC and later expansions, as well as a monk (this doesn't work so well in Classic).  I'd be willing to step into either a role as a tank or healer for Classic when it releases, as I enjoy both roles.
---
In addition, I've raided in nearly every other MMO that had raiding as an option both before and after WoW.  I'm not young, I have a good PC, I know how to hook up my microphone and have no issues talking clearly and loudly when needed to an entire raid.
---
I don't have a problem leading raids, if needed.
---
I have no other friends interested in Classic, so I've got no current guild/friend affiliations for server and/or faction.
---
Sure find a guild that are willing to carry the few meme specs (just like esfand did lul)
---
Oh, I see now.
---
Same thing I always say. Morrowind.
---
But will they still have chicken?
---
Don‚Äôt indulge people that are there solely for loot, there‚Äôs less raid loot to go around compared to later expansions. Don‚Äôt keep the whole guild waiting on one person that decides to get songflower on their own. 
---
Do try to maintain communication channels between guild members and the leadership, not JUST raiders. With 40 person raids every guild will have turn over. Do remind your guild members that the leadership is probably not consisting of professional leaders/managers when complaints inevitably arise. 
---
That‚Äôs the best I got, learned from watching the leaders in my guild on pservers.
---
&gt;I've seen a few people in the tests try to run away from a group of NPCs only to get cracked over the head from the moon and die because of this.
---
Oh wow, groups wiping to mobs?
---
Can't have that happening
---
This better be a multiboxing team and Snow White better be the main...
---
Having those seven other dwarves chasing you would make sense then.
---
Okay then. Well, when you are ready to have a discussion with the rest of the adults, you just let us know.
---
It's more slow than difficult.
---
Hey everyone! Now that I've finished up most of the generalized gearing guides (tanks, healers, casters, and rogues), I thought I should take care of one of the classes that really needs a phase 1 gearing guide - the Hunter.  
---
In this video ([and the linked written guide here](https://silvitesoltis.blogspot.com/2019/05/gear-your-hunter-fast-hunter-phase-1.html)), I went over what to do to get your hunter geared up as efficiently as possible upon hitting level 60 in phase 1. It's no pre-raid BiS guide (there's tons of those already), but it should help enough in the early days of Classic. Let me know what you think! ;)

As a Troll Priest you could run Ragefire Chasm pretty easily when you're only 10-12 range and hope for one to drop there. Failing that, if you are an Enchanter it's a quick run for chances at DE greens toward crafting your own.
---
In some cases, shadowmeld does allow you to be the aggressor. You're guaranteed the opening attack
---
No. But you have to discern between things you can and cannot change.
---
Can I change my access to Area 51? Nope. Can I change the government telling me lies? Nope. Can I research and study to vote for better candidates? Yep. Am I going to support the republican or democratic parties? Nope, that would defeat the purpose of voting for ‚Äúbetter‚Äù candidates.
---
VC for life!    DM is for the nuubs
---
Interesting thought, but not classic related.
---
Not everything. ‚ÄúThese guys will shoot you dead if you try to get in the gate‚Äù is one I generally put stock in.
---
You mean like OP's post here?
---
This is exactly what I was looking for like an hour ago!  I want to give warrior pvp a shot to see how I like the class in bgs on a certain Voldemort-esc server but setting up the action bars as someone who's never played the class has been a bit overwhelming, only overshadowed by the idea of trying to set up druid bars which seem even worse for someone who's hopping right in at 60 pvp to try it out.
---
I'm also curious about this. I'm fairly certain I'll spend a point on Holy Nova purely for grinding purposes (DM lasher farming, etc.).
---
It‚Äôs more of, NPCs should not be smacking you from 2x their distance as you try to run away. Think of a boss that moves slightly and suddenly he hits the healers who are way out of range. 
---
Yes if you run in and are standing there, sure due to a group of NPCs, but if your like 10m away and running away, why should they be given leeway?
---
#NoChanges
---
Yeah, I feel like part of what makes Classic WoW so great is that it allows for people to have a bad time. People can spend all their gold on nonsense and be poor if they want. They won't have as much fun, but they'll probably learn from it.    
---
I think Classic has a lot of lessons like that hidden in the game.
---
How is this downvoted?
---
I liked the furthering of the story in Duskwood. Sven Jorgen and all that.
---
Debatable for battlegrounds. Shadowmeld defending objectives or shadowmeld eating/drinking is a pretty useful tool
---
What is ignorant is the people in this thread that think owning something that costs 1000 bucks means you are rich.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KlLMlJ2tDkg
---
&gt; I guess some Europeans just don't realize how much distance matters for ping and how small Europe is.
---
Europe area: 10 180 000 km¬≤
---
US area: 9 834 000 km¬≤
---
Its more about shitty infrastructure and a slow adaptation away from dial up. Its not like servers were in one location in the US.
---
That's so cool. I've had so many people tell me they're running Azeroth campaigns, I'm jealous haha. ZG should be a blast to run!
---
I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs that much more difficult than in shadow spec.  You‚Äôre not doing ideally maximized raid DPS, but then you aren‚Äôt raiding.
---
It's not a new meta. Certain classes/specs underperformed in certain content in vanilla. Classic is not changing that.
---
"Play what you want and don't listen to the naysayers" leads people to believe they can realistically expect to raid as hybrid DPS or something. You are setting up false expectations and disappointment and wasting people's time.
---
People are passing around 30/0/21 spec like its some powerful secret. Realistically, it would be fine for raids on farm, but shamans are so mana inefficient without higher tier gear compared to other healers that you really need to go full resto on progression.
---
That's my point. TBC wasn't close after Naxx at all really. It was the same amount of time as Naxx after AQ. The wait for ZA after BT was much longer in TBC. The wait for WotlK after Sunwell was much longer. But guilds didn't fall apart at those times as nearly as much as during Naxx.   
---
The problems of raiding and guilds at the later end of Vanilla was not a content or timing issue. We know now you don't need 8 geared warriors for 4Horsemen. You don't need amazing dps for patchwerk or C'thun. We know it's not hard to get the resist gear for Huhuran or Saph. What is really hard is getting 40 players to show up for raids day after day and week after week. Keeping 40 players online and paying attention for hours at a time.
---
This thread is a throwback to reading threads when blizzard announced that TBC would give everyone 10 more talent points. That was a great time.
---
I'm working out daily so that's covered. That's a solid suggestion though!
---
So why has that time gap never affected any other final raid in an expansion?
---
We clearly disagree and that's fine. Cheers!
---
When people talk about DPS classes being better or worse, they tend to refer to their performance in endgame PvE content. If that was not the case, you would see a lot more people saying that hunter is the best DPS class in the game.
---
When it comes to endgame PvP content, the increased parry chance potentially decreases the DPS of all threatcapped characters. Worst case scenario, warriors, warlocks and potentially mages get weaker (rogues and hunters are unaffected). Best case scenario, your tank is good and the change won't affect anyone (more likely if you're Alliance).
---
What a good suggestion. Only problem is I've played and replayed this game for so many times that I am taking a break from it :) Thank you though!
---
If you care about 1v1 most go dwarf, if you're interested in BGs then nelf is more useful.

I've played most aRPGs, but haven't touched Grim Dawn. How does it compare to other similar games?

Too soon

I'm glad I'm not the only one that gets to druid and cant decide how to work in a clever CLASS related name and move to something cow related instead. xD

Th continuations generally weren‚Äôt bad where they were, because there was a lot of unresolved stuff in cataclysm.

Too bad the centaur pariah never got brought up again, given his quest and the conclusion of maraudon was ‚Äúmaybe the centaurs aren‚Äôt cursed to be dicks forever‚Äù.

Watersheep better not be taken for my mage alt...
---
Imagine having to ignore the hardest difficulty setting of a game so you can say it's easy
---
Earlier the better. So if you can pool resources with someone, do that. I expect there will be people doing that and then selling wands near the starter areas. It's just that good for priests, probably for other casters too.
---
"They can't stop all of us." üòÇ
---
Happened all the time in vanilla. Except oftentimes you'd get a hybrid outdpsing pure dps specs because that's just how things were back then

ATHENE best paladin in the world
---
Nobody said owning something worth $1,000 makes you rich. 
---
Everybody, however, has been saying that acting like dropping $2,500 on something as unimportant as a gaming desktop if pretty hard for the average financially independent adult. There are almost always way more important and way more necessary expenses that you will have to save for.
---
Now, if you‚Äôre making a solid income and you drop the money on a crazy expensive desktop because you want it? That‚Äôs not a problem at all. 
---
The problem is acting like it‚Äôs just this casual and simple act anyone can do on a whim. That‚Äôs ignorant as hell.
---
A civil discussion in which people toss intellectually dishonest evidence to support a very feels vs. reals argument?  I'm good.  Also good without you virtue-signalling waste of time.
---
Keep in mind you lose all your rage (although you get 10 back from furor) since you shifted in and out
---
For PvP sure
---
True it's not Classic related but I was reading a lot of Classic+ posts/ideas. That's where these thoughts came from. 
---
Some sort of Classic+ idea that doesn't really introduce anything new, just a weird twist on racial abilities.
---
You‚Äôre so close to the right answer, but you missed it somehow.
---
Today is the last day of beta. There has been 5 blue post from blizzard
---
True that, but it beats not being able to use potions or items in form at all. Also, wolfshead helm.
---
Eyebear, Eyeshift, and Eyemarkofthewild were all taken. I considered Eyenervate.
---
its not a bug, blizz said so! get over it! no changes!
---
In my guild on a recent pserver, we had some guild leaders lead at least one Dire Maul tribute run so people could get those buffs if they wanted.  Once a month we would attempt ‚Äúspeed runs‚Äù only trying to beat our own times. That‚Äôs when we required players to be prepared to get world buffs together. It was a nice balance of tryhard/casual in the context of world buffs
---
I know reading is hard, but both the person you replied to and myself talked about saving (the process of accumulating over time) money. Not just buying it on a whim.
---
If you want to define what this sub is for, maybe go be a mod?  There are other/better places for this info, which OP has admitted they were ignorant of.  Move on
---
AFK Summer is a pretty decent game.  I'm almost done rebuilding my deck, just bottled my latest batch of home brewed beer, have a project car in the garage that needs a bunch of wet sanding and polishing after I did a shit job of the paint, and might be picking up another project car soon if the guy ever responds.
---
Yes. It is itself a post that contributes the problem it is seeking to address. That's rather the point, isn't it? People are downvoting and arguing against stronger moderation because they might like the memes. But then there is content *they* don't like, such as meta discussions on moderation, and now suddenly the posts are an issue. The curtains are drawn, and the point is revealed.
---
Ya M&amp;B is great I have like 800 hours I think. Is there a genre your're interested in atm? RTS FPS or something else
---
Feline swiftness first
---
Then sharpened claws, 6% crit while leveling will make a big difference long term
---
I am then going for Omen
---
Then finally furor
---
Then finish off feral tree
---
It IS unreasonable to expect a certain subset of content when the description of the sub clearly indicates that it includes anything pertaining to classic WoW. That includes memes, WoW classic-themed battle stations, etc... If you‚Äôre concerned with bugs in particular like OP, is it really THAT onerous to do your own homework to find the information you‚Äôre looking for??
---
Need on everything and you're done.
---
You understand it‚Äôs a joke right?
---
Nice! I‚Äôm running my son and his friends through a one off in a few weeks, I was going to just pull everything from shadowfang keep. Great minds buddy!
---
Good job ruining your friend's plan.
---
&gt; weaver your wand hits and staff autoattacks. Easy life.
---
How does this work mechanically? I thought wand stopped autofiring when you attacked.
---
Dang that sucks, i still own my original Naga from probably 2006/07.  Works perfect still
---
I see what you‚Äôre saying, but I think your still missing my point. In general most of the semi hardcore guilds and above had BWL on farm well before AQ40 released. 
---
That was not the case for AQ40 when Naxx released. Quite a few semi hardcore guilds were still working through twins and Cthun.  
---
So a unique combination of burn out, announcement of TBC, and the feeling of difficulties getting your entire raid geared for Naxx when AQ40 wasn‚Äôt even on farm yet multiplied by the horror stories we received from the few guilds that did start naxx progression pushed a lot of guilds to just packing up the hardcore raiding scene and going more casual. My guild did this and many, many, many other guilds did as well. 
---
I think there was just, at the time, a unique combination of events at that time that made naxx not only less approachable, but less desirable as well. 
---
At the time the thought of farming more random +resist gear after the AQ40 debacle really made a bunch of people kinda pissed - at least that was the consensus amongst the tier of guilds I was part of. 
---
You‚Äôre not wrong - the difficulty at this point will just be player attendance for sure - but back then, different animal imo.
---
I'm open to anything (I like shooters, rpgs, turnbased games). But my favorite genre at the moment is storybased walkingsims (Oxenfree, Night in the Woods, The Lions Song). Sadly I've played most of them. Battlebrothers is a awesome game, finding something like that would be cool.
---
becouse ppl did MC with old talents, bad stats gear and no spell damage gear for example, classic MC is going to be a joke compared with vanilla wow when it launched
---
 I was considering rolling a priest for awhile. The strategy I would go for in regards to smooth leveling would be to not rush it in the beginning to setup a smooth leveling experience.
---
 So I would first roll my bank alt, probably a warlock since they are pretty powerful with the imp early on. Buy a minimum amount of skills for that warlock to save money. A bank alt should be level 5 so you can learn disenchanting but I might level that warlock up to like 7, grinding mobs, reason being to earn silver.
---
 Then you roll the priest, finish starter zone, you are level 5. Move out to the first mailbox. The silver you got with the warlock bank alt should be enough to buy a lesser magic wand you can mail to the priest( for sure there are people who have rushed enchanting in order to sell lesser magic wands in the AH by this point).
---
I came here to suggest the same
---
You'll able able to farm DME lashers solo with holy nova, or do many bosses with a warrior where one of you have mining to gather thorium. You're also a good class for gathering herbs/ores, as you have shields and fear to gather if a mob aggros, rather than needing to kill them first then gather.
---
Well that's a shame. 149,000 people gunna taste the steel of my axe
---
&gt; As far as I understood its supposed to be for the first weeks and they were expecting to have to use this layering system only on the starting areas
---
You're operating off old information, or you misunderstand completely.  Two main points: 1) Layering will not be "only in teh starting areas"  Layering shards an entire continent at once.  NOT zone-by-zone.  2) They've said they hope it will be for the first few weeks only, but that they are willing to use it up until the end of Phase 1, and that it would be gone forever *at the latest* when Phase 2 starts.
---
Then r/classicwowplus would be the place to post this. Still doesnt really fit with wow classic.
---
And before you mention other classic+ posts, most of those are discussing the transition or potential development of classic wow into classic+ as a game/expansion, not potential classic+ content ideas.
---
Thank you for elaborating! So just to doublecheck, in GD you can respec your talents?
---
I played hunter in TBC, which is when I first started playing. I want to roll it again, but am having doubts and am contemplating on rogue or mage. 
---
Can I trouble you to sell me on hunter. I promise you can get first dibs on all the gear before me.
---
I doubt it. Everyone I know playing will be veterans from real vanilla. Not pirates
---
Should've kept it.  It seems like it would have worked well with their faction grinds if tweak'd correctly.  Imagine becoming such an outlawed Human or Orc, that you become favorable to the opposite faction? Not unlike how the Bloodsail Buccaneers...
---
Hell, given enough time, you could have an entire mode where a raid team protects a dungeon/raid from an invasion.  So much potential and scrapped because they didn't know how to fix who actually gets credit for attacking/initiating a DK.
---
I check it every month but unfortunately I think the server I played on wasnt very popular so while i'm seeing your overall population of Vanillafriends increasing by hundreds, my particular server gets bumps of maybe 3-4 people and it's names I dont recall.         
---
            
---
I think youve created a pretty amazing thing though, i'd give anything to talk to my Vanilla guildies just one more time.
---
That‚Äôs fucking sick. Sell me one
---
I did not know that was a thing. Thank you.
---
I shift a lot in dungeons.  I also shift between pulls to either regen my mana or to pull from range.
---
I never suggested it was an issue for me. I know where I can go if I need to get more information. That I know it's not this subreddit *is* an indication of an issue, but that's something else.
---
For my part, I like all the content that lets us hang out and have fun. The memes and battlestations can be fun. I think there is a point of diminishing returns on them though when they start to dominate and crowd all of the other posts out.
---
How that should be balanced is beyond me. But I'll pop in on the discussion of it, certainly.
---
Shadowfang is an awesome dungeon as well! I'd love to hear how it goes.
---
It refers to high movement speeds, which for example mounted players have.
---
WHY TAUREN, beware Tauren are hated by every \*true\* horde player. They are the most non-horde race there is, they are despicable. Most Tauren players have small brains. All Tauren players have compensation needs. Look how they jump, look how they wiggle with a 2h sword. Tauren warrior's backpedal irl. 
---
You picked the most asthetically pleasing female warrior and instead want to chose THE WORST (right after Gnomes). Source: True Horde Orc Warrior in Vanilla.

---
So
---
15% extra Stam would be cool for SM/Ruin for pvp. But for pve.. I agree not much there
---
1. Based on tests, imps are the most efficient leveling pets
---
2. Lowering you pet cast time, especially with a cooldown, simply does not matter much for PvE compared to what you get in the affliction tree.
---
You can just heal MC as shadow tbh. Harder raids will require a healing apex but phase 1 won't
---
Neat! Thanks!
---
It's a lot easier to pick stuff up if I switch to bear and immediately have rage.
---
Implying he'll reservet any of these basic ass names in time
---
If my internet wasn‚Äôt down I could check now on a Pserver but I‚Äôm 90% sure you are correct
---
It gives a specific example of what it means. They probably should provide more info though to make sure there's no ambiguity.
---
nice
---
Meh. Just have the 3 or 4 or whatever people leveling a single character all connect to a VM the account's been playing on for months now. Blizzard won't have a clue.
---
Yep, there's someone that does it for you when you use these reagents which drop from mobs. It's neat that there are almost endless reagents to modify your weapons/gear to add various bonuses and further customize what you have going. It's also nice that the storage gets bigger and bigger as you go too - adding entire Tabs/Pages.
---
Have you ever considered that you're being ignorant? He never said how long it took to save for it which obviously is a huge factor to consider. I spent years saving up for my first build and I have two kids.
---
!remindme 44 days
---
My suggestion would be to have a mmo mouse that has 12 buttons on the side. Combine that with the foot switch someone recommend and you should be set. You can do all movement just by turning the camera with right click drag and then clicking both to run forward. I do 99% of my movement, outside of pvp strafing, by right click and having auto run set to click mouse wheel. 
---
I think for classic u wont really need more than 12 buttons until u try out pvp. Raiding is, for the most part, one button spam.
---
The one big question left is (pardon me I forget the names at the moment) but I definitely spend my first 5 points reducing the cost of most major abilities.  My question is where to spend the next 5 points:  into the demo roar + ferocious bite talent, or into the prowl level + bear threat talent.
---
Yeah, I've had rogues that just vanished and waited for my 30 second Sac bubble to wear off.  Or I think he sapped me somehow.  He just sat down and waited until my bubble wore off, then re-engaged.  I distinctly remember that, but can sap go through the VW shield?
---
Warcraft 3 perhaps?
---
Druids would be able to upgrade from 1/29/21 to 4/31/21 I guess...
---
He's a cult leader or something nowadays. Been committing a lot of fraud, too, scamming people into paying for a worthless crypto currency to enrich himself, or something like that

I picked up and played WC2 and WC3 in preparation to classic. Great games.
---
&gt; Deep Wounds after the first 15 seconds, **screen cap it** then feel free to rupture
---
man the real lpt is always in the comments
---
From my experience with launches is that when you are speed leveling the first 5-10 hours are delayed but after that it's smooth sailing when you are leveling as fast as this guy is. Those 5-10 hours maybe costs you at max 3-4 hours in speed.
---
This is actually me :D I did quite a few mistakes doing this run (becuase of diffrences between beta &amp; private) from 39-40 i lost 1 hour because i changed my route to get a faster 40 time (was way slower, since mobs were to high level)
---
Pretty sure i can do this in 40 hours pretty eaisly which would make it a 100 hour run. Also my goal is to get 4 days to 4days 4hours.
---
I personally think that this route as a hunter would be a 34 hour run aswell and with some improvement to make it more hunter specific i think u can do it in 33 hours.
---
The biggest time save from hunter compared to rogue is 1-30 however, u can get 16h30m to 30 (5¬Ω hour faster then what i did this run) and i did a lot of mistakes 30-40 (lost around 3 hours from mistakes since i didn't pratice 30-40 enough) on top of this a hunter should be able to do 1-2 hours faster then what a rogue can do. (Rogue gets faster at 30 because of blade flurry, so the time diffrence is not as much based on faster farming anymore like it is early game, but instead aspect of cheetah)
---
That sounds like a very convenient system. I'm going to take a look at this game. Thank you so much!
---
Yeah, you should just take the L here. I understand you are making a generalization but on Bear tanks you are just really not educated. 
---
You say that there's only 1/40 spots for a Feral druid, and while that is true, Druid is the least played class by far. Most guilds only have room for 2-3 druids per raid PERIOD. So you still have a pretty good shot at getting a raid slot, especially considering how unpopular Bear druids are.
---
This makes me  want to pick up magic again ughh too much nostalgia in one picture
---
Im american so don't know, but sounds like some random british isles accent
---
Just curious, do you bring low Item level people to your mythic plus raids?
---
If you can afford 2-3k a month, you are way better off than most, yes.
---
You‚Äôre probably fun at parties
---
You have to manually keep spamming them, as the wand attacks every 1.5 sec and the staff at whatever speed it is. So you can weave the melee hit every other shot. Personal opinion: not worth it, but some people like to get their carpal tunnel early.
---
OP af
---
Didn‚Äôt think about buying a wand, we will have to see how the early AH works out. If it is good, probably will ty this strat. Ty!
---
Nice!
---
What is a BRD lava run guys?
---
I'm also curious of where Fatphil is these days, guess i'll never know...
---
I was 2600 in TBC playing druid/warlock and watching people on Reddit talk about PVP is always hilarious.
---
That's why the Germans invented the umlaut
---
lasher farming is inflated on pservers.
---
Apex, Overwatch, Terraria, Rocket League are my favorite
---
it wont require it but your guild in all likely hood will want you in healing spec
---
So now i am confused. Wowhead pulls from the beta and is wrong but ClassicDB from the pservers is correct?
---
10/10
---
Unstable footing you‚Äôve chosen to make a stand on my friend!
---
This is very true. The shitposts have died down a bit. Well done.
---
I don't disagree that the U.S. was slow to move to better forms of network in outlying areas, but most major cities were on Curve with EU. The problem with the U.S. is that no servers for any game are centrally located due to how U.S. population is concentrated on the coasts, which means it is very easy to be 1500 miles from the closest server. It is like comparing EU internet to South Korea internet and saying "probably a salty European who thinks it was standard to have over 30 ping because he had it."
---
Great answer. It will save a ton of time if you coordinate 1 person to craft all the wands for a group. Both LMW and GMW are amazing for their level. If you can pool resources to get an enchanted started it‚Äôs probably worth it in overall man hours saved (will slow down the crafter slightly).
---
Awesome.  Where did you get it?
---
Druids have a MUCH higher health pool and armor (they can easily reach armor cap which is a 75% damage reduction). In addition, you have 4 tanks, that means 1 for Nightfall and 1 for Shatter. Ferals can also run HotW meaning they can be flexible and heal/decurse on fights where they aren't needed and become really valuable later in the game when you need 8 geared tanks and realize you've just been sharding all that feral tank gear.
---
There are plenty of competitive pserver guilds who run a feral tank purely for the ease of gearing and flexibility it provides. You are just clearly misinformed.
---
If they were by themselves. Pair a druid with an SL SL and they could 2v4
---
Yeah it's hideous enough upgrading a website into a newer framework. What they had to do for Classic WoW would be quite the undertaking. There must have been a *lot* of discussions on if it was worth it, following if it was even possible in the first place.
---
 Blizz has posted on the classic forum that leeway only applies to pvp, this is the way it is in beta too. 
---
Based on your response it‚Äôs not clear that you understand what leeway is or it‚Äôs intended purpose.
---
I guess when you have r10 as your objective it's ok, but yeah I don't think I could handle this to r13+.
---
It's not spamming... it's basically the same idea as hunters weaving aimed shots between auto shots. The staff is a real slow weapon to swing, so you just wand while the auto-attack cooldown goes.
---
&gt; See this. Right here. This miniature essay where you feel the need to respond to things point by point because someone challenged you on something or had a negative view on ISboxer.

The miniature essays are how I like to respond, and I feel I can better get my point across by typing it out the way that I do.  Breaking things down point by point is how conversations are had, and while you do it without quoting any of my reply, I would rather provide the quote for what I'm responding to.  I like to do this because: 1) it helps hone in on the section of a post I'm responding to, and 2) if the person I am responding to deletes their post, there is some remaining context.
---
&gt; Why would I ask for your help?
---
Based on your replies to me here in this thread, especially this third one, please don't ask for my help.
---
&gt; I don‚Äôt have time to go sifting through the forums for every time you decided ‚Äúthis doesn‚Äôt deserve its own thread‚Äù, and I obviously am not privy to anything you‚Äôve edited or deleted or whatever else only you as a moderator would have access to.
---
Every post on dual-boxing.com that is edited, it's displayed as such at the bottom of the post, which includes the person who last edited it, as well as the (optional) reason for doing so.  When I edit someone's post, I always put the reason, so that the poster knows why their post was edited.
---
However, on the ISBoxer forums, which uses phpBB and not vBulletin, an edit is not displayed by default, and rarely does anyone take the time to put one in because rarely do posts on that forum get moderated.  If anything, our first response to an individual will usually include any corrections they can make to their posting behavior when posting a thread in the future.
---
&gt; They whole reason I avoid the site now is because you treat it like your own personal little community. And that‚Äôs fine, I really don‚Äôt care because there are plenty of other places I can hang out on the Internet where I don‚Äôt have to put up with you.
---
I'm not sure what to say to this, but in case there was any confusion, I don't own either of the sites being discussed, and I'm just a moderator.  There are also plenty of times where I specifically don't respond to threads because I'd rather let others in the community respond first, even though I may have something to say.
---
&gt; Apparently we only crossed paths here because I had the audacity to say ISboxer isn‚Äôt the best thing ever. Better jump on top of that with a 3 point essay.
---
I don't care if you like ISBoxer or not, but the one reason you gave for giving up on the program was because you couldn't use one key on your keyboard. 
---
 That seemed, as I said, drastic, and so I responded with my take on the situation.
---
However, as has now been revealed, you seem to have a personal vendetta against me, and yet I don't know who you are.  You have a very hostile attitude toward me, yet I don't know why, and when I ask, you brush it off as if it isn't worth your time to explain.  You've got the time to criticize the way that I moderate multiple forums, yet you're not willing to take the time to back those statements up.
---
Again, I'll reiterate that I've been using ISBoxer for over ten years now, and supporting it, through both text and video, for the vast majority of those.  For someone who is being painted as such a shitty, unlikable person, it's odd that I'd stick around to do what I do, for as long as I have.  I'm either making bank from creating videos and providing daily support to people, or I actually like the concept of multiboxing, the playstyle itself, and the challenge it brings, as well as the real life friends that I've made through the community that has formed around it over the past ten years that I have been a part of it.
---
Finally, this isn't the first time my actions, as a moderator, have been challenged, and it certainly won't be the last.  So, if you, or anyone else, have issues with the way that I moderate either forum, then feel free to bring up your discrepancies with Lax because he's the boss-man.

I'd prefer just one, large monitor? lol

I did a dry run and was able to grind linen cloth in tirisfal killing gnolls from 4.5 to level 7 to craft my wand. I could of perhaps done it half a level sooner if I had better RNG with lesser magic essences.
---
Avoid an elitist guild and all these problems go away.
---
Not really, all you need is taunt and/or faerie fire and after 1 melee hit you'll have rage.
---
Now you know me, and I'm a pirate. My old retail friends from TBC/Cata/WotLK/MoP 3v3s and RBGs are also now pirates and will be coming back.
---
No, you're dead wrong. Blizzard has said no such things and melee leeway is a mechanic in both PVE and PVP. It's why all the pserver Warriors think hamstring kiting isn't going to work in Classic.
---
It's not a huge difference imo, escape artist, stone form, fearward, instant heal racials from human+dwarf make it pretty close. Also paladins are stronger than shamans in PvP.
---
I thought about doing the same in the past but them I looked at the maps and they are too linear to my taste. Some dungeons can be unlinearized and become great like Shadowfang Keep (one of the best WoW dungeons IMO) but others like Ragefire Chasm are nearly impossible.
---
It is a pity Cataclysm destroyed some non-linear dungeons like Sunken Temple.
---
Drops in a pond. On pirate servers there are only pirates but come classic they will be a small population and one that won't last long either.
---

Dearest Mirai,

While our interaction has been a lovely experience, I regret to inform you I must cut our correspondence short.  Your letters have become too difficult to read in these trying times, and I have other matters that require my attention.  
---
I shall give you the satisfaction of the last word, for your last response was too long, and I must admit I did not read it.  I can only hope that next you find yourself fornicating yourself with a hot iron poker, you think of me and recall that brief moment of passion we shared.
---
Truly Yours,

Beth
---
As a healer, you have better options than solo grinding. get a partner or 2 and work with that efficiency in mind.
---
No problem. Buying it is the way to go I feel. Like I wrote you are going to have people who rushes enchanting very fast just to sell wands. Not worth the trouble doing it yourself. Can't imagine the level 5 wand will be sold at more than like 15 silver or so which is achievable leveling up the bank alt like I described. The price will no doubt go up but at first they can't price them higher since people don't have money.
---
Definitely a good thing to note. Didn't know about that. Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs literally the opposite. They nerfed lashers on private servers.
---
43 hours isn't slow lol. Some of the best classes only best it by a few hours.
---
Even Stupider Mage Tricks (dat music tho), Vurtne 1, Pat PvP, Grim Total Annihilation, and Illegal Danish: Super Snacks.
---
They have already added controls to limit this and the additional resources will be needed to feed a higher server population than a Vanilla server held. The no lifers will always get an advantage, they do in current wow, they will in Classic too. That is why they no life, but the thing in classic is there will be no gold on the market when it launches and then the values of stuff will be minimal. Yes they may be able to farm enough mats for the first tier of raiding but that is a really not much as the big thing they will have to farm is a drop(elemental fire) and they will be competing with leveling players for tags(just like in Vanilla)
---
That's actually substantially more than I thought it would cost.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôve watched a bit too much black mirror.
---
I don't know which one is correct if either of them is. But I'd lean towards trusting classic wowhead over ClassicDB.
---
I know 43 hours isn't slow (i'm the guy that did the run)
---
but i'm just saying a priest can do 43 hours aswell :p
---
Eh ya probably but it was more common in vanilla than you think. Spending 25 hours a week staring at a screen full of hp bars. You either find a way to have fun or go crazy. No raid leader ever really cared in MC. The adults (I was in high school at the time) weren't allowed to show up to MC sober! Drunk MC is best MC!

8 lower is almost two levels lower.

---
Nice! Out of curiosity which talent order are you doing? Rushing Riposte into blade flurry?
---
The Rock and Kevin Hart could be gnome
---
1 melee hit is often not enough for an ability.  Taunt and FFF can miss.
---
People say that but I've not seen it is kind of the point. You ask 10 people to rank the fastest leveling classes and you'll get 10 different orders. Till we actually get solo speed leveling from every class it's just opinions :) gratz by the way.
---
it was super common yeah, some folks literally stood there lol
---
Put what you need in the guild MotD and mention it on on disc at the beginning and end of the raid.
---
Hmmm. I'm going to have to pop on an eyepatch and yarr on over to those unmentionable places and test that out.
---
That would be awesome XD Imagine The Rock punting him.
---
Yeah anyone who doesn't think warlocks were insanely broken in TBC either only ran around thinking they were doing something useful in BGs or not playing at that high of a level in arena. Warlocks and Druids were by far the best PVP classes in TBC.
---
Nah the supreme was double shockadin. No bad match ups because of the meta's. Warlock pets get roasted when theys two pallys.
---
I leveled a priest back in vanilla and stopped around level 25 because they seemed impossible to level. Most of that was because I didn't know what wands were. I always was in awe of level 60 priests because I thought they had the hardest grind of them all. It's like playing a rogue where you have to auto attack, gotta get that free source of damage somehow.
---
As a veteran, yes, the security forces at area 51 will almost certainly celebrate their victory with chicken a.k.a "tendies"

---
Boss party chance *does* affect the DPS of melee classes in raids (well all classes technically).  Not for the reason that most people think (i.e. the boss parryign the melee more) because as any actual raider knows the melee isn't in front of the boss.  The reason that boss parry reduces dps of classes in raids is because the *tank* gets parried more and thus does less threat.  This lowers the threat ceiling, and thus dps, of your entire raid.  Warlocks and warriors will be particularly hard hit by this because they do lots of threat and don't have aggro drops outside of soulstone.
---

Yes, unfortunately the Dev's like Kevin Jordan were poor with the class design and didn't think buffing the meme specs until TBC was needed. He even said it on a podcast regarding how useless Ret was at 60 that he regretted it later and it was his biggest class failure in Classic. During live he said they were ok with how the Class (holy spec ofc) was being invited to group content ie 5 mans and mostly raiding so they were "ok" with having a bad spec. They literally through out Elemental, Balance, Enhancement, Retribution, Shadow etc in the trash and those loyal players were stuck being 1/3rd productive as their counterparts. He said the goal was to have hybrids do a high % of pures productivity but still behind ofc due to the hybrid tax. But in reality how it ended up was the hybrid dps specs were so bad that their dps was double or even tripled by pure dps classes which meant they were completely useless even with the buffs they brought to their parties as it would result in net raid dps loss they were literally a burden to a raid unless you had no other dps options to choose.

You realize what phasing is right. Phasing is the world changing after completing a quest or for an event. Non automated layering does nothing to solve issues, especially the one when your friend is in a group on a full layer, you are expecting everyone to log out and log back into a layer when that can happen within the game.....IT IS NO LONGER 1998, we have the technology to make it work.
---
Lol man layering isn‚Äôt for launch it‚Äôs for long term server health.
---
It gives you the strongest PVP spec (SL) and the strongest PVE spec (DS) all in one package.  While it wouldn't really change anything in either scenario, combined it would be a huge QOL increase.  Sure, you dont need to respecc for SM ruin either, but this is just better.
---
Not possible, you are asking for sharding.
---
Amen.
---
People who call retail a single player game either never played it or couldn‚Äôt handle the difficulty. They don‚Äôt want to hear that raiding content is top notch. I enjoy vanilla/tbc much more but I‚Äôll admit that raiding in current wow is the best in the biz.
---
you are asking for sharding, you had that opportunity, they came up with a new solution that handles it better and keeps zone continuity.
---
Amen!

I wish I could fire them off with you. Hope you enjoyed.

Classic Wowhead shouldn't be wrong, and if it is it will quickly be updated with correct information.  
---
ClassicDB is hit-or-miss, it can be right but there's no certainty.
---
It's most likely going to be up for around 150-200g , if you can get your hands on it early on in phase 1 it's worth getting it imo. But as soon as DM releases it's not worth paying that much anymore, better just getting unyielding maul.
---
I thought most guilds go PI once you start getting a little bit of gear?
---
Instead of clearing the whole path through the dungeon (and BRD is a HUGE dungeon), you can jump down into the lava and run along the edge without taking damage until you end up between Emperor and the MC zone portal.

For a challenge, he should do the track from SFK/MC: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6lnwYWppkbo
---
alternating 6/8 7/8 (possibly 13/8?) would be interesting to see him pull off
---
The effect is disorient yes, it breaks on damage, but it is a stun for talent purposes (orc racial/priest talent etc).
---
Awesome video. I switched to warrior years ago for pservers and went through each of those styles of keybinds in order XD
---
Landed on macro keybinds like you, the aesthetic is the nicest to me as well
---
Totally bad idea. There is  a reason no one uses wyvern. It's a shit spell which can be taken off by almost any kind of dispel. YOu need to be out of combat to use it. It has shit dmg. It has shit cooldown. Everything about it is terrible. It's situationally VERY specific cases good for open world pvpers but even they find shitton more useful stuff in hunter talents. Sry bro, many have tried to make that spell work but... it sucks.
---
Instead you can use automation and dynamic layers and it is all happened at the same time with great opportunity to develop community between layers. The idea of merging is 1000X worse IMO, you take 2 communities with 2 different dynamics and force them to work together. What happens if you go from the #1 guild to #6 and now are having your players poached and no longer getting a steady stream of App's. THis could kill a guild and peoples experience in a game. This happened when they did cross realm joined servers back in the day and would happen again if you do this. Terrible IDEA.
---
You should have seen how many shots he did bro.
---
I believe that Ion mentioned that they were considering putting in pre-nerf C'thun, just to give players the opportunity to experience that. If this actually happens, C'thun has a good shot at outliving Ragnaros.
---
Tailoring has absolutely nothing to do with making a wand.  You can level tailoring and then disenchant those items to level enchanting.
---
Good luck getting any of those names. The same dudes that sell names in other communities are gonna be all over classic.
---
Really, only melee "needs" to hit r14. The caster r14 weps are kinda booty.

---
You're totally right, if it was going to be a spec you solo farm with as well I'd definitely take those talents, honestly though if anyone ever asks me I recommend they level an alt to farm with. After having played druid for several years I can honestly say their farming, outside of gathering, is pretty buttcheeks imo. Excellent points.
---
TIL some people consider WC a maze.
---
Put your first 10 talents in spirit tap and wand. Rest are free. I levelled on nost with 5 points in shadow, and that was fine. My retail priest, created in tbc, didn't have shadow points until wrath came along and we respecced for levelling.

Laintime and Vurtne and Happyminti are all top-notch in terms of World PvP.
---
Yeah that wand looks amazing. I will definitely try and get it as soon as I can, ty for all the tips
---
I‚Äôm sure there were just as many groups on those servers doing it the way I have said.
---
Seriously, it‚Äôs not that unreasonable. Do you just enjoy giving people the chance to roll need on a valuable BoE when everyone else greeds?
---
My experience comes from reaching gladiator.
---
Not entirely tbh. With a falsk of distilled wisdom on, innervate and rotating my mana pots/runes at the most optimal time I could cast starfire for 3 minutes straight without going oom. After a moonkin becomes tier 2 equiv geared he becomes a prime target for extra innervates as well. If your guild has bwl on farm tossing innervates on your big dick crit chicken is great overall raid dps increase.
---
&gt;On the other hand, if we remove layering, we get possible launch issues of unknown significance, ironically very similar to vanilla.  
---
&gt;Obviously no one wants launch issues or merges, but if they happen it's not a big deal, since they were in vanilla 
---
Blizzard has never done a server merge.......EVER. But nice try.
---
DO IT

Lightning bolt followed by an 100% crit free chain lightning followed by by an instant lightning bolt....
---
My memory of shadowmeld was that its pretty easy to spot. I guess Im wrong, though, given the responses here already.
---
dat female frontflip
---
the joke is you could play moonkin like a typing game and just type "/cast starfire" instead of pressing the key and it would make the gameplay actually engaging because every time you misspell it you lose 45 dps xd
---
You *can* of course go DPS as an Elemental Shaman, the thing is you will underperform and not be sought after.  
---
If you want to play ele, by all means do. But this time around it is more widely known which classes &amp; specs are 'bad' and it might be hard getting a spot...
---
People fail.  Which makes me wonder if you have actually played Vanilla if you don't know that.
---
we already have one guy that, alliance streamer called hydro look it up ;) He gets these times aswell
---
Eh, it's XP and it's easy to not get lost.
---
There was a streamer a while back that did nearly 96 hours leveling from like 1-100 in a single run without heirlooms or grouping. Blizzard banned him towards the end of the run despite it all being live streamed.
---
This is good news. Mages feel so broken on pservers.
---
I rush hit &gt; riposte &gt; respec 30 for bladeflurry (i have 2 points in the crit one in other talent, so i respec for bladeflurry at 30, otherwise i get it 32)
---
Warlocks would definitely feel obliged to spec SL/SL for PvP, so you lose the QOL.
---
...what? Any rogue that can use talent points already has stealth.
---
It‚Äôs pretty bad, it‚Äôs 26% spread over the entire channel
---
Sorry, female Tauren can't reach as far.
---
Not sure if it will be the same but these class quest items weren‚Äôt available until BWL patch, or Phase 3. The best alternative available is the DM Royal Seal trinket that will be available Phase 2.
---
And even if you‚Äôre horde, I haven‚Äôt seen a definitive answer if the Rune of the Guard captain will be available at launch. So technically, yes it is hunter BiS until one of these alternatives comes out.
---
That being said, I wouldn‚Äôt take it over a rogue or warrior.  It‚Äôs far more useful for them, for far longer, and that‚Äôs painfully obvious.  Any hunter who decides to roll on it over them deserves the huntard title.
---
They have a shorter melee range, but yeah, basically unicorns.
---
I'm fucking disgusted that the chain of comments commenting on this comment chain has gotten this long üò§

&gt;Relatively certain no cross realm battlegrounds in Classic.

---
But not every class has a Shamab 0 and 0.5 :)
---
It's 2019 dude, pallys are the best healer in vanilla by a longshot lol
---
A few people did it early on but everyone learnt pretty quickly to not to. 
---
Do you enjoy giving everyone a chance to stab you in the face while walking around? If not why don't you wear face armor everywhere you go?
---
Because people have learnt that it's not okay to stab people in the face randomly. Same thing people learnt not to ninja.
---
Or just take the path of least resistance and raid heal your way to full t2 and spec ele when you have a few days to pvp. I‚Äôm sure ele sham will be all over the place.
---
Well 26% but ye, that's correct. However you do need to spend 2 points in another talent in order to pick this one, so it's not really worth picking up afaik. It has its uses in some situations though such as when killing big trash packs in raids.
---
Anyone here who streams it? Whats your twitch name?
---
I‚Äôve had my NAGA since wotlk and it‚Äôs still running just fine.
---
Of course anyone maining a class would be glad to hear about unwarranted buffs that detour away from the 1.12 reference client, but thankfully that's not going to happen.
---
This'll be the third go, but yeah, we'll be doing a new one that'll launch in a couple weeks probably, and end at least a week or two before launch day.
---
For single-target healing yeah. But I also don't play Alliance, so the only thing that Paladins have to offer me are Blessings for speedruns.
---
Pally doesnt use 1h melee weapons other than caster weapons
---
Shaman cannot use swords

There are no high level 1h swords with hunter stats other than Dal Rends

Its situational-stone form is amazing against rogues; the ability to remove poisons such as crippling poison and blind is a game changer. 
---
Shadowmeld is great when used properly-when paired with a cat that has prowl, its a great tool both offensively and defensively. Its great when you're guarding a flag/base in wsg/ab. Stay shadowmelded, send in your pet, most people will react by using their "ohh crap" button (mages-frost nova, priest-fear) and you have an advantage right away.
---
World pvp scenarios-are you about to get ganked? Shadowmeld and get the jump on your opponent.
---
It really is personal preference in the end-what are you happy having at your screen while you are playing the game?
---
Don't put people's real names on the roster. You don't want that confusion when you're raiding and using voice comms.  
---
What the hell is a Herald? Is this an RP guild?
---
If warriors want a 2 hander for  pvp they should pvp, I don't see why a ret pally shouldn't have priority or equal roll, as long as the ret pally is doing his job (which is dispelling and cleansing and buffing)
---
We can play a game. Tell me any rogue move and I will tell you how a mage can counter it.
---
Sidenote: played both @60
---
I hope they do random crazy shit like this in Classic. Give us a week with 56/61 talent points. Give us a week with TBC prepatch talents. Give us a week of OG Alterac Valley. Give us a corrupted blood event.
---
SoupaSoka, this is about one month before the character creation (name reserving). Might be good to update it a day or two after that. I'd really like to see the statistics before and after that. And the next big date is the release and then maybe get the trend for the next 2 weeks post launch.
---
Something like that...if its not a hassle. 
---
Thx for everything so far.
---
Why?
---
&gt; Imagine being too dense to figure out having a Very Hard mode does not make a game hard if the Very Easy mode you are forced to play on 99.999% of the time is made for 5 year olds.'
---
lol
---
just reread what you wrote, I'll wait
---
My guild would simply clear heroic and then clear mythic. Any class clearing heroic is even harder than vanilla. Rotations require more than 1 button, there are 10x as many mechanics to deal with
---
If I spend months exclusively raiding mythic (which I did in WoD, when it didn't have the absurd out-of-raid grinds that are required to do in legion/bfa) then guess what, I'm playing something much, much more difficult than vanilla raiding. Hell my fistweaving rotation was more involved than pretty much every vanilla dps "rotation".
---
Please respond, don't delete your comment, I wish to hear more of your thoughts
---
Shaman will not be as heavily populated as they seem. I can tell you from  Private server experience about 60% of those shamans watched unbreakable and, have dreams of being an unstoppable Enhance gorilla. When they realize they have to heal raids and, their enhance dreams are nonsense. 90% will re-roll. Never been in a guild with a shaman overpopulation problem.
---
To be fair, the green he's upgrading is a damn good item.

Right so DoTs are included in the raid boss' 16 debuffs. I guessed that DoTs didn't count.

What mail caster gear? You mean Mail healer gear?
---
It's the same as it always has been.
---
Player Versus Player players
---
Other then Your weapon and, trinkets. All your gear is mail. So not sure how a Mage or Warlock is going to take it. Secondly I can tell you from actually playing a shaman. No you don't need to be deep resto even in early raiding. I have no idea where you pulled this nonsense from.
---
If rogue get to CS shaman, its over. Vanilla shaman has nothing to survive a stunlock. Unless youre resto and vastly outgears the rogue
---
Judging by the classic community right now, I'd say the hunter should be Grumpy lol
---
Bro ignore these people they have no idea what they are talking about. Gearing an Ele Shaman during BWL is easy as fuuuck. Other then your weapon and, trinkets. The rest of your gear is mail. No ones taking it from you. You are actually much easier to gear up then those other classes. Because no other caster horde side uses a shield or wears mail.
---
Making his toons pecs bounce.
---
Not 900 bucks for monitor stands? You cheap fuck /s
---
Not if rogue has the opener. Vanilla shaman is the only class that eats 100% to 0% stunlock without any tools to survive it
---
id you play in vanilla?
---
congratulations.
---
Not much since most engineer items are engineer-only. Maybe the MC scope will be cheaper due to bigger supply and I guess iron ore might be in more demand.
---
Yes, was in Deus Vox, killed all bosses in all instances. Was world first
---
Reeeeed Rocket. YuM!
---
Yeah but I figure this level of coordination is worth it lol
---
Maybe in early s2, but they fucked up BT release and warglaives rogues were running around killing everyone. By s4, restro druid/warglaive rogue or restokin/warglaive was the easiest and best comp, especially if they had 4/8 4/5.
---
I played on live.

Shame, hunters could have used that mana regen /s

Classic is perfect!

Im trying to think what I would put those 5 points in and yea... Hard to get really excited.

Are we the bad guys?

Plus you get to meet a cute twink üòè
---
True. I didn't PvP much in season 4 just 1-3 so that's where my memory jumps to first but you're right warglaive rogues were out of control at the end of TBC.
---
Rogue will never 100-0 a Shaman in full mail armor with a shield. Then Nature's Swiftness brings the Shaman to full health. If the Rogue uses Blind and goes for a 2nd opener, then the Shaman trinkets out of the 2nd Kidney Shot. The Shaman trinket also removes Crippling Poison so he can immediately begin kiting.
---
In no way. Just answering you when Blizzard raised drop rates on dungeon epics
---
Somehow my post is gone:  
---
I have added the Preview AddOn to the original post so you can see how it will work in classic :)
---
They call me the fastest shot under the sheets.
---
It should not take you 40 hours a week to grind potions.  Warlock will probably farm better than druid though.
---
Subbing on 3 accounts and scripting out all the name reservations on August 12th so you can login a few days later during dead hours and recreate the characters to what you want is worth it.
---
Sounds like it was just the right thing to say tbh
---
World of Roguecraft and Maydie (because Arthas is my Vanilla Server gotta represent)
---
Vurtne (ofc)
---
And im guna cheat here cause it was TBC but it was still pre-70 world PvP and these movies are criminally under rated: Shadow Word Dance 1-3
---
Well the idea was that both factions frowned on dishonourable kills, so Bob, murderer of 1,000 level 4 orcs probably wouldn't probably be less likely to be welcomed into the horde. 
---
City of Heroes/Villains sort of did this. You could raise your rep with the other side and lower it enough with your own that you got to switch which was kind of cool, especially since they each had unique classes. I recall it was a massive grind and I don't know how many people actually managed it before they shut down the servers.
---
This sub is so cringe.
---
You people need HOBBIES
---
Curious, have you focused at all on doing 1-6 as quick as possible to get out of Orc/Troll starting zone ASAP? You reason it's faster to grind than quest with all those people? I see people claim exploration but seems like that's a meme.
---
Oh, haven't see this posted yet.  /s
---
First, it blows my mind how some people respond. From narcissism to completely inane... Anyway, freakin awesome setup!! Love that background too ü•∞
---
Do you have plans on putting GuideLime on CurseForge?    
---
It'll make it easy for users to keep updated (the former curse client, now twitch client, has an "update all" addons button).
---
Oh I see. I'm just wondering why it's 4% now. Kinda removes some of the prestige of the item.
---
Priest is easier than Rogue and one of the easiest classes in general imo, there's 0 downtime
---
More engineers probably also mean more miners, that will probably keep the ore prices from getting too high.
---

Why are you stalking my posts?
---
Ok, so with 57 linen, you can tailor enough green items to turn into dust and use that for enchanting to 10.  Whew!
---
At least initially. Eventually we'll have the big gathering drop when everyone switches to a second crafting profession. Might be a good idea to stockpile some materials before that happens.
---
Ahh, I could have sworn BWL was first phase. Thanks for correcting me.
---
&gt;Maladath only has +4 swords sadly, and the Classic code has a special condition giving +1 hit if you are within 10 weapon skill of the boss' defense (315). So you need to get to 5 to get nearly half of the hit from +5 weapon skill.
---
I can't find this info. Could you provide a source? The only info I found was a percentage increase of hit per point.
---
I've been reading up on other guilds' general progression through raids and the private server rankings, and I'll have to agree that Orc is better until TF/late game, but that comes with the caveat that the tank actually needs the threat. Our guild only had trouble with threat a couple times in the whole history of our raiding experience (we all quit ~twin emps), whereas I've seen our tank's HP drop below 5% countless times, which means his racial saved his world buffs as well. He had zero +weapon skill iirc.
---
&gt;I don't see how that is "limiting options" at all.
---
This is about which racial is best for tanking, and the best tank in the game will not be making use of axe spec, assuming all skill being equal.
---
I said nothing about racials, just races
---
Those are all really valid points. The question was not whether or not the spelling was good, the question was whether it was better than scattershot if I was an engineer with war stomp
---
The cost of a couple drinks out in order to guarantee the names of your characters for the next two years? No, not really.
---
You're a saint.
---
I started playing in The Burning Crusade. My first toon was a priest. I decided I wanted to be holy and heal groups.
---
Made it all the way to 62 before speccing to Shadow. Didn't know jack shit about wands.
---
All that matters is had lots of fun, was in groups all the time, and had fun. At the end of the day, it's a game. A source of entertainment. So however you do it, have fun.
---
What'd it do to a moonglow spec?
---
What about Kitty?
---
Represent!
---
Paladins, Shaman and Druids would be pure heal/dps hybrids.
---
Unless you already have 200 people in the guild, it's WAY overkill in it's structure.
---
I find it's better to add roles as needed rather than define an elaborate structure beforehand.
---
Blizzard's numbers suggest 1/3 of their players are female.
---
[Swifty Incredible Warrior Tricks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HUPexEfCG7g) - Also played a very similar geared nelf dual wield fury warrior, loved all the songs, good editing, and actually good tricks  
---
[Destiny vs BWL](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsS6-GxhwCo) good songs, nice editing, really good intro
---
Couple drinks is 45 bucks? But nah I‚Äôm not desperate enough to reserve more than 3 names. I never have more than a few characters anyways. It‚Äôs sad you‚Äôre willing to pay that much just for names then taking the time to script it out
---
You can only claim like 3 names early on. Good luck getting these names after release :p
---
*Cuts down tree to make wand*

"You are now hostile with the Ents, young Hobbit."
---
That comment wouldnt exist without the thread, so remove the roots and the branches will also disappear
---
2600 makes sense for cata. For TBC, you‚Äôd be r1 in most BGs. I didn‚Äôt do much except hit max level and quit in cata, but I recall someone did hit 3000 at the end of WotlK on blackrock. 
---
Yeah, I was talking 2s, the easiest glad in TBC. TBC drain teams weren‚Äôt that great in 2s by the time Sunwell rolled around. I remember watching my friend rage because a PvE geared restokin was smacking him with a staff while he mana burned him and my friend ended up with 0 mana and the moonkin just /danced lol.
---
Sounds like you never hit 14
---
If you want to swap specs often its going to be 50 gold per, so 100 gold to swap to a different spec and back.
---
I think it was just an automated thing from being logged in for that long without ever logging out
---
China/Russia gold is a thing for alot of players
---
To make her play dwarf ofc
---
Why the fuck isnt Grumpy the warrior?  RAGE!
---
"False. Black bear." I was quoting The Office.
---
There was no cross realm back then, the world was smaller.  We all leveled together and knew each other.
---
If multiple people you've grouped with before and trust are saying to blacklist someone you do it.
---
Haha. Blizzard never anticipated one human actually managing to stay logged in for that amount of time. Rightfully so!
---
That's just insane. I know how bad I feel after staying up for a straight 24 hours. Two, three, or approaching FOUR days like that guy is just ridiculous. I wonder if he was on the adderall.
---
The only time you can spot shadowmeld is if you see it happen. It is just as effective as stealth for being detected.
---
Shouldn't the prince be a druid then instead?
---
If you have to ask, you can't afford it. But no, you're only paying $30 extra to reserve the other 6 names (8 classes + bank alt).
---
The money is nothing compared to getting what I want. I've already reserved the first 10,000 gold from two different major gold sellers on my chosen realm and the subscription costs don't compare to that at all.
---
It took maybe 20 minutes to script out a character creation bot.
---
You won‚Äôt be getting solid gear before your guild has it on farm.
---
Not all of them. If you played on ED and VG they were buffed a bit but also dropped more herbs. I can't remember if Nost nerfed them but Ely definitely did and also LH.
---
Death &amp; Taxes All Day Baby!
---
This show is video documentation on how my friends and I used to talk.
---
Maybe we should just be real and ask blizz to nerf it?
---
Are we going to get class flair at any point?
---
I used to think the same way . Until I spent and lot of time really studying how other rogues were beating mages so easily. I highly recommend putting some research in. Now i'm certain that the advantage is in the rogues favor in 99/100 cases. Only if both players have immense experience in the matchup does the advantage start to shift a tiny bit towards mage. But only very slightly.
---
There's no fucking way I'm ever going to do anything in this game I don't want to do. That includes farming something that can be bought from China for less than minimum wage. My time is too valuable for that.
---
Besides, it's a massive advantage. Epic mount the moment you ding 60, buying up every single Bottomless Bag and anything else I want the moment it hits the market, twinking out every single alt, not bothering with gathering professions, using full consumables in every single PVP fight, respecing whenever I want.
---
And I'm so looking forward to just dominating key markets by sticking an alt account at the AH with a script to buy up every single class of item that hits the market, essentially making me server royalty or at least a Rockefeller.
---
I've even started inquiries on straight buying Scarab Lord from a guild full of kids with student debt. I don't have time to lead a guild and convince 39+ other people, especially when people are so cheap.
---
And then fucking whelps come streaming out of Area 51 attacking him and we all find out it wasn't UFOs at Area 51 but the fuck black dragonflight!
---
If by casual you mean "only ever does what I want in the game and wants for nothing", then sure, I accept the label with pride.
---
You can also do orb runs and claim the first one although it usually goes to a tank. My favourite gold farm is Scholo for the runes. With a good prot paladin and solid AoE you can blast through that place extremely fast. 
---
Another way is teaming up with a warrior or possibly rogue/feral and farm the chimaeras in Feralas. The recipe for their meat is added in 1.9 so you'll have to wait a bit for that method.
---
Do you agree Bobby B. ?
---
Gordon Ramsey
---
I assume it will be like retail where it's run perfectly on linux with wine and DXVK
---
Still broken
---
The disenchants alone should take you to 10 and then you just have to hope that you get two essences from the DE.
---
Why do you sound like that
---
Illegal Danish: Super Snacks &amp; Escape from Orgrimmar are a must.
---
Gearing for Pre-raid BiS difficulty is based much more on role than class/spec. Ie: 
---
* healers or tanks can find groups very fast and are always in high demand. 
---
* Dps have trouble finding groups because of competition and overpopulation of the role, so the "best" class/ specs tend to get 1st dibs on spots.
---
Yeah, this has been confirmed several times. It runs flawlessly.
---
Ah! It's absolutely worth a watch. I suppose everything is subjective, but I believe you'd be hard pressed to find better comedy on TV. Personally I'd suggest starting at Season 2 if you ever do. You won't really miss anything, and that's when the show hits its stride (season 1 is only 6 episodes anyway).
---
except pally tier 2. usually not a lot of ret pallies around so you can get that.
---
Wtf no, you don't use 4 tanks until naxx, and by then all of your fury warriors should essentially have a full tanking set. I'm amazed at the amount of made-up scenarios feral druids come up with to try and justify bringing a feral lol.
---
Basically all pservers have had naxx out for ages by now, no? If we're working under the assumption that everyone is decked out in naxx gear, then this discussion hardly matters to begin with. You might as well fuck around and bring a prot pala at that point, for the heck of it.
---
You are my hero.
---
You should make sure you know how to powershift and bring a wolfshead helm to every raid. Even if you're tank 2 there will be several bosses where you won't need to tank anything and the bosses that only need 1 tank tend to be the least healing intensive.
---
Do you need to go to stormwind to get your ressurect? that is the most obvious thing I can think of. I don't play dwarf priest though.
---
i dont see the point in doing this. by the time you travel there you might as well kust kill mo s ans youll reach lvl
---
10y i propose you go with joanas alliance guide. he said its done until release.
---
Do you own a legitimate copy of Windows 7, 8, or 8.1? Because if so, Windows 10 is a free upgrade for you. Just create the installation media as normal and use your old product key.
---
Genius. I have a few who wanna take and a few irl ones but neither of those circles interact...
---
I'll poke a few of the irl ones!
---
CoW is completely trash and just uses up a valuable debuff slot. It's really sad we can't use max dots because they are a huge damage increase.
---
i mean this is basically what i do on pserver freshes and when i get to castle quests there's 20 lvl 2-4 people trying to kill off sailors lmao. Can't always rely on people doing quests for their level, on fresh people try to do quests/mobs way above their recommended level which means you have to really outlevel people by several levels before being alone on quests.
---
I‚Äôll keep you posted
---
Thanks! These will definitely come in handy for gearing up my main.
---
I personally see myself in the characters I play so I obviously don't play females. That's just me though and I couldn't care less what others think.
---
People are task-oriented and like to be efficient and precise. You drag your knuckles on the pavement too much
---
I'm playing classic
---
Who said anything about speedruns? Speedrun comps are completely different comps, especially on horde side. They're usually done after your whole raid is decked out, at which point ofc crushing blows won't be as scary.
---
I haven't played on a private server in a while, so I wouldn't know if the speedrun "meta" changed, but as far as I can tell from logs, none of the speed records were set with a feral tank, especially not as MT?
---
Most? Not really.  There's a certain misunderstanding on the sub about what a "typical" guild might do in classic because all they've played is private servers.
---
Herb/mining is one of the worst options for minimizing your /played time.  You will spend way too much time lvling those professions in lower lvl zones because you will outlvl them too fast.
---
Bloodvine only requires 300 tailoring for the set bonus, not to equip it.
---
You have a bright future in public relations. 
---
Enjoy your achievement.
---
So what happened
---
This guys doesn't understand that this great time is about you  and your skill in  speed lvling and not about rogue class. 
---
Btw I have a question. What weapons, or items upgrades q should I get on the road to lvl  40?
---
I'm not a bad player but I feel like my rogue does little dmg, I can dmg only mobs way below my lvl.
---
Be active and approachable. Apply the rules you make equally and fairly to even your closest friends. Use DKP to avoid loot drama with the exception of legendaries.
---
I mean yea I know how to powershift. I am going to be rolling HotW/NS and skipping all the cat dps talents in favor of tanking ones in the feral tree, so if I am not tanking ill probably be healing.
---
The best part is for some people this isnt a joke.
---
They have the money to do exactly what you are saying and there is no way to stop them.
---
As a kid in vanilla I remember wasting all my money on stupid shit then getting frustrated that I didn‚Äôt have any money.
---
Holy nova really isn‚Äôt that efficient. Single target while doting additional adds works best. Generally a holy priest can tank a bunch of normal mobs with all your + healing, it‚Äôs just not great for damage as you can imagine.
---
Haha, imagine sucking at the game so much you need to enlist the Chinese xD
---
The best healing and spell gear is cloth.  You'll get your mail, if it even exists, but it's inferior.
---
I managed to get top 5 on recent private server release at lvl 15 (as a rogue) also got first level 4 on the server :p Pretty sure if u know what ur doing u get ahead very fast. Even more so with sharding/layering now (also private server has 5-10k on launches, which is why people group up way more outside)
---
Would you rather people be mad at a system because one of your raiders who shows up to one out of 3 raids fucked himself out of loot, or have people be mad at you for fucking them out of loot? Only people who cry about DKP are private server cry babies who are insane loot whores often times. 
---
Perception is reality.
---
Me too.
---
PR? Ew, no. 
---
Lobbying congress is where the real money and power is at, but I don't even do much of that anymore ever since my wife and unborn child were killed.
---
Now I spend my time volunteering or doing stupid shit with money. One of my kids from BBBS turned me on to the game when it was announced and I've been hooked ever since.
---
I saw your earlier post and thought it sounded like a great idea. I‚Äôll need to check out the end result.
---
I kinda want an answer for this as well. I tried it on a pserver just to get a feel for it.
---
Why would I joke about something that is clearly forcing a lot of hate upon me? I honestly thought this sub was more accepting.
---
&gt;The money is nothing compared to getting what I want.
---
Yeah, it's clear that getting what you want matters most lol. You sound like a fun, totally not egoistical or materialistic, person to be around. :)
---
Hey there Moosetrax_ please do check it out and let me know what you think!  Any feedback is much appreciated :)
---
I go silverpine early because the best weapons early are swords. Then i get hammer in thunerbluff level 16, then i get swords 20/21 (torek assualt q &amp; longsword) then i get a dagger for my offhand at 27 from hills (i buy it lvl 25) then i solo BFD for outlaw sabre level 28, then i keep that bassicly all the way to 41. But outlaw is really good
---
You'll get healing gear from raids. Pvp gear you'll have to find somewhere else
---
Haha, imagine sucking at life so hard you need to do your own laundry and clean your own house and drive your own car and cook your own meals.
---
You mean you decided on a class and haven't changed your decision by over a year?!?
---
X: Doubt
---
I guess that's one of the weaknesses with DKP; you reward everyone equally regardless of their performance and dedication. 
---
I would be pretty annoyed if a BiS item went to some tool who never used consumables and did shit damage in raids, but has 100% attendance.
---
yeah what is that one? Seal of Command? Sea of something &gt;.&lt;
---
I've already done the quest twice, so it's not a problem, it was just an example of a time consuming quest, relative to rogues "gold farm for raid consumes and raid log". :) 
---
Ive made up my mind and just gonna go with hunter, feel more positive towards it!
---
What does on farm mean?
---
snow white and her animal singing powers. Druid 4 sure.
---
How did you coordinate the head/heart buff? I'm coming from private servers where they don't have a huge cd and I'm interested in how it'll work on Classic.
---
You want me watch every priest leveling video ever to see where the times are? I don't do meth or have that kind of time.
---
as if going deep resto is going to save you alot of mana...
---
even mana tide barely gives mana to yourself
---
30/0/21 is fine unless going for world first. one talent you take helps with tank healing wich doesnt happen oten since youll just spam chain heal and one is 10% increase.
---
Your inflated self ego will only attract the same. If you didnt smell of cheetos I would feel sorry for you. At the end of the day I'm laughing because I will never interact with you.
---
I don't much care for uninformed opinions, so I won't play your game. Your thinking is very black and white, because you think like that "mage can counter any one rogue move". But rogues are about doing combos, and a mage can not counter every one of them when you play them in quick succession and correctly.
---
Hard to tell if its even a solo run tbh but the one i could find he was well behind that mark for a solo push. Good effort but I'm looking for 1-40 times even his 30-35 was taking over an hour every level. Thanks for trying though.
---
Yes, life events have made me bitter and harsh, but you wouldn't know that in meeting me. It's Reddit. I get to let my true colors fly here. IRL, I'm a saint that volunteers and mentors with most of my free time. So many community awards I have to turn down the party invitations. Hell, I even received enough write-ins in the last town council election to seriously consider running in 2 years if I didn't think it was a dead-end position.
---
My Orc Warrior in the T10 gear. It's far and away my favorite looking set.
---
Event is ongoing, world bosses are spawning in cities and GMs are giving some people insane gear (like thunderfury etc)
---
Easily repeated 100% weekly for lesser geared players, with (theoretically) no wipes.
---
Not that kind of twink, ye meatwagon!
---
What a coincidence, you're my hero!
---
It's Reddit. I get to be as harsh and cynical as I want here without any fear of repercussion. You have no idea what I'm like IRL or in-game.
---
Nice to see the devs have some fun :)
---
Here i am with my one 24" monitor
---
Great! I‚Äôve been looking for someone doing this run. Can‚Äôt wait :) I hope the commentary is good
---
Enjoy it friend, I was going to invite your wife over for dinner but I almost forgot..
---
Good to know! Thanks.
---
The succubus is also pretty neat, especially when drain tanking since she does okay dps and can charm gankers. You can also use her as a mana battery with dark pact.
---
Lmao people are nuts. People like this are why layering is such an issue, if people just played the game and worried about pushing themselves and not hunting down their fav lame ass streamer then things wouldn‚Äôt be so bad. Find homies and make fun, quit following around streamers just so you can say you met them in game üòí
---
Fuck no. Much easier to hit Patchwerk. But I had plenty of friends who did. What's your point?
---
A site that lets you register your character/guild/realm and to lookup others that have listed themselves.
---
Optionally you can add some form of contact information so that someone who recognizes you can reach out.
---
Nah, most of us like playing the game.
---
Don't pay attention to the haters, you sound very cute and you make great content. Please keep it up!
---
\#blessed    ...blade of the windseeker
---
NSFW that shit.
---
Shaman with Elemental Mastery + Nature's Swiftness would be the kings. They would just delete someone with instant casts every 3 mins. This spec kind of sucked in TBC because of the higher health pools (people would still have quite a bit of health leftover) but it would be overpowered as shit in Vanilla.
---
You dispute my honor??
---
So you think my ego is bad but you're willing to attempt insulting someone by bringing up their late wife? If only that had any effect on me.
---
Minion rules are useful for making boss fights less one sided. 
---
Essentially, creatures have the same statistics except only 1 hp. Adds a bit of difficulty while also making players feel heroic, cleaving through packs of enemies. 
---
That, coupled with lair actions and legendary actions, make for a memorable fight.
---
I mean, my fav class in Vanilla was a hunter so if I had known about Classic WoW 400 days ago I'd have the same thoughts as OP.
---
That's really cool and seems pretty unlike Blizzard. I bet some of the old timers are all so excited to go back to classic too.
---
I don't 'act', I just know for a fact that private servers don't allow it, and it would seem natural for blizzard to be against it.
---
It isn't against the TOS, but not supported by Blizzard because it leads to unfair play and progress (eg; having an alliance account and a horde account, and killing your characters to earn honor etc).
---
That still doesn't explain why all the downvotes. I forgot how toxic and childish this subreddit was. Enjoy it, I'm off till classic releases and it's flooded with new people :)
---
-dopey
---
-not a hunter
---
You done fucked up A-Aron
---
Did you try your theories in practice?
---
Too stupid to understand basic English now? My post is flawless English.
---
&gt;Imagine being too dense to figure out having a Very Hard mode does not make a game hard if the Very Easy mode you are forced to play on 99.999% of the time is made for 5 year olds.
---
Why do I need to explain this to you? If you can't speak and understand English, then why start arguments on the internet in English?
---
BfA having a "Very Hard mode" does not make BfA a hard game, because 99.999% of the time you are forced to play on a Very Easy mode, and you are given no choice in the matter.
---
&gt;Rotations require more than 1 button
---
Cringe, more lies huh. Literally only 2 specs in vanilla have 1 button raid rotations, Frost Mage and Warlock. Mages other specs have more, and every other classes ALL specs have more. After all that, every single raider in BfA uses an addon that tells you what button to press next, every second of the way. You never have to think for yourself. There is no skill needed whatsoever. You defeat your own arguments by being so dishonest.
---
&gt;Hell my fistweaving rotation was more involved than pretty much every vanilla dps "rotation"
---
Keeps lying lmao.
---
&gt;Please respond, don't delete your comment, I wish to hear more of your thoughts
---
Why would I delete any of my comments? You have been getting absolutely annihilated in every single part of this argument. Every time you lied like an idiot and embarrassed yourself, every time I destroyed your arguments with facts.
---
You get one more try. Come up with a SINGLE valid argument for how retail is a harder game, and maybe you won't look like a clown anymore. Obviously it is an impossible task since retail is a far easier game meant for children. But the purpose of this test is to see if you can act mature and stop making yourself look like a clown.
---
Are you set on questing? 
---
If you aren't, I would say the new insight on dungeon grinding is just too powerful to ignore. And not just for warriors. 
---
Look at a 4 rogue, and a healer group.  4 rogues at 18 can probably do about 160 dps. (40 dps per rogue, I got this number from watching kargoz's rogue "melee cleave" setup when someone posted their dps meter logs a couple times). 
---
 A level 18-20 elite is giving you like 350 exp and has ~1400 health. Or 0.25 exp per damage point you do. 
---
so if you just have dps, and apply it to mobs, a 4 rogue and a healer group should be able to generate 40exp per second, or 144,000 exp per hour. divide by 5 for the party split, and that's 28,800 exp per hour. If you just have 4 rogues, run at stuff, and don't die. 
---
Now, put in a factor because the rogues will have to spend time running between pulls, and allow a bit of downtime. Say 25% of the time is not spent doing dps. 21,600 exp per hour. 
---
That's.... WAY better than solo questing, to my understanding.  Hell, if you spent half your time screwing around not dpsing, you would STILL make 14,400 exp per hour.
---
And that's 4 rogues in a party. Imagine once you bring in class synergies and good gear and strong players and maybe even some sort of AOE. 
---
Frankly, I think most of the current leveling content is either not yet refined, or hopelessly outdated.
---
They'll last a lot longer than retail tourists and people who only think they'll enjoy classic. We know we'll enjoy classic :)
---
That's a player (a dev) who gave himself the KT model (or frostwhisper from Scholo I guess)
---
I have plenty of money to do all this, but it wouldn't feel like much of a game just buying things.
---
Mounts I don't really care about.  Sophisticated use of AH arbitrage will net you all the in game gold you need.
---
But, buying carries and PvP stuff is pretty lame.
---
It's a lot more fun organizing a group of 20 (or 40) guildies and working on tactics and learning and then progressing at the natural pace of the game.  Of course, having played vanilla, you have some advantages in knowing all the boss mechanics.  Still, the joy is in doing that stuff and not in paying to have it done for you.  I'm not sure how that's any fun.  Just as PTW MMOs aren't fun.
---
I used to play Magic, but I had too many bad experiences with other players that I stepped away from the game. Cube and EDH were fun, though!
---
Maybe it wasn't funny, or maybe everyone else is the problem.
---
That would be a lot of fun. I've always wanted to see a GM in game
---
I didn't play a private server, but I did play a priest in vanilla.  I just think the deep holy is not as much of a benefit once you get some +heal gear.  You benefit a lot more from downranking, and the mana improvements from the disc tree.  And then PI is just icing on top, making one of your mage DPS go nuts for 30 seconds, reducing the amount of time the boss is alive.

I had almost forgotten about pyroclasm. Considering it only worked on the rank 1 variants of both spell till mid TBC it begs the question: Are they recreating that 'feature' as well?
---
I was handed nothing in life. I've had to work for everything. Enjoying my success is not wrong. And I still intend to play the game hard, to contribute to a raid team - I just have no desire to spend hours doing menial tasks just so I can go do the things I actually want. That's not what a hobby is supposed to be.

War Stomp, Revenge Stun, Inferno Effect (Summon Infernal), Seal of Justice proc

I've got a pretty good nose for smelling a c*** and I smell one here. Especially when I recognize you because you play the dead wife and child card more then Kenny Rogers played poker. You're a giant phony.

Yes, wow works great on Linux. I run manjaro and run all games.

Lots of Google results on this

Every public reaction has been negative. Whatever you think I'm "trying", I'm not. It was a clickbait title with one purpose: to receive PMs from guild leaders.
---
Do you honestly think that? What were you rated as double shockadin?
---
Victory or death!

Because it looks good lol.

Haven‚Äôt played magic since around the time I played vanilla. The good old days.
---
I've mentioned it once and only to explain very large character flaws in my personality and my recent lack of career direction.
---
Go through life not caring what people think about you and not only will you be more fulfilled, but you'll succeed a lot more often.
---
This post had one purpose and its success can only be measured in the amount of players reaching out to me privately rather than publicly.
---
Shouldn't Sneezy be a paladin because of blessings?
---
I don‚Äôt actually have an argument either way - just wanted to drop the rep thing in there for OP too. 
---
I‚Äôm going to be playing a holy priest so I‚Äôm in a similar predicament to you - do I just heal dungeons all day and level that way or do I take the slower (and probably more painful) way and quest as a priest.  Given I don‚Äôt have the time I had back in vanilla I don‚Äôt intend on rushing to 60 and on top of that I‚Äôve not played vanilla since actual vanilla (never been on private servers) so questing for nostalgia purposes is appealing. I guess ultimately the decision will depend on each individuals own circumstances and what they‚Äôre looking to get from classic.

That would be never.

I dont know what kind of storage is in your macbook, but it shouldn't be too much slower if you use USB 3 to connect the external.

Ad hominem.. please be more clever if you have to resort to personal attacks

&gt; Literally only 2 specs in vanilla have 1 button raid rotations
---
And the rest have 2 button rotations üòÇ
---
&gt; After all that, every single raider in BfA uses an addon that tells you what button to press next, every second of the way. You never have to think for yourself. There is no skill needed whatsoever.
---
Now this. This right here is absolute gold. Weird how none of the players in the world first races used these. Regardless, assume it's true. It's still harder than vanilla where you have no choice but to use your 1-2 dmg abilities üòÇ
---
&gt; Keeps lying lmao. There is no complexity or challenge or skill involved in a rotation of "press the button that lights up".
---
Go ahead and describe a typical WoD fistweaving rotation then. I'm amused you think an addon can tell you have to properly use fistweaving in boss fights. Wish I had that one :)
---
???

He streams speedruns all the time, like he streamed this whole run solo. I can't tell if you are a massive troll or actually serious. Check up his old vods :)
---
No idea what post you're talking about I'm speaking about the one where you talked about your game day set up. In that one you talked about all the money you had enough to pay for your girlfriend and her family to go away on vacation so you could play. You're tiresome troll go away.
---
He's done One-Winged Angel and so many other crazy pieces.  I have no doubt that he could.  He's got a pretty big library of songs; he's just doing WoW stuff now because I imagine he's hyped about Classic.
---
Yeah this isn't true. Undeads are the one's not true Horde.
---
It's ~8 gigs, you can't shove some of your porn collection onto an external or into the cloud to make room for that?
---
If you say so.
---
Bank alts and mailbox storage manipulation are clearly not the essence of the design of alts nor the mailbox system.  As can be seen by the fact that you pay money to increase your bank and there is an ingame bank in the first place.  How do you justify bank alts or mailbox storage being "supported" or in the spirit of the game's designs when they gave us space constraints to work within literally called "bank" that you're byspassing the limitations and the spirit of banking via these other means.
---
I see it as the same type of play beyond the scope of design and spirit of the game.  Clearly they've outlawed neither so they at least agree that these are not exploitative in nature and are also allowable.
---
Lmao, I read it was 45 gigs?
---
This but with a spoon on the end
---
Have any links to watch the leveling route?
---
I just pay someone else to play. I don't even like this game, lol.
---
I have no idea what you're talking about. There's no girlfriend in my life, just casual dating. I think you're confusing me with someone else.
