Runs fine, it’s streamed from my computer and all my games run great and smoothly with no lag
---
---
---
It's never just one thing. The demo represented a bellwether for both inside and outside community interest, a good faith gesture, a testing ground, and more. 
---

---
All signs seem to indicate that the team making WoW Classic are actual fans and are dedicating themselves to the fidelity of the game, so we can be cautiously optimistic in that sense.
---
Part of classic is a tacit admission that, as you said, many people do enjoy the old game or old method of gameplay and would like to return to that. The offshoot benefit is that, when retail gets stale, people will be less likely to cancel if they have classic to turn to, or TBC/WOTLK/MOP etc.
---
Classic is basically a one time value add that generates a lot of money with low overhead and generates good community sentiment and breeds loyalty with its fan base. 
---
I made sure to specify the sounds I mean but I definitely don't expect many upvotes :P
---
Shaman main(min/eng), mage alt(tail/enc)
---
Ignore PS bullshit. Play what you want to play and you'll have a slot in raids, bg, pvp, whtever you want.
---
That is really the gist of it yeah.
---
If you've only ever been Horde, why not try Alliance? Dwarf priests will be reaally overplayed due to all the hyperbole from min maxers and they tend to look terrible. Dwarf paladins aren't played as much but look really cool. If you're a minmaxer by all means go Dwarf priest though.
---
If you're bringing tears to people's eyes you're applying it wrong. You're supposed to put it on people's cheeks.
---
The answer is the same as it was in BC/WotLK, really. It depends on your guild management. Guild management should be able to prioritise what's important/optimal and go with that. And for that matter, even your case may not have been wrong, you know. You might've been trying to get weapons that were marginal upgrades for you, with yet better loot found elsewhere, while they were best in slot for Hunters.
---
Yea, and not to burst a bubble, but shadowcraft is not even bis for rogue. The druid did him a favor.
---
Same.  My guild took a break post-HoT to try it out.  I remember the gameplay being solid, but having a hard time understanding the linear story.
---
But that was enough of a break to not engage with MoP.
---
ele is way better then enh
---
Found a clip of the actual sound designer for vanilla talking about this exact thing: https://youtu.be/LYxU7pIJHhk?t=4751
---
Very interesting.
---
Tabula Rasa, anyone?
---
Like most people are saying it really doesn't matter that much so play what you want. Having a character you like playing is a much bigger deal. Also not sure if it was just a joke but I heard a guild speed running stuff a while ago (pserver) brought nightelf priests just for starshards lol. I guess its plausible, if a boss is dying in 30 seconds or so you won't need much healing and any extra damage is a plus.
---
It's because it's all the same. There's no content that doesn't have an easy mode version, so nothing feels worth doing. Oh look, we can get some armor that has few more spikes on it and a different color if we do the same thing at a harder difficulty. Woo. Much excite.
---
Human Warlock:
---
Pros:
---
- Easy to level
---
- Easy to solo hard mobs and quests
---
- Easy to learn in raids
---
- Warlocks are needed, but not as played as mages are. This means that gear is slightly easier to get in raids, even PuG’s.
---
- Warlocks have one of the highest skillcaps in PvP since they have so many specialized abilities that are very strong in specific situations.
---
- Shadow Mastery/Ruin specialization is very good for farming, PvP, and raiding so you don’t need to respec.
---
- This class has barely any downtime due to how life tap/health funnel/drain life works.
---
- You can adapt your class to fit the situation by changing your pet. Someone in general talks about a tanking frostmage? Pull out your pup and wreak some havoc.
---
- If you don’t like pet classes, go Demonic Sacrifice/Ruin instead and become a shadow or fire mage.
---
- As an alliance warlock, the CC from engineering Grenades is absolutely necessary to deal with undead in PvP, so your decision to go engineering already covers that weakness.
---
- Soulfire (and technically curse of doom) hits like a Tauren-sized truck.
---
- It is a strong class but it scales even better with gear. It’s basically a ranged warrior.
---
- If someone does kill you in WPvP, you can pop your soulstone/hearthstone and get instant revenge.
---
- If the guy manages to kill you again, drop a sentient meteor on him next time you see him.
---
- You get to play demon roulette with your friends.
---
Cons:
---
- Easy raid rotation can be considered spammy and boring.
---
- You have to farm soul shards if you raid, but soul shards don’t expire if you log out, so it doesn’t matter when you kill mobs for them, you just have to do it before raid night.
---
- Soul shards take up a bag slot. 
---
- With low gear, the warlock won’t perform as well as a mage on the meters. Once you hit T3, you will blow everyone else away.
---
- You will probably be expected to summon your friends, but most people will really appreciate this. (More so than mage water in my experience.)
---
I’m planning on making a warlock as my first alt. If I didn’t enjoy Druid so much it would definitely be my main.
---
&gt; Yikes, bro. Well, at least you acknowledge that you had no idea what you were talking about! 
---
Just to sum up the CCP thing - you dishonestly omitted the company's various failed game development efforts and  in your attempt to blame Eve's recent sale on being an MMO appealing to hardcore gamers. You claimed the main problem was instead sub retention, but posted no evidence. 
---
&gt;Because just having group-finder, or  balanced specs, or casual game modes, or catch-up mechanics, or the WoW  Token, aren't enough to keep players playing. It's enough to retain  players for a short while, but you still need engaging mechanics, such  as the ones Legion developed, or found in Mists of Pandaria, to keep  them till the end of an expansion.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;While  the current raids have all gotten great reviews and reception, the way  systems changed in BfA weren't exciting enough. For all their faults,  the Artifact Weapon and the Legendary system were far more interesting  than the Netherlight Crucible-esque Azerite Necklace.  
---
&gt;In  an attempt to mitigate the RNG “complaints” of Legiondaries and make a  more predictable system akin to the Artifact Weapon paths, they ended up  at a bad compromise that kept none of the good things of either system.  
---
&gt;Furthermore,  WoD failed midway through its existence, not because it strayed too far  from Vanilla, but because of a lack of real content. Making retail more  like Vanilla is not the panacea that people in this sub have deluded  themselves into believing.
---
I criticized most of this in another post. Cliffnotes version is none of these mechanics created a lastly subscriber increase, the trajectory of the game returned to decline during Legion and the gradient has steepened in BFA. None of this supports the idea that BFA is somehow ideal for the young gamers, or proves that young gamers want anything different than what all gamers want (good games). 
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
His in-game icon made him famous beyond any of his incredible work, which I always find kinda funny.
---
Not everyone but 99% are. There are people, you wouldn't believe, who like retail more than vanilla. And that is allright. Everyone has a different taste. Nothing wrong about it.
---
Dwarf hunter with a BLUNDERBUSS, living the dream!

---
Even though I disagree with you strongly, I will upvote your comment because you put up a good argument. My point with the kids was that a game like Fortnite is much more easily picked up by  younger kids than a game like, say Tarkov. I guess this is a good thing for the developer, since it would result in more sales, but at the same time I really don't think it's a great game, at all. Just the aesthetics alone are offputting (in the same vein as Borderland's obnoxious black sharpness filter).
---
Yeah indeed man, Rift still has one of, if not the best, class design systems ever.
---
no this is ok 
---
i preffer skinning 
---
and repeat instances while Leveling like Monasteryand then you have the lvl 40 mount while Leveling  
---
endgame best are molten core trash mobs with 20 people no Boss 
---
mc farming is the most relaxed way later 
---
Very much so. It’s very annoying. I had a night elf shadow priest just for fun and would get almost daily pms about how terrible I was lol
---
The sickest animations tho
---
I think you're referring to private servers rather than Classic WoW, so please try r/wowservers for your question (Rule #1).

I made a playlist of the edgy teen music I listened to back in 2005/6. Hitting nostalgia while we level haha.  
---
\*there are one or two songs in that list which probably shouldn't be, but in general its mostly right
---
I say meet in the middle. 
---
1. Pick up gathering professions to make spending money.
---
2. Buy pure strength greens on the AH for your Paladin. Enchants for +5 str.
---
3. Buy strength potions and blacksmith's weightstones for extra strength and damage.
---
4. Then go Divine Strength (+10% Strength) and Improved Blessing of Might (Like half a green's worth of strength).
---
5. Bask in the derision, shared or implied, that such heresy has wrought, for not going 15% mana saved and waiting an extra 5 levels for Vengeance.
---
6. All so you can say "My auto attack and SoC proc is like 15% higher than yours, while my level is about 15%+ lower." 
---
Fuck bis, shadowcraft looks cool and has always looked cool. Plus Darkmantle Armour is pre-raid bis
---
I got your point and yes maybe it is better idea to do this at once on every 2 years approx.
---
Source ? Last I heard 1.8m
---
This must have been released during TBC because those plate shoulders are 100% a BC item.
---
Smite priest.
---
Fear ward costs 100 mana.  Not wasting time using the spell and consuming the 100 mana is the only plus of being Night elf priest.  Blizzard should just change classic wow and make it so that only dwarfs can be priests.
---
I just wish TBC didn't have flying mounts or resilience. It would have been perfect otherwise 
---
People have their favorite classes, but a raid needs a bit of everyone. If you enjoy Paladin, then go for it. You’ll always be wanted unless you’re a retard.
---
Tons will be returning that haven't subbed in many, many years, myself included. I've leveled a couple characters to 60 on private servers but I'm inexperienced with most of the classes and don't know a damn thing about proper PvP. So personally, Classic will be endless content for me. And there's always potential for seasonal Vanilla and/or TBC servers.
---
Well, I pay to see a movie that I know will last for 2 hours. I'll pay for my sub knowing that vanilla has a limited content plan, but I know that the updates are good and the game itself is very fun. This game doesn't need anything new to excite me.
---
Monk all the way!
---
FF14 was the first game of that genre that I played that I felt had surpassed vanilla WoW in terms of overall polish, but in no way do I feel it "killed it"
---
If anything WoW killed WoW
---
There's nothing wrong with a game having an end and it will take a very long time before everythings out with a rolling release schedule and way longer to do everything available, even more so with optional content.  
---
  
---
After 1.5-2 years I imagine you'll see a classic "reset" with new servers where people get to experience a fresh start, fresh economy once again potentially with changes as an experiment but who knows.
---
Same here.
---
Gotta wait and see. There’s what vanilla retail did, there’s what the different private servers tried to do, and there’s what Classic will end up doing. We don’t know!
---
Fuck your tin foil hat!
---
Stick that tinfoil hat up your ass.
---
Obviously spreading DoTs on all the lowbie horde in STV and starting a faction war when other 60's turn up
---
Me: /guit and finds a guild with common sense.
---
Anything that isn't already obvious or a fixed amount of income won't be discussed, because any "secret" becomes less lucrative the more people know about it.
---
Power level alts tailering and set up a moon/felcloth farm
---
The server you mentioned has an average gear of Best in slot. So most people you hit will ignore you because you dont do damage to them In comparison.
---
No this is Patrick 
---
I swore left and right Archeage would have been a WoW destroyer. The game was absolutely incredible in Alpha, but the labor changes and stuff in beta onwards, and the P2W aspects destroyed an INCREDIBLE game.
---
I can't tell but doesn't this work on the presumption that +weaponskill is a linear increase for hit?  
---
Which atleast for private servers, it is not. the calculation isn't 5 weaponskill = 3% hit.  
---
 
---
**\[1\]** If the **difference between player‘s weapon skill and target‘s defense skill is &gt; 10**, then the formula for calculating base miss chance is:
---
**missChance \[%\] = 7 + (defense skill – weapon skill – 10) \* 0.4**  
---
This means that weapon skill between 305-314 will not increase your hit rating by any more htan 3%.  
---
So the gloves don't work on that basis (5+8 = 313 weaponskill).  
---
Then there's obviously the stat loss by not using devilsaur. Regardless, as everyone pointed out, it does depend on whether private servers have the calculations correct at all, compared to vanilla.  
---
Very That!
---
Ultimately, both Fury and Arms are good to tank dungeons up to late game. I prefer Arms because it allows you to stance dance and preserve/generate more rage while tanking. Anger Management is a solid talent.
---
For 50+ dungeons, someone else would be better suited to answer since I don't have much experience at that level tier.
---
Shadow priests.
---
Priests are very efficient levelers when you are not spamming spells and wanding mobs inside of a shield.
---
When you hit lv 30ish you will beat anyone in world Pvp except for hunters.
---
Rogue:
---
1. One of the slower classes to level.
---
2. Have to compete with hunters, fury warriors, and the other billion rogues for gear.
---
3. Have to compete for DPS spot with classes that bring more reliable CC.
---
4. Your PVE rotation is only slightly less brain dead than frost mage.
---
5. Your only source of AoE has a multi minute cooldown and only hits one other target right next to whatever you ate hitting.
---
6. Have to buy and carry reagents for blind, vanish, and to make thistle tea.
---
7. Annoying quest chain to unlock poisons, have to carry poisons on top of reagents and thistle tea.
---
8. Randos messaging you to open their lockboxes, insulting you if you take too long to respond or say no.
---
9. Any damage breaks your blind/gouge/sap, including your own weapon procs. Got a cool sword that shoots sbolts? Breaks gouge EVERY TIME.
---
10. You don't bring anything unique to a raid other than BWL suppression room. MAYBE evasion tanking once or twice in your life, possibly more if you make it to Naxx and your priests suck or are unlucky.
---
11. People will cry about you stunlocking them in PVP and using cooldowns/consumables, nevermind its how you're supposed to play.
---
12. Pretty much no reason to roll one on a PVE server. /s
---
Love me some rogue though.
---
GOOD THING FOR YOU
---
THAT MAGE IS BOTH COOL AND GOOD
---
:)
---
It depends on how much you value buffs, I like shaman more because I know that the melee love me for windfury and the casters and other healers love mana tide. 
---
If you prefer being a raw throughout machine then priest is the way to go for horde tho.
---
Didnt they make all gear types repair at the same price in the later Vanilla patches? 
---
this is probably the most circlejerky sub i've ever visited.
---
This. Class matters too. Some classes (like warlock with a felfunter) can beat healers 1v1 if gear is comparable. But, melee classes will struggle 2v1.
---
I think some people will be willing to share ideas. It's not that big a deal...
---
Enhance isn't that great and relies alot on RNG hardcore. Elemental can do just as much damage  more reliably. Enhance also has to be in melee range while elemental can do it from range or melee.
---
Why are you posting this a third time?
---
I don’t quite understand your point 13. 
---
I leveled 1-60 and never bought water once.  I only had to drink while healing if a mage wasn’t in a group ( I played on a high pop server and could always find a mage)
---
Classic will be the new retail most likely. We will have to think of another name for retail
---
Class fantasy is at an all-time high? The classes are so homogenized right now. Thats just what happens with balance. It is hard not to have class fantasy being inversely related to class balance. By making classes more unique, and good at certain things, it becomes far harder to balance. Meanwhile, the closer you are to having only 1 class, the more balanced the game will be (with minimum effort). That is what blizzard has been doing since Cata, moving towards more homogeneity. Every class can do almost everything the other classes can in a related role.  
---
What people need to grasp now though is that the target market is just different from what it was back then. They don't care about the oldschool fans when it comes to retail. They have moved to catering to the casual players who will spend money on the game. Getting Classic servers is just them acknowledging that they can get some of those subs back without taking away from the current target demographic.
---
The reason why i never roll male characters when going healer. You're literally stuck with a blue dress until you can get your next upgrade which is a pink dress.
---
I still really enjoyed Wrath.  First half of it was fine, but that last patch was sort of the beginning of the end.
---
Then my guild disbanded and I just couldn't get anything to stick in WoW after that.
---
Exactly my problem!  Im brazilian and i speak english and portuguese, but im really looking forward to raiding with brazilians or any other portuguese speaking country. Even if they're in US server.
---
Reasons to Play a Paladin:
---
- T2 is the best looking set in all of WoW’s history. There are great ones out there, but this is the most iconic.
---
- Holy Paladins are the best healers in the game once they have good gear. They’re bottomless reserves of free critical healing.
---
- Holy Paladins are the best healers in PvP.
---
- Paladins are very hard to kill. I mean it. Their survivability is among if not the best in the game. Many people will see you and decide that it’s not worth trying to gank you for the time it would take to kill you. You’re annoying to fight. Revel in it.
---
- You have an over abundance of “Oh Shit!” buttons. If you get in a bad situation you can fix it near-instantly with a reactionary button press.
---
- Divine Shield + Hearth makes you the greatest escape artist in Azeroth. Move over Gnomes.
---
- You have some of the most impactful blessings in the game. All raids want Paladins in them. Blessing of Salvation is a very large indirect contributor to Raid DPS that is sure to make the horde jealous.
---
- Blessing of freedom makes you a warrior’s best friend, and if the polls are anything to go by Classic will be filled with them. The Paladin pushes the ~~wheelchair~~ warrior to actually compete against mages.
---
- Paladins are the only class that was ever capable of one (1800+ at once) shotting a world boss *in Vanilla.* That was patched, but you can still reckbomb whatever Horde low-life refuses to submit to the judgement of the righteous.
---
- You can use every gear type in the game, so you can take advantage of gear with amazing stats.
---
- Did I mention the epic armor plated mounts that are unique to you and save you tons of gold?
---
- Sulfuras, Hand of Ragnaros often goes to a Paladin, if that’s something you’re interested in.
---
This is because of a shift of the playerbase. The vanilla players played vanilla for what it was, but did want some improvements. BC came out, with some of those improvements, while also testing some other stuff out. Then wrath came out. At this point, WoW was a juggernaut, and so many people (especially non-MMO players) heard of it and said 'hey, lets see what all this fuss is about.'   
---
The community makeup changed. Lots of people who were more casual players filled the community, and as they quickly outnumbered the oldschool players, Blizzard listened to them. Blizzard actually did a great job of listening (like you said). Its just that the majority of the playerbase changed overtime, leading to different wants and needs.   
---
So... its a little bit of both. People did want all these changes so that the game was more easily accessible, and blizzard did listen... but it wasn't really the vanilla crowd (yes, they wanted some changes, but not all of the ones we got). In the end though, this was also in an age where the genre was relatively new, and no one really realized some of these changes would completely change the game. And while they ended up ruining the game for numerous people, the changes were praised by a different aspect of the community. People need to just accept that. By the time Ulduar was released, the oldschool style fans were no longer the majority of the game. 
---
You will die if you go there.
---
I hate dealing with totems so I'd roll priest or druid
---
It's called Classic WoW
---
It will be different for sure. But I think it'll be great!
---
New end game raid content for classic may be added, who knows...
---
It's a little ironic that the reason they added flying mounts (flight paths taking ages) was already fixed in Outland.
---
You could argue there was no need for flying mounts once TBC released, but removing them now would likely spark an outrage. 
---
&gt; It is hard not to have class fantasy being inversely related to class balance.
---
I 100% agree. 
---
We're on the same page here. Class fantasy is something that is very important to most WoW players and it's something that isn't given to you in Vanilla.
---
With Vanilla, you have to fit  your expectations to it. You have to adapt to what it presents to you, unlike retail where you really can be whatever you want to be (within reason, of course!)
---
That's why I like Vanilla. I like adjusting to a wonky game rather than the other way around. But I'd be lying to myself if I believed that this kind of game design could be anything but niche in 2019. Retail has proven that you can make an incredibly open, balanced MMO that caters to the widest variety of players. Anyone in this thread who thinks that Vanilla will beat retail at it's own audience is delusional.
---
The nice part about Devilsaur is you can reliably get it fast. You can farm gold super easy and, since you are a hunter, even solo Devilsaurs easy enough if you want to do it all yourself.  
---
Then you can focus on other parts of your gear, you will even pick up solid pieces you weren't going for while looking for your BiS.  For example, I picked up 2 Bone Slicing Hatchets before I finally got my Cape of the Black Baron.  I ended up with Raid BiS before my blue BiS most of the time.
---
&gt; me ranting without agreeing or disagreeing haha
---
Despite you saying this, I 100% agree with everything you've said.
---
This is a good, sober, honest analysis. Much more insightful than some of the other hot-takes in this thread.
---
I means its one guy not an entire guild. Ill allow that
---
Farm gold for my epic mount and build a fury and tank set. Plenty to do....
---
Technically, the advent of "welfare epics" was pvp epics in TBC.
---
i know right ele can do so much burst on demand and from ranged without any rng. and on top of that ur gear makes ur heals and shocks stronger not just lightningbolt and chainlightning
---
Use the 3% hit melee weapon (Warmonger). Truestrike/Devilsaur bring it up to 7%. Double DM rings (idk why you'd grab Mara ring when it's 20 AP and DM rings are 30AP+some crit) bring that to 9%. If you're too lazy to buy Warmonger when it hits crazy prices, just go 2/31/18 and grab the 3% hit talent in survival. There's no point in sacrificing all the agi/crit gear chasing hit. Run Warmonger or run surv talents.
---
The itemization is completely wonky for your list and fully assumes that we will have the broken 1.10+ itemization changes that makes dungeon loot much stronger. Marksman's girdle/Windreaver Graves don't have hit until then. Savage Gladiator's Chain is a subpar item that only has +2% crit until then as well.
---
Pendant of Celerity isn't even in the game until 1.10 and the introduction of the Dungeon set 2.0 quest chain, as it drops off of Lord Valthalak. Mark of Fordring is BiS until Ony neck.
---
Dwarven Hand Cannon is pointless unless you want to have a purple, it's pretty much as good as xbows. The only difference is that it costs an arm. In fact, xbows are better because they clip less in your rotation. Dwarven Hand Cannon would be decent for dwarves because of their racial but that's pretty much it. Just aim for AV xbow until you get Rhok--&gt;Ashjre'Thul--&gt;KT xbow.
---
Oh and also you messed up your first set by putting 11% hit. The calculator is broken and doesn't count the Devilsaur set bonus. Also Swift Flight Bracers have 41 RAP while Bracers of the eclipse have 45 RAP + some crit%.
---
Hit calculation is completely wonky on pservers and on wikis and people are still trying to figure it out. From my experience, 305 wep skill only shaves off 1% hit from your hitcap, which makes it 8% instead of 9%. 
---
And after you get into raiding, you'll start having way too much hit. You'll be sitting at 8% hit with only the hit scope, ZG enchants, DM hit rings and ony neck. Tier will have plenty of hit on top of it.
---
The vmap and mmap tied to this map are both really wonky. Lots of invisible LoS things, invisible walls, walls you can walk though, and so on. It makes it hard to fully explore in-game (obviously only accessible via GM teleportation)
---
Maybe technically, sure, but the meme certainly comes from PvE badge gear in WotLK.
---
Same here, the only reason I finished WotLK was because I loved my 10 man guild, and had plenty of friends playing. Also Ulduar is my favorite raid ever. 
---
Then Cata hit, and things were actually kind of good in the beginning with heroics dropping blues again. Now epics actually felt kind of epic. But revamped talents etc made it kind of a trainwreck.
---
Legion is the only expansion after TBC were I found myself logging in every day because I wanted gear. I really don't understand how they fucked BFA up so much after Legion. 
---
Right? It's crazy how engaging a 15 year old version of the game can be, even on a private server.
---
Seeing people in full tier 2 in Org makes me hyped as fuck to gear my own character.
---
I could never get that feeling from retail. 
---
Troll shaman. Berserker has saved my ass soooo many times. 
---
So you're just going to ignore that retail is failing?
---
I also enjoyed the first half of Wrath, but when I stepped down from guild responsibilities, all my friends started quitting. I think community is really what made the game for a lot of people, and that dynamic really changed over that time.
---
When I started getting back into it, Gearscore and achievement linking was the new standard, which created antisocial emergent gameplay. That coupled with the seeming easiness of smaller scale PVE content (ie heroics) seemed like the game was getting smaller, while the world was bigger- population being spread between continents and heirlooms affecting low level PvP. I knew I would never care much about the permanence of my character's achievements in-game anymore.
---
Level as Arms since you won't be able to sit to proc Enrage on Classic, making Arms probably better.
---
Both tank fine, but Anger Management is too good to pass up &amp; as others are saying you can tank all the way to 60 and beyond as DPS without stressing your healer.
---
If you are going to pvp, You would be crazy not to pick up the range on lightning spells and the healing pushback reduction. 
---
our vanilla guild never had a dwarf priest and we did 9/14 naxx
---
This is the guy that should be beaten within an inch of his life for introducing Pandas.
---
At first i thought you were describing BfA, lol  
---
There's no actual source for sub count these days.  You can however count active characters across all servers which points to roughly 2 million assuming most people don't have more than 2 characters they play regularly.
---
That number quickly drops if the average player in retail plays 3-4 characters, but considering the systems they have it's unlikely.
---
Speak for yourself I'm going Enchanment. I'll be raiding with nightfall all throughout classic. Don't let people tell you how you are going to be playing.
---
[deleted]
---
In the context of the time, I think people really forget how much the changes from the cataclysm we welcomed. As a PVPer, I loved the talents changes for balance. And finally we got RBGs! Bringing high level players back to the original continents was welcomed, and the questing changes were much more entertaining and streamlined (though maybe at the cost of immersion). I also enjoyed the heroics- don't remember them being as hard as I people on Reddit saying.
---
Classic yogpods! Back before they where sell outs + movies I remember watching while playing / farming back in the day 
---
I finally felt that way in Cata. It's weird when you suddenly become detached to something that held you like a vicegrip for so long.
---
Well of eternity trilogy 
---
I'm planning on rolling a Warlock and for leveling professions I was thinking starting out as Tailoring/Enchanting and then dropping Enchanting at 60 for Engineering, make a couple of alts for gathering &amp; Alchemy to help support my main.
---
I know most people level with Skinning for the income, but with the inexpensive mount at 40 I don't really think I'll need it.
---
My reasoning was that I would rather have Enchanting for the early wands and also because I plan on running a lot of dungeons &amp; thought I could use my spare low level mats to give out free enchants when decent upgrades drop for my party.
---
I really wanted to do this just to build camaraderie and help make friends while I level up, but don't want to get to my mid 30s with Enchanting and realize I won't be able to feasibly give out enchants.
---
Can anyone with a little more experience give me some insight? Thanks.
---
Oh boy if you thought Vanilla was a grind, Aion really took the cake. 
---
&gt; it's a thing I did all throughout Legion and the start of BfA 
---
What exactly did you do? The only thing that exists in the world is people doing WQs as quickly as possible. Not to mention that (at least in legion) balance was so screwed up because of legendaries that world pvp was a complete shitshow.
---
&gt; The lack of historical context in this sub is insane
---
The only thing that's insane is pretending that the modern game isn't completely and totally different in this regard. Not acknowledging that the past 10 years have jacked the level of handholding up to ridiculous levels is so absurd it's basically trolling.
---
Fixed it for you
---
Ya give me current day mechanics with vanilla style grinds/reward pacing with a BiS that stays BiS and I'll be so~ happy.
---
Classic will do for now.
---
You can't do The Barrens from 10-30 though. There will be *a lot* of running between Stonetalon Mountains, Ashenvale, and Hillsbrad
---
Missing 20%+dmg from opportunity... 
---
*Sigh*, you're still looking for a fight, huh?
---
Okay. I'll take this head on. Is retail failing? 
---
Well, what does it mean for an expansion to fail? Was *Legion* a failure? I don't think so. Was WoD? Of course it failed. WoD hemorrhaged so many subscribers that it actually caused Blizzard to stop reporting sub-numbers. That's groundbreaking.
---
Yes, I think BfA has failed, and not just personally—because I really stopped playing. I didn't even get past 112! I've said many times in this thread, and [to you personally](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/amrc3m/it_really_do_be_like_that/eforqjp/), why I believe BfA failed, especially when compared to the massive, beautiful resurrection that *Legion* was. 
---
Trust me, [I could see it coming with the Netherlight Crucible.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/89q323/_/dwt64va/) If you know anything about how Blizz-devs operate, they love play-testing the next expansion's mechanics at the very end of the current expansion's tier. I *hated* the Netherlight Crucible, but I could see how they were trying to “fix” the Artifact / Legendary system of Legion. Make the grind more predictable, make the abilities less swingy, less impactful, less sexy.
---
I'll be honest with you: I *loved* Legion. I loved Legion more than any other expansion. Even more than Vanilla private servers. It was exactly what I wanted in an MMO in 2017 as a working adult. I even loved Legiondaries and their acquisition mechanic and Artifact Weapons and World Quests and the M+ dungeon system and the quest-based crafting system, and proof of my appreciation for these systems is my comment history—where some of my most down-voted comments are defending all the ways in which Legion did things right, especially after the wasteland of missed opportunities that was WoD.
---
But even the end of WoD gave me a chance to reflect on what I think is Blizzard's greatest saving grace, and I actually got gilded for [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/4u7ara/patch_703_removing_gold_from_garrison_missions_be/d5ni4xb/), at peak WoD-hate season. That's gotta be worth *something*, right?
---
&gt; This will forever be a shining example of how resource-based mini-games do not jive well with the core MMO experience.
---
&gt; *That being said,* I think for all the (rightful) hate Garrisons got, few people acknowledge the fact that Blizzard is still willing to put their entire franchise on the line with experimental gameplay mechanics every expansion.
---
&gt; It's like your favorite band who, in their later years, starts going off into weird places and trying out new genres and ideas. Most fans will do the typical “Man, they suck now, why don't they make another album like their first one?”
---
&gt; But the core fanbase will always try following them where ever they go next.
---
&gt; I definitely feel the Garrison is going to be that under-rated concept album that people will rediscover later on: “TIL you can set up an auction house in your Garrison and the Admiral's Compass gives you a second Hearthstone just outside!”
---
&gt; Personally, I still plan on putting my Garrison on the group-finder during holidays so people can come visit and farm the rare Halloween pets, etc.
---
So, is Retail failing? Yes. Retail is failing. Will the next expansion fail? If it's anything like Legion, certainly not. Could *some* mechanics from Classic be imported back into Retail to make it a better game? Maybe. Depends on what the rest of the expansion is doing. But just making Retail back into a Vanilla clone (mechanically speaking) is not a solution and it bugs the shit out of me when people in this sub pretend like it would be.
---
BLIZZARD OR SHOULD I SAY ACTIVITISION-BLIZZARD
---
13. You will melt faces in pvp 
---
Same, but ingame sounds need to be hearable as well.
---
Hunter should go Skinning LW to make armor for both.
---
Druid should go Enchanting if they want to tank for the Smoking Heart of the Mountain and buffing everyone’s gear.
---
But honestly it’s all arbitrary and as long as you have a way to make money you’ll be fine.
---
I don't think you understand how healing works in vanilla. Nothing about it is fulfilling.
---
You literally use the heal you got at like level 40 or something, because the latest rank would make you go oom too fast. Then you press the heal, but you stop it if the tank hasn't lost health. Then you press it again, but he still hasn't lost health, so you stop it.
---
Then you press it again, and this time you can actually follow through on it because he lost a little health this time. But be careful not to cast the heal twice in a row, or else you will go oom really quick.
---
I played a Troll Priest healer in Vanilla. It was fun. I am guessing a shaman healer would be more useful for a raid though with tremor totem. Priest has a benefit of two different healing talent trees to choose from though. Also you get Lolwell! Personally I like Lolwell, but people don't know how to use it. I am guessing when WoW Classic comes out ppl will still not know how to use it.
---
No it’s not.
---
I think the guild would piss their pants over how lucky they are if 2 priests applied at the same time. 
---
We don't yet know if 1.10 dungeon loot will be in the game, but that will have a significant effect on any bis list. I don't think there will be progressive itemization.
---
Shaman is more engaging for sure.
---
It will be absolutely hilarious if they do that. Can you imagine people paying to play old expansions?
---
Nostalgia is a powerful drug. 
---
&gt; The same as above but with Raptor pets.  
---
Explain?  
---
Tera
---
Just use a model changer dude
---
&gt;model changer
---
isnt this illegal and i get banned for this? How does it work btw?
---
Aussie here.
---
It’s hard to find enough people at times so we do need some crazy timed North Hemisphere;) people.
---
That said Loot distribution systems all have downsides and upsides. We’re rolling one, it was originally going to be DKP + Loot council until we realised its not heaps fair in some situations. Now we are looking at CPGP 
---
&gt; What exactly did you do? The only thing that exists in the world is people doing WQs as quickly as possible. Not to mention that (at least in legion) balance was so screwed up because of legendaries that world pvp was a complete shitshow.
---
I love the grind of farming the right legendaries for WPvP (which were often the Legendaries no one thought were good for PvE / PvP, which added an extra level of theory crafting) and doing WPvP for Aviana's Broken Isles faction. 
---
Sure, the rewards weren't amazing, but it was fun. It was very imbalanced. You know what it reminded me of? **Vanilla!!!**
---
You think Legendaries screwed up balance? You're going to hate Vanilla WPvP. Personally, on private servers where Naxx has been out long enough, it's a beautiful shitshow.
---
I played a Priest on a PS, was healing 5mans and raids. Had a ton of fun. It's true that the mechanics itself are not that hard to learn. I just loved the ability to keep a single buddy or a whole group alive. I loved buffing everyone and just being the nice guy. It was really rewarding for me. 
---
My very first character in 2005 as a 12 year old boy was on an RP server, and in addition to stuff other people have mentioned already, our guild had things like guild meetings every week, all trials had to write a short story about themselves and post it on the guild website.
---
 To become an officer you had to solve a riddle made by other officers, which for me was just a couple of lore questions, but my IRL friend had to solve a whole made up murder investigation. Then we had things like in game weddings, where I remember the bride got a whole set of Black Dragonscale as a gift, which was a really fucking expensive gift to get at the time.
---
It was a really awesome introduction to the game as a kid, and I have very fond memories of the guild, and the people in it. 
---
Hey guys! This week we continue the MC series featuring the 2nd boss known as Magmadar - I'm consistently working on a fast paced series of guides that hit all of the key points for Classic players. And as always thank you for watching!
---
If it's too hard then don't level in redridge
---
No it's not illegal, it just changes the model you see on your screen. I'm pretty sure blizz can't find out you're using it anyway. 
---
If you roll a dwarf, and use a model changer to be a night elf, you will still look like a dwarf to other people.

In about a month of doing dungeons after work I was close to full pre-BiS, only lacking Baron's cloak, one Dal'rend sword and HoJ. Got a bit lucky as I won the first Truestrike and Painweaver band that dropped. I got 5/8 T1 in 3 MC resets on my hunter so it depends on your luck (it was in a half guild/half pug raid which can be pretty common early on, and I got lucky on rolls). And that was without the belt which you can buy off AH. 
---
I'm not saying it can't be fun, it just seems like he's expecting something he won't find when he asks "which one is more fulfilling".
---
They're both healers, they basically do the same, which is standing around pressing one button maybe every 10 seconds. At least in raids.
---
Dungeons can be more engaging imo.
---
Maybe I'm wrong and he knows what he's getting himself into.
---
Literally logging in to do dailies and amass gold for other games.
---
Counting the days to classic and never looking back
---
You can wait.
---
It’s garbage and I just do dailies to amass gold then go play on a private server 
---
Oh definitely, I was speaking only to bop drops, should’ve clarified tho. 
---
I mean, sure, but we didn’t have 14ish years of math to let us know what was the best of the best at the time, all I knew was that it was an upgrade from what I had up until I got T1 and eventually T2.
---
The first MC guild I was in was stuck on him for weeks until we got a new MT. Hated this boss for a loooooong time.
---
Yes, but it reads as if front stabbing is a thing. 
---
I merely said it so new people become aware that front stabbing is a pserver thing :). 
---
This applies to every class pretty much. Maybe a rogue could vanish away or a pally could bubble hearth
---
Blessing of Sanctuary is worth it for the slight boost to tank TPS and reduction in raid damage, but it's a small gain and by far the least important blessing. Holy shock has such a long cooldown that losing it is not a big deal.
---
One paladin should have improved devotion aura and stand in range of the tank on most fights, the armor is pretty nice.
---
Same aura doesn't stack. Also no class granted resistance buffs stack. For example priest's shadow protection, paladin's shadow protection aura, and druid's mark of the wild all don't stack, only the greatest bonus will apply.
---
Pursuit of justice doesn't matter, but a build with improved retribution aura would be decent. Most fights a different aura would be used, but it has its uses for extra TPS especially when AoE tanking.
---
OMG don't tell me how to have fun!
---
Yeah and it was the only MMO that drew me away from WoW for any significant amount of time back in the day
---
Loved rift, too bad they killed in storm legion which was a pretty decent expansion initially
---
This hurt my feelings...
---
Chris Metzen actually says in the behind the scenes docu for WoW that Outland was definitely meant to be in Vanilla, as a server wide player effort. 
---
Players were meant to figure out how to open the Dark Portal. I got so fucking hyped when he said that. That's the type of MMO I want. 
---
Yeah if we have progressive itemization it will ofc be a whole different ballpark.
---
skip the deadmines? for everyone playing alliance its prob the first dungeon they ever did and its fun as fuck to revisit
---
skip the deadmines because of xp gains and losses? this sub hit a new low
---
They wont charge more to re-release the older expansions.  If they do I'll be highly surprised. 
---
Ok so one can do 30/21/0 to cover Blessing of Sanctuary and Improved Concentration Aura, the BoK Pally can stand closer to give Imp Devo Aura to the tanks/melee, and the Might/Wisdom Pally can go 33/0/17 with one point wherever to get Improved Retribution Aura?
---
There are two different formulas for calculating miss chance based on the difference between your weapon skill and the defense skill of the attacked mob. More than 10, and 10 or less. Normal difference versus lvl 63 mobs (which is the level of raid bosses and many trash mobs) is 15 which puts you in the worse formula and gives a miss chance of 9%. However, if you increase your weapon skill with 5 your miss chance is calculated with the other formula and your miss chance is 6%. So 5 hit is in a sense exactly 3% hit (versus lvl 63 mobs), but only when going from 300 to 305 weapon skill. 4 weapon skill (as with the  Marksman Bands and Sash of the Grand Hunt) would only be the equivalent of 1.6% hit, and every point beyond the first five only results in 0.1% hit.  Trueaim Gauntlets might be worth it because it is effectively 4.3% hit vs lvl 63 mobs, but that version is the 1.10 version and before that it only has 8 bow skill (and every pre-bis weapon is a crossbow) so it all depends on what the itemization patch will be.
---
&gt; skip the deadmines because of xp gains and losses? this sub hit a new low
---
Bruh, do you even poopsock? It's in the title. There are people that like playing the game differently than the way you like playing the game. It's okay that other people like other things.
---
Should all of them not have Lasting Judgment to get to 31 Holy? I guess the BoW Pally would only need 1/3 but still.
---
You still have to pay for the monthly sub.
---
I don't currently play retail, so I will be paying to play Classic. 
---
I actually kinda wish I found cool something that wasn't the 2 most played classes in the game...
---
Realistically most paladins will want Consecrate so they can solo farm DM E lashers. Improved lay on hands and unyielding faith ideally should be taken by all paladins that don't need the points elsewhere which leaves only 1 point for Lasting Judgment for a non-BoW paladin.
---
Objectively for the market today retail is a better game in almost every measurable metric.
---
This is coming from someone who will level 3+ 60s when classic releases and classic / tbc is my favorite iteration of the game bar none. Theres nothing wrong with hearing opposing view points, this place is a major major echo chamber, and it would be better if people would listen to to other side as well not just new bad old good
---
I'm aware of that already.  I was just saying they will most likely not charge any additional fees to re-release an old expansion if they choose to go that path...
---
The only ranged weapons a hunter should be using (at endgame) are:
---
LBRS xbow--&gt;AV xbow/Strath xbow--&gt;Rhok'Delar--&gt;Ashjre'Thul--&gt;Nerubian Slavemaker. 
---
Neither of the raid xbow drops should ever go to a melee. Every single other ranged weapon in raid is garbage (except Ouro gun and 4HM bow, which are okay-ish) and should go to melees as stat sticks.
---
The only thing that melees should be rolling for is LBRS xbow, and even that becomes useless to roll for when you can just get satyr's bow in DM for the +hit.
---
Melee weapons are a different thing but usually the hunter stuff is stuff melees don't want, with the exception being pre-bis.
---
Dal'rends--&gt;both melees off Hakkar (dagger and MH sword)--&gt;MH fist wep off 2nd boss in AQ40--&gt;whatever Naxx stuff.
---
I know very few hunters that actually go for Dal'Rends because it's a long-ass grind. Most hunters went for the DM tribute sword (which nobody else needs) or a BoE +hit 2h sword that was also used by nobody else. The Hakkar loot is garbage for melees outside of the dagger for dagger rogues. Ditto for the claw, nobody else uses that.
---
The only items that hunters should be mad that melees are rolling on is LBRS/Strath Xbows.
---
The only items that melees should be mad that hunters are rolling on (and should be rolling on) is Dal'Rends. 
---
Oh and no hunter should ever get DFT/Accuria's unless all the other melees/tanks already have it. Hit is nowhere near close to being an issue for hunters and every melees actually need it.
---
For rogues it is the same result, but instead of rage it’s for poison application.
---
Druid main, warlock alt.
---
Upvoted for math but then downvoted for annoying meme-speak terms such as "poopsocking", the implication that skipping the first decent dungeon is worth it (read: the amount of experience you "lose" is minimal, so short answer is - yes it's worth it to gain some good gear pieces) and lastly doing a dungeon usually nets you some decent amounts of gold, which everyone is usually hard up for...especially early on.)  It's not always about the experience.  Grinding crappy mobs, or skipping dungeons to only do normal quests is all fine and dandy but the end result is that rushing to 40 only to not have enough gold to actually buy a mount will actually LOSE you gold. (As anyone will tell you, time is money, and you spend a LOT of time travelling in WoW...any way you can reduce your travel time inherently improves your XP/HR and your gold/hour.)
---
They most certainly won't, but it's still a little ridiculous to think that we're paying a monthly fee for content that was released over a decade ago. 
---
&gt; rushing to 40 only to not have enough gold to actually buy a mount will actually LOSE you gold.
---
Laughs in Paladin.
---
This
---
This post wasn't really with progressive itemization in mind, if we get that ofc this will be wrong.
---
"Mark of Fordring is BiS until Ony neck" Yeah I know, the point with the gear i was showing was to discuss a different way of gearing insted of the Devilsaur set that could possibly be better, with the assumption that weapon skill works in the way that i wrote. I did not put all the "correct BiS" pieces in the examples cause I didden't think it would matter to the point, I just made sure that the 3 examples had the same other items like Dwarven Hand Cannon, Flight Bracers, Pendant of Celerity etc other then having to change items for more hit, because that was what I did with the first picture. 
---
"he calculator is broken and doesn't count the Devilsaur set bonus." Yeah that's an oversight by my part, will need to do some re checking with the 2% hit set bonus in mind.
---
Here is something that would be more correctly in the other slots: [https://imgur.com/a/qBxwBjQ](https://imgur.com/a/qBxwBjQ) 
---
Not 100% certain on all the pieces yet tho like Band Of Earthen Might, instead you could go 2 Tarnished Elven Ring. Backwood Helm and the AV Xbow is also a better option if its out.
---
Elemental also has inherent SP and a decent mana pool to better support healing, too.
---
I see.
---
So-
---
Pally One: 31/11/0 with 9 left over for BoK, Imp Devo Aura, and only 1/3 Lasting Judgment.
---
Pally Two: 33/0/17 with 1 left over for Imp BoM and BoW, Imp Ret Aura, and only 1/3 Lasting Judgment.
---
Pally 3/4 (and 6+): 33/0/7 with 11 left over for 3/3 Lasting Judgment, 2/2 Imp Judgment, and will be responsible for Seals/Judgments, Blessing of Light OR Salvation AND Resistance Auras.
---
Pally 5: 30/21/0 for Blessing of Sanctuary, Imp Conc Aura, and only 1/3 Lasting Judgment.
---
Paladins other than 3/4 should NOT be Sealing/Judging, and those two only when directed.
---
Am I on the right track here? Thanks a lot for your help.
---
Age of Conan was fun, for a little while.
---
And then were was some Korean shit MMO that was basically RNG:The Game.
---
The only thing I can think of with relevancy to that is Path of Exile.
---
And its not a WoW killer, because its not an MMO RPG. Its just an ARPG that has been kicking D3's shameful ass for years.
---
That's the best reason to roll a male character when going healer.
---
You get to look pretty with muscles. What's not to love?
---
War hammer online was SO sick. I remember my cute little green skin squig hunter &lt;33
---
Uh, neither me nor anyone around me really welcomed any of those changes. The feedback ranged from "this sucks, they ruined the world" to "meh I only care about raiding"
---
I was really into raiding at the time, was super hyped for the expansion launch, leveled to cap in the first 24 hours, went hard on the first raid... but I don't know - everything just sucked? I guess lore and inertia carried the playerbase through the end of Wrath, but before Firelands dropped everyone was gone. There wasn't even a 10-man left. Myself included.
---
Literally the *only* good thing about Cata was once again having difficult heroics but those got nerfed to shit within one patch.
---
I had a ton of fon with Age of Conan.  Was an absolute blast until late game, especially when it first came out and was popular.  Also, tits.
---
I would think the whole point to experiencing content is not using a guide...
---
Probably some podcasts, and mostly the ingame music with some people chatting over discord
---
I agree. My friends an I quit before firelands. I was just saying that the concept of the cataclysm was exciting, especially for those who'd played for 6 years already and got tired of the same old content.
---
It's funny, the game obviously was initially hugely successful thanks in part to its Star Wars brand. But it had very unique features that set it apart from most other MMOs. It's main claim to fame to the MMO genre was it absolutely redefined the 'leveling grind', where leveling was actually extremely fun and remains to this day the best part about the game. I also think it brought unique features in space combat, huttball, incredible customization with the UI with no addons required, crew skills, cover system for certain classes
---
The former game director said that after the game's first few months, when the initial hype died down and they started losing subs, the developers decided to push the game to be more WoW-like and he said he regretted that decision. And making it more WoW-like didnt help the bleeding.
---
Except your guide is about giving advice to anyone choosing to play a non-descript class.  When I say "you" I say it in a collective sense, not a specific sense).  YOU (singular) choosing to play paladin solely for the free 40 mount (not to mention that at level 60 the mats to get the paladin charger could sometimes be well over the average cost of a regular mount and was a very time consuming quest chain) doesn't change anything from your guide.  So unless you're writing the guide to just admire your own math and writing skill, you mentioning that you're playing a paladin (once again speaking in memes...) has about as much to do with this conversation as the price of tea in china.
---
I recall we took an average of current DKP with existing raiders, and gave each of their raiders that value. 
---
in hind sight, I agree.
---
gotta complete it by setting up a vent server too!
---
Blizzard nowadays ruins everything they touch.  They won't give us progressive itemization and not only will it trivialize pve but it ruin the whole flow of pvp making mages / locks / priests and elem shams op.
---
Yeah because you were horde with tremor totem.
---
ya, I recall that was their issue. They didn't have enough to fill a 40m raid at the Aussie time.
---
It's interesting to reflect back on the DKP systems in vanilla. Pretty terrible now, lol.
---
nope, alliance 
---
All this planning and he's still shitting in a sock.
---
Keep up the good work. Love the production value and art direction.
---
Desperate prayer is amazing in any setting. No binding heal so if it's a one of us will die you can heal an prayer as soon as the heal goes off saving both.  It's also amazing for shadowpriest because you can prayer plus renew and go back into shadowform.
---
Try http://vanillafriends.com/
---
For leveling it isn't bad because you can rely on spirit tap and stack tons of spirit. At 60 you don't have this luxury. You'll be sucking down mana juice more than anyone, especially if you pvp.
---
Only once you're in AQ40 gear or twinked out. So, not for a while.
---
I know. We can only have so much fury warriors
---
I'll be going Warlock so I don't have to compete with 25 other melee dps. 
---
I wanna see an Orc Warrior room, themed like Orgrimmar. Or a Gnome Mage room with spell tomes and steampunk stuff everywhere.. Ooh, or a Troll Shaman room with totems and sand and palm trees... someone needs to build an E-Cafe like this.
---
However you can get water from mages in any pve or group Pvp situation. I mean if your puging bgs as a priest you will have to drink your own water, but, given how easy it is to get into a group for Pvp as a priest, you can get a mage and it won’t be a problem.
---
So it won’t really cost them a thing. I recently played a mage, and would throw water at a priest so he could join my group. I feel like it is expected to give water to your casters in a group, given it will be a Muriel’s benefit.
---
But all of your ideas are just shitty capitalist price gouging that takes advantage of other platers. They also rely heavily on an established server economy which we won't have at launch. Seems like you see gold making as a race to the top against your own faction. You can keep that to yourself.
---
I mained enhancement through cataclysm. Even raided no problem and solod most pve group content. Fuck the haters.
---
Grats on the nightfall (after the 5 other shamans)
---
Pink dress?
---
Going to be Intresting seeing the redit posts when alot of the people who never played classic or private servers realise the grind and the lack of things to do, and the fact that they might be able to only do mc, unless they can commit to serious raiding.
---
And the casuals (me included) getting destroyed in bgs against bwl purples
---
How is orc warlock the duel king?
---
I cant fucking wait until classic.  I've got the feels right now.  
---
Ironic, it could save others from killing WoW, but not itself
---
Just remember that Tauren druid forms look way cooler than NElf druid forms. Easy choice.
---
FF14 could outlast WoW at this rate
---
Haha yeah its true its "fun to try" new things that no one else is doing until you realize how terrible you are and why no one else does it this way.
---
The expectations of quality the guild/raid group enforces is a 1 to 1 relationship with the quality of the raid. So if you want to play Boomie in MC, don't be mad when people don't carry you or you're in a low quality raid. Harsh reality of the game
---
Thats why my FDK is benched. RIP
---
Can we get that woman to draw "alot of wow stuff" because I think that would be hilarious
---
Mergers is the obvious solution. In vanilla they got screamed at to merge servers but never did, probably because it makes the game look like it's shrinking. They constantly released new servers desite the heap of old ghost town servers around. The common advice to new players was to not roll on "recommended" servers because the max level experience is garbage. This time around I can't see them making the same mistake. Or maybe they will, dunno. Personally I am just going to roll on the highest pop oce realm whatever that is to hopefully avoid this problem.
---
I would just sit in the throne room when I wasnt doing anything.  The ghosts whispering are so so cool.  And you can see the blood stain on the floor still too.   
---
What are you doing my son? Succeeding you...father.
---
3-10 million? I admire their optimism.
---
I’ll say it again, wow ended up killing wow ( now under 2 mil subs I hear), ever since they deviated from the classic known to work formula.... and get this, wow will save wow , when classic and hopefully eventually tbc and wotlk servers are up, but hopefully this time they keep all expansions running at the same time. Also remove ion as game master he sucks at that.
---
Joanas guide (and most leveling guides) iirc utilised almost every non-elite quest you could find including the fetch/travel quests that crossed continents which very few people would know to pick up. They would squeeze as much XP/hr out as they could so doing all the quests while grinding was the basic plan. If a quest was skipped, it was likely really hard or super tedious. Typically all the dungeon feeder quests would get done up to the harder elite quests. If you want to experience as much content as possible, a classic leveling guide is like a curated thorough experience.

You should consider going in blind though and winging it for your first playthrough. It's adventurous and maybe more authentic that way, at least imo.

In vanilla, if the game couldn't find an icon for something, it would use this image. 
---
&gt;I would like to see how the community thinks Blizzard should handle these dead servers.
---
Sharding to reduce the chance of dead servers.
---
Why not use Beaststalker's Boots in your bis list? 
---
Blizzard, Activision and Blizzard-Activision are 3 separate companies.
---
&gt; Mergers is the obvious solution.
---
Congrats, your server just merged with one full of Asmongold followers.
---
What.the.actual.fuck. how dare you have a different opinion to me
---
&gt; Notice how much less of an impact RNG has on the game in TBC or WotLK, compared to vanilla.
---
But this was a good thing
---
Enh absolutely does not dominate PvP in vanilla. You're lucky if you don't get run over 4 out of every fights.
---
- Druid, I love tanking as Druid. Did it in retail, and Nost and still love it. I also love the flexibility, as long as you got a gearset you can still do something for what the fight calls for. Cat form DPS set, healing set to help heal decurse etc.. Plus I love the open world pvp as druid, you can escape nearly anything and fight on your terms.
---
- Shaman, I like totem twisting and chain heal.
---
- Mage, probably my favorite DPS class if I had to choose one.
---
- Warlock, 2nd favorite only because I hate being summon bitch/farming soul shards.
---
- Rogue, Fun to PVP with/twink with.
---
That's why they floated the idea of sharding at the start. Mergers are way more disruptive to the server's community than a couple of weeks of sharding.
---
Again, thanks a lot!
---
Except Bliz was a big business from day one. And the "milking" didn't start until well after WOW was in its decline phase. 
---
This doesn't match with WOW history in most ways. 
---
make 2v2 great again
---
What is the release date? 
---
Exactly. I want to be efficient with my limited time, but I also don't want to skip over an entire zone or dungeon because someone calculated that grinding winterspring yeti's is 2% better exp-per-hour.
---
No Sharding
---
No Mergers
---
Just make fewer realms but cap the pops on them much higher. an 8k pop server can lose 3/4ths of its population and still be fine.
---
You know the dropoff is going to happen, so just raise the freaking server caps so when the dropoff happens the server is still fine. I have no idea why the community fight this particular option. I really don't.
---
"Big servers ruin communities!" - Oh and mergers don't? 3 Scarab Lords on 1 server due to mergers doesn't harm the community or the feel of classic?
---
"What if the populations don't drop!?" - This is a dream thats never going to come true. People will leave, thats just a fact. 
---
I don't get it. Personally this seems like a really easy thing to solve...
---
I guess I'm looking for a balance. I want to be efficient with my time, but I also want to make sure I experience each zone and dungeon possible - even if it means a slight loss in leveling speed. However, if there are a handful of quests that are just through-and-through garbage/a waste of time and don't help me see some sort of new area I wouldn't have already, then it'd be good to know to skip it.
---
&gt; Sharding to reduce the chance of dead servers.
---
It also merged with 2 other servers with a completely different economy, and now your servers Auction House is insane, and there's 3 scarab lords on AQ mounts on Ironforge bridge!
---
#JustClassicThings
---
&gt; Mergers are way more disruptive to the server's community than a couple of weeks of sharding.
---
At least someone out there agrees with me on this point. Mergers are absolutely brutal to communities.
---
"summer 2019"
---
I see no question here
---
Awesome - I've saved that google docs link on dungeons. That's a huge piece of what I was looking for.
---
/r/cringe
---
Merge dying servers together to create healthy servers.
---
Its 1000% going to happen
---
Yeah, this post isn’t about leveling via nostalgia
---
Asmongold's server won't be a candidate for merges. They only have to merge dead servers with other dead servers.
---
I absolutley do not want to play on a "superserver" with 8-10k pop. It absolutley is not vanilla and everything becomes a pain in the ass due to extreme overpopulation.  Farming... goodluck lol
---
My poison is Druid, tank specifically but ill list general stuff. I love it but you need to understand some things.
---
1. No regular old fashioned revive. Being the only one that can heal/resurrect in a dungeon is a pain when everyone runs back if you mess up healing or whatever.
---
2. Heckling. If you try to not be a healer you will get heckled often. Joining guilds and trying to be a different spec will generally either get laughed at, thrown out or be expected to be a great player - which everyone should carry their weight but its magnified in your case.
---
3. Join WSG? Hope you like or are good at flag carrying. I hate it personally. 
---
4. People commonly refer to Druids as the weakest healers so be prepared to be last prio for healer loot.
---
5. Can't drink potions while shapeshifted. Sucks as bear especially as you cannot afford to leave bear form.
---
6. Get comfortable with that Decurse spell. You will use it a lot.
---
7. Innervates will generally go to your priest healers.
---
8. Farming Gnomeregan for your BIS Cat DPS weapon...multiple times as it has only 3 charges. So stock up. 
---
9. Going OOM in any fight that lasts over 2 minutes a Balance druid.
---
10. Slow ass casting speed for your best heal so you will generally overheal more often if not skilled.
---
11. Aquatic form quest sucks dick, you gotta run to westfall/silverpine and gotta dive deep as hell. Generally people die to fatigue damage getting it.
---
12. Reagents and buffing. So many people to buff and quite a few bag slots wasted carrying the reagents. 
---
There is this rule in movies / books where you can basically set up the rules in the start during the first 10 % of the story, but once you've established those rules your stuck with them. The world rules can be crazy, like magic exists and everyone can use it, and your audience will accept it but once you're done with that phase you can't change them or your readers/viewers reject the changing landscape and lose touch with the story.  I feel like games should do the same.  
---
Has a game ever survived being changed in a large way after it's found it's audience?  I think of FF14's first launch but that game mostly failed on arrival so I'm not sure it holds up.
---
Based on private servers the answer is no. Or at least the one I play on
---
yea, i know about slow mana regen, downranking, 5 sec rule and all that. was just curious if there was anything about either class that would make them more engaging than the other
---
he's right guys, it's time to follow my dreams of being a health per 5 geared mace rogue!
---
What could go wrong!?
---
Is there going to be an auction house?
---
PvE or PvP? 
---
Its how I was then, and its how I'll be soon.  Destruction Warlock is my current plan.
---
Personally I'm gonna spend the first day making my characters (ie names I like) on every server so that when the merges happen I don't lose my names!
---
Keep in mind that +RWS has a very heavily dropping off curve for benefits. Really you just want +5 and to leave it at that because it gives you roughly 2.8~ hit (since the hit cap isn't quite 9% it works). After +5 you need +15 to get another point of hit, and it's just not worth it. 
---
+4 would give roughly 2% hit, so that's also nice. All the items you mentioned are good, but wearing all of them at once would be a waste.
---
Got really excited for a second as I thought you were about to mention a popular Aussie PuG  clan on my Icecrown server back in the day...
---
I cannot remember the name of it for the life of me, but I do remember the group formed purely out of a spite for the DKP system. Long story short they ended up becoming fully T2 geared and beat their actual US guilds to Naxx, all from random Aussie players and WoW forum organisation lol.
---
Very ironic considering at the time there was a big “hardcore” PVE shift happening in the race to Naxx and guilds were going overboard with hidden raid reserve lists, DKP systems, “ranked” class spots etc...
---
Great pic above too, would love to see this all happen again in some way with Aussies/NZ’s all teaming up.
---
what is CPGP? is it same as EPGP?
---
&gt;I can't see them making the same mistake.
---
You and I are living on completely separate planets.
---
No "Watching porn and jacking it" option for playing Paladin?
---
I agree 10 million seems high. But 3 million seems to be reasonable. Not sure if that's a reasonable low,but certainly a good middle. Perhaps 2-4 million at launch? Since it's included in the retail wow sub, I imagine nearly every live player will at least make a toon to "check it out" I doubt many live players will get past lvl 20 unless they already know what's in store for them in classic. Aka how "difficult" the game is vs retail 
---
An old professor once told me: a good idea presented terribly is a terrible idea. 
---
Unless you're on the tippity top of the competitive hierarchy, it will not affect you whatsoever. I agree that every single pserver has some shenanigans, but unless you're in a competitive progression guild at the very top you will literally never be affected by it at all.
---
Summer.
---
The only way anyone can think that it won't drastically alter group dynamics in Vanilla WoW, especially when involving PUGs or randoms, is that they are thoroughly ignorant of Vanilla WoW.
---
It is far better that Activision Blizzard just do a zero tolerance policy where if you mess up your loot, you have to accept that fact. Just be careful when dealing with bop loot.
---
Unpopular opinion: but if they could get Wow Classic working on Mobile devices or even the switch in addition to the computer, that would be amazing! I have a great computer, but I tend to spend more time on my phone these days.
---
Diablo fan were not upset that Diablo will now be on the phone. They were upset because the changes and any upgrades were done for mobile. And they wanted something new. Instead the fans that are mostly PC gamers were abandoned by Blizzard for the mobile market.
---
Melee hunter all the way.  
---
The server I'm playing on emphatically stated they will continue operating.
---
That being said, I'm very careful to not burn out, and the way I'm doing that is by only experimenting/trying out new builds/new classes/new routes, etc.
---
I'm not actually playing "proper" and progressing raids. Though I do raid a lot.
---
Hope the humidity isn’t too high
---
Merging servers ruins player and guild names, and economies if they're different. It's why I've been saying that sharding for very early (only) launch isn't as bad as the alternative, even if it is shit and I don't want it at all either. 
---
pez dispenser lookin ass...
---
If you get increased stealth talent you can go 2 points less as a NE rogue. A great rogue player sorrana(r14) plays NE rogue for that reason. Of course that's a PVP thing, anyone will tell you human for pve.
---
Damnit that game had potential. F
---
25% stun resist is what he is referring to i guess?
---
Been saying the same thing since it was announced. Mergers ruin the entire concept of community Vanilla is famed for. 
---
Very much this. The game might not be at its strongest, but given the new business model, and the lack of freaking out, I genuinely believe even with less than half the subs as wrath (where the subs were the highest ever), Retail is probably making more money at this moment. Can you say that’s failing? It’s doing what it is supposed to do, putting money in the pockets of share holders and employees. The game might be worse than legion, and lots of ya might hate it (as I do), but there are a shit ton of players dumping cash into a game they are currently in love with. 
---
Other than the obvious, why is there so much significance on mounts?
---
A server with 8k pop and no dynamic respawns/shared quests no sharding would be completely DOA, 95%+ of people would drop out within the first 2 weeks. Many vanilla quests literally can only support 2-3 people doing them at the one time. You may as well disable questing on the servers.
---
The same way they handled server population issues in vanilla, by offering free transfers.
---
Sharding is worse, merge communitys into one.
---
Every knows orc shamans are the coolest. example Thrall.
---
Starts with an “m” and ends in “erger”
---
1) Shaman. I never got the chance to play one in vanilla but was always fascinated by them. I've been playing one on a private and it feels tailor made for me. It's a strange class with lots of fun little nicknacks and weird. incongruous abilities. I love having a varied toolkit and being extremely adaptable. This time around I'm going to resist my persistent rerollitis and stick to just two characters, so having one that's so flexible is a big boon to me. I'm also perpetually broke so I fully expect to be ghost wolfing around way into the 50's.
---
2) Rogue. Exploring the world as a subtlety rogue is pure magic. I love sneaking around, skipping past trash, sapping a mob and looting the quest item chest, and then sneaking out while everyone else is slowly fighting through a minidungeon full of mobs. I love shadowing enemy faction players and deciding if and when to strike. I love sneaking through instances solo and pickpocketing. I loved brewing poisons and lockpicking. I loved sneaking into enemy capital cities and having a look. I loved the class fantasy of a world where people are wielding fire, demon magic, channeling divine power to bring the dead back to life, and you're just a sneaky bastard who's keeping pace with grit, determination, and cunning. (It's also why I really feel disenchanted with modern sub rogues who are all about mysterious shadow magic and stuff).
---
3) Hunter. My first character was one. I loved collecting weird, unoptimized pets that no one else used like crabs and gorillas. My trusty grab stuck with me for most of the game. Got a lot of whispers from people. I did have a pet cat I'd pull out when I wanted to use Eyes of the Beast and Prowl around through an enemy outpost.
---
4) Warrior. Same reason as one of my rogue reasons. You're just a guy or girl with a sword or axe (and most of the time not even a ridiculous one but a workmanlike piece you pried out of some bosses cold dead hands.
---
I cannot imagine playing on a phone effectively with as many buttons as classic wow has.
---
Idk why you're hammering this point so hard. This is the weirdest theorycrafting I've seen: how much water you theoretically will go through as a priest.
---
Well, unless you're just raiding every night and not ever soloing, then you're going to go through a lot of water as a priest. My own experience of playing priests, as well as almost every other class in the game at some point, is that priests sit on their asses sucking down water more than any other.
---
Even with dynamic respawns it sucks. The world doesn’t feel dangerous, there is no exploration. Everything is dead and everywhere is crawling with people.
---
The server may feel alive but it’s to much. I can run and finish just about any quest without a group cause everything is farmed to the point that I can single pull spawns as they pop.
---
Community is gone too. Sure there is a community but you’re just a face in the crowd on the superservers. Almost like retail except you know you’re all on the same server.
---
The only point I’m disagreeing with is to the degree of comparing the priests downtime compared to other mana classes. Mages and Wars will be eating/drinking way more often.
---
Agree... I think RIFT may be my all time favorite MMO. They even lured me back for a bit with PRIME, but it wasn’t close to the same. Very upsetting, I still wish WoW would incorporate a Chloromancer healing style spec or an Archon support spec someday. 
---
Even druids?
---
Clustered action bars maybe? PvE would work ok. PvP would definitely suffer.
---
Your story almost exactly reflects my experience with WoW. Minus the pserver part. I'm happy to hold off for a few more months. 
---
This is me now.
---
Unpopular opinion here. Blizzard should put out LESS servers for the initial rush and have queues because if eventually there’s still a queue after a couple weeks or so, start opening up fresh servers to accommodate. You can always add salt to a recipe but it sucks having to try and make something less salty. 
---
Honest opinion of best professions @ 60 undead mage pvp
---
Mirror image ftw
---
ele is better then enh the entire time your 60 
---
Haha yeah sorry typo. Stupidly wrote it thinking contribution points.
---
To all the people that say enhance is bad don't know to target mages and there are alot of mages on the alliance if you grounding totem, purge then earth shock to interrupt it will get you close enough to get those 1 shot WF smacks to send those gnomes flying. feelsgoodman
---
Your right... that was an unpopular opinion.
---
Yes there will be an auction house. It existed since original release.
---
Been practicing exploration route just in case. So far as a Dwarf Priest, I got to level 7 at 90 minutes.
---
What I achieved in this process is:
---
* Flight Path: Stormwind, redridge mt, duskwood, westfall
---
* Hit level 5 by the time I ended my exploration route in goldshire and picked up the 2 quests of exploring the mines. level 5 was achieved around 55 min mark.
---
* I assume, when I passed by the human starting zone, I would be able to tag atleast 3 wolves. This is important.
---
Hearth back to the dwarf starting zone and begin questing specific quests that is mainly going from point A to point B. During this time, I would assume, since I am running back n forth 2 times in this area, I should be able to manage to secure 5 more wolves to complete the first quest recieved when you start as a dwarf. Around this time I am near or at level 6. Buy my spells and make my way back to Kharnos, stopping at brewhall village first to pick up an easy quest that leads me to Kharanos. Hit those quick quests that doesn't require tagging mobs and boom you're at 7.
---
At this point, you should be one of the few solo players ahead of the pack but stuck behind the 3-5 man grind groups killing bears, wolves, wendigo. As a level 7, you can make your way towards the tundrid hills and grind off of boars until you are 8. Get your next spell and go to Gnomeran and kill those gnomies for cloth to begin working on lesser magic wand. Once you have the wand - it's smooth sailing and eventually join any group who are at your level or higher. 
---
What race and class are you going? 
---
Currently my playtime on this test run as a dwarf priest has me at level 8 at 2hr 20min mark. and I have an additional flightpath - duskwood and explored deadwing pass. 
---
I don't think there was a good dagger build until high 40s, and even then the build was tailored towards grinding specific mobs that you could essentially kill with an ambush + coldblood evisc.
---
In correct, my route resulted with 12s iirc, more than enough to get my level 6 spells. 
---
&gt; Which leads me to believe the typical FOTM classes that rotate out “normally” due to buffs and nerfs won’t actually happen, rather things will be just how they are.
---
For a lot of players who think they know the FOTM (or rather, Flavour of the Eternity) classes and specs this is a bonus. They don't want a living game where they have adjust to balance patches, they want a fossilised game with 100% certainty that their DPS warrior will be king of the hill, forever and ever, amen.
---
even with sharding, we dont know if this method may still be viable. How many players per shard, is it still competitive to tag or a non-issue. Because "Time is money my friend". Every second counts in the launch race of getting ahead of the pack. 
---

'TIL THE LIGHT DIES IN YOUR EYES
---
slaying my enemies then ripping there heads off for 31 silver each in av. not really a secret but a good way to make good when you do nothing but pvp at the endgame.
---
More wipes than the entirity of cata? Someone didn't do the dungeons early on. :p I loved that level of difficulty, reminded me of doing vanilla dungeons in terms of damage/healing, mana being relevant and CC being required - but with actual mechanics on top. So many cries got it nerfed. 
---
I don't think it could work in any capacity.
---
You have at least 30 abilities that are useful for certain classes.
---
Even clustered somehow it would take up most of the screen. And your reaction times would be so awful that it just wouldn't be fun.
---
The switch could work for when it is docked. If it was similar to ffxiv. Which works great with controller. But they don't have as many abilities as classic wow.
---
There was a nice solution proposed on the battle.net forums several months ago involving dynamically spawning instances of servers, and then reabsorbing same-named spawns into each other if and when they didn't maintain enough players to become their own server.
---
For example, let's say you join Blackhand. Then some popular streamer does too, and 50,000 other people all join the same server. After a certain threshold is reached, Blackhand spawns Blackhand-1, and new attempts to make characters on Blackhand end up on Blackhand-1. Let's say another 50,000 people try to join. No problem, spawn Blackhand-2, and they end up there. Blackhand, Blackhand 1 and Blackhand 2 are all separate, and people playing on one can't interact with each other just as if they're unique servers. But all character names on the entire Blackhand group have to be unique. If Legolassy exists on Blackhand-1, you can't create a Legolassy on Blackhand-2, but neither can you interact with her.
---
Then several months later after the population dies down, any spawns that happen to have a large enough population to stand on their own will be given new names, and those that don't merge into the original named server. For example, let's say Blackhand-2 has 5000 or whatever players on it, it becomes Blackfoot and is its own unique server. Whereas players and guilds on Blackhand, Blackhand-1, and Blackhand-3 all merge to simply Blackhand.
---
It doesn't solve _all_ of the problems associated with dead servers, but it solves _some_ of them.
---
you should already have that setup. Hope into a P.Serv, create your class/race and name so a folder is all setup for you. Download all your addons and have it all binded the way you like it and that's it. 
---
Once classic comes out, you just copy over your "character name" folder. 
---
Dude this is so cool
---
Haha!
---
I bet all the really big streamers are going to roll PvE. Otherwise they will get griefed constantly in the open world. I intend to roll PvP unless for some reason my friends decide to go PvE. As /u/TheScyphozoa pointed out, servers with big streamers are likely to very populated so they won't get merged. Though there could be population imbalances on those servers so faction specific transfers could happen, if Blizz care about it.
---
The first alliance Ony kill on my server didn't have dwarf priest.  Took us 9 tries to get her down with tanks stance dancing. Next time we we raided we had a different tank and we had fear ward.  We couldn't down her.  Bad tanks need fear ward on Ony but bad tanks are pretty likly to fail on Ony even with fear ward.
---
I also play(ed) on that server. I remember your guild. Conclave of Shadows...Genesis...so many
---
&gt; retail is a better game for most
---
So why do so few play and enjoy it? 
---
&gt; Though there could be population imbalances on those servers so faction specific transfers could happen, if Blizz care about it.
---
Uh, so if I'm Horde on a PvP server that has no streamers, Blizz might abduct me from my home and put me on Asmongold's server so his fanbois have more Horde to fight against??
---
Nah, it’s great.  I see it.  
---
I’ve got chills
---
So I was looking at random celebrities' net worth when I decided to look up Chris Metzen. Ended up clicking on a Reddit thread in Google and I saw I had a message. You reply to this comment 2 months after I made it, and the first word is Chris Metzen...
---
WTF
---
&gt; Personally I don't entirely buy into the popular notion in this sub that nobody will take ferals. 
---
My raiding guild didn't have a single restro druid.  Most of our druids healed in raids, but they were all speced feral.  Our attitude was that eventually, gearing will overcome most issues with spec and since we're a casual raiding guild letting people spec how they wanted was fine.
---
Oh, for sure, but in the "average day-to-day life" it's quite medieval. Disco floors are a bad fit.

If I can get two full years of enjoyment out of just classic alone then that I will be more than satisfied considering I was bored with BFA in less than two months. As someone who has played during vanilla and has played more recently I think it's very likely the game will hold my interest for the full two years with the occasional short break between raid releases to keep things fresh.   
---
I'm not sure what will come next but there will be a hell of a lot more content to explore and enjoy than I find in retail wow even if I'm doing it over again for the 8th time. Classic has incredible replay-ability because of how much it encourages the social elements and that's what draws me in every time. 
---
I think WotLK only felt OK for me because I was ahead of the catch up mechanics. Even though the late Wrath 5 man dungeons dropped gear that was better than early raid gear, I was still in better gear at the time and didn't mind. But the problem at the end of that was seeing the greater pattern, knowing that next expansion would be the same, and why do I need to be striving for success when I can jump in at any time and catch up?
---
The [possibly strongest argument](https://wow.zamimg.com/uploads/screenshots/normal/226488-vestments-of-the-shifting-sands.jpg) for draenei in classic.
---
Ok.
---
In all fairness, I wore that same robe on my **Paladin** for a while. So if you think you looked like an idiot, my Paladin looked like a mixture between a Priest, a Warrior and a Shaman. 
---
Which however incidentally might exactly be the kind of classes Paladin was a Hybrid between. Excluding Shaman maybe.
---
Just saying.
---
With your level of commitment, you do not need to worry about respeccing for Naxx. Or AQ40 really. Most likely BWL wont happen either.
---
Which is fine, you just dont need to worry about that.
---
That's the BC version though. Classic version was rectangular.
---
Are you even speaking English? Poopsocking? Get the fuck out of here, lol.
---
I'm playing The Elder Scrolls: Online at the moment. A rather casual game in many ways. But the questing is fun and it's fun you are more free in how to develop your character compared to most RPGs. There are some other nice aspects as well with regards to game design and generally the game looks quite beautiful to me. It's also just fun to explore the world, navigating solo-able world dungeons called delves, etc...
---
I do find the dungeons not as fun as in (Vanilla / TBC era) WoW though. Not really sure why. PVP might be fun, I have yet to try it. The Cyrodiil PvP area seems interesting in this regard, like some sort of Alterac Valley in that there's loads of things to do besides just killing one another. And the match never really ends if I am not mistaken.
---
Make no mistake: I am really looking forward to WoW Classic, but this is a decent game in the meanwhile and no monthly subscription required to enjoy most (all?) of the game (though you might have to pay for expansions to access more areas, dungeons, raids and some classes).
---
I've play BDO since the beta in NA.  Once I came back for Legion, I felt exactly like that.  Cheap sell out on lore. Classes and PvP became real shitty IMO.  WoD at least, my class was fun.   About a month into Legion, I went back to BDO.  At least that slot machine had value in gear and time.  Classic may hopefully break these slot machine shackles.
---
Ugh no. The screen is way too small. I played Order and Chaos on my IPad Pro for awhile and ended up quitting because that screen was too small as well. I can’t even imagine trying a 10 or a 40 man raid on my IPhone. It would be a huge cluster-F 😝😝🙄🙄
---
Gnomes own technology that is on higher level than our modern devices.
---
Dwarves also operate similar technology due to their close relations with gnomes.
---
Tauren are pretty much native Americans.
---
Blood elves have magic as defining feature of their race and their kingdom is filled with flying platforms and teleportation orbs instead of staircases.
---
Goblins also operate advanced technology, although not on the same level as gnomes. But they have cars (sort of) and radios, so definitely not medieval.
---
Draenei managed to build a spaceship and even without that seem to be more advanced than gnomes.
---
Trolls are Mesoamerican.
---
Forsaken create chemical WMDs and do this whole Frankenstein stuff.
---
Humans are pretty much the only race that could be described as medieval, but only if you really try a lot. Stormwind is an absolute monarchy (something that, outside of Byzantine Empire, wasn´t really a thing in medieval Europe), they used mechanical constructs for harvest. And that´s not counting their mages.
---
And at least in Orgrimmar, where they are (I think) operated by goblins during the event, disco floors make 100% sense, because goblins.
---
Good thing you wouldnt have to. Because... as the title of the discussion you are literally replying to reminds you, a significant number of people will leave the damn servers a few months in anyway. None of them would BE at 8k 24/7 so why you people keep creating this boogie man is beyond me.
---
Its completely ridiculous.
---
"bruh" blah blah nonsensical whine because got caught saying dumb shit lol bye
---
&gt; Asmongold's server won't be a candidate for merges. They only have to merge dead servers with other dead servers.
---
Congrats your server just merged with 2 other low pop servers and now theres 3 Scarab Lords...
---
Go ahead and keep trying to pretend that Mergers aren't absolute killshots to community.. its a lie youll never be able to convince anyone of. Mergers are cancer and should be avoided like the plague.
---
They split too much assets and I think it was ahead of the tech time.  Every race with unique variant of classes, and you can body block!? Loved it.
---
&gt; I absolutley do not want to play on a "superserver" with 8-10k pop. It absolutley is not vanilla
---
But merging a bunch of empty servers together is vanilla? Sharding like crazy at launch is vanilla?
---
I feel like the "But thats not vanilla" excuses gets trotted out only when you think you can make a point with it, and ignored otherwise.
---
Critical Role Season 2 again from the beginning and/or
---
Joe Rogan podcast
---
&gt; Community is gone too. Sure there is a community but you’re just a face in the crowd on the superservers. Almost like retail except you know you’re all on the same server.
---
You are right. So lets solve that community problem by merging 4 low pop servers into one.. So that... the community...
---
Wait.. What? At least a large server has a community, and the populations of servers drop over time anyway. 8k pop at the start isnt going to be 8k 6 months later, it will be half of that, and we had 4k pop servers in vanilla. But you would rather merge servers and ruin 4 communities at once forcing them into a frankenstein of a community where you are a just a mixed renamed face in 4 crowds instead? How does that make sense?
---
Sad thing is if you play what you like and its not strong, you wont really play any end game content. People think with classic they will get a similar experience to vanilla but its gonna be soo different. Even average guilds wont let people with unviable classes raid with them. Its not 2006 anymore, people know tacs now and require raiders to be fully meta. Sad but true. 
---
Sounds similar to how Blade &amp; Soul did it's world zones. It definitely sounds like a good idea but idk if blizzard has the server tech for this just yet. 
---
&gt;  and now theres 3 Scarab Lords
---
End of the fucking world right there. Anyway do you have a real reason they're bad?
---
&gt;Congrats your server just merged with 2 other low pop servers and now theres 3 Scarab Lords...
---
Is there being 3 scarab lords really the worst thing you can think of? Because the trade-off is certainly worth it in this situation. On the one hand, merging a bunch of dead servers allows the players on those servers to actually be able to be part of a community, a core part of an MMORPG. It will allow them to actually do battlegrounds (assuming there's no cross-servers) and actually be able to fill raids or have multiple guilds per server. 
---
On the other hand... 3 scarab lords...? The "cost" of there being 3 scarab lords is basically non-existent compared to this benefit. 
---
I agree that there is a significant community cost to merging, especially if the merges happen later (as in your example, when AQ has already been opened, the server has probably been running independently for at least a year). And I agree that assuming there is some sort of thriving community that the merger can be a "killshot." 
---
But the situation we're contemplating is "dead" servers. These are servers with extremely low populations that basically make playing the game the way it was intended, or getting the Vanilla experience (tm) impossible to attain. 
---
Would you feel better if instead of a "merger" it was a mass-transfer that you could opt out, so you could stay on your ghost-town if you wanted, but everybody else who would prefer to be merged with a more populous server could choose to do so?
---
Thanks for contributing to the discussion. 
---
Nah ele can be very good pre aq
---
Cool thanks. I wonder if without an AH the game would feel more genuine or just annoying
---
Would you like some saltine crackers with that comment?
---
Spotify playlist and a YouTube chillstep/drum and bass playlist when I plan to stream for 40 hrs straight.
---
SL Lock will just kill both..
---
You don't know that
---
Apparently we should all do this. It seems undeniable that despite how horrible forced mergers are for communities..... the classic wow community prefers Mergers as the solution.
---
Mind blowing. I genuinely thought people were serious about maintaining the community feel of classic. Yet its the first thing on the chopping block to solve the first problem.
---
Oh well.
---
Travel speed.
---
Try travelling around Azeroth on foot sometime. 🤣
---
thats why i plan on what i know i can plan for like what classes to level and professions and hints on what to do before 60.
---
Won't work. Not for me but I know many players who will absolutely rush the cap on release, taking days of work and everything. Said players sure are a minority but they will make a large chunk of the playerbase once all the tourists leave. If they screw them up with such a release I'm not sure if that large chunk will still be playing on retail servers.
---
the rectangle version is from alpha or beta wow
---
I think he means these [Raptor Hatchlings](https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Raptor_Hatchling), which according to that site were added in 3.2.0, so i might be wrong.
---
Yeah only mmo I've played without some sort of fast travel was BDO. That game would be annoying without mounts but still my $$$ would be prioritized for gear over a mount early in that game.
---
I never bought gear in WoW, so all good went towards my first mount.
---
It's also handy for picking up chicks and doing donuts in Coldridge valley..
---
There is a lot of travelling in vanilla, mounts make that process much faster (and more enjoyable since it's more fun riding than running on foot!). It's also essential in BG's after lvl 40.
---
Take the amount of threads on reddit from people asking how to make gold for their mount as an indication of how important it is. Before you get the lvl 40 mount, everything else is secondary.
---
To me it sounds like a boring job, to keep camping some graveyard for hours on end. But to each his own.
---
&gt; Would you feel better if instead of a "merger" it was a mass-transfer that you could opt out,
---
I would feel better if we adopted a solution that prevented the dead server scenario from happening in the first place rather than letting servers die then trying all of bandaids after the fact. 
---
I have trouble understand why no one wants to swerve before hitting the pole, rather than just driving into it head first then arguing about how to deal with the injuries afterwards... We know what the problem is (low populations) we know whats going to cause them (mass people leaving the game). But we want to do nothing and let it happen anyway?
---
Okay..
---
I had a almost the same journey but stuck with it in Cata. 
---
If you wanted to wipe there was wiping available. T11 was tough, both the dungeons and the raids. Blizzard's oops was making leveling and world content unfailable which drove many people such as yourself away.
---
Engineering is a must if you want to do competitive PvP.
---
If your playing on a pvp server you will get run down by people with mounts all the time because they know you cant get away.
---
GW2 had the potential to kill wow.
---
they fucked up introducing the downed state and force you into water combat.
---
the synergy of the classes, talents and spells was amazing.  
---
chain stun combos, nukes with preparation time, crucial cool down. the game had it all.  
---
the talents gave you real choice and sometimes completely changed how you played your class.
---
best of all? standardized gear and instant level cap for PvP.  
---
note: I can only talk about the first year of GW2, not sure how the game changed over time
---
&gt; End of the fucking world right there. Anyway do you have a real reason they're bad?
---
They ruin communities and economies wholesale by turning them on their heads. And all of the time spent before said merger the server lives its days out in misery unable to accrue enough people for basic MMO events like World Raids and more.
---
You are the only person who SERIOUSLY doesn't know how negatively server mergers hurt communities.... Thats why they are a last resort...
---
Hahaha that crack bit is fucking accurate my dude
---
M e r g e r s, name issue? make some realms only allow one name, for example Azjol Nerub, Draenor and Silvermoon 3 different realms but until after mergers only one person would be able to get the name on one of the realms.
---
&gt; Thats why they are a last resort...
---
I did say DEAD servers, did I not?
---
Mage can still get away or even kill them with skill.
---
SL Lock will laugh and kill both.
---
At least they can't need on plate.
---
Whatever looks cooler tbh. Neither Berserking or WotF are a gamechanger for priest, and both the unique spells are pretty rubbish.
---
Yes, and I said last resort.
---
How about we address the existence of dead servers so there wont be any at all... instead of allowing servers to die then handling it after the fact?
---
Pre-empt the issue instead of waiting for it to fall apart then praying we can patch it back together again...
---
This is Classic WoW. Blizzard has very little to work with if people are losing interest.
---
Uh...what was your question again?
---
Actually it’s not true, you’re just being an elitist jerk OR you are out of touch with the actual vanilla community. You can’t base anything off private servers, my friends and I are making a guild and already have a roster of about 30 people of tons of “elite” and “meme” specs. I also know a lot of other guild leaders that feel the same way. Sure maybe we won’t get to naxx with tons of sub par specs, but you can definitely do a lot of end game content in any spec as long as players are competent.
---
Let him play what he wants and don’t spread false info.
---
True story ! I’ve played every expansion at some point but i never get hooked like i did back then. Hope vanilla gets me hooked like that again !
---
If you’ve invested time to learn these dungeons well and invested time in your character to be able to handle them with a less than ideal group then there should be no shame in charging for your service. You’re providing them a better chance to succeed; no one likes wasting time and effort putting together a group for nothing.
---
Great question.  I think leveraging your scarcity in a healthy way is perfectly fine.
---
Offering terms of certain items is fair enough in my book.  If nobody wants to accept the terms, they are welcome to find another tank and you can find another group.
---
Now, being unfair and asking for everything and everyone’s first horns is a bit too extreme.
---
I see it as ok. Other classes like mage, rogue, hunter, warlock can grind/make gold using the abilities of their class. As a warrior you can tank. Your just a tradesman selling his service to consumers that need to run the dungeon. There should be no morale complications here, unless your charging super inflated fees which then could possibly be seen as extortion.
---
If you can't wait, why don't you play?
---
Wow you missed my point a lot. Thats the point, im saying that there are a lot of elitists and thats bad. Who the fuck said I am agreeing with them? 
---
I have zero problem with it and have paid tanks on private severs and back in vanilla. The spirit of vanilla, to me, is to make friends, not expect handouts. I mean who knows, maybe you run with them and you have a blast and you group up again in the future for free. 
---
&gt; This is Classic WoW. Blizzard has very little to work with if people are losing interest.
---
That depends. I see it this way.
---
1. Servers launch, tons of people play
---
2. 3 months in, all the tourists that were just trying it out leave.
---
3. Server progresses for 2+ years all the way through Naxx
---
4. People start to lose interest.
---
I just think theres a solution between 1 and 2. If the server pops are large enough to sustain 2k people even after they lost 65% of their playerbase then you have a bunch of servers with 2k people on them, instead of a bunch of servers with 300 people on them. That way, no mergers are needed because 2k people is perfectly fine.
---
As a frosty, locks and boomkins were the dangerous. Rogues were no problem at all. 
---
Can't wait to see the faces of retail players when they realize that they can't transmog and have to look like a bag of mixed candies for months before getting any pvp or tier gear
---
Why would a merge be a killshot..? I swear a dead server is a killshot, not making it playable on the expense of some scarab lords lol. 
---
Scarcity generates demand. Without competition tanks can get away with more and so they do. It doesn't go against the spirit. IMO it builds the games spirit. The fact that not everyone can do everything actually does a loop and in fact everyone can do whatever they want.
---
In the end healers also go trough the thing in raiding where they are the commodity and have more free passes than anyone else. 
---
In fact, anyone geared enough can fetch a solid price for dungeon help as they can literally make the group strong enough not to fail. As a T2 geared shaman I could heal a 4 man DPS group in dungeons without anyone dipping below 50%.
---
One question tho, why would you do said dungeons even for a price? With stuff like DME jump runs with a warrior/rogue and a priest/shaman you are genuinely losing money doing dungeons.
---
Dat robe tho. Crisp!
---
I'm sure discords will pop up when we get close to launch, right now we don't even know what the servers are going to be called or how many there will be.
---
Maybe i am just pessimistic but i think otherwise. Sure there will be lots of players who played in the old days, stopped and coming back for classic. But I think a lot of people will be changing from retail who have the mentality of gear&gt;skill and are also very strict about viable classes. But hey, lets hope that i am wrong, trust me i would be extremely happy. 
---
Kinda hard to make sense of your question but from what I understand you are asking why people who are hyped for classic don't just play on private servers?
---
You answered this question yourself, it's a waste of time because they know they will abandon that character in summer.
---
/shrug I try
---
Because pservers have inaccurate data. And many of them have enormous ping, p2w, and are already at the end of their progression, and finding one that doesn't already have those things isn't worth the work.
---
From human paladin &gt; orc shaman.
---
Finaly at the right side.
---
I'd read some books on eating healthy and exercising, you're gonna need it if you plan on playing Classic :)
---
Define “few.”
---
thats why in my classic wow, we wont allow minmaxers! because they dont have the same kind of fun!
---
I guess we both don’t really know, i might have a biased view because of the guild I’m creating as well as talks with other friends...but hey, let’s conclude that we both want the same thing :)
---
&gt; using ilvl to rank items
---
What do you mean? ilvl is shown as a piece of information, it's not used in the ranking formula.
---
The file I uploaded had a freeze pane at column E; perhaps you can't see any other columns?
---
Columns K - M show the rankings.
---
1. Warrior
---
2. Mage
---
3. Rogue
---
4. Hunter
---
5. Priest
---
6. Shaman
---
7. Paladin 
---
8. Warlock
---
9. Druid 
---
It means right/left hand... I guess...
---
Crazy to think when it was such a complete trainwreck at launch.
---
All I keep hearing about is how warriors are going to be the most popular class in classic so you might not want to worry about it lol
---
But doesn't it? Classics initial lineup were D&amp;D style RPG players, other MMO players, and Warcraft fans. A lot of casuals joined in late classic/BC and then the merger happened not long after, which shortly after, we got BS like the store and the dumpster fire that was Cata, and nothing from downhill after that.
---
Blizzard was a business before sure, but it was not some giant corporation like the EAs/Activisions of the world. It wasn't preying on smaller studios and the devs made games with gameplay in mind first and foremost, rather then sheer profit. Their amazing games are what led them to success.
---
&gt; Scarcity generates demand. Without competition tanks can get away with more and so they do. It doesn't go against the spirit. IMO it builds the games spirit. The fact that not everyone can do everything actually does a loop and in fact everyone can do whatever they want.
---
Interesting thoughts for sure. Thanks for sharing.
---
&gt; One question tho, why would you do said dungeons even for a price? With stuff like DME jump runs with a warrior/rogue and a priest/shaman you are genuinely losing money doing dungeons.
---
This has a simple answer actually. Dungeons to me are fun and enjoyable. There's also a minor tidbit of being treated nicely because of the gear LOL, I can't lie. The DM:E jump stuff wasn't discovered yet back when I was playing on those particular servers but even still, that does take another player (probably a friend?) who knows what they are doing. I'd often play late at night when most were asleep.  I could have made more money farming, maybe mining or herbing but yeah I just found tanking dungeons more enjoyable. In fact if the groups found that out, they'd probably have a hard time wanting to pay me haha.
---
I'll be listening to the game.
---
With you skinning money you can just buy wands dirt cheap on the AH from other enchanters. You should be thinking about BoP items when deciding your professions. 
---
Looking back it seems so, but I figured I would give something a shot other then "REEEEE &lt;insert mechanics&gt; killed the game!"
---
This. One of my friend who stared in cata are looking up dps charts to see which dps Class and spec he should run. Trying to convince him that it's a terrible move and he will quite before reaching 60 if he wants a op class for naxx dps
---
In vanilla they offered free transfers from very high pop realms to very low pop realms to spreadout the playerbase. I can't personally remember them doing it just to balance a lopsided faction population, but it might have happened. You would never be forced to transfer, at least I hope not, though a server merge can be thought of as a forced server transfer as typically it's one server being merged into another and it can kind of suck if your server is the one that is swallowed.
---
I think Asmongold will play PvE or he wouldn't be able to do a single thing in the world while streaming without it becoming a PvP shit show. It's unlikely Blizz would really care about faction balance on a PvE server. I am pretty certain that cross-realm BG's and Battlegroups will be a thing in classic as they were part of Vanilla and solved the massive BG queues which were the biggest problem these realms had.
---
While DM E is a decent source it requires you to find the other healer and one of you needs enchanting and/or mining. Sometimes you just want to mix things up as well.
---
More like "this guy vanilla trailers twice a day". 
---
In all honesty, were enhancement shamans any good?
---
They were in vanilla and will be again but keep in mind warriors are divided in half across two roles.
---
It failed to work in vanilla... The top posts in this discussion says he doubted Blizzard will repeat the same failed strategies. It took less than half a page of replies for someone to recommend that they do exactly what failed last time. lol
---
Honestly the best gold farming methods are already common knowledge. Any “secret” farming methods are unlikely to beat them.
---
Tell me how stabbing your skin in permanent ink with a needle isn’t stupid. 
---
Remember the biggest wow killer, BFA 
---
He's talking about UBRS and scholo. Forgive my ignorance because I never played warrior in vanilla but can't a dps warrior tank those instances fine?
---
Welp, there it is, irrefutable counterevidence.
---
SWTOR was the only game to pull me away from wow for any significant time. It’s sucks what they did with the OCE servers.
---
Why does games nowadays have to keep you occupied forever ? I understand that for MMORPGs there is a natural progression but classic is a revival of the old. If it lasts 2 years and that’s it, it will be two thrilling gaming years for me. 
---
&gt; How did you set the stat priority ?
---
Not that scientifically; definitely an area the needs work if it's the be accurate. I also know stat priority will change depending on your gear. So i thought the user can enter in their stat preference for their character. 
---
How do you think i should do the stat priority?
---
Should i leave it blank so there is no confusion, and provide an example while linking to a sheet that can calc the priority?
---
&gt;  hit for fury says 42 and 10.5 for tanks
---
As it's a separate ranking for tanking vs DPS, the comparison between the value in fury vs tank doesn't actually affect the end ranking. The reason for the decrease was to try to get the average rating of the BIS gear similar. Because tanking cares about a lot more stats, if they were all evenly weighted the tanking rating would be a substantially higher number and i think that would have looked weird.
---
&gt; How did you calculate the proc points for chance on hit weapons ? I see only dead values
---
The dead values mainly come from the DPS calc sheet linked in the post. They are dead/input values because there is no database to calculate the exact DPS gain for a proc. There are 33,000 spells in the spell database which could be proc'd and no frequency rates.
---
If you have an idea of how this could be automatically looked up let me know, it's the only stat which isn't automatically generated.
---
&gt; Arcanite Reaper are below some of the standard shields
---
Arcanite Reaper is Rank 0 for 2 hand weapons on Patch 0. The "Rank" is based on the slot: the sheet searches for the highest Points of the same slot type. So shields and Reaper are not compared with each other.
---
I'd also recommend you check that calculations are turned on, i uploaded with it in manual so i didn't break anyones computer who can't handle a 14MB file.
---
Yes, ff14 changes drastically and actually gained players 
---
Might be talking about the robe from first boss AQ20 but I thought that was a caster one
---
The problem is sharding does not help population distribution, in fact it will likely do the opposite. People rolling on over populated servers will be given the illusion its balanced without looking at a census and have no reason to look for a less flooded server. Though some people like the private server style of overpopulation (mostly people who want to do the honor grind) I think it's a negative for the game overall. The trick to get an even spread will be login queues, but who knows what they will be set to.
---
Shaman all the way. 
---
5 second rule basically doesn't apply as you will want your manaregen to come from MP5. 100% casting uptime is achievable with heal rank changes in fight and solid gear.
---
Totems are slightly annoying at first but once you get into a habit of redeploying them they will become a fun min-maxing game on the side.
---
AoE healing as your bread and butter in raids is also a thing. AoE healing is way more fun than spot healing for most. Not being on tank healing duty is always freeing as you get to use more of your toolkit.
---
Dungeons rock as a shaman. Perfect toolkit to do niche stuff to make the run smoother + satisfaction you are using more abilities at times than the other 4 people combined. If that's not your thing, the baseline, just heal mod, is completely fine as well.
---
Probably the best PvP spec for DPS/healing baked in a PvE spec out of all the healers. Healing in your PvE spec in PvP is as expected great, but with DPS gear and only the instacast talent in resto tree you might as well melt faces in your resto spec considering how strong it still is.
---
Tldr, shamans are amazing.
---
That's fair - I'm definitely in favor of certain changes that will prevent people from leaving the game. For example, a more spread out progressive content release, progressive itemization or just item rebalancing in general, class (in particular shit-hybrid DPS specs) rebalancing, and possibly new content are all things I'd like. 
---
However, I doubt that even these changes would totally prevent the "tourist-effect," that would lead to dead servers. And unfortunately, judging by what was said at blizzcon, it seems unlikely blizzard will make such changes anyway. I think that's why we've resigned ourselves to our fate. Blizzard sent some pretty clear signals at blizzcon that we will drive into that pole headfirst, and there's not much we can do to stop it, which is why we're talking about how to deal with the inevitable injury
---
Yup, same feeling here.
---
But when I played the classic demo at blizzcon, I loved everything about it. I didn't play much since I want to save myself for the actual game, but man, I can't wait!
---
FFXIV has huge button bloat and most classes use at LEAST 32 abilities.
---
How bad are balance druids for real?  I'm currently playing a t1 hotw resto druid, but I dont want to put in the effort or gold to respect and regear if it's as shit as everyone says.
---
I see! Thanks a lot 
---
In this case sharding is only used as a temporary measure in the first 1-2 weeks of a servers lifespan to fill a server beyond it's usual capacity, so that once tourists are gone you still have a healthy population. If sharding is used solely for that purpose, and only in starter zones, then it's fine. The problem is just trusting Blizzard to stick to that.
---
Saying rushing to 40 and not having enough gold to pay for a mount is the same as losing money is straight up wrong.
---
As you level up items becomes more worth and you’ll have an easier time farming gold. It is likely better, time-wise, to rush and collect gold as you go then deliberately slowing yourself down to farm gold. Also, depending on your leveling style mounts can be less important. 
---
Yes, more than fine in full tier 2 
---
Age of Conan, Warhammer: Age of Reckoning, Rift, SWTOR, WildStar are the ones that come to mind before I stopped counting
---
&gt; By default the sheet shouldn't be set to give defensive stats any value for fury warriors
---
Fair call, will change.
---
&gt; bunch of librams, totems, and idols cluttering up the gear results
---
Ah yes, was testing to see if it could work for other classes.
---
You can filter out the libram slot, or delete the 6 items.
---
Long term i think there is a code for which class can use an item in the database which could help remove those un-usable items.
---
If it's to work for cloth wearers i'm definitely going to need to look at implementing some usability criteria.
---
i dont think it has to do leveraging your scarcity. if your done gearing up then you dont need to do the dungeon anymore and your charging to be a tank for something you wouldnt otherwise do. to me its just that simple you dont need to do the dungeon so you offer to tank for gold since they need items in it 
---
If you're overgeared for the dungeon (tier 2 in 5 mans) and you're not going to get any usable loot from the dungeon then it's totally fine as long as everybody understands the deal. You're essentially guaranteeing a smooth, quick run and it's not fair if everybody is getting loot and you're getting nothing.
---
If you're still gearing and there are drops you want from the instance, then absolutely not. You're putting not bringing anything more to the table than anybody else in the group, regardless of how scare tanks are. 
---
&gt; ilvl shouldn't rank items
---
/u/l453rl453r has the same comment, makes me think you're not seeing the whole sheet because of freeze panes.
---
&gt; Google Docs
---
Agreed, currently formulas I've used won't work in google docs. If there is interest I would fix. 
---
Do you think it's worthwhile putting in the time to fix?
---
I never said private servers was flawless.
---
I would love server merges. I hope that's their solution in Vanilla. I think your vastly overestimating the issue of server merging. The vast majority of people would love having a healthy server.
---
The difference is that vanilla was made by the developers as a game that they'd like to play as opposed to a game that's designed around the same concepts as a slot machine.
---
By the way, I think people who play slot machines are just as mentally absent and brain dead.
---
&gt; But merging a bunch of empty servers together is vanilla?
---
It actually is, considering that is what the community wanted in Vanilla, but Blizzard never did, thus ruining many servers.
---
No offense, but does someone have a tl;dr?
---
Its really really really really bad, if u compare it to all other dps classes except enhancement shaman, because they are even worse.
---
Not really. There is more that retail wow, but far from classic wow when it comes to abilities. 
---
The main issue to begin with is that the game is considered a service rather than a product, and it lives in a wierd no-mans-land between the two definitions. When the game is considered a product, my view applies and when its considered a service, your view applies.
---
I suppose we will have to agree to disagree. Games moving towards a being considered a service is in my (and most gamers eyes) problematic, while the big companies love the change because it allows them total control of their product and opens up new revenue streams.
---
It's basically Activision-Blizzard, EA, Bethesda and other big bois ruining gaming as a whole with this approach and it will come back to bite them in the ass (as it's currently doing for all of the above mentioned with their stocks tanking, executives jumping ship, mass lay-offs etc).
---
So f***ing what nobody knows anything for sure, ever
---
Funny thing is, I dislike difficult games, yet, WoW is the only game ehwre I like difficult raid encounters and I love trying and dying and eventually succeeding. Really strange.
---
But classic is the better game for me just because of the social aspect and the one great big world. Fucking sharding.
---
Ofcourse there will always exist a fringe population of gamers whose sole purpose of playing on private servers is soley financial. However, most they play on private Vanilla, or TBC or Wotlk servers do so because there is no alternative. Most of us would GLADLY pay for it if only the option existed.
---
Just merge the dead servers, obviously. 
---
Yes this will upset a few small fish in love with their own, tiny ponds, but will be well worth it for the vast majority. (AKA it will ”upset the community” lol). 
---
Thank you for not bloating the video to make it as long as C'thun or Sapphiron ones. These both need lots of explaining, therefore the time is justified, but most MC bosses really do not, so thank you for keeping it clean!
---
I'll just leave [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mh_cLN66zHA) here.
---
Rule 4
---
While I appreciate the meme, the editing could definitely use some work 
---
God yeah, I was so excited for the first run of FF14 and... I couldn't believe how unplayable it was.  At that point who would have thought they even had that turn around in them.
---
I don't think so.
---
I will just avoid pugging or only play with people I don't think will abuse the system.  It has no impact on me if I don't want it to.  I would rather the rest of the community be able to fix their loot issues for sure.
---
Agreed with everything above but just to reiterate, if you roll on Dal’Rends a lot of melees will despise you. Alternatively go for the 1h axes in Stratholme called [Bone Slicing Hatchet](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=18737/bone-slicing-hatchet) , you can dual wield them.
---
You sound fun tbh...
---
I don't like this. While it's true that a person should play what they want it's not a good answer to someone who specifically asked an experienced vanilla wow player for their opinion on what classes are worth it. 
---
WoW is a game about time investment. If someone asks what class they should play, they are really asking for your experienced opinion on how they should invest their time. They are trying to avoid making a poor time investment. 
---
To respond with this, you're withholding your experienced information and telling them to go potentially waste their time with whatever class they randomly select. 
---
We all started the game with no knowledge of what we were getting ourselves into. It's a feeling many of us cherish. However, just because we liked going in blind doesn't mean we should dictate this as a requirement for playing classic. 
---
We know what classes are strong. It's okay to want to start the game by playing a strong class. If someone comes to us looking for advice on what we think the strong classes are, we should tell them.
---
"Inquiring minds just got to know!"
---
They only need to make slight alterations. Free transfers from high and low servers to medium ones. 
---
Well with current technology they can increase pop cap to 10k per server and hopefully it will average out to 3-5k post hype. Which is what the numbers used to be for good servers  back then.  This one isn’t free blizzard I want to be paid 120k USD if you use my solution. 
---
Every cloth. Sweet sweet cloth money.
---
I disagree. RNG makes fights varied and interesting.
---
A mix of Discord, Twitch/YouTube and Spotify, so I selected other. I am planning on playing with the ingame music for a bit but I always think that and end up muting it after a few hours to put some other music on.
---
Always liked being a troll and sitting on the point of the zep.  
---
Played one to 60, getting white hits is really frustrating, relying on rng is no fun at all, most times you will get smacked in pvp by ranged classes and put dps'd by most melees and mana is a huge problem.
---
Raids will take you less likely but if you got a nice Guild that shouldnt be a problem.
---
But when you get that wf triple crit im PVP tho one shotting that damn gnome, hnggggggg...... you feel so good.
---
For me personally its still not worth it but hey, to each their own, ill play a lock in classic.
---
I’ve raided MC, BWL and of course the various Dragon world bosses as a Shaman back on ED, it was the most fun PvE experience I’ve had in any MMOs. Totems are not that hard to get used to and there are great addons available for managing them. Healing seemed more engaging than primarily tank healing as a Priest, as you have to constantly Chain Heal the damage of melee groups and of course the Life Tap happy warlocks which means you don’t have to interrupt your heals as often as the dedicated tank healers. Also Shamans are always in demand, I got an invitation to a raiding guild at level 56, without any previous WoW PvE experience just by submitting a properly written application. I assume getting a guild invitation would be just as easy as a Priest, although there might be a bit more competition as Priests are much easier to level and most Priest players tend to know what to expect when they hit 60, unlike the numerous Shamans wanting to play Enh/Ele meme specs and getting very disappointed at level 60 when they realize that they HAVE to heal in raids to get any decent gear.
---
If you want to PVP, respec costs are going to be a bitch as a Shaman though, so either get Herbalism at 60 or level a Hunter/Mage/Warlock alt.
---
Ret Pally master class!
---
*^(pleasedontyellatme)*
---
&gt; The speculation I’ve seen ranges between 3-10 million people at launch.
---
Lol what.
---
That's not realistic at all. 1 million maybe. Well, maybe even 2 because of free sub for retail players, but i doubt even that. Most likely around 1 million and droppiing by 50% in a month.
---
I think it’s kinda weird people think tbc was less classist. Yeah pallys could tank and yeah druids could dps and tank better but the tbc meta is so much more classist than vanilla. Melee are shunned and unless you are playing ele/warlock/hunter good luck getting raid spots. 
---
I really wanna play warrior but I know there is going to be an abundance of them and I really wanna raid and I dont wanna have to compete too much. Was also maybe thinking hunter since hunter is my main in retail but ik they're not very much needed other than a few for raids.
---
I agree with this. Killed Onyxia like 40 times during vanilla and saw my druid T2 only drop 2 times. Never got it. Still hurts.
---
Players wanted flying in vanilla and didnt get it, that doesnt make flying vanilla. Only what happened in vanilla is vanilla. And mergers aren't it. Just admit it, you want changes; but only when you like them.
---
You guys are hypocrites with the nochanges/changes stuff.
---
W\* had quite a bunch of doubtful choices which were its doom. 
---
Sci-fi? Fantasy is usually more popular... and art and story setting were a bit lacking.
---
Combat felt limited. Little flavor skills, limited skillset, annoying trait system, telegraphs galore... And even with a sci-fi theme too traditional classes (see: warrior -heh-, stalker -generic rogue/thief-, medic -chainmail cleric in other games, see WoW's pally, EQ and Aion's cleric...-, engineer -typical summoner-, esper -mage/priest-  and slinger -gunner/priest-   .  
---
Attunement was such a poorly implemented feature. Compared to vanilla's it greatly lacked inmersion, it was just the tedium (and an excessive one indeed). Compare it to vanilla's alliance Onyxia chain part in SW, or the UBRS and BWL ones. 
---
The questing system was annoying for many. 
---
Optimization was such a bummer early on. 
---
Do hunter pets require less food the better loyalty you get with them?
---
Dude, play whatever you want, classic is about fun, you know as much as i do that theres going to be tons of pros rushing people but also new players without any insight.
---
Play what you enjoy, every class will have a few downsites.
---
And btw, warriors are always needed theyre great dps :D, hunters are easy to play hard to master and a ton of fun in world pvp :)
---
After 39 levels of running around on foot you will understand.
---
Players didn't want Flying in Vanilla. A few did maybe, but I remember clearly how the server forums constantly wanted mergers because their server was dead. Considering how Flying Mounts weren't even a thing, I'm not sure how that's your argument?
---
You seem to be against it in many comments, without being able to explain why. Mergers actually did happen in Vanilla, but not in the traditional sense of two realms being merged, when the region-specific servers came to existence.
---
On your argument of "changes when one likes it" Classic WoW have a plethora of changes already to the platform running Classic. We're running on the modern client, not on the Vanilla client, so with regards to Merging, it's really not a change compared to the client we're going to use.
---
Sad yet true. What is sad there is barely any oldschool focus on most of the last released MMORPG. 
---
Just no. 
---
\&gt;If you wanted to raid, you had to have a certain spec. 
---
If you wanted to successfully raid AQ40 and above, youd have to not only min-max your talents/items and consumables, but also have little time for alot else. 
---
You can easily go MC as an arms warrior with a weekly Pug. You can easily go ZG as a feral druid (if that group is willing to bring you). 
---
I think its been said many times by others, but Ill repeat it. 99% of ALL players wont kill a single boss in Naxx.
---
I'm super interested in what you're talking about, but at the same time I have no clue what you're talking about. Can you link it?
---
&gt;You can’t base anything off private servers
---
Even on private servers you have multiple guilds clearing Naxx with Moonkins and Retpaladins. A lot of guilds got bored from years of doing content with optimal setups, and just dont care anymore.
---
I didn't play Rift that long but I'll never forget how much I liked my chloromancer.
---
What you describe only works if the server has people from all over the world playing on it. On Eu/Us servers, this wont be as bad as a problem. Sure, the hardcores are going to kill Rag/Ony, while most people are about to enter STV, but lone wolf lvl 60 will easily farm their devilsaur sets, their arcane crystals and their herbs.
---
 **&lt;UNITY&gt;** \- OCEANIC (PVP) Semi-Hardcore
---
Alliance faction
---
We are based in Australia (Sydney/Melb). We will be taking time off work at launch after then returning to work playing on a 6pm-12pmish schedule while trying to keep a balance of life. Weekends times are all day if possible. We are mostly 30+ but we have a few younger members joining us as well.
---
Priority is raiding and Dungeons. PVP is secondary but still promoted. We will be using EPGP as our loot distribution system (not fully set it stone yet) and we will not be letting anyone just over-ride gear calls except to the main tank or unless there is some serious reason to otherwise.
---
Anyone can apply - more the merrier just PM me on reddit and I can send you the discord info. This includes those outside of Australia who play in the same time zone. Feel free to bring in friends we don't have a limit on numbers.   Rules:  Standard non-Harassment rules. 
---
Yeah this was the initial reason I wanted to roll a shaman on a private server lol
---
Okay, just watch it happen. You can bury your head in the sand now, but I'm telling you, vanilla pservers will be a rarity post Classic. There obviously will still be a few, but low pop and shitty servers at best. Come back here in 6 months and see how wrong you were. 
---
Here are my top3:
---
1. Paladin
---
2. Warrior
---
3. Mage
---
I‘m living together with 3 of my closest friends, we‘ll divide our appartement in September! So our hope is to WoW being released in July/August !
---
If that happens, I will empty my room (the biggest one) and put the tables of all the other roommates in, set it up as you said like a oldschool LAN party. We‘ll cook, have snacks and drinks (only junk food is a little too much, that‘s why we gon cook) and play for at least 3 days. 
---
Then we‘ll decide how to go on. 
---
gotta get this on my hunter when classic drops he looks badass
---
Read the post. Everything on his list other than the Savage Gladiator Chain and the gun could reasonably be farmed in 3 weeks with decent RNG. 
---
Free market. If someone is willing to pay you, why not?
---
REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE NORMIES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Mounts are much less significant if you're a druid or shaman, or get a free class mount, but Azeroth is biiiiig and most classes are sloooow.
---
Ikr. Yes this is a meme blablabla but, problem is many people have their idea unconsciously reinforced by that kind of thread and then it reinforces that stupid hate of offspecs. Just play what you like, like you did in 2005. If some assholes don't want to play with you then just find people who will. There are plenty.
---
&gt; Free market. If someone is willing to pay you, why not?
---
But there are a lot of things people would pay you for that are unethical :p
---
My father was a guy who keep gray item or other type just for the style not for the stats.
---
I think we will see things like this a lot :)
---
Note that Lasting Judgement usually is the place to dump spare points, most Holy Paladins just need 1/3 in it because it rarely lasts 30-40 seconds due to other debuffs pushing them off. Even just 2/3 to take it to 30 should be plenty for the Paladins in charge of buffing. 
---
You don't ever really need Imp Judgement either, as 8 vs 10 seconds isnt especially critical for anything other than maximising ret dps, and remember melee swings refresh your own judgements too.
---
You'll probably also have every paladin wanting 2/2 imp BoW simply because they'll use this when solo healing.
---
I think you've got too many specs there really. You'd probably have one half-Prot who goes 30/21/0, one half-ret who goes for imp BoM, imp Ret aura, and the rest will just be standard build with BoK and imp Devo.
---
Note that the BoSanc paladin will probably go with more personal tank talents in the early prot tree such as shield spec and toughness and imp RF, as if you're grabbing BoSanc you may as well spec yourself to be able to actually use it yourself as a trash tank.
---
So many good pets in the barrens, Kresh was my favorite.
---
I was a nelf, for me the barrens was a very dangerous and strange place. I was terrified all the way from the boat to humar's tree lol
---
 You learn to love the caps lock key. 
---
So two or more dying or dead servers is the better alternative to merging them and giving the opportunity to create a fresh, larger, community on the merged server?
---
There are three alternatives as far as I see:
---
* Manage server pop with free transfer and faction changes. (Very unlikely as it requires actual effort from Blissard.
---
* Merge servers despite the intial clash of communities and players/guilds losing their names(or come up with a solution to that), and thus keep servers at a healthy population. (Also unlikely because Blissard listens to people who care about their name more than playing on a server with other people)
---
* Enable sharding and cross realm. This kills the community. This means being on a server is meaningless. Being in a guild is meaningless. The whole idea of classic becomes meaningless. But this is the most likely option because it's the easiest for Blissard to do and everyone keeps their names they are so fond of. It's the same reason we have sharding and cross realm today. It's simply the easiest solution.
---
The AQ40 one is great too.
---
I repeat, pservers competing with blizzard live expansion has been a thing for the last decade. This magical situation that you think will happen in 6 months has been in effect for the last 10 years. Just you didn't use your noodles to think about it like the rest of the dumb Blizzard drones.
---
The only servers Blizzard was able shut down were the ones that weren't able to competently hide their identit, willing folded, or were in the US to begin with.
---
And everyone knows servers are going to lose pop after Classic. Don't pretend the discussion was about that just because your failing miserably at the topic at hand: Blizzard being able to shut them down.
---
Nah, good lock would make it really hard for rogue. 
---
Half of them quit before 40 because the slow walking and you die to 2 mobs but after 40 warrior is like a whole new class with mortal strike.
---
Well BfA is trying really hard.
---
**Epoch of Thought [H] **| NA-PvP | Wed, Thur, Sun 1800—2200 PST | Hardcore 
---
**About**: EoT started on Bloodscalp shortly after vanilla wow’s release &amp; became a top guild on the server. We’ve persisted as a gaming family ever since. Our goal has always been to clear content as a team while providing a second family for our members.  
---
For classic we will be a top guild &amp; clear Naxxramas. We have a solid core experienced through Naxx. Most of us have raided for years &amp; are ready to devour classic content. We run a DKP-guided loot council focused on awarding gear where it best serves raid progression &amp; best recognizes attendance, &amp; contribution to raid performance.
---
**What we expect**: We expect dedicated, skilled raiders who show up with consumes, proper gear, &amp; knowledge. We are team-focused so great performers are appreciated &amp; recognized, but divas who are unconcerned with the health of the entire raid team or overly self-interested are not tolerated. We are a diverse group of raiders worthy of individual respect &amp; the respect of everyone’s time.  
---
In short, be prepared, be knowledgeable, be on time, &amp; don’t be an A-hole.
---
**Raid Schedule**: Wed, Thur, Sun, 6 PM to 10 PM PST (GMT-8) (9pm – 1 AM EST) hard stops. Our guild has always been extremely active &amp; 20-mans, Onyxia, etc. will continue to be ran on non-core days. On most days, if you log in, you will find a good group of people to smash content with.
---
**Looking for**: Great people of all classes are strongly encouraged to apply; specifically seeking: Shamans, Rogues &amp; Warlocks. Core raid spots are earned through demonstrated competence &amp; dedication. If you are interested in leadership roles within the guild please send me a whisper &amp; let’s chat.
---
**Apply**: The best way to join is to shoot me a private discord message (Discord: 
---
Lne#2710 | Battlenet: Lne#1326).  The less social can also fill out an application on our Website &lt;http://epochofthought.shivtr.com&gt;  You can also jump on our discord at &lt;https://discord.gg/UqAVjJT&gt; 
---
**Join us!**
---
Wildstar for sure. Rest in peace.
---
Who is the master looter?
---
Chosen at random?
---
''Request trade'' - sure, okay, but a ninja will just decline the request.
---
This idea needs more thinking.
---
Just to clarify btw: I'm feel strongly ***against*** any form of loot trading. Let us pay for our own mistakes, instead of this carebear wotlk shit.
---
I plan on doing the same on my dwarf warrior with enchanting for those sweet orbs. i can claim rp if they get offended because dwarf greediness lol.
---
Illidan 1 illidan 2 illidan 3
---
Mannoroth 1 Mannoroth 2 Mannoroth 3
---
Etc etc etc.
---
You know who you are gonna merge with if it happens. 
---
Takk the Leaper was my introduction to how addicting it can be to tame rare pets.
---
You go arms post 40? I usually switch to Fury to get bloodthirst. That sweet healing yo.
---
A warrior aint gonna get tier 2 unless its a tank or its been on farm for a very long time and all tanks already got it. 
---
Yes, when I do a raid we all draw sticks and whoever gets the shortest one is the master looter.. fuck me.. the master looter in a raid will not be a random person. Pay for your own mistakes isn’t really a thing, you message blizzard and wait 4 days for a GM to roleplay on your shoulder and give it back. This seems like an excellent fix to all problems 
---
The best idea is to let blizzard release classic how they want to then scrutinise it and dig it apart when we know what we are actually dealing with.
---
Remember, the players complaining is the real reason we have a lot of the issues we have right now with retail wow. 
---
Warrior can play either role, they can tank and dps. I don’t see how this is relevant to my post.
---
I understand you don't want loot trading, nor do I.   
---
The main thing is saving money and all that would happen was a ticket was created and people would get the item anyway, this just removes the middle man. 
---
**"Who is the master looter?"**   
---
The person who is assigned by the raid leader? (Like it always has been)   
---
**"Request trade"**  
---
There was and always will be ninja looters and that's fine, its a local server so they'll get a bad name. (Original classic feeling)   
---
*click bait works, it got you to look at the post correct?* 
---
Might wanna pull one of those sticks out of your ass. You're just thinking about raids. Consider dungeons.
---
Loot trading is a result of people complaining. the people complaining are the reason why retail is what it is now. Why not try to fix the problems before it gets out of hand? 
---
&gt;I would recommend this too. I levelled back in the day using Joanas guide as a base then doing all the dungeons and group quests. You end up doing hardly any grinding this way too!
---
Because we have no idea if it’s a problem or not, the only way we can know for sure is when the game comes out.
---
But what if you find whatever is strongest, the most fun to play?
---
I can see how it works for raids, but what about dungeons?
---
You had me at ''Loot trading idea''. The rest is fake news (lol), which detracts value and trust from your message. But sure, do whatever you fancy.
---
lol i go fury pre 40 but yeah only reason i switch is pvp server lol
---
Haha well that's random. Yeah I got on the hype train for classic and started looking through some old posts 
---
Hahahaha so many trolls in this sub
---
Thing is, whatever class i choose I will change my mind at lvl 28.. Every.. Time
---
That is simply amazing. I am in the same boat. Never touched a private server...until Blizz announced Classic. Even than, I was like " nah, i'll just wait for Classic, don't wanna invest time in a character I will ditch in 6 months or w/e".
---
Thing is...there was nothing else worth to play. The MMOs today are SO BAD, that playing on a private Vanilla server, even for a limited period of time, is MORE SATISFYING that playing a current, official MMO.
---
I rolled on a private server...and I was expecting to stop playing after 10 minutes, because, well...I already did it for almost 2 years back in 2005-2006. But the game got me. Vanilla got me, again. I leveled, casually, to 60. Farming gold, questing, lots of dungeoneering on the way, and A LOT of talking in guild, /trade, /general, / party chats.
---
And than I stopped, because Blizz announced that Classic is coming in the Summer of 2019, not even caring that I left a T1/T2 geared Warrior with shitloads of gold for dead.
---
But I only stopped for couple months. I restarted anew, on a different private servers, playing the same old game and wanting, again, to gear up in whatever it drops, questing, leveling, farming, etc.
---
I WANT this stuff, even if I KNOW that coming this Summer, I will again abandon another well geared lvl 60 character. But I don't care.
---
It was WORTH IT. 
---
Do mages get anything other than their portals?
---
I care
---
In raids; no. Not really.
---
What makes classes unique is how their armor look, what you can do in wpvp (priests MC'ing in Blackrock Mountain for example), your class quests (Anathema, totems for shamans, shamans also have an epic quest for a helmet iirc).
---
In raids you basically just press one button. Every healer does.
---
As I said, in dungeons it's a slightly different story, and you get to use more of your toolkit. 
---
Woah you can use potions while shapeshifted ? I didnt know that , thats like a major thing jesus ..
---
I hear ya. Do you go dual wield fury at 30? Two handed from like 6-30? Nice thing is if you get whirlwind axe at ~30 then arms is nuts.
---
There is really nothing wrong. Hell, the *warrior class description* describes warriors as mercernaries doing the dirty work for the highest bidder. Tanking for gold/items is exactly as the Blizzard devs thought warriors out to be!
---
Undead rogue.
---
They all kept me away from WoW for some length of time. LotRO by far the most. 7 or so years.  
---
The irony of people always calling WoW itself the WoW killer is that it very well could be WoW Classic that kills modern WoW
---
I could have sworn they had 12 million at the absolute peak in WotLK. 
---
A DPS warrior in full preRaid BiS can do it just fine, he will do very well in raid  plate DPS gear. However a not so well geared warrior is a liability and increases the time the dungeon takes a lot more than a badly geared DPS. 
---
A healer dipping down to 75% mana can be at 100% mana again once the tank is done marking and pulling. A healer who constantly dips down to 20% because the warrior is badly geared, will lengthen the dungeon substantially.
---
I don't have a problem with it as long as the tank is stacked/knows the instance well. I tip mages for their time on portals/water and I don't see this as being much different.
---
And tanking a dungeon isnt one of them. If the tank dont need anything from the dungeon he wont be running it. Having the option to hire a tank that otherwise would not be available for tanking, is perfectly fine.
---
Or -in my situation- hide my pride.
---
Shamans have more buttons to press then any other healing class because of totems and they have some ways of making raiding more engaging like totem twisting. Being a good aoe healer also helps. Not saying it is going to be hard but I always enjoyed shaman healing more then priests healing
---
that site is literally just a database viewer and it brings my cpu from 5% to 70% for a solid minute. what the hell
---
first of all, i read all these post about GM's reverting loot, in case of a mistake.  
---
I never ever experienced that on my server and the GM's wouldn't help with it.
---
Based of that, I don't want loot sharing, i want it what is was in like Vanilla.  
---
GM's shouldn't handle these kinds of requests and tickets.  
---
A Ninja looter is easily handled by the community and the realm (on the long term.)  
---
You'll appear on a blacklist list, and get a bad name, that is how we handled it, and that's how i want it in classic.  
---
^(Also, i'm in favor to autoremove all post about loot trading and sharding. This sub is getting down the drain by al these retail players coming here and demanding stuff.)  
---
^(maybe expect the sharding issue, but there are literally 5 post a day, about this :()  
---
I miss the old “I am (celebrity) and I’m a (their character)”
---
Stfu cripple. Keep believing you need a whole guild supporting you just to run Dire Maul and UBRS. 
---
&gt; Who is the master looter?
---
&gt; 
---
Usually the raid leader?
---
&gt; ''Request trade'' - sure, okay, but a ninja will just decline the request.
---
No different from any other form of loot trading.
---
This is what you clearly do not grasp : Wildstar target audience was the hardcore raider...Vanilla WoW audience is EVERYONE. You can spend months in Vanilla WoW doing hardcore raiding and be happy, but you can also spend months in Vanilla WoW from lvl 1 to 60 and be happy. Or doing 5 men dungeons ONLY for months..and yes, still be happy.
---
As for EvE Online...man, that game is how old? Oh, right...is SIXTEEN YEARS OLD, and it's not even comparable to WoW. Apples and oranges would be a superficial comparison. Its more like comparing potatoes and tables. I know, because I have played EvE for like 5 years.
---
The word "niche" on a dictionary should have as first synonym "EvE Online". That's how niche EvE was , and still is for the most part. You can't throw EvE on the same category as WoW Vanilla...it is impossible. There are NO SIMILARITIES, at all, between EvE and WoW Vanilla.
---
You are ASSUMING that Classic will be a niche MMO...but your assumption is dead wrong, because Classic target audience IS NOT a niche part of the gamer community. Its not for hardcore raiders only. Classic is for EVERYONE. 
---
Will it be as successful as Vanilla was? Will it boost 8 million players after 2 years? Most likely NOT. Not even close. But if, just if, Blizzard decides to go a different path after 2 years, and we will know that in due time? Well, I won't be surprised for Classic WoW to have AT LEAST the same number of players as Retail WoW (will be much higher anyway) and that alone, in today's GAMING MARKET (compared to the one in 2005-2006) is a MASSIVE SUCCESS.
---
Time will tell.
---
My money are on Classic being the NEXT "THING" on MMO gaming, a success so massive, that nobody outside old Vanilla WoW players will understand.
---
Not to mention that, in case of Wildstar, there were SO MANY fucked up things that led to its death, that simply only  considering one (the one that fits your agenda - "Classic is just another game mode designed to keep players like you subscribed to Blizzard"  ) is beyond stupid.
---
They get free food and water
---
I go 2h and hamstring kite swing timer abuse my way to 40 and try and get whirlwind as early as possible.
---
a vocal minority is complaing.  
---
I dont see a reason to listen to these people.  
---
Look what Retail has become  
---
I just want the system like it was.  
---
The community will regulate things with black lists, and people get a bad name very easy
---
It would be tolerable if loot trading was restricted only to master looter. That's just it, no additional fixes needed.
---
Pink Dress is a rite of passage.
---
for me only Swtor worked, only partially. each year I sub 1-2 months, currently wow is frozen, while raiding in swtor.
---
but for me Wod was the real wow killer. 
---
Completely agree.
---
It doesn't happen THAT much and when it does, it's our own mess to clean up.
---
Blacklists will be created and each individual server will take care of their ninja looters.
---
me and our guilds were raiding until the shitty Kotfe/kotet where they sacrificed operations . last new op(=raid) is like 4 years old, Temple of Sacrifice
---
I remember running through the Pass in order to get to my first Sunken Temple run. Turning the corner and seeing that tower was the most menacing experience I have had in a game. 
---
The fact that it was guarded by skull-level enemies and nobody was around or even in the zone just made it feel even more like I really shouldn't be there. Other expansions never really had that "unfinished" and haunted feel to unfinished content. This wasn't unfinished, it was a feature that it wasn't ready yet. 
---
You know... Just #VanillaThings
---
You are delusional. HALF the subs of Wrath? You BELIEVE that BfA have over 6 million subs? Try half that, and 3 million subs would STILL BE optimistic.
---
BfA is atm, around 2 million subs. Probably UNDER, not ABOVE 2 million.
---
The servers are basically EMPTY.
---
Had the same idea works perfect for raids as for dungeons no loot trading should be implemented at all and if someone says they miss clicked. It take a confirmation click after needing in vanilla so you know they are a ninja and you just blacklist them. 
---
Yeah, basically, in BfA, the player is "free" to choose between a dozen plates of shit.
---
No matter what he chooses...its still shit.
---
Only spec wors then enhancement in end game pve is boomkin you can not use two of your abilities in raid due to debuff slots and if you are unlucky whit rng you pull agro and die 30 sec in to a boss fight. The itemisaton is crap you have a hard time getting gear and ones you get your nightfall you will never get a weapon upgrade ever again. So the life of a enhancement shaman is basically stand whit your dps warriors and totem twist while auto attacking praying you will not die first minute of the fight
---
When everyone has access to everything, all of the time, nothing has any meaning
---
If this is legit, I'm so jealous.
---
at beginning we started raiding mc. no rogues no exotic chars allowed. hard rules and a lot of discipline.
---
 but 6 months later people are allowed to bring in there twinks. this means if molten core is at farm status you can bring in and play what you want.
---
back in time 2006/2006 i was a hunter. no problem to get equip or raid spot.
---
in classic i will try a shadow priest, the most rare spot in every raid :)
---
Welcome home :)
---
This is the shit that have to stop. You’re spreading misinformation. Enhancement is decent at best, which means you can make it work, but it absolutely gets destoyed against somewhat decent and viable classes/specs. You can get lucky with WF, but unless you get that, you’re probabaly getting mauled. This is why they’re the perfect highlight class/spec.
---
Yea but Perds on Vael = sick damage :P
---
&gt; Objectively for the market today retail is a better game in almost every measurable metric. 
---
Vanilla subs numbers : 8 million. BfA subs number : less than 2 million.
---
Vanilla impact on society in general : massive. BfA impact : ZERO.
---
Vanilla impact on MMO gaming industry : revolutionary. BfA impact : NONE.
---
I have no idea what metrics you are talking about, because I can't see ANY metric (except MICROTRANSATION SALES) where retail is a better game for today's market.
---
With the exception of WF crits? No.
---
You can’t Stormstrike on most bosses and you’re left with swinging white hits, hoping for WF to proc. Same for PvP, except Elemental is actually wanted very much, because of their on demand burst.
---
Chloromancer was amazing! So much fun to play.
---
If by half, you mean like 70/30, then yes
---
Personally I would never give gold to anyone to tank an instance for me but if you're running Live then reserving the first Orb for the overgeared tank is perfectly Ok.
---
"Dead and buried WoW"
---
until the rogues find out it’s an orc soul link warlock with pot and hs. 
---
You'd have to go back to Vanilla Beta for similar sub numbers. Because Vanilla had 8 million subs at the end, about 4 times more than estimated current subs.
---
That's my biggest turn off in books and movies - When a sequel comes out and changes the rules of the magic system or structure of the fantasy world.
---
Oh well 99% of the time the four members of the group would pay say 10g or so each. I understand though, it's certainly not for everyone. For stratholme living side, the group would usually allow me to take any righteous orb that drops. Though I'm not sure what other tanks would charge. This was around four years ago though.
---
I have raided in pservers as both alliance and horde, and my impression was that alliance tanks just didn't know how to stance dance properly and blamed dwarf priests for every fear. When dwarf priests died, it was total chaos.
---
Horde tanks would stance dance very often, as tremor totem is not as reliable as fearward.
---
**&lt;Pertento&gt;** 
---
**EU [RP-PvP] | Alliance**
---
**Dedicated PvE** ***with a social atmosphere***
---
**Guild Information:**
---
At Pertento, we emphasize the social and altruistic aspect of vanilla gaming. We believe raiding should be fun and engaging and not a mindless chore. As a result, we have tried to circumvent the currently prevalent min-max culture by making room for viable specs that are considered unoptimal and feeble by many. 
---
Ultimately, we value social cohesion and respect among our members which will ensure our perseverance, and eventually our success, in even the most strenuous PvE encounters.
---
**What we expect from our members:**
---
At the same time, we are a dedicated raiding guild which means that our expectations of raiders are high. Like any ‘semi-hardcore’ guild we expect all players attending raids to be **fully prepared**, including those that are playing an ‘off-spec’. Members must also acknowledge that **the freedom we provide players depends entirely on the difficulty of the content**, and as such, if progression is too slow, we will take the necessary steps to get more optimal raid setups. Depending on the circumstances, **we may also try to vie for server firsts**, as we ultimately strive to be on a competitive level with other dedicated raiding guilds.
---
**(Preliminary) Raid Schedule**:

Wednesday &amp; Sunday 19:30 - 23:00 CET

---
Discord: https://discord.gg/nxHPErY
---
In some cases I did that, at the very least for sitting in town.  
---
There’s plenty of people having the most fun playing whatever is viable or the best. Discrediting someone for wanting to get the most out of their character is not any better than the guy telling you, you can’t play ret paladin.
---
Dwarves are only possible playable priests. Other races are literally unplayable, i tell you. How you can even think of playing without fear ward?
---
No, that is totally impossible. They have stated they will permanently ban you if you join a raid as any other priest than dwarf. Applies to Horde too, so no priests for horde guys.
---
If somebody considers Vestments of the Shifting Sands an upgrade over the Stratholme dress, they should also consider [Robe of Volatile Power](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19145) (which is earlier gear - it drops in MC) an upgrade over Vestment of the Shifting Sands.
---
I liked that cheerokee White tiger. Always cool to see rare pets 
---
What a scrub, go back to retail kid.
---
Going to go out on a limb here and suggest enhancement shaman. You have a decent levelling speed and you are really good in wpvp. Big plus is the ability to kite elite mobs and heal dungeons. The first one will make you les less reliant on finding groups for quests and the second one will help you find groups for dungeons. 
---
Think I had those back in vanilla...
---
It's all about drops I guess. First you need the item to drop, then you have to win it! People were running MC for years just to get the T2 legs.
---
I’m kinda in this boat too. No kids but a steady relationship and weekends are mainly spent with my girl so I’ll be playing pretty casually with just week nights to jam. 
---
In the past I played pala briefly in vanilla, rogue tbc, mage in wotlk and then hunter cata onwards stopping before legion came out. Out of them all hunter has been my favourite and most fun to play. In classic they’re good solo levellers and are awesome in pvp. you’ll be able to save fairly easily to afford your mounts. They get a bad rep for not bringing much raid utility and spots are hard to get with people not wanting to take many hunters but if your not going to have the time for that anyway, it doesn’t matter. IMO hunters are just cool 
---
Enhancement shaman really is garbage though, the spec does less than 50% of the damage of a similarly geared proper DPS class. If somebody doesn't want to play with a guy who performs as 1/2 of any other player, they are not an asshole.
---
I'm playing a bit on an instant 60 sever just to mess around with the PVP and try to get some macros set up
---
The spec is fine you might want the 5% crit but it is not absolutely needed. And not sure if you want holy nova and  healing focus. Pick up herbalism to generate your gold or find a stable 5 man group to do fast dungeons whit (strat living) if you don't want to respec 
---
I think this solution is the best. With the prediction that the majority of players will quit, in in favor of smaller number of servers, but a larger amount of sub servers, like Illidan 1,2,3,4,etc. If all of these subservers fall off in population then I’d merge them together. If one of the subservers retains a high population then just rename it to Dalaran or something. 
---
Besides the fact that only wanting to be top dps for the very last raid is a bad idea when you have never touched the game before. Better going with something you find fun class fantasy wise over "op" dps if you are not knowing what you are doing. It's like going for rogue but hate to level up of things such as lockpick and poisons or being a hunter who hates the whole feed pet and ammo thing. 
---
Kind of what i was getting at, Dungeons i don't see the point but a raid is completely different. 
---
Yeah I got herb and skinning :) just find the end game herbs to be very inconsistent (competition, ganking, travel loops).
---
Dude Earthen Ring EU was my first server back in 2005. That's awesome.
---
Horde or Alliance? 
---
Sir, that was a caster.
---
Well just some napkin math here a FAST lvl 60 time is 7 days /played (168 hours), usually closer to 10 days (240 hours) or even longer for casual players. You will spend probably 50% of you time traveling while leveling and even more at 60 farming mats and running dungeons. I would also say the trip from 40-60 takes probably 50% of the time despite only being 1/3 of the levels, just due to the lack of good quests.
---
Like I said before this is all napkin math so take it with a grain of salt. 168/2 = 84 /2 = 42 so in the first scenario you spend 42 hours of walking from 40-60 (Hitting 60 in 7 days) and 60 hours (Hitting 60 in 10 days) so lets take those and say you can speed up the whole thing by 60% post lvl 40 we come out with 25.2 hours spent traveling and 36 hours in the 10 days scenario.
---
The reason you spend that money on the mount instead of gear is most of the gear is garbage, and the gear thats better is usually considered twink gear that people will hold until the server is established and then sell for 500g. You won't find ANY set of gear at 40 that will increase your DPS by 60% for an the same amount of money.
---
On a pvp server this is even more pronounced in opportunity costs, outrunning enemy players via mount will save you a huge amount of time in graveyard runs.
---
This is all BARE MINIMUM travel time, when you factor in buying skills, getting to dungeons etc you will literally shave weeks off of your leveling time if you only get to play a few hours every day.
---
The classes which do good in Naxxramas are all fighting for top DPS throughout Vanilla, though. With the exception of Hunter. Just off the top of my head. Some classes more than others and some dominante specific tiers, but the point still stands.
---
There’s plenty of people who level these classes, because feeding the pet or buying ammo isn’t even that big of a deal and it’s more class fantasy than actual class mechanics. 
---
Rogues and poison/lockpicking is a one time thing, and most people will be able to look past these things, as defining whether or not they choose that class. Just like most serious people will level Engineering twice for example. If you’re dedicated, these things should be relatively small bumps in the road.
---
Hi, /u/Sandsconsumeyou
---
Permabanned streamer here.
---
For the past 3 weeks blizzard has been very active on banning streamers, so if you stream with something like "classic" [some private server] etc. in the title and have like 10+ viewers doing NA work hours you are prolly gonna get a DMCA claim which is a 24 hour ban.
---
If you get 3 DMCA bans you get a perma ban. Twitch can however chose to permaban you earlier so don't take it as a strict rule.
---
If you had a ban doing this "banwave" (which at this point isn't rly a wave anymore is it...), it appears that blizzard saves your twitch profile and checks it now and then, because I got banned again while streaming "unlisted" which is where you stream without a game attached and a empty title. 
---
So yeah... right now is a pretty bad time to stream vanilla, it has been completely fine to stream with up to a hundred viewers for the past 3 years, sometimes risking a 24h ban, but now blizzard really has worked hard on cracking down on the streamers.
---
The first picture is in BFA, everyone looks like a god. In classic everyone looks like shit so when you see T3, it really means something 😍
---
Bwl is harder than aq 40 and aq20
---
&gt; Come back here in 6 months and see how wrong you were.
---
I play druid. My coolness is off the charts. 
---
Very hard to say because private servers aren't that accurate and I don't think anyone did it on vanilla.  Especially on the last boss seems very inaccurate because he has been changed drastically many times and is different depending on the server you play on.
---
Typically you would want at least prebis gear, especially something plate for the warrior. You want to spec fury for DPS really, and prolly want to play in a healing spec for the healer, especially if you playing priest which isn't as strong as paladin or shaman for this farming.
---
Shards have historically always been worth it to collect on anything that isn't a weapon, so I think it's something you should definitely consider, it's a huge part of the gold income from it. Remember you only need 1/300 enchanting to disenchant items, so it's something you don't have to skill, and can remove at any time.
---
No u
---
No you both
---
Fuck that sounds like ass :(
---
They probably are cracking down harder now that we are getting closer to release, they probably want to control the image of what Classic is.
---
The drama classic creates out of nothing is just glorious. 
---
HAHAHAHAHAHHAHA. STORY OF MY LIFE
---
I would call onyxia easier than MC &amp; BWL if you are doing it 40man
---
Wildstar was the first of all the 'wow killers' that actually gave me the same feeling as vanilla wow. I played it non-stop when it released and it was super fun. Loved the combat, the graphics, the zones and all of it. It was a shame they shut down. 
---
I would support this. The costs for a tank who raids are absurd. Not only is plate stupid expensive, tanks also need 2 million buffs.
---
5g each or demand that you get all the green items or orbs and shards.
---
Not to defend pservers but:
---
Inaccurate data? Honestly this better be a joke because blizzard doesn't even have accurate data, they have 1.12 at best, pservers is very close if not closer to vanilla than classic will be. 
---
Enourmous ping? I suppose if you are NA but 150ms in vanilla isn't big at all.
---
P2W? Which ones? All the good pservers only take donations
---
End of progression? I mean right now they are sure, but they weren't when they came out like last summer when 2 came out?

Man, I remember playing Aion on launch. It was sooooo grindy, like way more than wow was. But combat was interesting and beautiful aesthetically.
---
I was also super overgeared for dungeons so was only doing stuff like Live for the Orbs. Still don't think I'd pay ever xD I'm too stingy
---
They get to spam blink which is close to druid/shaman though they do spend mana doing it.
---
SWTOR leveling and storyline was amazing. I played it a few times, but I usually played it like a singleplayer game. I'd usually just level and stop playing once I reached max level. The Sith Inquisitor and Jedi Knight storyline was just amazing. You can really tell Bioware was involved.
---
Probably just confusing it with Robes of the Guardian Saint from Fankriss. Which is another turquoise dress  [https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=21663](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=21663)
---
Thanks for the insight! Very helpful.
---
It's also entirely reliant on RNG to do damage. This shows especially on short fights and trash pulls where you may end up only autoattacking for 300 damage per hit, or get windfury proc on your first hit, pull aggro and die.
---
&gt; blizzard doesn't even have accurate data
---
Hey man they might fire you if you're saying things like that!
---
I think you should drop 2 points from +heal and drop them into improved poh. 20% is pretty big.
---
Figured it'd be something close to this, thanks for the detailed post
---
It is kinda bad tho tbh
---
Moonkins are dangerous to frost mages? I am leveling up a frost mage right now but have yet to encounter a single rare moonkin in the wild so I wouldn't know.

Mirror image was introduced in TBC I believe. Definitely wasn't in classic.

Power draw on modern PCs is almost entirely related to workload. Mining on an old PC wouldn't be efficient enough to make money...so I guess you could so it on a modern PC, but the mining load would increase your power consumption massively, so not sure what your point is.

Really
---
&gt; more knowledgable players playing on private servers
---
that has always been the case, with all games that had private servers
---
&gt; Once classic releases and we have more "casuals" that don't understand the game as well as someone who plays on a private server would
---
I agree here. As a side note, I've seen several players on Nostalrius, that were playing it, instead of retail, because they couldn't afford the subscription.
---
&gt;  I think we'll see a lot more people "scared" of the tank/healer roles
---
I hope so, that they're at least more "scared" than on retail - if someone comes from retail and tries to tank, it will be us, healers, who will suffer.
---
Guess the dingy basement aesthetic is why Rogues are such a popular class. 
---
Yes, sorry. When r/classicwow was first started, the mods wanted to differentiate from r/wowservers by keeping most private server content (e.g., posts primarily focusing on private servers) there, and most Classic WoW content here. We've maintained that rule/philosophy ever since then.
---
America doesn't exist and Earth is a cube
---
How about this? Sending an ingame letter to every player from the group when a loot trade has happened. So they can't do it without everybody getting informed.
---
Then it'll be like Ninja looting: You can't avoid it, but from then on you can avoid those suckers.
---
Fair enough, have a good day
---
&gt;I still really enjoyed Wrath.  First half of it was fine, but that last patch
---
required more GearScore than I had
---
Lol, who actually uses caps lock for auto run? 
---
against every other class then yes lol. 
---
Even more than Feral druid?
---
&gt;As a PVPer, I loved the talents changes for balance. 
---
You mean balance druids?
---
Yes, that OP moonfire spammer build. I loved it too :Ð
---
&gt; Bringing high level players back to the original continents was welcomed 
---
Yes, people like me, thought it would bring back a bit of vanilla, by making us return to vanilla zones.
---
And instead, they removed vanilla zones and replaced them with cataclysm.
---
Why would I trust you to cook pizza rolls? I'm sure you'd find a way to fuck that up. Stupidity at your level is pretty much a disability.
---
Then you could look at what you find the best twink? lol
---
Jk I know your situation. Have been there. I have actually never reached level 60 myself, so it will be a magical moment in classic.
---
Good for you, I guess?
---
There's worse things you can do to yourself. Smoking, excessive alcohol, not exercising. 
---
I'm willing to bet some of the shit you do is a lot more stupid than getting a tattoo.
---
In PvP, they were nice to play and moderately good. In PvE, you would only see them in Dungeons or, rarely, you could see them as Nightfall-users. That is what I have been told. 
---
STV - you can't get ganked by both undead and human rogues until you've played both factions
---
Thanks for the input. That does sound appealing to have an easy leveling experience. Lol.
---
Most of them won't get to that stage of the game, imho.
---
How were oomkins dangerous? Healing?
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bxRhsV0oZfctcc0Vx
---
I've been enjoying priesting all the way to 60, but I feel like I need to rejig my talents slightly. I have zero issues in 5 mans with this build, but open world grinding can be a bit of a pig in terms of damage output. I understand priest isn't the best farming class :)
---
My healing bonus from gear is +324 so i'm not sure if this will allow some talent change ups? I'd like to maybe do a bit more damage for my own enjoyment when i'm not grouped up / raiding / pvp etc.
---
I might respec just so I can get my epic money quicker, I've tried DM farming but holy nova OOM's before getting a single mob dead, so it's risky. People say to get INT gear but I wouldn't know what to get (i'm a genuine newbie).
---
Sure.
---
I cannot wait until you chumps try and poison Classic's atmosphere with the attitudes you use on live. That community is going to chew you up and spit you millennials like the garbage that came out of your mother's womb.
---
Damn right. Zug Zug.
---
But you won't have to go all the way if you'll be ranged!
---
(sorry had to make the pun don't yell at me)
---
BOOOOOOOM!
---
Maybe try a rogue with fist weapons instead?
---
damn is he good ? i remember the rake having good attack speed 
---
I like how people are happy in the game just for being able to have a gun and be a dwarf. Fuck yeah!
---
.The release will kinda sort people anyway, because the hardcore fans will start in the first hour / day and the tourists more like in the first weeks / month. That means the 'suggested' servers for the tourists will be servers that are in low pop at the time the tourists come - while the hardcore fans will be already pushing their servers to high pop.
---
And there will be payed realm transfers as far as we know today, so you can always leave ghost town for a price ;-) 
---
lol
---
One thing I hate about current live, is the fact that every single one of us is the 'saviour of azeroth'... we constantly get praise from Npcs that call us 'champion'... and yet, due to server sharding and cross realm shit, you never see the same person twice, and therefore, nobody actually has a reputation among the community anymore...
---
I recently started playing vanilla again, and I already recognise a bunch of players by name. It's awesome seeing the same people. You can build relationships without worrying about never seeing them again. You don't even have to add people to your friends list because you know that at some point, you'll run into them again. 
---
I've been questing through the zones at a reasonable rate and I keep bumping into people I've met before. We group up and do quests together, maybe do a dungeon run... It's an amazing feeling. I was worried that the nostalgia wouldn't be enough to keep me playing... I was worried that I would never feel that sense of adventure I felt 14 years ago. But I was worried for nothing because it turns out, the game was just better back then. Those feelings were real back then and not just because it was the first time I played. I felt those things because every quest really did feel like a QUEST.  I'm currently in Duskwood, and I've ran the length of the zone about 30 times. I'm still not bored because every time I set off on foot, I know that on my way to my destination, something interesting will happen. 
---
None of that happens in Live. 
---
Can't wait for Classic release. 
---
Everything is viable. Literally everything. Though it is not viable everywhere. Yes, you won't be doing raids as a shield-wielding enhance shaman, but maybe you could be a tank in dungeons? I mean, a skilled shaman can tank most dungeons, as far as I know!
---
Hhhmm as I recall, it was a regular cat. 
---
ohh how I loved Age of Conan - I still miss it, it had SO much potential, but too many bugs.   
---
Another game killed by being launched before it was ready. It even got worse after launch, as they "fixed" some bugged content in a way that made in inaccessible, so a lot of "hardcore" players stopped when they had cleared the equivalent of T1 and T2 content, but T2 was then removed. So they were essentially waiting for content they had already cleared.   
---
But the PVP, the classes, the world, the apell animations (and general combat animations), was just all so good, especially for its time. 
---
Hey! My paladin gets to wear a red dress! Robes of volatile power
---
Guild Wars
---
Don't believe so. It's at least present on every private server I've played on.
---
Honestly I don't think it's that.
---
You see a new private server came out recently, it's actually a TBC server, and its gained a HUGE amount of hype. Famous streamer Sodapoppin stopped streaming because he is playing on it, and a lot of the private server streamers stupidly streamed this for hundreds of viewers, and there was for some reason some drama with a guy donating to one of the method big boy streamers impersonating a pserver streamer causing a lot of drama.
---
I honestly think this is what caused it, especially with a new raid release in BFA lots of hype on that. I honestly do think it's gonna get better once that new raid is cleared and once the new pserver hype has calmed down. 
---
CAPS LOCK? But...then you can't use chat while you're running...

&gt;I was really into raiding at the time and was super hyped for the expansion launch. Leveled to cap in the first 24 hours, went hard on the first raid... but I don't know - everything just sucked? I guess lore and inertia carried the playerbase through the end of Wrath, but before Firelands dropped everyone was gone, myself included.
---
Same here, and I remember how it was.
---
I started to do the super hard heroics. They were hard, that's good a challenge.
---
But, I had to farm them. And, farm them daily. That means, not only when I felt like a challenge, but when they allowed me. It was like a job - I had to follow a daily schedule.
---
At some point, I've tried to raid. I remember I was in a guild &lt;The Arctic Fox&gt;, and we entered the raid, wiped like 20 times on the first boss, then everyone was tired.
---
But, apart from that raid. There was nothing exciting. The challenging dungeons were only a daily pain in the ass - it was more like working under pressure, than playing a game - as I've already completed that 30 times, and was bored.
---
For PVP, Wintergrasp, my favorite BG from WotLK, was left all but abandoned.
---
I was just farming heroics mostly for tokens, and also hoping for a drop with +3 item levels (that was the ilevel "step" in Cataclysm, if I remember correctly, not 5 like today)
---
In the end, I made it to the point where I could not get any upgrade through heroics - and had to either raid, or arena/RBG. Whenever I joined a raid group, it just went off after 20 wipes. And whenever I tried to join an arena team or RBG, they said I don't have good rating.
---
Also, the login screen music was very disturbing - not only the fact that you got DC, but also the computer froze (as it used to after DC), and that loud and chaotic music was playing, waking up my neighbours, and I couldn't turn down the volume, because the computer was frozen.
---
Anyway, after failed attempts to raid and PVP, I was bored for the last few weeks before 4.1. And, when Zandalari came, well, it was fun, a new series of quests, and new dungeons. The problem was that they were again a pain-in-the-ass, daily farm of challenging dungeons. Especially when I leveled an alt - first I had to get ilevel 300 to get into heroics, then 315 to get into Zandalari. And, 315 was exactly what dropped in the original heroics - meaning, I had to first live through the original pain in the ass, and get better gear, to be punished with a next series of pain in the ass.
---
That's when I left - and watched the Firelands ads, from behind the "prepaid expired" message.

They did offer free transfers from low population servers to medium population servers. It failed completely. They also tied free transfers from high population servers to medium/low population servers and it failed completely.
---
It doesn't work. Server merges are much more likely to work.
---
Yeah he definitely did, when specific tames had different stats!
---
Honestly I'm spanish and I wish they don't do Spanish servers just for the fact that: 1. There are not too many players, 2. I don't like the community (this is just a personal opinion).
---
Is it confirmed what you said about the spanish /french dedicated servers? 
---
What? Retail servers can't even handle 60 people in the same zone today....
---
If you have a solid group of friends, most certainly do the Stonetalon Mountains quests as alliance. It's like STV on steroids for the alliance. You will probably have something like a dedicated crowd controller, a target caller, healer etc. 
---
Seeing full 5men alliance groups roll into Charred Vale really made the area a boiling pot.
---
It always exacerbates the tension between alliance and horde. Horde is killing your dryads and KotGs while you are there defending them from a lore standpoint. You get missions from Stonetalon peak, horde ventures there to destroy the grove.
---
The Rake has 1.1sec attack speed and does great DPS. I've got him on my NE hunter on a Pserver. Great pet. Long walk to get it tho.
---
I mean, you can't really avoid it. Nobody wants a free transfer to a dead server, nobody will want to reroll onto one, and if blizzard were to lock character creation on full servers heads would roll.
---
Since even blizzard can't predict when the player count for classic will start dropping off and everyone still playing will be too firmly established, there's not much else to do but merge. 
---
By definition the contested zones with faction specific quest hubs. 
---
Why would you want to draw people out of a low server to a medium one? That's just twisting the knife. 
---
Obscure? Southpark Season 10 Episode 8 - "Make Love Not Warcraft" is one of the best episodes ever :D
---
Thanks for sharing! Being from the EU i never saw this back in the day. Definitely channels the Leeroy vibe!
---
Very, very important is that the highest boss is lvl 59. Most mobs are lvl 54-57, therefore you can get away with a lot less +hit gear. However plate gear is very important. If you could get a BRE that would the best outcome obviously. You need something like 4-5% hit to reliably hit Hydroboss and the altar one as 2hand fury.
---
They stated that /sit macro to enrage will not work, also without being shaman, you will lose an important DPS buff by not having windfury. Thats probably a 30-40% damage reduction already from a warrior + shaman on pservers. 
---
PreBiS will not suffice, because prebis consists of 50%+ leather gear, some mail and only 3 pieces of plate, therefore the wolf form from last boss will absolutely shred you even with shield + def stance. 
---
There were rank14 warriors who just bruteforced their way through with R14 2hander weapon cleaving quite a few demon groups, but as a normal player fury will be necessary.
---
There is green gear that is not worth disenchanting as its worth more to the vendor, but the best really is herbalism/enchanting/mining to get the most profit out of it.
---
Got him at level 28 on my hunter in vanilla and I still have him on my hunter to this day on BFA.
---
Sometimes you tame a unique pet like that and it has a shitty 2.0b attack speed. I remember taming the awesome looking ghost cat in darkshore only to discover it's slow attack. Don't know if Humar suffers from that though. 
---
To be honest, I've been going so back and forth on what to play for Classic. I wanted to play paladin but I'd never get anywhere because I'm really not into healing. I kinda wanted to play warrior but I've tried it and it's less than fun.
---
But hunters? God. I remember now why my first ever raiding main was a hunter. They are so much fun. I really loved the aesthetic of the gameplay. Feeding my pet, having arrows or bullets and whatnot? I really enjoyed that class fantasy. I know they're also just really easy but honestly I don't care about that. I'm in it for fun.
---
Yup. That is exactly what it's like.
---
Dead servers isn't really an issue if you're free to leave anytime you want. It's like an empty apartment building, the only ones that really suffers are the people who own the building and since servers are virtual nowadays not even that is an issue.
---
Connected realms is a worse solution imo since it doubles the population cap of the server and the authentic 2500 cap is very important to vanilla. 
---
Getting ganked by gnome rogues is the best though.
---
**&lt;Wanderlust&gt; [Alliance] EU-PvE Server | English language**
---
**Our Philosophy:**
---
No rush, no guides. Let's play the game and learn it that way. Many of our members are new to Vanilla or at least to Vanilla raiding. We would like to experience the game to the fullest by going in "blind" and taking our time. (This should be taken as "first few times", for fun and flavor. We are not overzealous.) Veterans are of course welcome if they are fine with the style. There are already members with extensive WoW experience. We know this will take a lot of time but we are fine with it.
---
Progression. Although we should be relaxed and not rush anywhere, we should progress through all content eventually. Wipes on first tries of raids are completely expected but eventually we should learn them and clear them efficiently for progressing to the next one. The same goes for characters. We should be somewhat relaxed, not demanding the utmost in min/maxed builds. But just goofing off with "joke" builds shouldn't be our style either. Anything which works reliably for progression will be fine but no less.
---
**Who are we looking for:**
---
Anyone wishing to experience the whole game in a relaxed but mature atmosphere and who is prepared to take it slow with us. Focus is on raiding reliably, which means that people should show up and perform sufficiently. You don't need to know know stuff or be good at the game now, just be willing to improve and get good enough for raiding. Gear distribution will favor reliable progression. We should also be able to help each other in every facet of the game but apart from raiding, everything is optional. 
---
**Raiding related information:**
---
* We'll start raiding at least 6 month from release. You can use the time as you see fit, leveling slowly or leveling more than one character.
---
* Raid times are up for discussion still but I expect two raids on weekdays. (Most likely around 19-23 CET)
---
* Loot council (most likely).
---
Anyone interested, message me!
---
Less accurate than your other meme.
---
Have fun! The old continents are the best. So many memorys there. I love the plaguelands
---
Lost Ironfoe with a 85, he rolled 92.
---
I lost Onslaught with 90, the other person rolled 95
---
I lost Viskag with a 92, the other rolled a 100. 
---
I crie everytiem
---
I'd rather they just do full merges at that point. No sense in having 10 servers out of 20 be completely empty forever, and with transfers players and guilds would still need to uproot. 
---
This one
---
Wow man you played enhancement during cataclysm? That's so relevant to the conversation and you're so brave for doing that against all odds 
---
Thanks! Gonna be a long road untill i arrive at the Plaquelands

WotLK isn’t classic though.
---
iam thinking of going for hunter because itsceasy to level and to get groups for pve and its decent in pvp
---
I agree. I just loved dungeons. I almost leveled exclusively in dungeons as a healer and as long as there wasn’t something more pressing I wouldn’t mind helping a group through. 
---
That was until I found out 3 really geared shadow priests could solo most undead dungeons due to vampiric stacking. Then I said goodbye to my healing days :) 
---
that's the same as any type of bartering
---
you give me a token I'll give you 15 bananas. Just because both items are digital and both are called WoW doesn't matter since its different games. No one can artificially bring in or take gold out of the WoW economy.
---
You can trade 1000 classic gold for a scooter outside of wow, its the same shit. doesn't fuck the economy like introducing an actual token would
---
And people watch that?
---
I cant wait for classic wow! I am doing my best not playing on any vanilla servers and saving the full experience for WoW Classic, but man is it killing me inside.
---
**&lt; Filthy Casuals &gt; \[A\] US-PVP**
---
   
---
Hey everyone! 
---
We are an Alliance based guild that wants to remain relevant through the lifespan of WoW Classic. We are looking for players who want to focus on the community aspect of the game as well as clearing content. We are not a hardcore guild by any means. I would put us in the category of "Semi Casual". 
---
Our objective is simple it is to work together, clear content and get the hell out so people can have their own lives. We know that everyone is an adult now with responsibilities for the most part so we will NEVER keep anyone longer than official raid end. If we finish early we will encourage people to work on consumable farming or just hanging out with the guild but it wont be mandatory. 
---
Additionally since we are semi casual and not extremely hardcore we don't expect everyone to min / max and use every cookie cutter spec out there. We want you to have fun while raiding and not get burnt out. We will try our absolute best to allow people to change specs / change roles and still raid. With that being said, we still expect people to do their role in raids and help us clear as fast as possible so we can GTFO. 
---
Something I should have mentioned maybe is that all of our officers and most members so far have PLENTY of WoW Classic experience either private server or just remembering from 2004. 
---
**Raid Times (PST):** 
---
* Monday - Off
---
* Tuesday - Off
---
* Wednesday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Thursday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Friday - Casually 8PM - Whenever (What does this mean)
---
* Saturday - 8PM - 11PM
---
* Sunday - Off
---
Our Friday raids will be official off nights. This is when we as a guild form up groups to do dungeons, pre-made BGs, or anything else the guild may need help with. Need to do a Paladin / Warlock Epic mount quest? This is your night. Need to farm materials for raids, but don't want to do it alone? This is your night. This is the night we go out of our way to help others in the guild and build relationships.
---
**Loot Rules:**
---
While we've looked into many other systems we have decided that we will be a DKP based guild. Randoming a raid of 40 people just isn't a fair system. Loot council can ultimately be made fair, but I don't want people to think officers or people placed on the loot council are bias against or for someone else. Also with 40 people, loot council is a beast lol. So we are just doing the simple DKP system. Points per boss kill, bid on the items you want, top bid wins the item. No going negative DKP unless you're the only one bidding on the item. We haven't decided if we want to make it an Open bid or closed bid system yet. But we will keep everyone updated. If closed bid system is chosen we will be using a discord bot to remain 100% transparent as leaders. 
---
**Membership:** 
---
There will be 6 Ranks in Filthy Casuals.
---
* Recruit - Recruits are exactly what they seem. They will be on probation for 2 weeks and must make an effort into doing things with the guild to become full members at the end of that two weeks. At the      end of the two weeks, the officers will decide to promote to extend recruit status. Last priority on raid invites, and only can get loot that      is going to be DE'd.
---
* Alt - Duh
---
* Member - These people are fully functional members of Filthy Casuals with no restrictions. If a member goes inactive for a period of time we will just place a note on them in the guild tab and move on. When they come back, its like they never left. 
---
* Raider - These are members who have put forth the effort to raiding. These people require at least 75% Raid Attendance to keep the rank of raider. That number may change later on we're not 100% sure yet. Literally the only perk that Raiders have over member is they are given priority on raid invites. This will benefit them more if we have a full 40 members every raid. 
---
* Officer - Currently we have 5 officers and we plan to keep it that way unless something unforeseen arises. We will get no special treatment other than raid spots for our mains. We have all known each other for 12+ years and want to ensure that the classic experience is great for members of our guild. 
---
* GM - Me.. I don't do much, I just look pretty and stream while my officers do things for me. I will be the final say in any major decision but I do not run a dictatorship. I listen to EVERYONE and will try to do my best at leading a bunch of filthy casuals. 
---
That's about it. If I missed anything, you have questions, concerns, or just what to chat it up feel free to send me a message on Reddit or join our discord below and we'll get your member role assigned.

---
**&lt;Requiem&gt; - Horde | NA-PvP | Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Intro:** We are a group of friends from the mid-west all jumping back in for Classic. Most are classically trained up to and including MC, ONY, and BWL, with a few who saw AQ40 and NAXX content prior to the release of BC. Many in this group, myself included, have been active across various private servers over the years and are eager to bring our knowledge and experience to the Blizzard stage.
---
*First and foremost, this will be a Semi-Hardcore Progression/Raiding Guild.* Our goal is to progress through all Raid content efficiently but without tryharding and sacrificing the fun aspect of playing the game -others have referred to this as relaxed-progression.
---
Don't let this intimidate you, we understand we're all older now, with families and careers. We're not asking you to put in an extra 40 hours of WoW on top of real world responsibilities. We're also not asking you to give up PVP. And while we'd love to begin progressing through content as soon as possible we understand the level 60 grind, and preparing for raids, takes time and effort.
---
**What we're focusing on now:** Building a core group\* of like-minded players who understand the level of effort and coordination behind building a successful raiding guild and have the drive to make it happen in a friendly and laid-back, albeit efficient, environment.
---
*\*If you have past experience with being a raid/class leader (or even no experience at all) and are interested in applying for an officer position, PM me.*
---
**Expectations:** Be courteous and respectful of all members. No gatekeeping. We don't expect everyone to know strats to every encounter, but if you don't, we will expect that you show up with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.
---
**Raid Schedule:** Thursday &amp; Sunday 6:00 PM PST. As more content becomes available we may add a 3rd day, this is still TBD.
---
Discord: [https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE](https://discord.gg/WkmxDEE)
---
I think it's ok to be able to 'jump in' and catch up but it should still take a considerable amount of time.. one should have a clear gear progression throughout the expansion that you have to earn one step at a time.
---
In a new/medium age economy live side strat is a nice way to get gold as healer orbs sell for a good amount and enchant mats sells pretty good aswell 
---
That's what sharding is for, to allow way more people on a server than they intend to and for it to gradually drop to the wanted player number.  
---
DDO
---
On our guild, we considered 1 as better than 100.
---
That's stupid but we did that way
---
Don't worry, I will keep the server alive by rolling two hunters.
---
One to level and have fun with.
---
The other to level and gank my first hunters faction when people steal my ores.
---
Blizzard has a lot more access to what data is accurate than private servers. For example, a whelp in the wetlands might have 700 armor on a private server, but Blizzard can dig up the info they have recovered and find out that the whelp actually has 947 armor. Maybe it doesn't sound like a big deal, but perhaps someone likes to grind on those whelp because they die easy, now it won't be nearly as effective. There are literally thousands of data points that Blizzard has accurate info on that observers basically had to take a random guess on, some minor like how much spirit a random mob has, and some major, like how certain boss mechanics work.
---
If you're headed to the Plaquelands, don't forget to floss!
---
Same here 
---
I honestly remember loving Rift's dynamic world quests (that retail would steal SEVERAL years and expansions later in Legion) that were the game's namesake, I loved the multi-class system, and I loved the aesthetic.  I don't for the life of me remember why I quit playing it, though.
---
Some people don't want to play because they want to save the feeling of nostalgia and re-living their past when classic comes out.
---
This is because their classic character won't vanish in three to four months.
---
As someone who joined in wrath and who personally feels that current wow is crap. (pre-ordering BFA and then not being able to play as Zandalari druid at launch, let alone right now, which it is STILL not out yet, was the final straw.)
---
I do believe they're changing how macros work for Classic. Save the macros you're making anyways, cause I'm not 100% sure.
---
how are you kiting on a warrior?
---
I *can* wait for classic wow. But only for two seconds. Then i flame on the internet.
---
No it does not.
---
&gt;missing maps even
---
What the hell does this mean?
---
you know whats worse? when other warrior rolls 4, and you already laughing inside, then /rolls shows you 2.
---
But I want to play something strong, I find this is cool.
---
&gt;some major, like how certain boss mechanics work.
---
Honestly I dont think it's as big of a deal as people try to make it sound like.
---
The early raids have very simple mechanics, so getting it right isnt that hard. Later raids such as Naxxramas is also a lot better documented as high quality videos just started appearing around that time.
---
My bad, thought he meant the absolute max. 
---
I'm more excited about this than the upcoming netflix adaptation, and this isn't even real. 
---
Raids:
---
UBRS (If you count that)
---
Molten Core First 3 Bosses
---
Onyxia
---
Molten Core Garr Onwards
---
ZG
---
BWL
---
Dungeons:
---
Maraudon (I count this as a 60 because it had a few pieces of preraid BIS)
---
BRD
---
LBRS
---
Stratholme Living
---
Stratholme Undead
---

Shhhh man. Don’t spread it around. Especially AF. Keep telling people how shitty AF lock will be because of UD edge-lords and WOTF.
---
Trying to get gear here man.
---
I tried on an instant 60 realm and it did not have its damage reduced.
---
Am I alone in hoping for a retuned version to level 60? Such a great raid. And adding “new” content in filling all the holes in the classic Azeroth would be a nice way of doing it.
---
You wont have this issue in Classic now that people know which weapons they should get.
---
Hunters want AV Crossbow/Strat UD Crossbow -&gt; Rhok'delar -&gt; Ashjre'Thul. The next upgrade I believe is the Ouro gun, followed by Kel'Thuzad crossbow.
---
Every other weapon would be for either DPS, Tanking or PvP.
---
With a shaman it's definitely doable with a prebis, leather wearing, fury warrior, though I might have had some raid drops on my shaman. There's a give and take relationship between the warrior's dps and survivability and the healer's ability to sustain healing vs heal through some burst. I think we actually found staying in dps to be more successful for the last boss. But once again, this could all be biased because I may have had some purps already, but I was definitely at least in prebis.

**&lt;Knights Templar&gt; - Alliance |NA – PvE| Semi-Hardcore**
---
**Introduction**:
---
Knights Templar roots were established during World of Warcraft’s launch on the Zul’jin |US - PvE| server.  Our guilds mantra was “The causal guild that raids hardcore” and to a degree we will continue with that mantra during Classic WoW.  We accomplish this by having a very casual guild environment, but a very focused and dedicated raid environment.  Our goal is to progress through all raid tiers at a very strong pace.  
---
**What we Expect of Members**:
---
We are looking for members who share the same mantra that was referenced above.  All members are expected to be respectful and polite when dealing with other members of the community.  It’s important to remember that when you join our guild, you represent us at all times.  For raid members, you will be expected to show up to raids on time and prepared to pull by raid start time. 
---
**Raid Times:**
---
Wednesday, Thursday and Sunday 8:00 -10:30 PM EST.
---
**Guild Website:**

**Recruitment**:

---
World of warcraft gonne downhill because it is the same game from old times nothing new on both lore/gameplay and a few other things. 
---
This "Dark Iron Dwarves being good guys" means very little to nothing since every faction or charcter on warcraft always do things based on their needs and beliefs, so evil characters like Garrosh can be both good or evil based on his need/belief.
---
I know many mmo players dislike to hear it... but endless grind isnt a challenge and people wanna play games for funny not to spend eight hours a day to craft billions of potions for months just to be stuck in an endless dice game for years only to get low status/value gear. This kind of thing only punish the player and show no real challenge since dice game doesnt require  vast amounts of skil to play it is usually lucky.
---
Did OP take a picture of his monitor?
---
Personally I hope they have fewer realms, maybe a good 1 rp server, 2 pve, 3 pvp with time zone differences.
---
&gt;I'm happy to hold off for a few more months.
---
Same, I figure a few weeks before the release date I'm going to jump in and just get familiar w/ the controls, hot keying things and what not. 
---
I remember being super hyped up for Vanguard. That game had so much potential. I enjoyed how intricate the tradeskills were. I played briefly in the beta before TBC was released. The game just had so many bugs and was just unfinished. That is what happens when the investors pressure to go live without the game being ready. The game tried to do too much all at once.
---
I also played Conan at launch. The first 20 levels where there was storyline and polish were amazing. After that there was just grinding and buggy instances. The combat that seemed super fun at the beginning became a bit of a chore with having to perform the same button sequence for 1 attack over and over again. I was about 5 levels away from being max level when I quit and went back to WoW. LoL.
---
I personally think BRD is the hardest simply because it's so long that it's likely your group will dissolve before you get to the emperor
---
My guild does this too, coming up on 10 years of tradition!
---
The alternative of loot council is equally terrible if done correctly, and downright worse when it gets corrupt.
---
Rolled loot doesn't particularly help your guild progress because Johnny who came for one raid can just take important loot.
---
A mage that... uses chlorine?
---
Yes
---
What easier ways are there to get gold besides farming?
---
I like how taunting had an effect in PVP in that game. I think it reduced enemy player's damage in an area around you.
---
Ghost Saber for the win!!! 
---
Why didn't you take a screenshot of your desktop?
---
I was in the beta. Great game but needed a bit more polishing.
---
On the SWTOR subreddit I predicted that moving from a subscription model to F2P model would signal the death of the game. I was downvoted so hard.
---
Darkfall 
---
Well you give me all your gold in game?
---
Just let ppl either deal with it and keep playing or reroll. Sucks for those ppl but if you dont wanna end up on a dead server just dont play for the first 2 weeks ot so.
---
Hey OP, turn off bottom left action bar to get rid of that gap between your main bar and your pet bar. Your not using it anyway.
---
TAKE IT ALL. JUST KEEP FIGHTING TILL YOU FALL.
---
Ah hey, I mostly played on Horde as Vathdar undead mage in The Northern Raiders but I had a 60 paladin alt that I used to hang with some people from Imperial Measure. 
---
That thing could outrun epic mounts. So good in BG's
---
Asmongold's server will be all one faction. They probably will end up merging his server with another streamers server who plays the opposing faction. I'm sure Asmongold will try to hide his name and server name as long as possible. At least he should if hes smart. 
---
Then there's PVP
---
I wouldn't be able to get my hands on a wand as fast on a fresh unless I was lucky or some dude decided to stop leveling to grind linen and sell everyone wands
---
Because that wouldn't be a full classic experience if he did, gotta live and play like you did back then.
---
I wish I was high when I read this
---
And Ony. 
---
This is dedication. Dps meter from level 1
---
Would feel immoral for me to charge a group. Makes the game more a job too, than fun. If I want to run something, regardless if it gets me gear or not, I'll do it. No reason to charge someone money. 
---
Motorola Razr confirmed 
---
These virgins will be on those classic servers

I'm confused.  Why is the Teldrassil owl so impressive for PvE?  Can't you get tame later owls and get the higher ranks of their pet abilities anyhow?  
---
When WoW guildies also met up with each other in real life - I don't know how many of those there are left.
---
I have been playing on 1.12.1 private servers since 2014 with players from around the world - classic WoW (at least on private servers) is now a global culture with its own set of shared behaviors, interactions &amp; social norms. I don't know how much that will continue when classic servers come out and everyone is divided into regions again.
---
Did you guys have phones back then?
---
AV doesn't have the correct map, they don't have the files which makes there claim of a authentic AV total bullshit and a mess of different patches thrown together. Then people with private server experience turn around acting like they're AV experts.
---
We know that now. It took a while for the WoW community to realize that there were better alternatives for distributing loot.
---
Starting zones shouldn't get watered down because people are afraid of the chance of getting merged which isn't even a big deal.
---
Hey guys, I’m zaronce the hunter. I’m just gonna roll on this too...
---
Dont settle for being suboptimal
---
Humane the Pridelord sounds like a rapper 
---
Holy shit, that intro was good!
---
I was in an RP guild actually, Ari Scara. Me and my IRL friend started around the same time, and didn't really know what RP was haha. We enjoyed getting our officer rank through various tasks though, I seem to remember.
---
Seems like they were still somewhat active in Legion, and their original guild site is still up, if not a little outdated.
---
This brought back a ton of memories.
---
I can't really seem to remember any other guilds on ER though, was such a long time ago.
---
And you think paying a stranger in a video game with video game money to help you do something for 1-2 hours that they wouldn't otherwise do might possibly be a question of ethics? Lol I feel dumber having read this whole thread.
---
I just don't see them ever forcefully relocating players against their will. It would probably be preferable but I don't think they'd ever do that to people.
---
Yeah it will be easy to find like minded people if the game is a fraction of how be I think its going to be, or if you want to raid offspec and no guild will accept you then make your own.
---
He's gonna need it soon.. what should rlly concern us is where he has immolate and corruption.
---
Oh forgive me. I wasnt aware I was talking to an idiot. Private servers use 1.12 as their Client so they will obviously have the last iteration of the map. Blizzard is basing their Classic on 1.12 because they dont have complete files for the older versions of the game, so they will also almost guaranteed have the latest iteration of the AV map.
---
I think we can conclude your post was just another sad attempt at making private servers worse than they are.
---
Yes, a lot less
---
So it's not real? Hey! That guy is a phoney!
---
Whenever I play a pet class, I never use the bottom left action bar, all the way through lvl 60. Hate having that floating pet bar lol. 
---
It always seemed weird that there was only one explore quest. But the deeper you go the cooler it gets. The kobolds wrapped in spider cocoons and spiders everywhere. Mother Fang was probably going to be the final boss of the dungeon.
---
God i remember camping it on my 19lvl hunter twink. That was so painful, having to go to school mid camping was more painful tho. Got him in like 3 weeks of irregular camping. This game brings such memories back. Thanks for reminding me!
---
I read this somewhere but am forgetting where. Is this from the WoW Diary?
---
Really? 2 Hunters of 2 different factions on 1 PVP server. You're planning on paying 2 subscriptions? 
---
I got a friend to send me 10s on a level 1 character on a Pserver, and now I'm just playing the auction house maybe 30 min a day and slowly gaining wealth. I have about 4g now
---
It's fun and doesn't ruin my future classic experience (I think). It just prepares me to play the auction house when classic arrives :P
---
The crossover I never knew I needed.
---
Razer Naga perhaps? They have = and - buttons in a very convenient place to click with the thumb.
---
Damn, that looks good and fine as hell!
---
Reread. I said less than half. 
---
Hunters also get +30% run speed (and possibly some extra talent %). 
---
Damn fucking stright!
---
Wanna steal MY GODDAM ORES!?!?!
---
NOT ON MY WATCH!
---
Well done op it’s hilarious. Cowboy Bebop is the Classic WoW of anime. 
---
I usually bind one of my extra mouse buttons to auto-run SO I DON'T END UP TALKING LIKE THIS. 
---
&gt; I’m just gonna roll on this too...     
---
      
---
Everyone shits on hunters for stealing gear, it happens *to* them as well.  
---
Nothing stings quite as bad as the tank needing on the bow/gun you've been running the same instance over and over for.  
---
Trolls are one of the best hunters though!
---
yeah hybrid sex offender class!
---
Druids in general since you can’t slow them, can’t shatter combo them. Boomkins have range, can use dots and hots while kiting your mage, it can be really difficult to beat a Druid in wpvp 1v1.
---
Oh, I'll spell it out for you since you're too fucking stupid to extrapolate relevancy through contextual evidence. I mained enhancement from VANILLA through cataclysm. The point being despite all the clueless blowjobs like yourself who cry about resto being the only viable spec, enhancement works perfectly fine and always has.
---
Ganna be honest, that was a pretty cringe commercial.
---
Activision ruined Blizzard and their works. I am happier to be playing vanilla than whatever shit they have in stock. They do not deserve one second of my time.
---
You know every big guilds nowadays manage to get a scarab lord on pservers (hardcore guilds can get even more) since as long as you ring the gong less than 10hours after the first one you get it.
---
Because it is freely available to anyone, on any platform, with an extremely easy to pick-up and play style that needs zero investment or game knowledge.
---
Its meant to be a game that literally anyone with any type of electronic (cell phone, game console, pc) to be able to pickup, play for 5 minutes and be done. 
---
Source? I cant find anything on google regarding this.

So a RFC equiv for Alliance? Is there something similar to Deadmines on Horde side? I’m not as familiar with the dungeons available in that factions starting zones.
---
I exercise 4 times a week + play football twice a week.  I don't smoke. I rarely drink unless it's a wedding or new years or my birthday.  I'm in tip top shape because unlike some, I actually care about my body and don't damage my skin with stupid silly pictures or piercings.
---
Where’s Hogger?
---
wailing caverns is similar to deadmines 
---
Read it a while ago and it wasn't there. Not sure where OP gets his information from.
---
this has happened to me before. “lol a 6 there is no way i can lo—“
---
Still doesn’t mean it’s not true. Fortnite is the most pervasive game I’ve ever seen in my life.
---
It's not even remotely obscure and nearly every WoW player that doesn't hate South Park has seen it.
---
&gt;I personally think the idea of “seasons” in wow clashes with what vanilla wow stands for. It’s not a race, it’s not constantly restarting fresh, it’s not separating the player base.
---
I agree. WoW is not an esport. I think Blizzard treating it like a esport is their biggest mistake.
---
I am hoping for a slow progression through the other expansions. Slow and steady.  
---
I wish Blizzard didn't scrap Titans. A new MMO with Classic/Vanilla like design philosophies would be a great breath of fresh air.
---
Rip Verne
---
I have the original wow dungeon map prior to release. I’ll try and find the source where i originally got it from but it’s been circulated for a few years. The dungeon was called “Kobold Lair”.
---
 &lt;No Plan Required&gt; is an EU Alliance guild that intends to roll on a PvP server.  If you're looking for a relaxed raiding environment with a pinch of competition involved, or a social enclave to hide from your severe depression, then you've hit the jackpot.
---
The main idea of the guild is to create a community where casual players and hardcore players can co-exist and succeed - but the utmost importance is that we all have fun doing it.
---
Feel free to join the discord. We'll talk! https://discord.gg/vEezjx
---
Thats hella cool
---
Agwe never actually did anything against the terms of service. PVP can be pretty ruthless in Vanilla but that's just part and parcel of PVP servers. If you arn't mature enough to take a break or move to a different zone, then that's not the other persons fault. Granted corpse camping and such is pretty shitting and frowned upon by most people, but it's also not against the rules. I'm also fine with this, my only suggestion would be that after someone has been killed a certain amount of times by a ganker, perhaps then they should be immune to them for say.....10mins or something. Otherwise, people know what they are signing up to when they select PVP server.
---
You fill that bar with buttons first, then its not floating...
---
I would remove lasting judgement and put points into shield specialization
---
id also go for imp lay on hands, just for all around usage, like for pve too
---
otherwise, yeah imp hammer is great, and if i go paladin id go after the rank 10 set for the further bnus to hoj
---
Interesting. I always figured Deadmines was the Alliance version of RFC, just a few levels later. But they appear to have had two lowbie instances planned.
---
Such as? DKP if implemented well is the fairest system. 
---
Yes, fully agree. Hopefully it makes the starting zones bareble with enough lobs for everyone.
---
First thing that came up when I googled it was the map posted in this sub 😆

Hum i usually go with the Num lock standard bind.
---
&gt;Straight into it, no pointless bullshit. People talking. People interacting.
---
this is underrated, i remember back in 2004 and entering the game
---
to this day, you dont find many games where people talk to eachother on open channels, granted im sure many more people will whisper now, depending on how many newbies are on your server
---
Honestly, some of my fondest memories in vanilla are getting stomped by horde (I was alliance) while leveling my first character.  It gave me more motivation to level up so I could return the favor sooner than later lol
---
He's the one that pulls aggro on all nearby lions as well right?
---
Leveling can be divided into 3 categories: Time spent killing, Time spent recovering, and time spent moving around. Cutting down any of these 3 categories can shorten your leveling experience drastically.  Mounts offer a massive movement bonus, which cuts down on the movement part of that formula. The transportation factor might be obvious, but how much it helps might not. It is massive if you are questing to level and still really good even if you are just grinding mobs (essential for aoe grinding later on). 
---
the ground you cover adds up to a lot, therefore getting you to 60 faster
---
needed on pvp servers too
---
&gt; Even average guilds wont let people with unviable classes raid with them. 
---
No classes are unviable. I assume you meant spec?
---
Tooook me so long to get a full run back in the day!
---
This is awful advice because people play for different reasons. Some people find being competitive cool so rolling a sub par class/spec will not be as fun for them. 
---
decent in pvp when ur fighting phys dmg
---
That's cool, and im sure that you were credit to your raid, but understand that the numbers are simply not on your side as a dps class, or even close. Playing what you want is well and good but it's simply a fact that shaman, priest, paladin, etc. dps is sub-optimal. Take that as hate if you want.
---
There's a lot of weirdness with that map: the placement of Dire Maul (wtf was that going to be?), Karazhan in vanilla?, Caverns of Time in vanilla?, Jaedenar actually makes sense, no idea what Tol Barad, Amberhorn Cavern is, and can't imagine what was supposed to be at Stonetalon Peak.
---
I happen to love the art style that Borderlands does. Different strokes I guess. 
---
Have an upvote for disagreeing with someone in a sensible manner. 
---
Yeah, but that gun has a LOT of stamina.
---
Hahaha I get it! :-)
---
I would love to be in a guild that does this. I mean come on, HES NUMBER 1, HES GOTTA HAVE IT
---
&gt;The classes which do good in Naxxramas are all fighting for top DPS throughout Vanilla, though. With the exception of Hunter. Just off the top of my head.
---
Warlock too. 
---
Yeah I was thinking about this. It was SUPPOSED to be in classic anyways I’m pretty sure. If they released it LONG after Naxx and only if the majority of players are cool with it, I’d be down for additional classic content as long as it stays true to the formula. Also it would make Atiesh’s portal ability so much cooler. That’s my opinion anyways. 
---
o rly
---
Sometimes haha
---
if yourself alrdy have the key and know the correct route, it will make things lot easier
---
not gonna lie. I was around 11 years old, ran around with my hunter and found this thing. Tamed him and around a week later i abandoned him. I had no idea he was rare. I was just a dumb kind wanting to tame everything i saw
---
No it's been said many times. best raid in all of wow being of somewhat equal level to naxx? Sounds great. I think it they did naxx it should be t2.5-3 difficulty. Harder than naxx near the end.   
---
Considering TBC had 10 god damn raids, it'd be nice to split Kara off from tbc and put it in classic.
---
back in the day I was one of the two best priests in the best guild on the server (only guild deep in naxx) and we were both night elf.  My memory is shot, and I havnt done my research but the only fight I remember having trouble was onyxia with fear? It's not as game breaking as those make it out to be.  I remember loving starshards in pvp and shadowmeld. I pushed up to r11 for the mount and felt really strong as a night elf priest.  
---
Might by hypocritical but if i play priest this time around I will probably go dwarf cuz i think female dwarfs are cute af and I want a slightly different experience.  
---
Yea which is like a few hundred or so people at most only this time they will be split up across 30 some servers. 
---
Saw a 99 roll followed by a 100 roll once. That must have been crushing for the first one.
---
one warlock destroyed me and 2 friends in the groves, because alliance can LoS dot you and hide behind elites lmao
---
I only switched into def + shield in the wolf phase and immediately switched into battle stance as soon as he assumed another form.
---
I was giving reasons why it was the most pervasive game in history....
---
NEVAR GIV UP
---
What class?
---
i seen hunters getting it, shamans too
---
I’ve died more times in that cave than I have died in dead mines 
---
But it still takes up space and makes me move my chat box higher. 
---
ESO is pretty fun, currently sitting at Chp170 on it, Els just came out so maybe I'll get that
---
I am not pro merger. Mergers are worse. Sharding is the lesser of two evils. That is of course assuming it’s only in starter zones for a short period.
---
&gt; I'm also fine with this, my only suggestion would be that after someone has been killed a certain amount of times by a ganker, perhaps then they should be immune to them for say.....10mins or something. 
---
I agree with all of your post except this bit, seems arbitrary.
---
The concept is cool and really well made, but as a Youtube intro its way to long :D 1min30sec.
---
Yes. That skill makes me going to the graveyard two times, making me a lot nervous. I need to rest and make him freeze with the ice trap. 
---
Cause that lock can stealth past everyone and get the quest item real quick. Or solo run bosses for gear. No wait... that’s rogue.
---
Priests use wands a lot while leveling or farming.  Mages and Warlocks use wands for stats only.  Guess who loves rolling on wands.....
---
That's fair, I've experienced first hand wipes on Ony via some dumb shit.
---
This post has been removed as a repost, I'm fairly sure it was up just the other day. 
---
Love the new short format.
---
This is the edited version. The extra panels were confusing people, so I deleted the previous posts
---
Shaman also have chain heal, so two buttons ;)
---
Re-approved, my bad. 
---
No it isn't worth it. It requires you to spend gold as most of the set is BoE and you'll out live the set pretty quickly. You are better off getting  herod's shoulder and helmet and maybe the pants if you have extra time. 
---
Improved concentration aura is extremely good and you will want concentration aura up almost all the time. Interrupts and silences are your biggest weakness as a holy paladin and almost every class has one to use on you.
---
I recommend this [build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuRgotVMtMMh).
---
if you have friend where you can try it out with sure.  
---
But please, why would you even try out this meme role.  
---
You are a DPS or a healer in dungeons or raids.  
---
The fact you can wear a shield doenst mean, you can suddenly tank or something.  
---
Im not sure if you are able  maintain treath on lvl 60 dungeons
---
Not an awful lot to it. Rockbiter on your weapon. Sword (mace) and board, use Earthshock as a taunt. AOE aggro is really difficult to manage and you'll be turning around to pull shit off your healer pretty regularly. 
---
It sure sounds fun but unless you have a guild with you I doubt people will take you as a tank even if it was viable ... Reminds me of demo warlock tanking ^^ 
---
Blizzard does not have the data themselves either. They have the client and its source code but do not have a _complete_ backup of the database. Chances are they will also guess with a lot of values.
---
Yeah sure if you get a bunch of terrible mages. Surely you'll come across a mage who knows how to kite you. 
---
I remember playing another MMO with a very active world PvP community ( Faction vs Faction) , was not just a server.  
---
When you get killed , you were forced to ask for help from your faction / guild , as they came in to help the opposing guy calls in reinforcements. ***What started out as a level 30 camping level 25 in a level 25\~35 zone, over a period of 30\~60 minutes escalated to a full on faction war with around  30 vs 30 max level(120\_ players duking  it out in a starter zone.***  I was so damn proud for being the level 25 player who called for help , for a long time in the server i played people remembered that particular skirmish fondly and even the players involved in it .   
---
In the same game i also knew for a fact that a lot of players quit very early when they got ganked by high level players repeatedly , PvP games are not for everybody sometimes things are very unfair and that motivates you to even things out by getting better (levels , gears , skills , friends , guilds etc) . **I also remember making it to 120 before the level 30 player who used to gank me and KoS him hard until i moved on from the game.**  
---
Yeah I got so hyped for classic that I logged onto my old account to check things out. So different now and your right nobody really talks to each other in dungeons anymore. Its like they took the soul out of the game.
---
That works until you realize you need to get taken along by groups/guilds for the relevant content. 
---
As soon as what you choose to play affects other people's experience in the game you're no longer picking only for yourself. You'll find it harder to do the group content you'd like to do if you're picking weak stuff that might be a hindrance for the group. 
---
its not worth getting it.
---
But i like sets like these  
---
I've had it on my shaman.
---
Also had the Wailing Cavers sets... i like to collect :D  
---
So for fun yes, but its not worth getting int as main gear.
---
Aaah this reminds me of good old days where me and my friends would secretly log into each other's accounts at 4 AM, destroyed the character's hearthstone, banked all their gear, packed their bags full of cheap vendor food and ran halfway across the world just to log out in the middle of nowhere. 
---
&gt; the spec does less than 50% of the damage of a similarly geared proper DPS class.
---
I've always wanted DPS meters to include the damage your party does from imp WF totem as the shaman's. That way this bullshit idea that everyone needs to be competing on meters can stop. Enhancement is a support class. Just like Spriest. There's a place for one in the raid. 
---
Whatever it takes to gear up and spec elemental 2-3 months down the line lol. 
---
Not classic, but I am still salty about running Ulduar and the Guild Leader's brother who just started playing WoW was invited right when he dinged. We were literally carrying him hard, and when the worldbreaker dropped, the axe I desperately needed, he was allowed to roll too and he beat me on the roll. 
---
I still remember his, "woot!" in chat. I've never been more upset about loot. 
---
Yeah RFC is really useless as far as dungeon drops go- but it does have a lot of quests and if you do a full clear it's a decent chunk of XP.    WC is the first instance that has a couple good (blue) quest rewards and also most of the bosses drop blues.  In that sense it's the first place you go where there's really a chance to get top-tier gear for your level.  RFC just doesn't have that same feel to it.  
---
Not classic, it was TBC, but after KJ died  on our realm they had the legendary bow drop (how lucky right?).  They gave it to the dual glaive rogue.  
---
It made sense, since it didn't use ammo so it was technically a downgrade over quel'thalas haha.  I would have been pissed though.
---
Yeah. Definitely do not do this.
---
Call us immature, but our guild's house rule was '69 always wins.'
---
I enjoyed the leveling experience
---
Also, the best gear you get from leveling is mainly quest rewards and BoP gear from dungeons :-) 
---
lmao is this the new enhancement player copypasta or what 
---
Naw make em do the walk to the spirit healer in another zone to Rez 😂😂😂
---
Not a dps in raids tho really, basically only healing.
---
While corpse camping is clearly griefing, afaik it's not against the TOS. So corpse campers should be fine. 
---
But I'm glad I won't need to deal with it this time around though, I'm going for a Normal server. 
---
Classic warrior trying to turn people away so he can get more loot smh.
---
early cata was amazing. the nerfs to difficulty were the beginning of the end for me. 
---
This I was a pally at release. In the beginning, we had to optimize till we had it on farm (hate that place, 43 damn trips for my judegment legs). As time went on, we got geared up good, we could start loosening what gear went to who and specs (I kept 31 in holy, but could now go 20 in ret and become the dreaded shockadin!). You got 40 spots, if everyone is competent you got room for a couple of offspecs, but there will be competition for those spots probably.
---
Buying gear doesn't really move the needle all that much in classic, other than weapons of course.
---
Gold
---
I died so many times there compared to other places, it makes sense that it was originally meant to be a dungeon. Thanks for the info
---
The sample size of important rolls in this game is so low that it really sucks to be the guy on the one side of the distribution who lost them all. 
---
RFC can be done at a lower level than Deadmines. Deadmines and WC are more closely related, though I'd say WC is more difficult of the two.
---
LFM
---
true.  
---
Untill your Main tank got  \[Tunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker\]  
---
Then he want a enhance shammy with WF totem in his party :)  
---
100% ethical. 100% in the spirit on the game
---
I'd like the option to spend all day mining and herbing, then exchange that for a carry so u can focus on gearing and progression
---
Well yes, although just another healing shaman can do that too.
---
Shaman
---
Incase you care, Warhammer online still has a private server going that's decently popular called Return of Reckoning. Installing that is pretty simple, too.
---
Pop music was objectively better in the boomer era than it is now. 
---
But niche or underground music is magnitudes better than anything from that era.
---
Same situation. WoW was good for a pop culture game. But pales in comparison to some niche games. For example, DotA2.
---
The problem is that as for games that are similar to Vanilla WoW, they keep messing up in vibe, lore, aesthitics, gameplay, design, etc. Something is always wrong that keeps the mmorpg from being on-par with vanilla. This is the anomaly.
---
It doesn't matter if the "numbers are against you," not everything needs to be "optimized." The game isn't about min-maxing, and it's not necessary for 99% of players or content.
---
I never played Rift when it came out and I deeply regret it. Its class system is something that, after playing Path of Exile since beta, would be right up my alley.
---
I love making weird builds and really wish more MMORPGs would value creativity over viability and balance when it comes to stuff like buildvariety, class skills being interesting and mechanics synergizing well with another.
---
After playing Horde you should know pretty well that Fear Ward is an unnecessary crutch for bad playing. And Dwarves look pretty dumb in robes.
---
2-3 hits? That's optimistic. You should stick to mobs not higher than your level with optimal 1-2 below. Also questing is on average faster than mob grind - unless quests are overwhelmed - then farm spots or mass running early dungeon.
---
&gt;It made sense, since it didn't use ammo so it was technically a downgrade over quel'thalas
---
That's not true. Because it doesn't use arrows, Thori'dal has a massive dps bonus baked in as well as the 15% attack speed buff you'd get from using a quiver with any other bow. It's by far the best weapon for hunters.
---
I’m going to slowly level my UD priest on a pserver just to relearn the quests so I’m not running around like an idiot when it’s launched.....it’s been like 15 years lol 
---
I’m having a blast so far.  I’d give it a try tbh 
---
Depends on your class and gear. The type of mob should also be taken into consideration. Ideally you want to grind mobs that are easy to, as close to your level as possible and have decent loot/can be skinned.
---
Nah people got banned for that, even on private servers.
---
Well, the totem is 30% less effective, and they have to stay within 20 yards of the melee group. But yeah, they can.
---
... and this is another reason why I like Horde in Vanilla =P
---
True true
---
I would say it depends on your class and gear. Ideally jobs your xp level will be most efficient in time/xp gain, but let's say for the poor, under geared, solo warrior you might even want to grind green mobs. 
---
How many times are you going to post this garbage?
---
I edited this one to make more sense and deleted the old ones. Just seeing how this one does
---
Killing mobs your level is your best bet for the optimal exp/hour. This takes into account downtime, and combat time. The bonus for killing a mob one level higher than you is not worth the time spent in combat. 
---
I'd say they are nearly the same.  Essentially playing whack a mole to keep yourself occupied. 
---
Yeah shamans do have totems but are you forgetting you will be spamming chain heal for large duration of a raid, esp in MC/BWL?
---
Just play whatever you enjoy more
---
Holy Reckoning hands down. 
---
Yeah. It’s not in the WoW diary. 
---
Calling BS on this one. 
---
I shamtanked with my guild up through LBRS while using mostly pvp gear and some rep gear from AV.  I won't lie, it sucked and we only did it when we couldn't find a real tank.  We wiped a lot and had to stop to eat/drink after every pull.  It required a great healer and a lot of CC to pull off.  As someone who remembers doing it...I honestly don't reccomend it. 
---
Only thing funny about this is your username. 
---
The post is bad, and you should feel bad.
---
I am quite knowledgeable on the subject.
---
To put it as simply as possible, without going into math, etc.
---
Shaman tanks are capable of reaching the same stats as a feral bear tank. (bears can tank nearly everything in wow) Make of that, what you will...
---
Nice, I am torn between troll or orc if my buddy rolls horde. I like troll race and being less common of a race, beserk sounds nice too. However that 25% stun resist would be super nice against rogues. In what ways did beserk help you, healing groups/yourself?
---
There have been *tons* of small patches to the game and custom games are being played more than ever right now.
---
Big points:
---
- Everyone can host now. No port forwarding, no makemehost, you press "Host game" and it *works*. Beautiful.
---
- No need for bot hosting because you can kick and ban players plus you're able to see the ping of players.
---
- 24 man is a thing now. Yeah. One person short off of remaking a realistic TBC-raid map, crazy right?
---
- Actual 16:9 support, Windowed Fullscreen, Balance patches that according to the r/wc3 sub aren't completely terrible, oh my!
---
WC3 reforged will, if I get this correctly, be compatible with the old game. I'll still buy reforged, if only for the much improved interface that actually shows mostt of the screen. (The old one didn''t show anything because the screen to render gameplay in was actually so small they had to hide it under the UI, one of many tricks to make it run well)
---
I can't wait to play it, way more than Classic WoW even. I met some of my best friends via Warcraft 3, I've learned to pseudo code thanks to it, and I've played so many custom maps that it should amount to more than 2000 hours easily. This game means a ton to me.
---
^^please ^^don't ^^fuck ^^it ^^up ^^Blizz ^^PLEASE
---
Without an official hard date it probably will be pushed back by a few weeks.  I think the majority believes it's between the end of June and early july so I agree with Aug which I am fine with.
---
Num lock in every game lol
---
Whats your solution?  Spoiler alert:  there isnt a good one
---
&gt;the totem is 30% less effective
---
I wouldn't say that. Sure, the bonus AP is 30% less, but it's all about that extra swing you get from it.
---
Maybe. Eventually if your guild has the place on farm mode it's bound to happen.
---
Shamans look bad ass by aq with healing gear.
---
Basically something gets made by a dedicated fan base, by them for them, and it takes off and a lot of normies/casuals seeing something new and growing are attracted to it, and in turn corporation get attracted to it because they see a potential goldmine, buy it out, and in attempting to cater to the lowest common denominator nerf it in to the ground ruining it and adding micro-transactions, then everyone gets fed up and leaves.
---
Then I tried to make some suggestions for people to try and keep classic as such, since I know Activision/Corporate Blizzard \*will\* begin to change it (whether adding tokens or stuff like that), but apparently my opinion wasn't very popular /shrug
---
Karazan was completed years before vanilla released.
---
No, The Rake had an attack speed of 1.2. 
---
It was "BiS" for annoying casters in PVP until "Broken Tooth".

Meh at least I had a good laugh making it.
---
“Hello Toyota Headquarters. ‘Battle for Ass-off?’ No that doesn’t sound like something we’d be interested in. Thank you for your call.”
---
1 week off. 40 hour leveling shifts and hopefully be 60 by the 6th day. 
---
At level 15, here's the XP breakdown for mob kills:
---
|Mob Level|XP|
---
--:|--:|
---
|12|75|
---
|13|90|
---
|14|105|
---
|15|120|
---
|16|126|
---
|17|132|
---
|18|138​|
---
Same level is usually best, since higher mobs only grant 5% more xp per level, so unless you can kill a level 17 in the same amount of time it takes to kill a 15, the xp benefit is moot. 15% longer to kill something for 10% benefit?
---
Same with lower mobs. Unless you can absolutely obliterate a level 13 fast, the loss of 25% xp for 2 levels over isn't worth it.
---
That being said... Any and every mob in front of you should be killed at all times while leveling.
---
Specifically while grinding tho... do the math based on your expected kills per minute, since grinding = no travel time, you're only considering time to kill and recovery time. I personally grind level 13 mobs from 11-16, and level 18 mobs from 16-21. If grinding 'optimal' mobs includes travel time vs 'suboptimal' with no travel time... might as well camp out and kill +/- 2 mobs.
---
By that logic Rank 1 WF totem should be used because it costs less mana and it's all about that extra swing. 
---
I barely avoided something similar on the last server I played on. Main hand Dal'rends dropped and another rogue was considering rolling on it even though he had a Perd/CHT combo. I already had the offhand too and he didn't.
---
Sorry if I came across harsh. If you got a laugh out of it, that's great I guess.
---
Thank you. This is exactly what i was looking for.
---
Did you ever get it?
---
The issue W\* failed was it didn't cater them well enough. There was raiding, but its development got stopped rather soon. Attunement was annoyingly tedious but meaningless inmersion-wise. 
---
If u focus a niche you need to atract that one niche. W\* failed miserably at it. They did too much design mistakes to do so. 
---
I had fun with SWTOR and even re-subbed a couple times to check out new content. The storylines are super well done, and the classes and skills are quite enjoyable. 
---
But it feels like WoW-lite to me. The world is more like a semi-linear RPG than a true open world - if you see something on the horizon in WoW, you can get there. In SWTOR you often can't, and most zones have clear limited pathways to get around. A lot of art assets are re-used way too much, for both environments and gear. No world PvP to speak of. It never feels like a real place, which is huge for MMOs.
---
Wasn’t Conan before Warhammer?
---
What about SWtoR? Or uh that game where you played angels...Aion? And Star Trek Online...and.....
---
Rift. It was actually an incredible game that made me forget all about WoW. Until their first expansion, where they got rid of the sub fee but instead added a cash shop where you could literally buy gear. I miss that game a lot, it had my favorite class from any mmo, the Chloromancer mage.
---
I've never had that much fun with a class before! And the way macros worked made it even more fun.
---
Same, at least for the leveling experience. Once I hit max level I got bored fast. 
---
That's for posting this *again*
---
Loot council is far superior if done correctly.
---
If you take a look at all the guilds that actually clear aq40 and naxx you'll notice almost none of them are DKP. 
---
No, it's not griefing, you may not like it but camping a corpse is legitimate.
---
It's almost tradition at this point to get my first death on every character at this place!
---
The first Guild Wars was great, but I don't think anyone ever expected it to be a WoW killer. It was more like a MMO-Diablo 2 hybrid. I miss the completely open hybrid skill system so much, Guild Wars 2 is way more limited.
---
i tried spending all of my time with my dad trying to camp this on our shared hunter class. We found out that statiscally speaking it was better to park your toon there for log in and log out to help increase the chances. Sure enough after 2.5 weeks of logging out near his spawn camp resulted in taming him a day before work.
---
As someone that played it at launch, and hit the cap pretty fast, respectfully, the designer you quote was terrible at his fucking job.
---
Swtor’s Main failure was a complete lack of endgame content, when the first round of players hit the cap.
---
Raids weren’t open, the big open world PvP zone wasn’t ready yet, and then launched in several different broken iterations over the first few months of the game. 
---
The folks that ran it honestly has no idea what endgame MMO players were like. They really thought people would cap out on several toons, before even looking for raids, etc, which was a comically bad miscalculation. 
---
They didn’t do their homework or understand the genre. 
---
His blaming their failure on trying to be WoW like is laughable. Before then they just ignored endgame entirely. 
---
I'm starting now just to figure out the macros.  I first started about a month before TBC came out, and I guess at that point they overhauled the scripting format.  I'm used to stuff like /cast [mod:shift] blah; blah blah...but that simple formatting doesn't exist at all in vanilla.
---
Do you start with 0% hit when you hit lvl 60?
---
You'll get whittled down with moonfire and insect swarm with no possible chance for counter play.  They're both instant with no cooldown so iceblock won't help you.  You can't chase because Druids can shift out of roots and slows, move a lot faster and can punish Blink/Frostbolts with feral charge and bash.
---
Rejuve alone is enough to outheal fireblast and any instant casts you get hit with, while some druids even have swiftmend.  The idea is to stay far away at around 30 yards and outrange Frostbolts with travel form.  If there's a pillar or object the druid can hump, it's probably one of the most one sided matchups in the game; it's just completely unfair.  The upside for mage players are a lack of druids in general.
---
30.0 yards ≈ 27.4 metres ^(1 yard ≈ 0.92m)
---

&gt;They have the client and its source code but *do not have a complete backup of the database*
---
Uh, yeah they do. They have all server side code and data from at least 1.12 at the latest, not sure where you got info otherwise. If they only had the client they'd be in no better of a position than private server devs.
---
&gt; my $$$ would be prioritized for gear over a mount early in that game.
---
Early gear doesn't make too much of a difference aside from weapons for melee. A badass sword might increase your damage 20% but a 40 mount increases your travel speed by 60%
---
Let's say your leveling experience is split evenly 33% fighting, 33% recovery, 33% travel. A 60% boost to one of those is equal to a 60% boost to any other - and you're not getting a 60% boost to any of the others.
---
And even if you got the best sword available and it gave you a 60% damage boost at 40, it'd trend downward and even out to other gear and be 0% by 60, whereas the mount is flat 60% travel speed from 40-60.
---
People Rolling in downgrades that are upgrades for you pisses me off the most. Happens constantly in the p server guild I'm in atm.
---
All the feels. 
---
And for some of us, such frustration is grounds for quitting. Ive seen some people on here wish that Blizz simply do not have any pve servers, but I hope they ignore that minority and give us non-pvpers a place to be as well. 
---
No
---
Agreed. Hopefuly, this will happen rarely in the actual Classic.
---
Sadly most of them will pull the reasoning that deep restos will also have it (not talented, though, so slightly weaker) and the loss of dps being enh is more than the loss of that 30% WF boost and having u healing as full resto (while getting a straight dps).
---
You won't stop these annoying minmaxers this way.  
---
Not a thing in vanilla, no
---
(also have fun with constantly failing attempts)
---
I think that the way one would write macros in retail is different than in vanilla, so you may have to write them w/ modern scripting lingo as opposed to Vanillas, but I'm not sure. 
---
Semi-related, I'd love for this sub to do a Macro sticky day, where someone/people can give pointers on helpful macros or just how to write them in general. 
---
The best one I have encountered was a modified suicide kings, it eliminated most of the loot drama in the guild I was in &amp; everybody was ok with that approach. Essentially, we had everybody go through the loot table for the entire raid instance and identify what loot items they were interested in, and there was a fair &amp; balanced way of loot distribution.
---
Wow. Seems you have some experience...
---
How did you avoid it? Did you just talk it out?
---
Oh, I remember the failing (and failing, and failing again, and wtf this thing is GREEN ARHGGH), just couldn't remember if the exp was there or not.
---
Back in TBC my guild was a bit goofy, we had the policy of 69 being instant win, above 100. 
---
It was pretty early on in Kara, can’t remember which tier piece, but we had a guy roll a 99, a guy roll a 100, and I won with a 69.
---
Wtf really you get xp for professions? 
---
Well, yeah, but that doesn't always work. It is not like you always find a group without any other warriors and rogues when you go for that Dalrends...
---
Yeah I'm honestly wondering what they'll do there...they're using the modern engine, so does that mean modern macros as well, or back to the way they were?
---
I don't know whatever weird definition whoever made that guide used, but it's definitely since corpse camping literally serves no other purpose than to make the other person enjoy the game as little as possible. 
---
Honestly a lot of times this works as almost a filter of folks that I wouldn't want to play with anyway. If someone is that much an elitist I probably won't enjoy playing with them anyway. 
---
So how did the ammo work with that item? I know it was summoned by the bow, but I mean the multiplier of damage. Because arrows had multipliers for damage done, right?
---
Ahh, Humar... I have great memories of killing him and Echeyakee when hunters were trying to tame..
---
&gt;Go to Barrens
---
&gt;See Hunter camping spawn area
---
&gt;stealth
---
&gt;make macro
---
/target Humar
---
/Cast Moonfire (rank 10)
---
&gt;spam macro for as long as it takes while watching TV
---
I can't wait to do it all over again.... also, watch out Hunters trying to do the leaf quest. I'll be there too.
---
At least it was still a roll. It would be worse if it was just given to the guy. Though I absolutely understand you.
---
Kara was the first dungeon they built I think and all the CoT stuff was in the game files from vanilla
---
Why even bother going there? This is one I always skip. Those Kobold Geomancers are the Defias Pillages of Elwynn
---
Old ones deleted, this one is very cut down
---
True. I tend to say that everything is viable - don't let other people tell you differently - but not for everything. You wan't to play a non-healer paladin? Well, you might be allowed to go Ret in Raiding, but don't expect to be a tank at all. However, if you like PvP, Ret is your thing. It is a beast. And if you like tanking, then you might enjoy doing dungeons! Also, Prot Farming with a lot of mobs is super fun if you have the gear.
---
Now imagine that this is not even close to the worst things added in Cataclysm.
---
#nochanges. I would never play and would instantly begin my journey on a private server if that dumb idea was implemented. I don't want safety and I don't want safety for my foes.
---
You just spam low rank chain heal tho, so still one button.
---
I remember always losing the DBW trinket in ICC, while I was playing Feral DPS and in all honesty doing incredible. It was all I needed to ascend my character to the next level, but I could never win the damn thing despite passing it at least a hundred times.  
---
I offered to give my like, 30,000 gold to some Spanish huntard (he was bad) who won the trinket, but he turned me down and still proceeded to float towards the bottom of the pack. It was so disheartening.  
---
Loot rolls are what they are, however.
---
I like SK. We used that pretty heavily. I still think DKP is a little fairer as it rewards those who attend without punishing those who dont. Your DKP goes up above those who don't attend. SK if you are near the top say.... position 3. And don't attend several raids, when you come back you're still in the same slot above position 4 who perhaps attended all those raids. That would be my only argument for DKP over SK. DKP rewards attendance while SK doesn't if you're at the top. Both are good systems though. I don't know if there is still a mod that supports SK though.
---
Yes it's worthwhile
---
It's used in the warlock epic mount quest iirc
---
I probably should have made it just say "play what you find cool". The thing is that if you are an elitist or trully do find the most viable of classes and specs cool, then you should play them and this post does NOT tell you otherwise. It only references the people saying that they shouldn't play some classes because they are sub-viable or even unviable. That's my point.
---
Can I play fire mage in your guild's MC runs?
---
It serves more purpose than that. It gives real consequence and threat to your actions. You meet new enemies and adapt in different ways as such. Your enemy may come to know your farm spot or vice versa. You may become enemies because you share the same farm.
---
All of that ties into immersion, and I truly believe people that whined contributed to ruining retail WoW.
---
WPVP was in bad shape before BFA, but warmode utterly destroyed any remaining resemblance of World PVP we had. If you don't want to get corpse camped, I suggest playing retail where warmode exists. 
---
The rest of us? We want our game back.
---
Frost Shooooooock!
---
Then play that. The two statements aren't meant to be contrary to each other.
---
Absolutely agreed.
---
I wouldn't say it is necessarily easy to get into groups. If you want to get easily into groups, you want to be a tank or a healer. However, play what you find cool. Hunter is very viable - don't let you my previous statement make you think different - and if you find them cool, then it should definitely be the class you play.
---
Still sucks.
---
Yesss
---
10. is the only reason I need. If I'm not tanking, I'm not having fun so my options are pretty limited. 
---
It didn’t happen to be Analogkid, did it? I’m still filled with rage thinking about Thori’dal going to a fucking rogue.
---
You know, when I roll these dungeons for loot and not the quests, I barely ever take any warriors or rogues. 
---
I disagree. Perhaps it is the best pure progression system, but like I say, it has to be implemented correctly. If you have a flakey member, or a drama queen, it instantly runs into fairness issues people will argue over. My guild has run a DKP system with 90% tier squishes and its worked pretty successfully. We've had the odd drama yes, but there are clear rules everyone, including officers and the GM, follows. 
---
Loot council only really works in the very top guilds like you mention, and those make up probably 5% of the raiding guilds if that.
---
For a warrior (possibly other melee), killing mobs roughly 2 levels lower is optimal due to their defense skill relative to your weapon skill. Killing mobs the same level results in so many parries/dodges etc that the 25% decrease is worth it to kill lower level mobs.
---
Now only if you cared that much about your mind, and how extremely ignorant you seem. You're missing an entire section of well being, it's called being intelligent enough to know when you're in over your head and should shut up.
---
Nice argument. Looks like I’ve hit a nerve eh? 
---
Or you roll the 99 and the other guy 100.
---
W is for running, alt+w is autorun, alt+s is follow 😉
---
If hitting a nerve means explainingto you how stupid your take on tattoos is, then yes. Very nerve, many nerve.
---
I noticed this more from ret pallies and enhancement shaman.
---
"Guys, I need the minuscule amount of crit that item with only agility and stamina has on it" - Every enhancement shaman I've ever grouped with. 
---
Konriad merged into Emerald, Johari merged into Markov.
---
P.S. Get off cyssor.
---
Do you remember that in the beginning there was only a roll button and no separation between 'need' and 'greed' ?
---
I remember that you had to type 's' for sell or 'n' for need in the chat, together with your roll.
---
One guy leveled a character all the way to max by only mining/herbalism in Mists of Pandaria (90). No quests/kills. Times have changed. The commentary isn't the best, but here are the details: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BILfSG66ar8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BILfSG66ar8)
---
Just a talent that increases it by 6% (so 36% boost with AotCheetah up). There's another one but is pet-only (and outdoors-only as well...).
---
They have the same files and map that Blizzard has lmao. Another person talking out of his ass trying to make private servers look bad.
---
bUT iTs noT LUpUs oR bRokEN tOoTH?
---
Jokes aside as a kid I just went with what was cool. The tigers on Echo Isles come to mind.
---
It worked out imo because the unprompted exploration of interesting and mysterious locations are many, many of my fondest memories of this game. Going into cool locations without a quest and just discovering it for yourself is awesome.
---
Whatever happened to the instance entrance in SW inside the wall between old town and the trade district?
---
Unfortunately an enhancement shaman with nightfall is not even close to being worth a slot in a raid. Consider this: A fury warrior using Nightfall does dramatically more DPS than an enhancement shaman with it. Also by using hamstring every global cooldown that isn't already being used by their normal DPS abilities that all have a chance to proc nightfall they provide around three times as much Nightfall uptime as an enh shaman that only can stormstrike every 20 seconds.
---
But it is rarely worth it for a fury warrior to swap from their usual weapon to Nightfall. And enhancement shaman is dramatically worse, so why should they be brought?
---
This was one of the changes i liked.
---
There are some bows that are for hunters and some bows that are for melee or tanks because of the stats they provide. Good guilds will know what gear goes to whom. There are also melee weapons that aren't great for DPS but have really good stats for hunters like the dagger from ZG.   
---
If a hunter was given a weapon it was either because that weapon was best for him and not you or because your guild didn't know what to do with loot. If you look into what items are good for what classes you should have an idea about whether you can expect your class to be given a particular item.
---
I haven't seen that so much with Shaman, but 1005 noticed it with pug pallies.  The attitude seems to be "This thing that would be a big upgrade for  you will give me 1/2% more DPS, so imma need on it...".      
---
The one that burns most still has to be a warrior needing on hunter weapons though.   Unless they're min-maxed out the ass, most warriors could be pulling with a level 5 green and no one would notice..
---
For sure lol I know it’s not for everyone.  I don’t see why they wouldn’t have a mix of server types.  If I remember correctly classic had dedicated PvP, pve, and rp servers 
---
Either that or try to get that farmer guy laid...
---
Don't worry. Your friends can roll need on it and trade it to you. sTrEAmLinEd ExPeRiENcE
---
If it's the instant 60 server with all the venders with gear in hyjal then that server has a bunch of bad numbers. Heath and armor values are all wrong for mobs. If it's that server I wouldn't trust it. But then again since the server I tested on is still private, their numbers could be wrong. 
---
The big trick to them is keeping a rank 1 earth shock for times when you need to taunt adds but max rank earth shock would be overkill. It saves you tons of mana.
---
The rest is down to playing triage with your auto attacks with rockbiter on.
---
This character recently hit 120
---
Yeah pretty much. I was like "C'mon man... I'm using a Thrash Blade and you're in full t1".
---
&gt; Or in Strat Live, I'd ask if I could have the Righteous Orbs. 
---
Orbs plural wouldn't wash - tanks on a big Pvt Server can reserve the first, round robin after that.
---
Last time I checked, getting the Legion to Azeroth was a highly laborious process that involved quite a bit of undead, candles, _and_ evil magic.
---
Why was it postponed until the expansion, then?
---
Aside from druids, I reeeeally don't think Mulgore will be overwhelmed :\
---
Go Axesmith and craft Nightfall/Annihilator. These are used in raids often to buff raid dps. 
---
Bad phrasing on my part. Was only arguing that it's not 30% less effective as a totem. The extra AP is obviously beneficial.
---
That sounds amazing, I hope you guys make it happen. Post pictures of you do!!
---
u/whenitsready any thoughts on this? Did you design the Jasperlod Mine and, either way, have any insight as to whether it was being considered as a 5-man dungeon?
---
I didn't know that, that's crazy
---
it is all within the game algorithm, you must do a "fuck up" roll to break that chain. (/roll 33-44, enter\*) after being called out on a false roll, simply so a normal /roll afterwards, this will break the chain of low rolls and typically lets you make an average roll number guaranteeing a win, note to do this when you see all party members rolling petty numbers 1-10
---
I never said you didn't, but their lore had been freshly retconned and there theme had been completely changed.  Blizzard doubled down on it in Legion, to the point where portals are largely superfluous because they can just fly anywhere they want in spaceships.
---
Steam punk was never the primary theme in Warcraft.  It was in TBC.
---
You haven’t explained anything. You’ve just said I’m ignorant and I’m in over my head. 
---
So cmon buddy, I’m waiting for this explanation of yours. Tell me how wrong I am ;)
---
SK might not be the best choice for a group with a lower threshold of attendance. ie, make 80% of the raids or you're out (not fair to the rest of the raid.) It worked for me, the group consisted of all working adults age 30 &amp; over, so there was more stability.  
---
Some systems of DKP do not include decay, so someone with great attendance could disappear for a couple months, come back at the start of a new raid tier and be in good position to get some nice loot.
---
Viskag and Onslaught were pug MC/ony runs and the emp lava run I was summoned and it was my very first run ever on that server when I saw it drop :(
---
Yeah, modern hardware and client are going to be great. Just a heads up if you haven't played since Vanilla, dungeon sets are pretty much a meme. Dungeon blues with good secondary stats outclass them easily.
---
It was never the primary theme of Warcraft prior to TBC, but it was one of _the_ defining traits of TBC.
---
Didn't know that. That's pretty neat.
---
Projects get moved around a lot. Guess it just wasn’t time for them to release it.
---
Jaedenar is always a cool experience. Very clear it was fleshed out to be a dungeon.
---
Very clear Jaedenar was fleshed out to be a dungeon. Such a cool area.
---
Yes, and I didn't like it.
---
&gt; TBC all day. That's when I started playing
---
'nuff said
---
Yes. You want to get 9% hit to reach the hitcap against lvl 63 monsters. ?? bosses count as lvl 63. This means getting a total of 9% +hit from items/talents/etc.
---
That is assuming you have 300 weapon skill and are fighting against lvl 63 monsters, which means they have 315 defense skill. You also need 5% hit to be hitcapped in PVP against other players at level cap.
---
&gt; If you have a flakey member, or a drama queen,
---
Then you part ways with those people because they are nothing but trouble and it's not in the guilds best interest to keep them around.
---
&gt;My guild has run a DKP system with 90% tier squishes and its worked pretty successfully.
---
What does pretty successful mean? Cleaing MC and BWL is one thing but from what I've seen on pservers you rarely see a dkp guild downing cthune. 
---
&gt;Loot council only really works in the very top guilds like you mention, and those make up probably 5% of the raiding guilds if that.
---
I would say about 50% if not more of the guilds now a days on pserver run loot council. It is a lot more self regulating than people seem to think here on the forums. Like if it's not run fairly the guild will fail because people will leave, which isn't the main of objective of the officers. Most of these guys want to actually down cthune and kt they aren't worried about hoarding bwl loot all to themselves. 
---
isn't world breaker a tbc item
---
Honestly the cataclysm elwynn forest music is so good.
---
Made up reasons. Farm spots, consequence to actions, meeting new enemies my ass. It's max lvl characters oneshotting lowbies. Nothing even remotely resembling a fight here. Lvl 60s corpse camping lvl 25s in low level areas has nothing to do with anything except enjoyment in ruining someone else's day. 
---
I've never played war mode but from what I've read there's plenty of world PvP, people are just complaining about faction imbalance. Not really up to date on that though, I've stopped playing BfA about 2 months ago.
---
&gt; If you don't want to get corpse camped, I suggest playing retail where warmode exists.
---
Or you know, I'm just rolling Normal when Classic releases :) 
---
Bad gatekeeping attempt. 
---
This was a portal that would go to a player housing area. It didn't make it into the final game, unfortunately. I remember this being confirmed, but I sadly don't have the source.
---
Oh yeah I'm sure they are not as good as I think they are, I was just obsessed with getting them during that time but my internet made incredibly difficult. It's of just satisfying my younger selfs goals heh.
---
More accurate-
---
Cool weapon: *drops* 
---
Me: Guys, I need this.
---
Second warrior: Same 
---
Me: Alright, let's roll for it then.
---
Second warrior: *rolls 98*
---
Me: *rolls 1*
---
Enhancement shaman that everyone hates: *rolls 100*
---
"grats"
---
I always use it when traveling far honestly. Just caps lock and hold right mouse to turn. It's really frustrating when I get stuck and have to manually move my character out of the way.
---
&gt; Azeroth was never a barren wasteland during TBC.
---
It was for anything except low level players, which is exactly what he said:
---
&gt; separating the playerbase into high-level and low-level continents made azeroth a barren wasteland
---
You better make your name start with 'aaa' lest you roll a 100 just like the other guy but they win it for having their name take priority due to the alphabet.
---
Just sounds like PvP isn't for you if that's how you feel about it, you shouldn't take it so personally.
---
Stonetalon Peak has a den like the one in Teldrassil. It is a mini dungeon for horde which holds two elite quests. Couldve been a dungeon with lots and lots of dryads and kotgs like you see couple of in Maraudon. 
---
Tol Barad either Green Dragon Aspect/ emerald nightmare fuel or dwarves.
---
This is true. There are some people who think the coolest thing is what's said to be strongest, and that's okay too
---
Probably not completed, completed but more like a sketch just like Azshara battleground and the likes.
---
These dudes are bein harsh. But such is the life of a meme warrior. 
---
Good attempt, I’m not sure what the point is, found myself pretty confused. Sharpen it up and try again dawg
---
Yeah, same as the people that roll need only because you rolled need on it.  You cana tell because they always have this long pause before clicking need.  I had a warr roll on the hakkar 1h axe when he had a bre (horde) and it was a huge upgrade for me.  Always wait for the last second to roll if you have competition that might roll against you.   
---
I remember having to team up with 2 other guys to make a quest in loch modan. Not the elite quests with the ogers, but a normal mine with kobolds in it. They where so dangerous and kept respawning before I got one down :p 
---
In that group I first saw that roll-window pop up and pressed that button and the other guys told me to state if it's N or S and not just roll on the item.
---
Thst would encourage someone to camp a player until they are on cooldown. 
---
This guy sounds like a blast at parties.
---
Kara and Caverns of Time weren't/aren't in Kalimdor lol
---
that gate was meant for player housing that never got added
---
I never do either oooooh shit 
---
It also has marvelous weapons for all melee classes from the quest and decent silver.
---
Ah yes.  Good ol' Anklepopper and Kneecapper stabbing your shins to death.
---
I think they initially just did it out of pride.  I'm sure it's turned a good profit by now, though.  FFXIV is one of the success stories, definitely, and a very good game.
---
Wildstar made plenty of mistakes, especially with their endgame.  It's like it was four games that they glued together artlessly.
---
tell me more of the servers my friend - I want to get a base of play + figure out what class Im gonna roll for Classic. Figured this would be a good time to do so. 
---
This game I played on release, and man, it was a bad experience.  I felt there was a lot of potential there though.
---
What the fuck are you talking about - Caverns of Time is in Taranis. Kara is in Deadwind Pass on the Eastern Kingdoms. Hyjal Summit is 100% a TBC raid. You should play the game sometime. 
---
HAHA omg this is a very accurate representation of activisions current logical decision making, i think i can see sharding coming from his mouth, gee willikers I hope they don't have us all fazein out in STV :p... Personally... I am against sharding  
---
When you finally able to mine Rich Thorium, find a node, fail. fail. fail. (see a guy B-lining it straight to you) *panic intensifies* 
---
Fair enough. 
---
As for your last comment. I did not mean that loot council was a rare method of loot assignment, only that in almost all cases it has failed.
---
Dragon Sickness is an insidious killer... *opens wallet*
---
Read what you said:
---
&gt; Kara, Hyjal, Caverns of Time - all on Kalimdor.
---
Dumbass.
---
&gt; I also remember making it to 120 before the level 30 player who used to gank me and KoS him hard until i moved on from the game.
---
And that revenge is so, so fucking sweet
---
All is part and parcel of a PvP game. 
---
It’s not about changing PvP it’s about managing expectations so you know what you’re getting into. Not for carebears
---
Yeah there's 1 - 2 mages in my guild like this. We don't have dkp but are starting kinda with a loot council type of system now. But in the start it was just ffa. Like I didn't have my bloodvine yet and some others had it. Yeah arcanist pants aren't that good but they are better than the green of the eagle pants in wearing while being significantly worse than bloodvine which the winner had. Just tons of examples like this, people who roll for an epic part when they have a blue equipped that is actually better etc.
---
&gt;poopsocking
---
I haven't heard this term before.  Thank you.
---
Exactly what imma play in classic!
---
Get out of here with your complaints about PvP
---
It’s not called normal you filthy casual. It’s called PvE server. 
---
If you don’t like PvP then roll PvE but don’t talk shit about PvP. You don’t like it you’re entitled to your opinion but trying to change it so pussies like you can dabble is just weak
---
Who the fuck is Angwe
---
How is this controversial? Assuming the scenario you're describing is that you're an over geared tank offering fast clears, you are providing a service to players that's no different from providing items or services via a profession.
---
I've done exactly this in several other MMOs, so it's nothing new. Some people will be willing to pay for it, and some wont.
---
Heck, you can even do this as a healer or even dps if you have that much gear. 
---
I probably wouldn't go around charging lowbies, since they likely don't have enough gold to make it worthwhile anyway, but max level players will always be doing a cost vs time analysis based on how they play and what they need. And definitely not when you are still gearing up yourself.
---
Anyone talking about the 'ethics' of something like this are taking it way too seriously. It's just another way of making virtual money in a video game
---
They also didn’t merge because it forced you to buy a transfer if you wanted to change, easy money
---
Yeah I pretty much never do RFC. The drops are one thing but on the other it's so early of a dungeon that people don't have all their skills to run a dungeon yet.
---
You're a pedantic asshole. Good luck with that. 
---
They've already merged servers on Live (called connected realms), but they don't merge names. I'm technically on the same server as 2 other former realms, but we all keep our name + our server name tagged at the end when people from another realm see us. Same with guild names. So I'm Balanor, but people on one of the realms I connected with will see me as Balanor-Maelstrom. If I see someone on one of the connected realms with my same name, I'll see them as Balanor-[Other Server Name]. Neither of us had to change our names. 
---
I forgot about this one! So good 🤣
---
Farming garn nighthowl back in WoD, after many attempts finally roll a 96, oh boy daddy's got a new mou....  Who tf rolled 98... FML. grats on mount dude.  *press all f4*
---
Thats a great goal. They are nice to gather too.
---
I get what you're saying, but technically that's not how the free market works. Its basic supply and demand. If you have something that is scarce (Tanking) its objectively worth more than something that is not scarce (DPS) so its not out of the question to expect payment even if you need things from the dungeon. 
---
It's not pedantic to say that CoT and Kara aren't on Kalimdor lmfaooo
---
It has been a while since I encountered someone on here who was _actually_ this pants-on-head retarded.
---
Not from vek was it??
---
I see no issue with that. The demand is clearly much higher than the offer. 
---
Asking for benefits is normal, in such circumstances.
---
Mark and John confirmed that on a classicast  stream. Player housing would have been cool
---
WC has the jump.  
---
Not the person you are asking, but it sounds like you and I were in the same guild.
---
The set looks badass. It's important that you take this into consideration.
---
Dude who played an Orc Rogue on Dethecus who sat in Menethil Harbor for months on end ganking everyone who got on or off the boat.
---
I just res behind a tree and spam /lol as I HS away if I get camped. Even on private servers were people gank lowbies 10x as much as people did in vanilla I've never had too much of an issue with it.
---
It is obviously beneficial, but to a very marginal extent and as people gear up it becomes less and less meaningful. 
---
The static ~90AP bonus which makes the difference between improved and usual WF applies to the extra white hit only, and if you add up the scaling (14AP=1DPS) with 20% proc it would provide roughly 10-12 DPS boost for every person in a group, and that's kind of underwhelming.
---
*Cool weapon has spirit
---
The one weird thing for me was that I've always loathed grinding, in vanilla, in TBC, in wotlk I hated to grind mobs. On a private server now and for some reason I honestly don't mind at all. I just alt tab while drinking, have some music on and take it slowly.
---
Yep. The original Kara map that’s in the data files for versions of vanilla prior to 1.8 or so has a similar general layout and shape to that of TBC Kara, but it was an entirely different map (no shared lineage).
---
I've gotten quite a bit of negative whisper replies in games when asking. My message isn't offensive, just informs them I'd be willing to do it for a price. Standard stuff.
---
May I ask though, I'm curious if you believe reserving items in raids is controversial?
---
The guy to the right should just have "Fuck you, give me your money monkey" instead of everything he said.
---
I like to squeeze as much XP as I can out of Elwynn without grinding before moving on. It helps smooth over minor questing dry spots later on.
---
Yeah they wear you down. Also they tend to boom when you're oom
---
I think you may have problem at later stages of levelling due to sheer amount of neutral quest hubs in those areas. The theme I noticed in Vanilla and to lesser extent TBC and WotLK is that the higher you go, the fewer faction hubs you have.
---
Granted, I did not explore everything back in the day, so chances are there are many small, hidden questlines that are faction-specific, but overall, you will be doing many of the same quests if you level more than one character.
---
After all, think about it. Most of neutral factions were for high level. Cenarion Circle, Argent Dawn, Thorium Brotherhood, Timbermaw, Everlook, Gadgetzan and that doesn´t even include places without faction (like Un´Goro), but still with neutral flightpoints.
---
Yeah if rogues aren't pvp specced or unwilling to pop preparation then rogues are pretty damn easy as a mage unless they outgear you massively.
---
Yes. Rogues and warriors should focus on killing casters. Using spell interrupts, it's not uncommon to kill a caster without taking any damage. They also have less armor.
---
Most classes there is no spec that works for riading and pvp. I agree respec cost reduction or dual spec option would be great. It wouldnt hurt the economy really that much if at all. Also its 100g because after ur done pvping and need to respec for ur raid nights u pay again so if u want to pvp ur looking at probably 4 hours of farming for most players. Thats a lot of time to just spend grinding and being bored just so u can play both pvp and raid.  I dont see how thats good design. I love vanilla but it has its problems just the same.
---
I was Alliance all throughout Vanilla. So I knew very little about the story of the Wailing Caverns. I only visited it maybe once. Since this time around  I will roll Horde, I can't wait to  go there once again..
---
I remember getting lost in that place so many times. We always followed someone who knew where they were going and to this day I still don't know how it's done. I'm just glad I figured out old Sunken Temple.
---
Not only is this "everything must be equally viable" mindset thankfully absent in Classic, but Tauren would have the easiest time of any race building a lowbie dungeon group. They have have access to 2/2 tanking and 2/3 healing classes of their faction. Even orcs and trolls combined have just 1 tank and 2 healer classes.
---
Not that even that level of optimization is required. Even something silly like shaman tank can work until almost level 30. Literally nothing matters at the level of these lowbie dungeons (&lt;15). As long as you have one healer, the rest honestly doesn't matter.
---
I think you must be mis-remembering as Humar was a level 23 so you couldn't tame it at 19.
---
Joined the discord &gt; Chaise. Let's have words
---
That sounds like some pretty standard gambler's fallacy stuff
---
Uhh warlocks use wands, heavily.
---
You say its essential game time decision. But people farm gold to respec all the time. If ur just pvp or just raid then yes i agree but many players do both and spending 100g a week just on that on top of consumables which can easily be another 100g maybe more depending on progression ur looking at 4-8 hrs farming just for respecs and consumables and thrn u still need to farm for enchants, mounts, gear, etc on top of that. So basically your saying its good game design to force an extra 4ish hrs on average per week for somone who wants to enjoy both aspects of the game on top of the amount they already have to farm. Try doing all that on top of buying ur NR set for aq soaking for example and tell me its a blast not being able to pvp cuz u cant spare the 100g by next raid
---
If only you could spec into both healing and improved totems at the same time...
---
Maybe not while leveling in Dun Morogh or Winterspring I take it, haha.
---
Also pet battle dailies were major contributions to the exp, not gathering.
---
But better than enh? Ease of finding gear is a factor too.  Enh with a nice weapon in mostly greens/ some blues is dangerous all the way to 60.
---
If only
---
I lost Armageddon countless times to this
---
Explain how its part of the balance? To me it just means if i am not a class that can pvp wel and raid well in 1 spec i must farm a few hrs for 100g to change pvp then raid again. Forcing me to farm a2-4 hours versus not doesnt make the game more balanced lol. Also i would say vanilla is one of the least balanced versions of WoW
---
If you take the minimal time to gather all the quests it is a great chunk of XP!  Easy to do the quests as well, most of them are just traveling to the various places to get it, and the only one that's a chain is picked up from Thrall and you have to run to the zep location roughly in Durotar.  minimal investment to get 5 dungeon quests worth of XP.
---
Yeah the various (x) of Orgrimmar are green quality and maybe level 15 or so.  For many people it's an upgrade, but it's nothing like the crescent staff or wingblade that you get from the WC quest reward.  WC also has a few rare weapons that drop (1h mace and shield at least, maybe caster 1h too?) from various bosses so you are guaranteed to get a level ~20 blue if you have the quest.  Big difference in power.  Wingblade is almost 2x as much DPS as the 1h rewards from RFC. 
---
Who are you talking to?
---
&gt; Minus the pserver part
---
The spirit is weak. Just like my Spriest back in the day.
---
This is why I'm playing hunter. Need everything man for my off-spec 
---
This is fantastic! Great job, man :)
---
Thank you. It really did feel like it. Gaming home.
---
Enh sham actually can get good of value from agil because crit boosts flurry uptime.  But you'd have to actually HAVE flurry so at least level 30+ for that to apply.  It's borderline but definitely not a useless stat.  Also raises AP and armor/dodge. 
---
I think it was the lack of interaction and challenge at lower levels that put me off the most. Felt more online RPG than MMO.
---
I guess that’s sort of the point I was trying to make. Angwe never broke the ToS, but with wow’s current reporting system if he’s reported by a handfull of players he automatically gets a brief account “ban” without a GM reviewing the case.
---
i have zero problem with it either. i often pay certain tanks to tank a dungeon when i need a specific item. its much faster to just pay a trusted guy (and then compensate that gold while farm) than wiping with random pug over and over.
---
I can agree with this statement 100%! I remember the fortress in Desolace on a friends rogue I was playing on. I didn't have any quests for it, but when I saw that place I whispered another friend. "This place looks so awesome! I'm going in there even if I die!" .. being a rogue I didn't die- but it was still an amazing feeling. \\o/
---
&gt; Plus, this whole discussion is missing the fact that in a Tauren focused dungeon, there'd be around 5 players with innate CC: War Stomp. If there were any CC requirements for a Tauren dungeon, it'd be designed around five players and their war stomp cooldowns.
---
There wouldn't be any CC requirements in any lowbie dungeon. Know how I know? Because there are no CC requirements in RFC, despite being a level 13-15 dungeon and players having CC abilities, because that wasn't Classic's design philosophy. 
---
Encounters were not designed around the tools the players had, because encounters had not reached even that level of complexity yet. You can count on one hand the number of Classic encounters at launch that require more awareness than "don't stand here when it explodes"
---
I hit 60 as a druid tank just a few weeks ago. CC was never "required", not once, not even tanking the officer groups in the low 50s.
---
Definitely will!!
---
Tol Barad actually made it into the game, it was Cataclysm's version of Wintergrasp, you fought for possession of the prison in which there were bosses.
---
My first reaction was, holy shit this is way more grindy than I remembered.
---
But then a lot of the fun happens while grinding. Meeting people, discovering places, general chat, etc.
---
I'd rather have a community grinding together, than everyone blowing past each other.
---
&gt; Its like they took the soul out of the game.
---
Yup, great way of putting it.
---
In Darkshore, right? I vaguely remember clicking a bunch of ornaments in Darkshore on an alt.
---
The problem isn't ghost servers, it's ghost factions. It doesn't matter if there are 10.000 active players on alliance side when you are one of the 300 active horde players. It's even worse than playing on a completely empty server. And when Blizz merged something, they always merged similar servers. So you ended up with 600 horde / 20k alliance which was even worse than before.
---
I mean, it's hard to balance. I assume as always PvE servers will be Alliance dominated with PvP servers going horde. 
---
I leveled as a Holy Priest in Legion using mostly smite, would not recommend. lol
---
It's like people forget we have a WAR going on 
---
Literally nothing this is a 5/7 plan
---
I'm not taking a side here, but I actually think it will be really interesting to see how Blizz handles this stuff, gaming, gamers, and blizz have changed so much over the last 15 years, I wouldn't be at all surprised if they take a different stance now.
---
You could be a healer and just use grid. 
---
Th question baffles me, your asking for the most optimal class to play sub optimally (clicking)? By laptop do you also mean you're using a tracker pad? 
---
&gt;Nothing stings quite as bad as the tank needing on the bow/gun
---
Considering hunters and melee never want the same ranged weapons, not really an issue.
---
Why? 
---
If it's an upgrade it's an upgrade. You dont get to dictate that item X is a bigger upgrade for the warrior than the pala in the pug when both came there as DPS.
---
Absolutely. Still have it as one of my main pets on my hunter too!
---
Dual wield is fun but your %miss chance is so high, and the offhand weapon is weak.  Numbers wise 2h is superior, but dw can be fun.  Especially vs casters you get all that sweet pushback.  
---
If I make it to 40+ on my warrior (currently 21) I will stay Arms to have the PVP utility and sweeping strikes/cleave. 
---
You where almost there, actualy retail wow already has the solution. Just use zones. The server has no treshold but zones wil. Everytime a zone, lets say Stormwind1, reach 1k players Stormwind2 will open. Players in Sw1 cant see players in Sw2 but they can chat with them and invite them (which will spawn them in the same zone) Eventually when the server pop starts to die the zoning tech will be abundant.
---
No merging needed. No 3 scarab lords....
---
The tech is there already. They do it between servers now they just have to change it per server population.
---
That just makes it all the more satisfying when you grind your way to some cool looking gear. Like an actual accomplishment!!!
---
I remember it being a thing on my vanilla servers that everyone automatically passes on all loot and we'd talk out who should get it/all manually roll if no one needed it. Like, even in low-level dungeons. There was just an understanding that this was how you did it: everyone pass. If anyone needed/greeded when the window popped up it was seen as basically ninjaing because we didn't talk it out as a group first. Because, like, often when two people needed the same item, it was clear one of them really needed it more than the other, and usually the person who didn't need it as much would just be like "You go ahead man, grats" and it was cool.
---
Not sure when the culture changed on that, but it was definitely dead by WotLK. Fuck LFD.
---
This hurt me in a very personal level
---
I still have broken tooth on my og hunter alt
---
Which could be less time spent camping than they'd spend in the first place lol
---
Then play on a pve server?
---
I mean at 60
---
Which is what I plan on doing.
---
I'm assuming the people who dont want Blizz to have them have gotten too used to Private Servers, which are usually PvP servers.
---
Shaman actually didn’t get AP from agility in vanilla. Just strength.
---
Its a cop out so they could skimp on real content. 
---
Ah thanks I will edit my reply.  I thought it gave 1 AP/point and strength gave 2 ap/point
---
just depends on your personality really. I always loved questing 
---
Looking at your post history, you deserve the ban.
---
Shadowclaw 
---
Brutal hard to tame due to being right in your face. Use the noob bop items you get on either side (Horde is the sticky glue stuff) to quickly lock it in place and start taming.
---
The cat is for those hunters no too worried about what type of pet they use. It's just a 2.0 attack spd cat (generic stats) but sure looks cool.
---
Nah man that's perfectly fine, you're giving them a service. I myself will be selling food/water/portals &amp; UBRS key service, when I'm in major cities. Time = money.
---
Yeah these are just sad idiots that wants attention. No idea why anyone finds doing shit like this funny. I can kill a lowbies for revenge or some shit a few times but the way they camp Redridge us just autism levels of griefing, don't understand how they can find it enjoyable.
---
Steampunk tech is a defining part of Warcraft since Warcraft 2. Gnomes, Goblins, and Dwarves all use steam punk tech. 
---
Spaceships aren't steam punk so I wasn't commenting on that aspect of TBC, though the alien aspect had been around for much longer than TBC (the eredar were retconned to have been corrupted by Sargeras instead of the other way around, they weren't retconned into existence in the first place though). 
---
It was actually called normal though.
---
Honestly its been about 10 years so I couldn't tell you his name.  The realm was muradin I think?  Or thug'thol?  
---
I guess not being an edge lord makes me a mod of /r/wow. Head back to T_D, bud. You're not gonna find many friends here. 
---
Couldn't tell you to be honest.  I just remember that was the justification.  Its been about 10 years so I'm a bit fuzzy.  I also remember after the ret paladin rework, (pre wrath launch) ret paladins were doing more dps than anyone for about 6 weeks.  Which was fun too.
---
I was betting one time just for fun with the higher roll wins and i had lost 3 in a row. I was boud to win so i be 100k i had like 150k  rolled a 97 to be beat by a 99 i never been so mad 
---
3 things:
---
1, ARPGs are not (typically) esports either, hence the RPG part.
---
2, this is an optional path for players and nothing effects the primary server which contains everyone's "legacy" or "forever" characters.
---
3, Going the expansion route is fine (you mentioned a TBC "server") but that opens  pandora's box on how to make that work without splitting your (already pretty small) playerbase, and also re-introduces power creep, which is literally the reason we're here saying retail wow sucks and we want classic.
---
Yes! This is the best reason to tame it. I got more whispers about this pet more than any other pet I’ve ever owned. Such a cool unique cat.
---
I really loved Warhammer. The pvp was so amazing in that game. Played it for a few months as an Inquisitor, loved every moment of that. Too bad all my friends eventually abandoned it &amp; went back to WoW, so I felt alone and gave up on it aswell. Just to hear that a few years later the game got shut down as I was wanting to play it again.
---
Shame really, the Warhammer universe is so rich in lore &amp; story, one of my favourite fantasy/sci-fi universes ever.
---
Warlocks have life tap and drain life. They shouldn't have to wand at all.
---
The amount of pirate hats and that burning gloria thing from BRD is just astounding. 
---
doing the same thing. Haven't touched wow since Cata. 
---
It's so fun, i'm having a blast 
---
Blizzard has talked about the Fresh/Dead cycle and it will certainly be a built in part of the server rotations just like it was required on private servers.
---
Obviously there is the future TBC progression option but Classic servers will persist. Blizzard potentially has a HELL of a lot more resources to adjust this Fresh/Dead rotation due to building the game on a newer engine that they have full development tools for.
---
Let me repeat that: Blizzard has FULL development tools for Classic. This is a very big point.
---
What will Blizzard do once Classic has been released for it's first server wave livecycle? Not sure atm obviously, but they will have all the metrics available to direct them to decisions that help prolong the Classic server cycles so you can bloody expect tweaks and changes in the long run once they are polling their own core audience and not inherited ones from generations outside of the original Wow experience playing entirely different games and those with, let's say, "adjusted" private server opinions.

Lol I miss those days.  Having someone log onto another account to shit talk lol you won’t be the only one doing this!
---
Ya pretty much it if done is a modern engine and graphics. 
---
Now I wouldn't actually want Classic looking that way. Development would be forever and hinged on modern payment methods.

Melee specs can go into resto for the totem mana / efficiency boosters as well as +hit. Something like this in a quick and dirty sense- PVE focused enhancement/resto:

This is backwards when you start pvp'ing :)

Personally I dont see a problem with PvP on a PvP server.

I never won a "lets roll for it". NEVER
---
There use to be a trick on private vanilla servers where you could kill the parent Savannah Lion around where Human is and tame the cub and would get a 1.0 cat pet for a hunter.
---
This was changed to a 1.2 cat. Still, may be a way to get a ghetto Rake that looks like Broken Tooth if this holds true in Classic. Guessing it won't.
---
Humar still looks way cooler. Even Rake looks better than basic Savannah skin.
---
Most (read all) Resto shams will dip Ele/Resto instead since the gear has so much overlap. 
---
In TBC I (Warrior main) rocked the epic Agi gun from Big Bad Wolf. My ranged wep was blue and I was the only one in the group who got to roll...because our only raiding Hunter was on his Rogue alt and mains got priority. We were buddies but I still received (and enjoyed) the endless salt. Besides, he never got to raid progression on his Rogue anyway. :)
---
As a holy pala, man do I despise that dress
---
That would result in pserver bis lists that have progressive itemization over 12 patches rather than 1.12 items released in the 4 stages.
---
I guess I'll speak my mind on this. Yes, I am concerned with the report system. Back during early Blizzard and WoW you could say some negative or hurtful things and the one thing that was always suggested as the solution is to ignore them. Reporting someone was done through a ticket and only in extreme cases.
---
Now, as I've experienced in Overwatch and HotS, Blizzard's policy has changed to "play nice and play fair". Say something negative: reported. Be obstructive: reported. Don't do as others like: reported. Enough of these will automatically flag your account for review at first, and after additional punishments you'll receive automatic bans after enough reports. This is done without a review which you can only be appealed after the fact through customer service.
---
What this means for Classic and the community interaction it requires: I am not yet sure. My opinion however is that their new policy is trash. A world is about emotions and finding fun or doing things your own way. Not the way Blizzard wants you to be: a hug-me teddybear who's brown-nosing everyone they meet.
---
Yep, that's the way of PUGs. If a drop is so important that it's gonna be an issue, you gotta work that out before you even start or else just accept the dice's verdict.
---
Why is everyone in this thread so toxic? This is higher effort than 90% of what we get on this sub most days.
---
They should, but they won't
---
Welcome to current day Blizz
---
I liked it, it put herbalism and mining on a more even playing field with skinning in terms of exp. I would categorize it as 'it's a good change for its time'.
---
Have you heard of a mouse? They're like 5 dollars...
---
I didn't really get to raid vanilla before TBC dropped, why was this the case? Just curious, in TBC there def were occasional conflicts there.
---
Interesting that "Furbolg Totem" is listed as a dungeon too. The first time I went in there, I thought I WAS in a dungeon!
---
**&lt;The Crimson Knights&gt;**

**NA \[PVP\]**  **|  Currently Alliance \[Sargeras\]** ***Re-rolling Horde for classic*** 
---
**Guild Information:**  We’re a relatively small guild on Sargeras focused on growing, made up of me and some friends who currently play the game casual. Most of us are unsatisfied with the way wow went but we still love playing it. I am looking to build and grow a strong community with this guild and, I am hoping to find some like minded people who want to turn a small guild into one that is capable of doing some end game content, and prepare for classic.  
---
We want to re-create that community feeling of vanilla, we understand people are older now, and a lot of us have lives outside of the game. That being said we hope to gather enough people and push leveling, assist where we can (about half of us started in vanilla or early BC) and push end game content. We're not going for world or server first we're simply happy that we are getting a version of the game back where you need others to play. 
---
 **Our Mission:** ***To Focus on Community First!*** We want to create the old guild feeling of a “family” away from family. We are casual currently but with classic and lots of time off over the summer from classes/work we will be playing a lot more  then we currently play of BFA. A group of people that first and foremost enjoy playing the game together. All of the raiding team politics and such comes second. 
---
**What We’re Looking For:** We’re looking for patient people who are willing to help us build a guild up. People who are more excited for the hardcore experience of classic and who remember what community in this game meant. People who agree with the statements above and actually want to work to make it happen.
---
**How to Reach Us:**  If this is something that seems appealing to you, you can reach out to me either on blizzard \[HotKarlPRFC#1782\] or discord \[hotkarlprfc#5722\]  with questions or simply join the guilds discord.  I hope to hear from you!!!!
---
**Discord:** [**https://discord.gg/vCmssqQ**](https://discord.gg/vCmssqQ)
---
Mergers are fine.  Calm down.
---
performing the roll of a literal "mercenary" in a medieval fantasy game is perfectly fine. if they want a tank badly enough, theyll give in to your demands. 
---
I'm 50/50 on this. Yes, it's a PvP server, but this person is wasting other people's time because of the sadistic glee he gets from irritating them. This isn't really PvP as much as it is bullying. It's just so damn pointless.
---
DME jump runs are done with a fury warrior not a prot warrior
---
Can’t you plug a mouse into your laptop?
---
The bow had increased damage and attack speed to make up for no ammo/quiver. Then it simply didn't use ammo. It was the best Hunter now, not sure what his guild was thinking 
---
I think he’s talking about the dancing rp stuff
---
Haha glad you like it! 
---
I agree. Editing actually takes a bit of skill and time no doubt.
---
Warlocks have plenty to clutter their UIs with. Four basic demons, two cooldown ones, all the curses, healthstones/soulstones/summoning, misc. support spells like Unending Breath &amp; Demon Tracking, etc. Always played mine with every optional action bar enabled. Necrosis helped a ton for the demon &amp; stones, but without addons you'll fill up the default action bars pretty quick.
---
Lol
---
Everyone should be allowed to have fun in their own way 
---
That’s kind of what I’m thinking about, but I wouldn’t be able to grind for gold very easily.
---
I honestly don’t think it’s possible. However next expansion may be coming to mobile 😂 
---
&gt;Also the gun issue, never happens. Warriors and Hunters do not share ranged weapons in Vanilla.
---
? Warriors can use guns...
---
Do people downrank arcane shot? I know people downrank concussive and wing clip with macros, but arcane shot drops off so much I feel like it wouldn't be worth it.
---
But yeah I would agree hunters have by far the least space. MAYBE warlocks beat them out, with SS and HS each taking 2 (one to make, one to use), each pet, multiple curses, summoning, etc. but they're still probably a ways off. I don't think anyone else comes close, but I haven't played shamans much. I could see them having a bit with all their totems.
---
So...no rules or terms of service at all? Just allow whatever hacking, botting or exploiting people want?
---
This is why I really hope they don't do sharding or cross server stuff. On BCs launch I leveled a blood elf pally and kept running into the same dwarf pally as I leveled. We must have had 50 I kills each on each other by the time we hit 70. 
---
I edited my post.
---
I know, it would probably take the biggest brain in the world to check if the dungeon where one of the 3 or 4 available options from the list is already released, but please... At least try to.
---
well, some people will still roll on it, that's the issue m8.    Fwiw, stats are stats.  I've seen a frigging tank roll on a neck with int and spirit and try to tell the (pissed off) healer that the spirit was useful for him.    
---
Some people are just dicks.   
---
Well with the old “code” server population used to average 2-3k , that’s why you saw all those people together at once.
---
Yes, but I edited my post because I realized I have a good mouse to use, but I’d still prefer clicking on a laptop.
---
Oh man, as soon as it went f2p it was over. 
---
This is why I hope the Classic server limit will be similar to how it was. A-holes like this guy become well known and places in well run guilds restrict their entrance appropriately.
---
Wands are mana free dps, and do a lot more damage than drain life. A warlock rolling on a wand is totally justified. You should be wanding as a warlock.
---
I was so bad at making cash that my guild eventually bought me my mount, I was a hunter so I just ran everywhere and was fine with it. But they got fed up with it when I was 60 and still just running. 
---
Draenei are to WoW what aliens are to Indiana Jones.
---
I personally am most fond of the Outland/TBC one
---
When the fun is at the expense of someone else, it's more complicated. 
---
He wasn’t doing any of the sort though. Just camping and killing. Newbs should get better if they don’t wish to fall by his daggers. 
---
Especially for Warlocks that half of your stuff is summoning an item that you then use.  So for healthstones you have 2 bindings (more if you stack them).
---
There are still the question if 1.10 items that were added to loottables of excisting bosses will be in at stage 1. And got to account for bosses that got added later on like the T0.5 related onces or Naxx Invasion etc.
---
But sure all that doesn't matter... keep being a smartass instead of helpfull.
---
Wait where dafuq is that 
---
There is no rank of Concussive shot.  Arcane shot downrank is used for kiting, so you only spend a few mana to keep the mob tagged (most important part).
---
The line is at cheating, if they want to stop him then they should have made the area around boats a safe zone.
---
Because it requires a subscription. 
---
Not even playing a Druid but good on you sir for this excellent response.
---
I'm set on rogue and leaning towards dwarf due to stoneform (will mainly do pvp with some raiding). But a friend of mine who played nelf rogue in vanilla has been raving about the extra agility, dodge and improved stealth. Can anyone weigh in with their opinions on this matchup please?
---
Its a little questionable if you're not carrying. Ive seen people do the "tank for hire" bit in absolute crap gear with no more skill than you could reasonably expect from a pug.
---
&gt; Also the gun issue, never happens. Warriors and Hunters do not share ranged weapons in Vanilla.     
---
    
---
That's wrong.     
---
     
---
If you're a hunter you might find a rogues and warriors rolling on a drop that makes a huge difference in your viability, while simply being a stat stick for them.   Sure they _can_ roll on it, but it's not cool.      
---
I mean, so does Netflix. 
---
Sure. I don't think what he did was necessarily against the rules or should be punished. I just think its asinine. It's like spitting on the sidewalk or screaming obscenities at children playing on the playground. I don't think you should be arrested for it, I just think you're an asshole. 
---
My previous comment (the one you're actually reply to) was directly about "everyone should be allowed to have fun in their own way" which is too blanket a statement. 
---
It will happen a lot more on actual Classic, with retailers not knowing Classic itemization.
---
They either just wanted to disenchant it or actually thought it was gonna be an upgrade. 
---
I’m on board with this idea, but I would break these servers into subservers, like instead of just having Illidan, you have Illidan 1,2,3,4,etc. If the population of some of these subservers begin to die, you can merge them together. If the population remains high after the initial launch phase with masses amounts of people quitting, just rename the server something else like Dalaran. 
---
Rogue might have the most open space.  Of the three classes I played to 60 it definitely did.  Probably since every rogue spec does roughly the same thing, not like a class that has stuff for healing/tanking along with damage spells.  And they have relatively few class Flavor Spells, it's just lockpicking, pickpocketing and poisons IIRC
---
What I meant is that your mana pool is essentially equal to a mage/priest mana and health pool combined, so you would need to wand much less. Warlocks are also the only one of the three without wand specialization, so wands only do 80% the damage they do for priests and mages. Additionally, your demons do damage while you wand, so the even when wanding, the wand makes up a smaller portion of your dps. Pretty much a hundred reasons wands are more important for priests and mages. Of course you need a wand, but it's far less important to warlocks than to priests and mages. Mages and priests are totally justified getting irked and rolling their eyes if they lose a wand roll to a lock, just like locks are justified being angry if they lose a staff roll to a hunter.
---
There shouldn’t be payed character transfers at all. There should be free character transfers for players who are active on a dead server, and they have the option of leaving that server and joining a new one.
---
Yeah I meant that you would primarily be enh spec and doing melee damage in raids, not resto (or even 30/0/21) and healing. 
---
Hunters aren't that bad. Their entire melee rotation, many pet commands and ranged auto attack can all be put on as few as one macro. They UI complexity increases depending on how many custom macros they make for situations. An experienced hunter will only have close to half the UI slots used as a noob hunter. Other slots can be filled with Eng, Pots or custom macro variants for specific reasons.
---
Druids: Shapeshifting can be put down to 3 buttons: Travel which combines cheetah and water into 1. Cat which also includes Prowl, Track Humanoid and power shifting on 1 button. Bear which includes charge and stun on one button. Due to having form bars unique to cat and bear, this also limits total slots. All in all, it lowers to about an average total UI slots devoted to skills but the skill of the class comes with instantly flowing between forms and skills which makes the class an advanced one to play.
---
Shamans: LOTS of totems and nearly nothing that can be put into custom macros. You will have a shit ton of slots and God help you if you also slot Eng and Potions. Least maco heavy, but one of the most UI slot heavy classes for sure.
---
Paladin: LOL. You can put your ENTIRE combat rotation on a one button macro! You'll level to 60 with half your slots not even used.
---
Warlock. You can put your ENTIRE leveling affliction rotation on 1 button. ALL dots on one button macro. The UI bloat will later catch up however due to proper Pet usage and lots of Warlock utility.
---
I raided Fury and the ArP 2H sword dropped from Iron Council. I was late resubbing after TBC and still playing gear catchup. Our DPS DK cheerfully decided to blow his DKP to take it (I was the only other candidate for it) and respec to Blood so he could get value from ArP. It was zero sum DKP too, so winning it put him all the way back to zero. I was so mad at that smug shit. 
---
Flash forward and Blood DPS is removed from the game, while I didn't get a better wep till the ICC 5mans. I was even saltier than when a part-time raiding Retadin snagged the 2H axe from KTZ on my first raid back from hiatus. He used it to get the 2.2k arena rating weapon inside of 2 weeks and quit raiding. Our GL even shit talked him to me specifically over that...but no one (myself included) was in favor of loot council so those were the breaks. 
---
In hindsight it makes me imagine some kind of mercy rule, like based on ilvl disparity maybe. Like if it's X more ilvl for Frank and Y for Bob, and X-Y is greater than Z, Bob can't roll/bid against Frank. It always sucks when Raider A can just out-spend for a minor upgrade that would be massive for Raider B. There will never be a perfect system though, outside of the whole group just magically always prioritizing the collective over themselves. 
---
I wish people would still be like that.
---
With loot trading you can have your buddies roll for the item too, then they can trade you it. Or you can be rolling against 1 warrior and 3 of his buddies. Loottrading really diminishes ninja looting and is good for vanilla /s
---
You're an idiot. He didn't propose any changes, is already rolling pve. And those servers ARE called "normal"
---
I'd recommend holy paladin in that case. Even in your raid healing spec you can do DM:E lasher farming.
---
Forgive my ignorance but what do the letters in parentheses mean next to the dungeon names? 
---
Absolutely ethical
---
Oh I misread your shit. Yeah I definitely prefer the Enh/Resto route over Enh/Ele.
---
I'd argue that PvP in Vanilla wasn't carefully planned and it's not like all aspect were sound decisions of devs to make the game a better place.
---
Now you're totally allowed to disagree with me but the fact that a max level player was able to gank low level player and make them lose quite a lot of time and avoid almost any kind of retaliation is simple bad game design.
---
Personally that's why I will go in PvE servers despite having played on PvP servers during all Vanilla (and having most of the time a great time)
---
I never saw wrath ring before in retail. However I’ve played private servers for years on vanilla and there was this ONE time I came across a ring of frozen wrath on the AH. it blew my mind 
---
Fun fact: It's longer than Tuesday. I saw him 4 weeks ago at Sun Rock
---
I still think back in amazement at how perfect that server was during Vanilla. 
---
Signed,
---
Eluzin/Nizule, early member of Aurora and friend of Moreland, Toku, Durhoward, Krundle, Qiez, Everzhuzad, and more
---
Agreed. I loved it that way. Dungeons/loot seem so impersonal and "me first" now.
---
I really wonder how the culture will be on Classic since there will probably be a lot of people bringing their shitty Retail habits over. Community and making friends and seeing your fellow players as actual people was such a big part of the vanilla experience. But that was a long time ago. Gamer culture is so damn toxic now I only play single-player anymore. I don't know if it's possible for us all to go back to caring about other people, but I really hope we can pull together and make something beautiful again.
---
&gt; the placement of Dire Maul (wtf was that going to be?)
---
I mean, sort of not really. It COULD HAVE been that DM was going to be ruins of the modern High/Blood elves, but then they moved it to Kalimdor and made the lore reflect the elves as they were before the Sundering. 
---
It's weird, it's not just that they don't think it's funny, it's like I've offended them for creating something they don't like
---
Just by seeing the comments in this thread you can see a lot of people who think allowing such unfair scenarios is a positive thing, it forces you to adapt or do something else.  
---
Other players being able to affect your gameplay experience is a part of what being on a PVP server is about and is a part of what Horde vs Alliance is all about.
---
Sounds like you both want sharding, and you want massive population caps that aren't at all like vanilla.
---
Not going to be a popular opinion around here.
---
That's what I've been doing, but every time I edit it people get more pissed that I'm posting it again, even though it's totally different :/
---
Interesting topic. 
---
In my view shamans have a ton of buttons to push. All those spells amd totems and, as with all healers, lots of downranked heals.
---
Also binding rank 1 of all shocks is imortant for PvP. Maybe rank 1 lightning bolt and chain lightning as well.
---
Talents also effect the number of keybinds in differsnt ways me thinks
---
There is definitely enjoyment - it's just not yours. You are not obligated to play on a PvP server.
---
Same safe-space sjw crap we have in the rest of the world. People interact in games as well, and people act as people do in Azeroth as well. Some will always get offended. They should learn to deal with it, instead off getting power by the Gods to smite those who oppose him.
---
Upon some reading after I commented, I saw a couple of people elsewhere guess that Dire Maul was originally planned to be in the ruins of Alterac area, and the whole Eldre'Thalas lore was likely pulled out of their ass after the DM location was moved for unknown reasons.
---
As others mentioned, it is highly dependent on class.
---
Pure melee have to put up with misses, parry, evade and glances and the like. This destroys their dps against anything close to even level or higher. Dual wield sort of helps for more constant dps vs a slow 2h but the issue still exists prior to +hit gear. Efficient mob grinding for them is on mobs that just turned green.
---
Feral: They always have capped weapon skill, attack very fast and can hybrid magic damage in. This allows feral to grind even or -1 level mobs much more efficiently.
---
Pure casters: Resists will hurt early on. They should avoid anything above even level for efficient grinding.
---
Hunters: LAWL. They hit up to +5 mobs as easily as melee hit even level mobs. Kill everything ... don't really care about it.
---
The spells I train to 60 is shorter than the ones I don't train tbh.
---
&gt;, but we all keep our name + our server name tagged at the end when people from another realm see us.
---
I really like this option, because I'd HATE to lose a name if forced into a merge, but someone made a suggestion on here a while back to keep things "RP" like that I loved, instead of Name - Server, the dash is replaced with "of" so it reads Name of Server. 
---
While a small change, I think that something like that would be cool for RPers and just a nice little piece of immersion for the rest of us. 
---
Still, a wand is a huge part of my dps as a lock while leveling, I literally use it on every single mob. When my wand starts to get underpowered, killing mobs becomes very tedious. Im not gimping myself because a priest or mage thinks they need it more than I do, They don't.
---
Yup there will always be players who see it as a negative, likely because they see it as being charged by a player to just play the game, and fail to see it as paying for your time investment, gear and skill level. 
---
When I would find dps/healers that could keep up with me while gearing, I would often tip them a good chunk of gold, which always helped in showing you appreciated them more than just a 'thanks!' or 'ur good!', which would later translate into having a rolodex of people I could call in for runs (paid or not)
---
I'm not sure in what context you're asking for regarding raid gear. In a PUG? Guild? Being tank for hire? For gear you need to tank or offspec? Etc etc
---
My point on why vanilla is better than retail. Retail would have come up with a silly system to rectify this behaviour.
---
Vanilla would have just trusted players to deal with it their own way.
---
On K3 right now there is a hunter in Silithus always griefing named Badrat.
---
Trust me when i say horde guilds always farm his ass when they encounter him, make a screenshot of them spitting on his corpse and post it To the discord's server.
---
Word is out he is a KOS horde side. Trust in people !
---
What do you get? And what class?
---
Stuff that won't be used, depends on class.
---
Rogues won't likely get Backstab ranks unless focusing on Dungeons ("Frontstabbing" isn't a thing on retail servers before someone mentions it). Same for Feint, Expose Armour, Rupture, Garrote (maybe, depends on DPCT/mob TTD)... Just things that won't do much whilst questing. 
---
July 16th, 2019 or May 28th, 2019 or June 18th, 2019. Those are my three guesses.
---
If that’s the case, this was already mentioned, but a healer would be great for raiding (not as fun farming though).  
---
My dude, summer 2019 was confirmed at Blizzcon.
---
I’d poop my pants if a May release happens.
---
**&lt;The Tail End&gt; \[A\] \[NA\] \[PvE\]**
---
Creating a new guild from scratch. Back in Vanilla I raided through AQ40 (and dipped my toes in Naxx), and looking forward to getting all the way through Naxx this time.
---
My schedule's a bit weird, and the best days for raiding for me are the last two before reset. Thus the name of the guild. I'm assuming I can find at least 40 other people in the Alliance world with overlapping schedules. :)
---
We're not super hardcore and won't be racing to 60. But not casuals either -- looking to start raiding about 3-4 months in and expect people to be decently geared. First guild goal is getting a core group of people to run those 60 dungeons (or battlegrounds) smoothly for that pre-raid gear in our last few weeks pre-raid.
---
Msg me if interested.
---
**Raid Times**: Sun/Mon 9-12 EST
---
Thank you :D
---
They said Summer 2019 so May would be extremely early. But always hopeful.
---
Like I said you can disagree and have fun on your PvP servers.
---
Personally I know I'll only be able to play casually and as much as I loved having skirmish in Stranglethorn and Blackrock, I don't want to be one-shotted and harassed by people who rushed lvl60 in 10 days and now spend their time killing low level people because they think that's a fantastic experience of PvP (that they will never experience of course since there won't be any max level player to kill them while they rush their max level)
---
Lmao the irony
---
Indeed. It's makes it even harder for shaman due to needing downranking slots for shocks, bolt and heals. UI becomes very full, very early for Shaman.
---
You should use the search bar before posting. Also it probably won't be Nov 19th because Blizzard has said Summer 2019. It's commonly thought that they will release it July 16th.
---
Yeah no worries =)
---
Enh/Ele isn't that bad, it has much better sustain since you can downrank shocks and then go max rank shock or CL when clearcast procs.   But much less group utility.  Totem mana and extended distance helps a lot with mobility, redropping totems, twisting/etc.  And you get a few bonus talents to help with off-heals whereas the elemental tree is useless for healing. 
---
I hope they're right, but I stand by my prediction. :)
---
I don't remember If its the same but I remember a quest to explore one of these mines and then report back. So I would always run in, get to the point where it Mark's as completed and die trying to run out, and keep dying until I made it out
---
That was me. I prefer to talk out rolls and figure out who should get what. But when I see another guy not rolling, I just know he's waiting to toss out that need roll at the last second, so I go ahead and roll need myself.
---
This. Plus stealth is a joke unless you talent it in Sub tree. Dagger spec is less consistent. Combat Swords master spec.
---
I think you have largely the wrong impression, almost all of the people that rush level 60 in 10 days will be then rushing instances and trying to gear up in time for raids/other content. There might be odd oddball but it's certainly not something that's even a thought to most people so I'm not sure why you have that concern.
---
But somebody in Goldshire needs those Candles!
---
I think he's on some kind of vendetta, cause his other pet is called SunrockBOSS, obviously taken after Redridgeboss.
---
I just honestly don't understand people like those two. They have to have some kind of mental deficiency, autism or whatever else.
---
I know I probably sound a little salty calling them mentally retarded, but I just can't see another explanation for wasting your  actual limited human life ganking low levels in a computer game for up to 10 hours a day over several weeks.
---
Sure would be fun. I've only tanked as shaman when greatly outleveling the dungeon but I've seen videos of dedicated dungeon tank Shamans.
---
I'd F'ing love to see a good Shaman dungeon tank but it has to be someone willing to get some damn good gear and then just use it as a fun alt. Shamans need to out gear their instance to tank.
---
&gt; This isn't really PvP as much as it is bullying. 
---
Not really. Its neither personal or specifically targeting someone. 
---
Bullying is a very inaccurate term for it tbh.
---
Also.. this is what makes PvP servers an option. The pitiful factionwar both on a small level and a big level such as BGs etc. 
---
If you roll on a PvP realm and go to Blizzard and want them to punish someone like Angwe.. the issue was you not picking an rp-pvp or pve realm, not Angwe playing PvP realm full out pvp. 
---
Or Disturbed/Drowning Pool
---
Alliance have quests in Stonetalon Mountains? 
---
Yup pretty much. Stealth is so slow too. You do more damage in the time frame that it'd take you to crawl to the mob in stealth and ambush/BS just by running to it. The only time I use BS is after a gouge (if I was interrupting a cast or using a bandage (gouge+bandage is so useful). 
---
In our guild we had two people have a roll off in sunwell, and they both rolled the exact same number twice in a row.
---
Mulgore is historically the lowest pop starter zone. It's also a very chill place and relaxing to level through.
---
I'd imagine it will be the least troublesome noob zone at launch. Orc is FULL. Human is FULL FULL. Dwarf is full but also has some very annoying quests requiring long respawn items. Dwarf and Human are my least favorite launch start zones ... by far.
---
Bring the player, not the class. Vanilla aint that hard.
---
Hey RockeSolid, thank you for the post! I am really glad you enjoyed the video, and thank you for the kind words.
---
In all honesty I wouldn't trust any opinions. A lot of specs were less viable until AQ40. At which point there was enough itemization that you could start to create some cool new stuff that wasn't viable in MC. But most guilds just weren't experimenting enough to make these discoveries, or were so deeply ingrained into their opinions that they refused to see anything else as viable. My guild was a top 5 US guild, and as a mage I wasn't even running tier gear (on purpose) but I was #2 for mage dps. I could never get my staff to drop to take the #1 spot. We also ran with a cat druid, something else I've seen other people say is impossible. The feral druid put out a ton of dps. 
---
So yea, take it all with a grain of salt. I imagine we'll have much better logs and strategies this time around.
---
Haha @ "nothing (silence)". Psychopaths. 
---
Agreed totally. That's me even caring enough to level... Been trying to find the motivation. It is just so boring and mundane. 
---
It just doesn’t make sense right now, maybe to you it does but it’s too confusing for anyone else. Might need a diff meme
---
Yeah if you have the right weapon and gear this is a total load.  Still have great heal capability plus ridiculous burst damage / tankiness.  
---
However you're unlikely to become a full monster unless you have a lot of t2 or t2.5  You can do it with full heal gear for example, but your reck bombs would be pathetic even if you have like Ashkandi or whatever.  By the same token if you gear for straight up white damage stuff (str/crit etc) then your heals will be kind of iffy.  But if you just spam FOL and use divine favor for holy light then you can be pretty mana efficient. 
---
They've already said the macros will be more on the modern side to help curb the ability of boots to automate everything.

Zul'Gurub was originally planned to be a 5 man dungeon, a bit like Zul'Farrak +10 levels or so.

It's never coming out. This has all been a fever dream. We've all been lied to. Lied to, I say! You're being taken for suckers, all of you! They only told you that to give the few remaining devs that care about you time to abandon ship without poor press. Once they've all been replaced by salesmen and an army of "I got an associates in game development to make vidya for a living" drones, they'll discard the facade and laugh in your faces.       
---
         
---
You'll see! You'll *ALL* see!
---
Ah yes, I remember reading about this. Someone released a guide describing how to travel through there. Stuff like he was less likely to chase you if you jump in the water, he’s active around these times, etc. Interesting stuff
---
I personally have no issues with it other than, how did he get a character on the same server different faction? Pay for a 2nd sub? I don’t know the rules around multi boxing but blizzard is clearly against faction collusion and that would qualify to me I’d think
---
Lol this is partly why I can't wait to play classic. SO many years playing this game and I know nothing really about the story. This was super cool to understand why WC existed and why we killed those fanglords and why there was a sleeping guy inside lol.
---
Exploring the game for the first time was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. Sadly nothing has ever come close to replicating that feeling. 
---
It was the copper farming spot
---
The classes with the most action buttons are Hunter and Shaman with locks taking 3rd. Hunter/Shaman can fill every single action button and still have spells that are not on any hot bars.
---
Rouges probably have the least amount of action buttons. 
---
Epic is given a lot of shit over their new store. But not enough credit goes to their decision to avoid a p2w cash shop. They could be much more greedy, but I believe this style of play allows as dolts to feel comfortable allowing their kids to play. Because there is no Overwatch loot boxes they keep wanting to buy. 
---
Vastly different times
---
Gaming back then made you a nerd and an outcast
---
Twitch and Yt weren't a thing
---
So true. I rolled a nat 100 on a bonereavers edge and lost due to +1 loot rules.
---
I also rolled a 1 on the AQ 20 staff and won it due to +1 loot rules. 
---
I have been on both sides of this. Always sucks losing something, but that’s part of what makes this game great.
---
"The pass" is Deadwind Pass. Karazhan. 
---
Hunter/Shaman are the only classes I remember that cannot fit all of their spells on all of the action buttons.
---
I think that's a fair point about it not being specific targeting, and to be clear I don't think the Angwes of the world should be punished by Blizzard. I just think its douchey and people shouldn't do it.
---
It always amuses me when people on gaming forums rant and cry for sources like it's some college paper.  Chill the F out "Dr Takhs".  It's a game,  just relax and enjoy the history/nostalgia.  Or don't and continue to act like some source facist.
---
Dude, its true love.
---
True, though as a roleplayer I also don't think it's too much to ignore the server designation in-character. It doesn't hurt immersion if two characters have the same name (actually is quite a bit more plausible then everyone having unique names).  
---
I don't understand....Is it too difficult to bind the 1-6 keys and use those instead of clicking. That's 6 keys, add a shift modifier and it's 12 keys, add another Control modifier and it's up to 18 and you don't have to move your hand that much.
---
Honestly I think the human +5 sword skill beats both Nelf and Dwarf for rogues. 
---
I don't understand how Shamans are capable of reaching the same health pool or armor rating of a feral Druid.
---
I would kill myself, I can‘t take holidays that near in the future.
---
I hope Blizzard takes in mind that most vanilla players are adult and working employees.
---
The later the release the better.
---
And the least it is summer at the point of release, the better, too :P.
---
i hope there will not be such a system in classic
---
It was in the demo :/
---
100% prioritize 40 mount over everything else
---
You outlevel gear quickly, that 40 mount will be your transport for a loooong time. Especially when you consider the majority of players never actually earn a 60 mount. 
---
It’s just too big a speed increase. Helps in levelling/questing, travelling, wpvp, bgs, everything
---
I would personally never do a dungeon with a Shaman tank because it has a large probability of being a massive waste of time.
---
&gt; A world is about emotions and finding fun or doing things your own way. Not the way Blizzard wants you to be: a hug-me teddybear who's brown-nosing everyone they meet.
---
While I understand the conclusion you've come to, I'm not really sure if I agree. 
---
What I'm taking away from it is this, Blizzard is trying to save money and built a system to automate/regulate the game and behavior within it. Unfortunately, this system can be (and is) abused. 
---
The problem isn't the world, or "sjw crap", it's that this company would rather save money building an automated system that decides what to do based off of number of reports than pay the peopled needed to give the time needed to make sure the proper outcome is given to the various issues players feel the need to report. 
---
Well, the answer to nearly any question along the lines of, "What's the easiest and least interactive class at doing X, Y or Z?"
---
... Paladin. The answer is Paladin. Make one single skill bind: Flash of Light, and you've reduced your mouse clicking by 98%.
---
Agreed, but we do need a way to differentiate people in the case of a merger. Like, if my friend told me to go to a specific person to get my weapon enchanted but there's 20 of them on the server that'd be kind of a pain.  
---
I played on US-Bloodscalp. Hoping I find a few people from that server again.
---
Are you being sarcastic with July 16th?  Ive seen the one post about he guy having bad luck and therefore it mist be then because he will be on vacation, but I dont think there is anything actual to it otherwise
---
This guys cynical as fuck, don’t listen to him 
---
You could boil most of every class down to “just hit these couple things” it is a bit more complex. Priest has bubble, 2 heal specs, shammy has totems, chain heal. There are a bunch of differences and the playstyle, especially the levelling is very different 
---
Hmm... seems interesting
---
So, all those portals were actually supposed to be working... not just placeholders in case of future. Now I'm hoping for that to happen.
---
CoT - could be some retail-themed (:Ð) dungeon on patch 1.14 or something.
---
The Dreaming - I've been waiting for the Emerald Dream raid since 1.8... and got only the Nightmare shit.
---
Outland - I've been waiting for the "old Draenor" raid since 2.1... and got only the WoD shit.
---
All playable races were supposed to have separate newbie dungeon?
---
Amberhorn Caverns - that Winterspring portal? Or, that Hyjal portal?
---
Dragon Isles - the little building being the only thing on old Quel'Thalas map?
---
Dire Maul - THERE?
---
No Feralas or Un'goro crater at all?
---
That black thing next to Hyjal - I'm sure the color was neither meant for snow, nor for moonglade... unless moonglade was supposed to be dark, eternal-night forest?
---
Blackrock Spire marked "H/M", instead of a crude "H" - WHAT???
---
BTW, seems like "U" was meant for "future updates"?
---
I plan on not skipping a single spell while leveling. Too much OCD.
---
I wish we could get proof because I have to book my long vacation in advance at my job...and it would be nice nolifing for 2 weeks lol.
---
And when you finally get T3 set, you are the first picture again. Srsly T3 Shamen look like Gods. You can come full circle in Naxx.
---
Not like the Paladin who simply becomes a power ranger.
---
Shamens ftw
---
You're gonna have to farm alot then. Gl getting mount x)
---
Yea I think its 100% fair game to not like it. Its clear why some wont like it. 
---
I personally love it since Im a Wpvper myself and these type of things is why i specifically am gonna roll a PvP server. Even if Im on the wrong end of it. But Id lie if I said Ive never been frustrated once or twice :) 
---
So...
---
N, red - newbie dungeon, each race was supposed to have a separate one. That is, Gnomeregan and Scarlet Monastery at level 10?
---
L, blue - low-level, probably today's 15-30
---
M, green - middle-levels - pre-endgame?
---
H, pink - endgame dungeons
---
U, purple - to be introduced in future updates
---
This way, it would make sense. Now, for the curiosities:
---
1. UBRS was supposed to be endgame, and LBRS to be pre-endgame?
---
2. What is Dire Maul doing THERE?
---
3. Hyjal was supposed to have its own dungeon - Amberhorn Caverns?
---
4. Venture CO dungeon in the Barrens? And without a name on this map?
---
5. Caverns of time was planned to be released early in vanilla - with what inside?
---
6. Teldrassil still having the planned, multi-layer layout?
---
So... who are these 2% of people who will be levelling in silence?
---
You guys are weird. 
---
Play as a druid and it's fun to fly.  I'd play chicken with the ground all the time!
---
&gt; Ah yes, I remember reading about this. Someone released a guide describing how to travel through there. Stuff like he was less likely to chase you if you jump in the water, he’s active around these times, etc. Interesting stuff
---
Yep.  Lol.  This is the kind of stuff he'd post on his website:
---
http://liquidcode.org/~lostman/wow/dkeserver.se/stuff/angwe/
---
Just FYI, if you see the term "AF" pop up, that's what we [the Horde] used to call Alliance on Dethecus.  Stood for "Alliance [expletive]".  The puzzling part was that the Alliance players started using the term to refer to themselves as well..  LOL
---
DAY BY DAY. KICKING ALL THE WAY.
---
mmm free blues
---
I feel like a lot of people are talking Dark Mines, but Wailing Caverns is for me a really iconic Dungeon in the most infamous Area in World of Warcraft: The Barrens Chat.
---
This is why I have to play Horde.
---
I can't think of any music that's more nostalgic though. It's full-fat nostalgia right there.
---
It's also beautiful and atmosphere and I love it, but still. 
---
Warrior first probably and shaman 2nd if I can play both factions.
---
Nor do I.  In fact, the fact that we're still talking about it a decade and a half later is kind of proof that it was an important and memorable part of the game.
---
DM:E is way too low on the list. Those spirit things in the room, on the way to the upper floor, are a pain in the ass. Then you have invisible ones that just popup while doing a pack of three.
---
Is that with the pig??
---
&gt; It's just so damn pointless.
---
Is it?  We're still musing about it a decade and a half later.  Hardly pointless, if you ask me.
---
Meant to be?  This IS the first 5 man dungeon &gt;.&lt;
---
Man, how cool would it be to roll in there at max level as a new max level dungeon, going back to the start only to face a incredibly hard dungeon
---
Depends on class, but if you want to get your mount at 40, skip basically everything that you don't constantly use. 
---
The most obvious example is leveling an enhancement shaman. For totems, you train earthbind totem, MAYBE a few ranks in stoneclaw (tho def r1), maybe one of your 3 damaging fire totems, and Maybe SotE &amp; GoA.
---
You only really train one of your shocks (frostshock need only be r1 for the slow). 
---
You never train frostbrand weapon. You only really train one of rockbiter/flametongue/windfury. 
---
You don't train lightning bolt, you don't train both types of healing waves. You only get R1 is ancestral spirit. 
---
You end up skipping like 90% of your total spells.
---
Ret paladin for me lol
---
As a druid, not leveling healing touch once regrowth is online. Won't level up wrath past 15, won't take Starfire at all. Won't take bear abilities other than growl to tank dungeons past 20. Won't take shred for cat, or faerie fire. Won't level up entangling roots, or hibernate. 
---
The one major tip I can suggest to returning (and new) players is to enjoy the nostalgia, but also then approach the game with an entirely new perspective. 
---
WIPE THE MEMES FROM YOUR MIND! Most (and I am not exaggerating "most") memes are from pre-1.12 version of Wow. They are dead memes but players still keep using them like f'ing idiots, talking about classes they barely played and learned data from the internet.
---
1st hand, personal experience is the only thing that counts. If a meme is real, then learn it from experience. You'll learn the reality and real ideas how to counter limitations or flat out lies. 
---
I personally take this to the extreme with nearly everything in life (most certainly in games). I will reconsider my keybinds for efficiency each go around and even mid-leveling and adjust accordingly even if it takes time. I will re-evaluate my strategies and rotations constantly. I experiment at times just to personally see how something works even though I know it's less efficient. 
---
Understanding AND personal experience is superior to all. I would suggest being very careful who you enter conversations with though. I recently just experiences (yet again) one arsehat who whispered insults at me and put me on ignore when I was answering some questions from a new level 12 feral player. My information (based on experience, raiding metrics and spreadsheet data and direct conversations with those who created the spreadsheets ... one is/was a Youtuber and known as one of the best private server feral raiders) apparently didn't jive with his meme data.
---
This is likely my one major complaint with Classic Wow ... all the dead memes players continuously spout that don't fit the real meta of Classic Wow (as emulated by private servers which very likely may have their differences ... but my conversation was about a private server at the time).
---
&gt; how is that a "get good" situation?
---
Avoiding Angwe was an art.  People wrote guides on it.
---
Yeah, when I got my old Account back a couple of months ago, I had the same feeling. WoW retail is so full of clutter and pointless stuff. But it was enjoyable to see Characters again, that I had forgotten about after 9 years.
---
You are not overwhelmed in a good way, like when you open the Path of Exile Skilltree for the first time and have an RPG orgasm.
---
Glad I can now talk on the official forums though.
---
There was an "easter egg" when they showed developement screenshots during the classic panel at blizzcon.

"Don't do as others like: reported "
---
\-Oh, so you are retribution... Reported!
---
&gt;My first reaction was, holy shit this is way more grindy than I remembered
---
mine was holy shit, it is not that grindy after all
---
but... I've entered it during early Cata, so was still used to the WotLK leveling speed... which was the same.
---
Yeah, I'm not typically a min/maxer. I like the Priest class, but I don't want to be a Human if I go Alliance (It takes away from the fantasy for me). NE Priest would be cool, I suppose. Dwarf Pallys definitely look cool, but I'm not sure I'd like the play style and the fact that Ret and Prot are trash.  I'd do it in a heartbeat if it was TBC though.
---
and the nerfs happened during late WotLK.
---
Loot trade only with master loot
---
Require a vote from group members to confirm the trade. No voting allowed if someone is on your friends list.
---
Remove loot trading all together and let people just deal with it.
---
These are the only options I see working right now.
---
Hahaha, that's hilarious.  I'll be at a conference the 15th-17th so that would suck.
---
**&lt;Hate&gt; (EU, Horde, PvP server) is recruiting knowledgeable raiders and pvp-ers.**
---
**About us:**
---
Back in the days of glory, &lt;Hate&gt; was one of the top dogs on Boulderfist-EU (2006). More than a decade later, friends and old guild members are excited to announce that &lt;Hate&gt; is still alive !
---
Having a fine legacy at both Raiding and PvP, &lt;Hate&gt; scourged Boulderfist-EU, being nicknamed the “High Warlords Guild”, since we had the biggest amount of R14 players (names like Quatro, Zoby, Efe, Artificial, Hiphopyoyo, High come to mind). On the PvE scene, we almost cleared AQ40 and reached Naxxramas, and if we wouldnt’ve been a bit late to the party, with TBC around the corner, these raids would’ve been toast too. On a side note, we invented several strategies that are used even now, ahh, the times when everything was at first hand and you couldn’t possibly find tips and tricks like today...
---
Anyway, our plan is to rebuild &lt;Hate&gt; and push the envelope even further, aiming to assemble a very competitive raid that will last from first UBRS raid till Naxxramas. However, should be noted this time we’lll use a slight different approach and not go for the full hardcore experience. Instead, &lt;Hate&gt; will start as a semi-hardcore guild, thriving to build a really tight community of talented players that will be able to overcome everything. Now that we are older (but wiser!), we are fully aware that WoW Classic is a game that doesn’t evolve around who clears Molten Core fastest, but around which guilds still exist by the time serious stuff like AQ40 and Naxxramas is released. And as you probably know by now, statistics are quite grim: over 70% of the starting raiding guilds fail at clearing Blackwing Lair. Hence our approach.
---
Therefore, if you trully know that you are a talented player, don’t be shy and join our Discord server, available at https://discord.gg/8HqvwAK 
---
May this be the start of something truly spectacular.
---
This is amazing! I like the stat differential you included. I feel like a lot of people aren't aware that different races have different distributions of stats, and this is a great way to provide some clarity. Awesome work!
---
100% could not agree more
---
“Just ignore it” has turned into “report anyone who hurts your feelings or inconveniences you in any way”
---
Blizzard seems to think that players *like* this new system.... as if we are a legion of SJWs looking to unleash on anyone who says something offensive.
---
I was banned in Hots for two weeks, two full weeks, because I told some guy he plays like a retard.
---
Now, it’s not a nice thing to say, but two weeks? What I said is child’s play compared to Barrens chat of old.
---
Blizzard desperately needs to grow balls. They need to come out and say “no loot trading we won’t help you with any misclicks” and get rid of this pussy report system too
---
The point I'm trying to make is that the report system has become too accessible. Reporting is too easy, justified more easily, and done in greater quantities than ever before. 
---
I have the feeling that many players will reach lvl60 very fast, get a good part of their 5man BIS without too much difficulty and with gated content (if they don't tune MC and BWL) and no BG, you'll see many players with a lot of time roaming popular areas and taking advantage of that special time of the game where low level areas are crowded to feel all powerful.
---
Maybe I'm wrong but that's my opinion that PvP will be totally different than during Vanilla where it was a rare sight to see a lvl60 in TM-Southshore battle (and if you saw one, they had helm of the whale and a lvl49 blue weapon)
---
&gt; Loot trading is a result of people complaining.
---
Stop making shit up.
---
Loot trading is a DIRECT result of Blizzard having to spend hundreds and thousands of hours in resolving those issues. 
---
I cannot remember a single thread on the WoW forums suggesting loot trading.
---
The vanilla game client disagrees with you. 
---
Worth in terms of what ? Leveling efficiency no. Idling in front of Ironforge or Orgrimmar bank? Sure.
---
The cross-faction account is what would put it over the line.  You originally could only have characters on a single faction on a pvp server.  Creating a second account with the sole purpose of enabling of circumventing that limitation to enable asshole behavior shouldn't be allowed.
---
Having a second account with a cross faction spy planted could be seen as cheating.  You weren't allowed to have cross faction characters on a single account originally.
---
Well, im most likely rolling lock, pally or druid, so its either a free mount or travel form until i get enough g, so it should be np!
---
Will this be normalised? I want this or echayakee, but cba having it nerfed! 
---
I always thought they *should* make it November, so it can be the same season as it was at launch for maximum nostalgia fulfillment. 
---
So youre planning on gimping yourself.
---
I find it pretty funny that Im downvoted when I'm the only one around here who seemingly know how the game works, but ok.
---
As a hunter, you want to get the AV crossbow as that is the best preraid weapon. Your next upgrade is Rhok'delar from MC which is Hunter only, followed by Ashjre'thul, which has ranged attack power from Chromaggus in BWL. After this you will use Nerubian Slavemaker from Kel'Thuzad. Those are all the ranged weapons you will ever use as a hunter, and neither of them are good for Warriors or Rogues. The only other option here is Larvae of the Great Worm from Ouro, which I believe is only good for dwarves because of Gun skill.
---
I see a mixture of the behavior you're afraid of and very decent people on Vanilla and TBC private servers these days, so I'd assume it'll be a mixture of those two, as well.
---
omg next time dismiss yr pet pls
---
That's true, but how about for primarily pvp? 
---
22nd of September.
---
In this day and time, when a player clicks that server select screen and they go 'PVP', maybe Blizzard should put up a huge window that says, "Are you sure? Classic WoW PVP may not be for everyone. Some players may prefer a PVE server instead. Are you sure you want to play on a PVP server? YES NO"    
---
You'd be a good person to click 'NO' at that screen.
---
welp ... you convinced me!
---
I feel like this has to happened me more times than mere coincidence, but it's probably just confirmation bias.
---
"I am the Serpent King I can do anything"

---
Alterac Valley XBow -&gt; Rhok'Delar -&gt;  Ashjre'thul -&gt; Nerubian Slavemaker.
---
Unless you have Rank14, those are the only weapons you will ever be using once you hit 60. There is no overlap between the weapons a Hunter want and those a Warrior or Rogue wants. I dont know why you guys are all downvoting me when you dont know this.
---
I always did it for the quest xp rather than the gear.  BoE drops were always good value in RFC too.
---
Isn't this only true if the macro system is vanilla like? 
---
Not really. Here's every single ranged weapon you will be using as a hunter with the exception of Rank14 weapons.
---
 Alterac Valley XBow -&gt; Rhok'Delar -&gt; Ashjre'thul -&gt; Nerubian Slavemaker. 
---
The first two are from quests, the third has ranged attack power, and the last is from Kel'Thuzad, at which point, who cares.
---
I hope we will see some creative content like this again with classic l
---
Healers with their various ranks of spells?
---
They wouldn't laugh if someone asked to try something with fortnite haha.
---
The first time I experienced a Hunter wiping an entire group was from "the jump".
---
Well I'm saving this page thank you!
---
I find that playing new open world games without the use of guides and information material comes very close to replicating this feeling. Especially Minecraft did that to me.
---
Counter point: you can trade your retail gold for classic gold with other players thereby creating incentive.
---
Hearthstone
---
Name one ability listed that helps leveling or dungeons? I'll wait
---
Very cool tool. The paladin base stats at least are incorrect however. I assume you referenced the base stats listed on this page: https://www.classicwow.live/basic-stats
---
For some reason the paladin stats on that page are identical to the priest stats. I can confirm the priest stats are correct as I have a 60 priest on a pserver, and I know the paladin stats are different but don't know exact numbers unfortunately.
---
I once walked past him and just killed him because I don't like lion pets ( I am a hunter )
---
Since we don’t know that ourselves how would it be more helpful to exclude it ? 
---
a friend has played private servers for many years and sais hunters are good dps and pretty rare so heasy to find guilds. When you do 40 man raids you only need like 2-3 tanks so it alot of dps needed
---
Come on, if they would actually release it in november they would most definetely release it on November 23rd.
---
But since we know it will be coming and July 16th was hidden in the Classic WoW Presentation, this is our best guess for now.
---
The Witcher III came pretty close, but nothing really feels the same. i think too many games handhold too much now. 
---
It’s interesting that you mention Minecraft. Was it the creative side or the survival mode you found most enjoyable?
---
Speaking of recolors, I wore the green one [[Robes of Insight]](https://vanillawowdb.com/?item=940) on my dorf priest for a long time. Dropped in ZF for me.
---
Probably healer.
---
Also, good luck with your post. 
---
You should check out games based around exploration, perhaps. The remade No Mans Sky is supposed to be very enjoyable (can't confirm), there are also games like Worlds Adrift, Empyrion, various Minecraft conversion mods, Enderal (a Skyrim overhaul), and probably many more with very interesting worlds.
---
I have no problem with it at all except the fact that he uses a second account on the opposite faction to game the system.
---
I've always viewed PvP in an MMORPG in the same way I view it in an FPS like Quake or Battlefield or in an RTS like Warcraft.  
---
If you can be attacked and it looks like a fun battle I will attack you.    
---
Angwe camping the docks is perfectly fine in my opinion and can even be justified from an RP perspective.  I just think it was poor sportsmanship that he/she had to rely on a spy to game the system.  
---
I'm so bad at this. Everyone says not to get all the skills, but on both the hunters I've made in the past 6 months I've gotten just about every skill.
---
Arcane shot, serpent sting, aimed shot, mend pet, aspect of the hawk, hunter's mark are all abilities you obviously keep maxed.
---
Mortal strike, raptor strike, viper sting, and wing clip are extremely useful if someone ganks you, and if your pet drops aggro.
---
Freeze trap, ignite trap, feign death, and disengage are a little bit less required, but extremely useful, especially when you're against elites or doing dungeons.
---
Eyes of the beast, all the tracking, flare, and eagle eye *seem* like really easy abilities to not get, but they are all fairly cheap, don't have multiple ranks, and are super useful for scouting out mobs while leveling and definitely worth the &lt;1g training costs.
---
WTF am I supposed to skip??
---
So I guess realizing you were wrong about something was to difficult to handle emotionally? Or why else would you make such a hostile response to what I believe was a very reasonable explanation to my previous position that Hunters and Warrior/Rogues taking each others weapons is a non issue.
---
While this is true, it wasn't as bad as you think.  For one, some spells simply didn't have a coefficient to make it worth it.  
---
I crunched the numbers (but don't have them on me) and assuming the coefficients I found and the math I did was correct, some spells get a huge benefit from downranking (like Greater Heal), some get barely any benefit (like Flash Heal) and some got no benefit at all.
---
Hi, /u/lobsterbash
---
I had Enderal installed, then blew it away when I decided to do a crazy Skyrim mod play through. 
---
More the creative side I'd say. I really enjoyed learning redstone circuits on my own and exploring cave systems without digging through rocks. I ended up making parcour maps for my now ex girlfriend most of the time while using more sophisticated redstone clocks to time jumps and the like. The survival aspect came too short for me. I did enjoy mods like Aether, Herobrines Mansion and similar ones though.

I mean, you are allowed to think he is an asshole and he can (or could) continue on his merry way knowing he tilted someone. It is a win for him.

I think it was, but I'm not sure honestly. Classic is going to use a modern client though, which almost certainly means there will be a modern macro system.
---
I only really came to enjoy Skyrim when I installed immersive mods exclusively, like Hypthermia, hunger, diseases and the like. It made the game more slow paced but made the world feel more alive.
---
I have to ask. Are these like troll replies or are you really bad at typing?
---
But is accessibility really the issue, or how the reports are handled?
---
Quote from the OP
---
&gt;it only takes 5 players total to report a player and automatically have them flagged. This will disconnect them, automatically forcing a silence or ban on them without the involvement of a gm. Obviously, this can be abused by those with grudges in the game. 
---
Even if you made it more difficult to report a player, it would only take 5 people (or someone w/ multiple accounts) to get someone banned. That's the issue, making it more or less difficult doesn't stop the fact that the "algorithm" is set up to act automatically after X amount of reports, nor does it stop the fact that someone can be banned for BS and have a difficult time getting back in because the human element of review is near non-existent. 
---
If Blizz, a billion dollar company, would just fork over the money needed to give a quality experience this wouldn't even be a conversation. But no, their shareholder &gt; us. 
---
Become the bull!

Warlocks definately want to be using wands a lot while leveling. Life Tap sounds great in theory, but all it does is to make it so that you have to eat food after combat instead of drinking. Drain Life can fill up the lost life, but it costs the same amount of mana as the life tap gave you in the first place so why bother.
---
Besides, if you have improved drain soul and fight multiple mobs at once (which you should as a lock) then you can use your wand to take full advantage of the increased mana regen from spirit upon killing the first mob.
---
Discord with my guild and friends.
---
Shaman have the best sets and no discussions about that. There is literally only 2 instances, where classes have gear as cool as shamans, and those are judgement for paladins and dreadnaught for warriors!
---
I agree with the free market mentality. During initial release of WoD I found out a method of spawning invasions in garrison and was spawning one every ~hour. Due to desirable weekly rewards it didn't matter to me after the first one so I started selling/carrying anyone who wanted for gold. After a week it (how to spawn) was figured out and I moved on, but I made a good chunk of gold doing 2-3 people at a time.
---
typing on phone with one hand while watching tv
---
What is this +1 thing?
---
Hence why OP is asking about a \*Speculation\*. I know that for mages and locks people have created gearsheets that make certain assumptions about what items being in when and have 1.12 itemization, that are ez enough to addapt when we get more information out and plan on keeping it updated as is.
---
I am fairly confidend as warriors being one of the most popular classes come classic that someone has done the same for them or plans to. OP is looking for what a BiS list might look like with the current thinking blizz has atm for it and what items might or might not make a certain stage and why it is up for debate.
---
Mages dont even need wands. It's entirely a stat stick for them while leveling due to having enough tools to keep themselves from ooming. The wands you use while leveling anyway would be some green boe wand made by enchant, followed by the quest wand from Blackfathom Deeps, followed by the +7 Frost/Fire/Arcane damage wand from magequest.
---
Once you have that wand, you never replace your wand until Alterac Valley anyway, while Warlocks and Priests actually need their wand for DPS.
---
At some point we just need to make rules banning these topics... They've just been beaten to death and get reposted every day.
---
Level cap was in the demo. They aren't going to let us get to 60!!! Game is ruined. 
---
as rogue you can also get just r1 of vanish, kick, gouge since higher ranks don't do much for leveling
---
What change? This looks identical to your last two.
---
Yes, you understand the joke. Good.
---
The question is, though, do you have the healing pants?
---
That's pretty decent pre 60. It's basically a second Inner Focus.
---
Depends on race spec(2hand or not) and also how blizzard does itemization.
---
Hell yeah. Lok'tar!
---
Those really do help improve it a lot. 
---
Is that the one with Thralls story ? That is a good one.
---
Sir, go fuck yourself.
---
Thanks that’s helpful. Scrolling past is easier then taking a dump on it. 
---
I don't think it was an option, I haven't seen it on any of the private servers I've been playing on. At least, they don't have it as an option on the icon page, there might be some command you can put in the macro that overrides it.

The first time he posted it it might have been high effort but every time after that?
---
Happened to me with jed trinket. We killed rend and then reset the instance, and the trinket dropped again. And this time I won the roll with a 93. I got a lot of grats when I won it lol 
---
And it would be easier for you to use the search function... this has been posted literally hundreds of times in past year.
---
It is a rule: Rule 7. Report and move on is the best you can do.
---
Wrath, starfire, more bear abilities if the shit hits the fan, shred for cat dps in dungeons or when grouping in general, faerie fire for pulling, higher ranks of hibernate for pvp or dungeons. 
---
Might be situational, but they all have uses.
---
hmm, that "wsispers" thing - I have one thing worthy of mentioning.
---
I have a feeling that my country was hit too hard by the Internet. 
---
Before the Internet, everything was discussed openly in the public. It was well-known that Icelanders are very open and honest about everything. It was common to say that when an Icelander doesn't like you, you'll know it.
---
Also, there has always been the talk that Icelanders believe in Elves - and, before the tourism came, it was not just a tourist trap - it was truth. Now, it's truth only for the oldest generations. The young people will either just say they do, hiding the truth, or even turn it into jokes!
---
Also, things such as "CV" or "job interviews", were discussed on English, rather than Finance classes - because learning about English culture was more fitting into English classes. In Iceland, you would just go around and ask - there was no such thing as CV, unless you were applying for abroad.
---
And, if you weren't accepted, you would know why. "I'm afraid you don't have enough experience" or "They say that you can't cook", did not mean the same as "I'll call you back this evening".
---
Today?
---
Everything is done on facebook or snapchat. If you haven't been accepted for a job, you'll never know that - unless you ask online later. Nobody will say that on the interview.
---
If someone doesn't like you, they'll hide their feelings and behave completely friendly, but when saying goodbye, they'll say "message me on facebook tomorrow", and then block you on facebook.
---
If there are any bad rumors going about you - I'd risk guessing that you wouldn't even know that - just random people suspiciously blocking you on facebook...
---
I've even had a case, that I've been fired - and haven't received any message about it, just when I tried to open my timetable on google sheets, it said "you don't have the permission to access this file", and when I called my boss, he stopped answering. And, in reality - I didn't know that for sure, until I looked at my bank account statement and seeing only 4 days of the salary - with empty account and  bills to pay. You know, I didn't go for unemployment, because I wasn't sure if I wasn't employed...
---
2 months later, one of my workmates responded on facebook, "I thought you got fired". Pathethic...
---
To a person that lives in the real world, not online, it feels as if everything is done in conspiracy - even socialization - take the /whisper example. Almost all serious small guilds have empty guild chat - back then, when I asked on guild chat and didn't hear any response, it meant the guild was dead and I immediately left it. Now, it happens commonly, and also I sometimes get /w with a warning to "stop spamming the guild chat" and "google it".
---
Everything has become so... formal, consumption-oriented, and... autistic. 
---
Imagine not lagging in field of strife this time.
---
**Sash of the Grand Hunt** and **Marksman Bands** seems to have different amount of weapon skill depnding on the source, some sites say its +2 and and other say its +3, so its a bit hard to tell if you get +5-6 or +4. Also the **Trueaim Gauntlets** say either +8 or +9 but i guess that's not really that relevant. The information might be a factor of different patches or something.
---
Yeah not having to get **Truestrike Shoulders** is a big benefit from this setup.
---
I'd call it a cross post. Shouldn't fall under rule 7. Sure i could paste in what he wrote or I could just include the link.
---
Removed per rule 7. 
---
Yeah weird. Mine is bound to 1.
---
Makes sense. Tbf, there were certainly douchecanoes back then too. They just didn't get friended and invited to more dungeons later, so it was ultimately their loss.
---
Removed per rule 1. This is obviously private server content which is not allowed. 
---
I haven't seen it either.  But it could just be a piece of code they haven't emulated yet.
---
Newer loot mechanics that PUGs tend to use: “MS &gt; OS, +1”
---
This means: Main spec gets priority over off spec, and awarded loot gets counted (+1 per item). People that haven’t gotten loot get priority over those that have.
---
It’s a pretty way to distribute loot in raid pugs.
---
It is already cross posted a few posts below yours.
---
For sure, it was godly for how low level it was. Definitely carried me until I got some tier. Just really unfortunate-looking on a fem dorf.
---
Removed per rule 1. This doesn't relate to classic. 
---
At the same time, would player housing quickly turn into modern Garrisons. I love the concept of player housing, but for me it has to be in the overworld not instanced.
---
I dont skip anything. I like the slow leveling progression that comes with being a completionist as i level. Ill aldo be keeping my fishing/cooking/gathering skill/crafting skill up to date with my level. I like to craft gear (or potions etc.) for myself that are at my level, and even collect recipes. As i reach 40 ill start farming for my mount.
---
This is the most satisfying way for me to actually enjoy WoW content and not start treating this game like a chore or a job that im trying to skip as fast as possible. Thats the shit that retail tries to push and thats not what i want from vanilla.
---
I say GZ because i think if i dont say it, karma will screw me over and ill never get a weapon :D 
---
Removed a per rule 7 after numerous reports. Posts like these will be removed with more frequency. 
---
The Jasperlode mine why you need to click this. (and here's why)

That's not  Humar the Pridelord. That's my boy pubert, the lord of all lions, and he's been my friend through many dangers.
---
I see where youre coming from but is having a lvl 1 ally char just to be able to read general chat and recieve flame really a huge advantage/gaming the system tho?
---
The only perk I can see is if people started to plan a raid on him, and did so in general chat, but he was a rogue so hed be able to avoid that anyway so I dont  really think thats much of a gain.
---
As for chatting... its basically what battle.net allows now, just allows for some shit chatting

**&lt; Sun And Steel &gt; \[Alliance\] OCE (Syd/Melb)- PvP Server | English language**

Lets take a new approach to an old game.... and have fun!  All are welcome, no matter your experience level.  We plan on raiding when we can.  The sooner the better, but no one will be discriminated against for slow leveling.  We plain on taking a Boomkin, a feral tank and a Ret with none cookie cutter builds allowed and encouraged .  
---
We are also wanting to bring back city raids and make our guild name known in the Horde chat.  Join us and lets march across the plains and take whats ours!

Kings honor, friend!

**Who we are interested in joining our ranks:**

Everyone and everyone.  Toxic behaviour will not be tolerated however and you will be kicked for being an asshole. 
---
Raiding times and days will be discussed at a later date. Message me to lend your sword, spells or heals to the Alliance and be apart of Azeroth history!
---
Gnome for escape artist is best for alliance rogue PvP, mainly because of the 1 minute cooldown compared to 3 minute stoneform cooldown, if they had equal cooldown I'd give the edge to stoneform. It's a gamechanger against mages and druids roots and still pretty useful against all classes except priest, warlock, and paladin.
---
Night elf base stats differences are inconsequential in PvP, as is the slightly better stealth.
---
There's a guy on the private server I play on, who's been terrorising Terren Mill for months
---
I played during all Vanilla in PvP so I know what exactly what it is. I'm sorry  but I wasn't impressed and I feel it will be worse in classic so indeed I'll be playing on PvE
---
(which is kinda sad because I loved the skirmish in stranglethorn and blackrock but I simply hated all the 'I'm lvl60, I'm gonna kill low level players in starting areas)
---
The only issue is when hybrids don't want to play as a hybrid...
---
Ok, this fight isn't as healing intensive. 
---
Me: "Hey Bob, pull your Nightfall and Ret gear out and go and thwack him this fight to keep the debuff up, you'll increase our caster's damage by a ton!"
---
Bob: "Sweet! I'm so excited, I can be all kinds of different useful and get to play a true hybrid!"
---
VS
---
Me: "Hey Harry, I know you're Feral, but we need more decurses and poison cleanses this fight."
---
Harry: "How dare you make me do something I don't want to do!!?!! I only have FERAL abilities because I'm a FERAL Dr00d!!!@!@!"
---
Me: "But Harry, we seriously need more decurses, your damage doesn't matter if we ALL DIE!"
---
Harry: "Whatever, what a GARBAGE group this is if you can't build your entire raid around ME, the FERAL Dr00d!!!+@!!"
---
Harry leaves the raid.
---
The shards will perhaps sell for around 3g each (mileage may wary). The good thing is deposits on AH are free and it saves up bag space.
---
As for the gear I didn’t have issues as healer + prot. Fury + healer might be better. Not sure if shadow would oom to fast without the proper gear but I think so.
---
I find strength to be cool
---
This is really nice!
---
Hey, maybe you could revive chardev.org?
---
Would be the most popular tool on the web for vanilla for sure.
---
Wrath and Starfire are not worth it, pulling with moonfire if ever out of catform is best to pull. Same reason we don't take faerie fire. Hibernate and entangle aren't needed past an initial cc. Bear abilities I'll take - frenzied Regen. Tank really doesn't need to dps in dungeons. Shred is so marginal not worth ranking up, same reason I won't take ravage. 
---
Still gives crit % I believe. 
---
That's at least some place you'd specifically have to go to, as opposed to a common path of travel.
---
Was it really that expensive? I don't recall having problems getting them all.
---
I guess what I mean by the whole post is not so much me worried about enjoyment, cause boy will I ever! I’m worried that the flood gates of Rogues and warriors will be wide open cause from a lot of aspects they reigned supreme. Nobody in their right mind will roll a Druid to top Dps charts, yet when classic was vanilla, people tried that and a lot of trial and error ensued. There won’t be trial and error just content we already know how to get through to an almost perfectionist standpoint. Kudos to those who play like it was new again, refrain from guides, and makes their toon to how they want, cause that coupled with being sociable was vanilla to me. 
---
Yup. I got ganked many times in vanilla. I also ganked plenty of people in vanilla. That's life on a PvP server.
---
It's sort of amazing people are still debating it 15 years later.
---
That seemed to be my initial thought but then I saw a sea nearby and im like what
---
Subnautica is a great exploration/survival game.
---
Shouldn’t assume a private server is correct. They make plenty of mistakes. Do you know for sure the page is wrong in the real game?
---
For some reason as a kid I always thought this icon was  Henry VIII. I have no idea why.... haha I just realized how fucking stupid this is, thanks for bringing it to my attention 
---
I zoomed in. Its actually garbage graphics/  distance LOL
---
That's true, I agree with you, that shouldn't be allowed and I'll be seriously disappointed if they don't keep faction restrictions on Classic.
---
I dunno what game you played in vanilla, but I was there from day 1 in 2004 and there were plenty of 60's around ganking low levels throughout its lifespan. Especially in STV.
---
I fucking loved getting shit on by some class that was super good lvl 20 and then see them again in like Tanaris and my class was stronger to revenge. The internal server rivalries haha
---
It's on my list to get eventually. 
---
It's a factor but I agree with what you're saying too.
---
Everything that isn't necessary (Example: ranks of Drain Soul past 1). Things that are fun to dick around with like Eye of Kilrogg or Far Sight are fair game though.
---
I welcome this influx of Sam Didier memes. 
---
Plus it's also worth noting that this early into development, what a dungeon was and looked like was in flux. The idea of instanced content was one thing that made WoW seem appealing vs. other MMO's and it's unclear, by this time, if instancing was even a thing yet.
---
Not to mention immune to sheep!
---
'I don't agree with something someone said so it's dumb.'
---
like I said, it's poor sportsmanship if anything at all.  gaming the system to see where other rogues might be hiding (as you can see allies when closer)
---
Yeah I kinda wish it was. The quests that go through it are great. One thing about Cataclysm is that there's a great quest chain that goes through it. Only wish the fights were a bit tougher and it'd be kinda cool feeling to solo.
---
One change I'm 100% on board with: allowing a vastly larger ignore list. 
---
Don't forget about the hunter he needs that weapon also
---
Uh, you must be new here. There's a lot of stuff that was originally going to be in the base game. There's been three different versions of Kara made, only the third one was used in BC, but it was considered for use in Vanilla. Caverns of Time was going to be in Vanilla. They made the entire area and ended up just sealing it off but some wall hacks and/or weird jumping angles can get you inside. It's all there in the Kalimdor map. 
---
Amberhorn Cavern was totally scrapped. 
---
Yeah one of the OG devs said that there were three different versions of Kara made, and only the 3rd one they thought was good enough for the game, and that was the one used for BC.
---
First dungeon overall? That's ambitious.
---
The first raid was Onyxia, for sure.
---
I think the general assumption is that Blackrock Depths was the first instance created and it's kinda ambiguous what they wanted to do with it.
---
druid training bills are particularly horrendous, although I think they might have significantly reduced them after I hit 60
---
Little did we know, the kobolds and gnolls were the true threat all along, and Hogger is the true final boss of the game. 
---
night elf priest missing
---
Enhancement meets the concept art standard
---
But that might have been something they added later. Or it was going to be part of the original dungeon.
---
And you're fighting dumb/silly mobs like kobolds, it's a very DnD-esque way to start your journey.
---
Warriors don't use up too much space, with some abilities split between stances you only have a handful of other abilities that take up space.
---
We do not have any definitive information on how Classic will tackle the vanilla itemization, so making an accurate list right now is almost impossible.  
---
However, we can infer certain things from the last blizzcon panel. Ion talked briefly about how classic world of warcraft was a "journey" and that "catch-up mechanisms that might undermine or compete with gear from Molten Core or Onyxia could make that stuff irrelevant" would be detrimental from the game. Surely, this hints at a somewhat progressive or gated itemization - so I would guess they would not include 1.10 items or AV rep rewards on launch, etc. That being said you would probably get very far with a pre-raid bis list from that one big private server that started with N or its successor servers. There will be plenty of time to deduce what the list will look like once we get more information.  
---
I'd think it'll look something like this:  
---
Head: Mask of the Unforgiven --&gt; Lionheart Helm (when someone gets the plans on your server)  
---
Neck: Mark of Fordring  
---
Shoulders: Truestrike Shoulders  
---
Chest: Cadaverous Armor -&gt; Savage Gladiator Chain (questionable depending on path chosen with itemization)  
---
Bracers: Battleborn Armbraces  
---
Gloves: Devilsaur Gauntlets / Edgemaster's (edgemaster's being a must-have if you're a non-orc/human using the respective weapons, whether they're 100% worth it for an orc/human depends on which weapon skill formula is used, since private servers might not be 100% correct in that regard)  
---
Belt: Omokk's Girth Restrainer   
---
Legs: Devilsaur Leggings / Cloudkeeper Legplates  
---
Boots: Battlechaser's Greaves  
---
Rings: Tarnished Elven Ring &amp; Blackstone Ring  
---
Trinkets: Hand of Justice / Blackhand's Breadth (Diamond Flask would be here if it's in-game at launch, but that would be a little OP)  
---
Weapons: Axe of the Deep Woods / Flurry Axe (if orc) or Dal'rends set (if human/other race using edgemaster's)  
---
Ranged: Satyr's Bow  
---
Dogshit 
---
It's part of the balance doesn't mean it's good balance. If you change it, you change the original balance. 
---
I've said this before, but current wow, and the few previous expacs had great class balance. Vanilla did not. 
---
Also, if you want to talk about poor balance, start by pointing out that most classes have one (at best two) viable specs. 
---
I know it  was there for tbc.  I could of sworn it was there in vanilla, but my memory gets hazy that far back lol
---
I remember walking my happy ass up to the statues as soon as I could when I finally made my Orc Hunter
---
I had this same experience with the Elder Scrolls games, Morrowind in particular
---
The advice I have for everyone is:
---
Play what you want. But feel free to research and know what you're getting yourself into. Understand that picking your class is a choice. And choices have consequences. It means you can and can't do certain things. And all that is okay. Just know what you're signing up for. But have a blast doing what you like.
---
Morrowind is one of my favorite games of all time. I still go back and play it on occasion! 
---
And a bear. The canonical trio of dwarf, gun, and bear is the best.
---
Totally new.
---
That's the thing.  I did a LOT more research in TBC and really figured out the game around then.  I didn't even hit 60 in Vanilla (52 or 53), didn't really figure out macros, didn't have much in the way of addons, if anything.  
---
Awesome tool! However, your description of the troll regeneration racial is misleading for priests, shaman, and mages because it says it increases mana regen. Troll racial only increases HP regen
---
Beautifull!
---
If that system makes it in Classic then it would ruin world pvp.... Imagine killing people of the opposite faction while questing in STV and a bunch of them report you for ganking them.....
---
Can 2h fury actually keep up with DW?
---
I've seen 2h do more dps in MC content, but how soon does DW outscale?
---
i hope you played elderscrolls games then
---
Because you’re not a champion of Elwynn Forest 
---
Warriors: Everything I touch dies!
---
Priest: Oh Rogue, aren't you gonna come over and give my Warrior a congratulatory hand touch?﻿
---
&gt; They need to come out and say “no loot trading we won’t help you with any misclicks”
---
So you want them to change their loot policy? You know they did help with misclicks back in the day?
---
Anyway:
---
I'm surprised how hard people find it to behave civil and respectful. Not flinging insults and slurs at people even if you're not happy or maybe downright angry with the way they play the game is just a matter of common decency to me. Apparently that's a SJW thing nowadays. 
---
The hunter rolls a 99.
---
Then just shut up im hype
---
Yooooo I totally forgot about tabards.  That just made me sooo happy thanks lol 
---
This is great, thanks for doing this
---
It gives some nice XP tho.
---
&gt;Not sure if it's a bug, but Razormane Seers in southern Barrens will, on occasion, immediately cast their two totems (Healing Totem/Searing Totem) back to back, overriding one another
---
This happens on private 1.12 servers as well. Not limited to the demo.
---
Might be intentional, or bug. In any case it seems true to vanilla
---
Roger that, will fix.
---
I was the same way.  Unfortunately most people these days won’t be ready for that type of gaming lol 
---
Meant to be? Swirling portal or not, this place sucks trying to do it solo. 
---
Thank you, will update.
---
What about teleport moondglade
---
I recall the Aussie guild had the word "deer" in it. Like "Runs with Deer" or "Running with Deer" or something like that. They may as well have server transferred. I dunno.
---
It’s kind of broken now unfortunately. When you reach the end the boss doesn’t spawn half the time and the portals to exit don’t work.
---
I saw him the other day on a private server. He was just lying there taking a nap like in this pic.
---
I thought about letting zone chat know his location, but naw. I just let him be.
---
Cool looking cat though.
---
'Many' is a bit abstract. One thing is sure however is that there will be way more lvl60 after a month in classic that there was in Vanilla and they will be way better geared.
---
Then I'm complaining because I liked to PvP against people in my level rank and if the game had been designed better (like bounty system or all kind of penalty for high level attacking in low level areas) then it would have been fun. 
---
Now of course I know they won't change this but for the sake of discussion I'm telling that PvP in Vanilla was lackluster
---
1?! What are you and animal?
---
After reading "The Last Guardian," Kharazan has a whole new meaning to me.  Seems so awesome now knowing it was home to Medivh. 
---
I know, right? I don't think New Classic will ever capture the innocence, naiveness, etc. we all experienced the first time.
---
The only character I had a problem not being able to afford every ability on was my druid, and that wasn't too bad. Plus I think they nerfed the cost in the later vanilla patches
---
Where are you even suppose to level? anyone have like optimal and guaranteed guide in classic to do 1-60? and not run around like a fool looking for which quest
---
There was a similar troll rogue on Mal'ganis who was famous for ganking at menethil. Can't remember his name, but he didn't use an alliance alt. He just ganked indiscriminately. And being famous for ganking on Mal'ganis is impressive, because it's also the home of the original Goon Squad. 
---
All that linen, tho.
---
Exactly. I don’t understand why no one is talking more about on of the most crucial topics that blizzard implemented in 2016, right click reporting.
---
e.g: I’m a rogue and I’m ganking people out in the open world and five of them happens to report me. What happens? Banned. If they implement this shit into classic, well yea. DOA.
---
Instead people have this mindset https://m.imgur.com/gallery/c4jt321
---
N, red is more like 15-20
---
L, blue 20-30
---
M, green 30-40
---
H, pink 40-50
---
U(IMO its more like upper or uber) - raids in general for lvl50 - during game dev firstly levelcap was planned as 50, then as 70, then again 50, but looks like there were too much content for 50 lvls and not enough for 70, so we have 60 =)
---
1. UBRS was raid, mean its more like "heroic" raids nowadays. LBRS is another kind.
---
2. Looks like Dire Maul(elf ruins dungeon) was planned to be in some kind of lore with High Elfs or Dire Maul was planned in Ogre-like style based on ruins of Alterac.
---
3. Yep. Most likely, placeholder of its raid is used Ony Lair model.
---
4. Venture Co dungeon in Mulgore =)
---
5. CoT - Black Morass and Hyjal most likely.
---
6. It was not Teldrasil, it was Kalidar.
---
7. Un'goro is here, just a bit small(grey color). 
---
8. Its just small.
---
There are many legitimate fears for Classic.
---
* Loot trading seems to be the biggest one.    
---
* I don't care about sharding in starter realms.    
---
* Content release schedule seems controversial.    
---
* Changes to things like gold farming and cheap mechanics don't seem like they'll make it to release.    
---
There are more but I can't think of them right now.
---
Question everything young padawan.
---
Necessary for bear form, so yes
---
I would like to play Nelf druid healer. But I have so little time with fulltime work and studying for a degree, so question is, do I have to soe d a lot of time farming for stuff on druid? My backup plan was pretty much warlock, since they dont need to farm anything and always wanted.
---
And y dont they just let u create a character in no-server so u can choose the server u like when u start playing...
---
STV has always been one of my favorites... I remember stumbling upon ratchet and the boat that took me to STV.. my first trip there I was wayy too low of a level for everything which made the world way more intimidating.. only Booty Bay felt safe to me and even there it wasnt safe...
---
my first death was always reserved for the murlocs nearby. 
---
Horde or alliance? I don't have guides or anything but I have played both and there are tons of fun areas and quest lines that I remember for both. If you want to put together a guide for yourself I can help you out with that.
---
Arcane shot/aimed you 'really' dont need. Plenty of dps with serpent/gun/pet....go BM for leveling.
---
Mend pet is very very useful.
---
Hunter's mark I'd only get to 1...its a mana waster but still good vs stealthers.
---
Ignore raptor(mortal strike?) strike, don't really need to improve wing clip, but get it.
---
ignite trap is next to useless except for the occasional elite mob.
---
Freeze trap and Feign death for pve/pvp, cap it.
---
eagle eye is useless.
---
Get the speed boosts. I rarely use the range damage bonus one until 60. Speed is very useful.
---
Flare is a must.
---
Remember...for hunters its not about burst damage, its about survivability.
---
2h fury on horde can keep up for a fair bit
---
It will. The report function isn't part of the game, it's part of Blizzard's customer service. All they're doing is re-releasing Classic WoW, not reverting their customer service to how it was in 2004. The way you report players, the way you submit a ticket, the way you contact GMs etc - expect that to all stay the same.
---
It would have been pretty neat to have dungeons in the starter areas
---
Except AV won't be in the game from the start so you have to look at pre-BiS. Which is LBRS xbow unless I forget some DM loot. It has +1% hit iirc and I already lost it to warriors and rogues. 
---
Five right-click-report = banner system ;)
---
who is blizzard? That name sounds familiar 
---
It was indeed Clownboat. My Dwarf died many a death in Menethil thanks to that guy.
---
I agree with you and think most people do as well and just try to say the same thing differently. Play the game the way you like, even if it is something that is considered "unviable" or "sub-viable", but know that you won't be doing Naxx with that thing or raiding at all. I think that all specs are viable for dungeons and most are viable for PvP and that is where people should have fun with their stuff. 
---
Thanks.
---
You are thinking of some other fantasy version of dwarves. Warcraft dwarves use lots of guns and flying machines.
---
It's a slippery slope when you start regulating this.
---
Think about it like golf - if you suck at golf, you had better enjoy golfing because you will play a lot of golf to finish the course.  
---
If you suck at PvP (or making groups to defend yourself) then you had better enjoy getting killed. If this isn't what you enjoy, then roll on a PvE server.
---
Ironforge? Hammers used for smelting?
---
You could say both people made art of massacring the weak... 
---
Then play a warrior, shaman, paladin or maybe a druid.
---
rogues - least, shamans - most.
---
I think it was an immersion thing. You're writing out what the quest giver wants from you. 
---
Personally I played with it on for quite a while as J didnt know there was an option to have it be instant. 
---
cold war, at best
---
This was added in tbc along with a bunch of "made for macros" slash commands and conditionals.
---
I just said I don't think what he did should be against the rules.
---
"Shaman tanks are capable of reaching the same stats as a feral bear tank"
---
Seriously doubt you can even come close of the armor that a bear tank have with only mail when even warrior with plate are behind on this stats.
---
Big difference between using them to build things and using them to fight.
---
People play classes in Vanilla, not specs. That should be knowledge of everyone. If a person likes ret paladins, he should play them in PvP (because they are actually really good there) and either walk the extra mile for consumables and be one in raids (if the raid leaders allows that) or stay holy. Same goes for kittycats. They are good in PvP, mediocre in raids. Go the extra mile for pummelers or be a healer. Not to mention there sometimes is a feral druid for the leader of the pack buff.
---
Then there are even less viable things, like prot paladin or balance druid. In that case, they should go into a dungeon, where these specs are fine. Prot paladin is also actually a lot of fun when farming large stacks of enemies and balance druid has some nice crits in PvP. Especially good against mages. Again, leave the raids be.
---
Couple of bugs but good tool.
---
2nd comparison allows nightelfs to choose paladin
---
Except they use maces and hammers in combat much more than humans do. Magni is depicted using dual-wield maxes as his weapons of choice.
---
Lol, nice.  I'm sure there were many more, on other servers.  Angwe just took it to such an extreme--in _and_ out of game--that people started hearing about him even though Dethecus was a total backwater.
---
He also reportedly social engineered his way into getting admin rights from Ally guilds he didn't like and disbanded them.
---
PK all you want but to me that he crossed the line for reasons not directly related to his PVPing.
---
Actually sounds nice on paper, but fucks people over in practice. Huh. Haven't I thought that of some other thing... hmm
---
And they all involve potential harm to others, while this is beneficial to literally everyone.
---
It does t really screw anyone over. You just have to be careful what you roll for!
---
It does give some preference for people that run and only need 1 or 2 items and allows for other people that are less geared to get more items. 
---
It’s a hell of a lot better than silent DKP bids IMO.
---
I might try it actually. I want something to force me into reading the quest text. Sometimes I read lore stuff related to quests I’ve done, only to realise I’ve done this content and barely remember what it was about - possiblemy because I skimmed through the text. 
---
It doesnt really screw anyone over. You just have to be careful what you roll for!

---
Your arguments here are selective. Magni being depicted with maces is one dwarf... Humans were the first paladins in existence, and maces are heavily favored by paladins lore wise. 
---
Warcraft dwarfs are riflemen in most situations (looking at warcraft III and the mountaineers) and if I'm not mistaken Ironforge guards carry axes, as does Muradin Bronzebeard. Wildhammers like them maces though.
---
So I think your argument isn't very strong. Just sayin'. I also agree with Skribsbb in that using something for combat would be much different than for crafting.
---
I'm more of a Gimli from LOTR style guy myself. Dwarves with axes!!
---
And how do you beat a lock? Viper won't work, all the mana you drained lock life taps, all the life lock lost he either drain back or gain fro. The dots if u played slow.
---
Honestly I never lost tu a hunt on a fair duel with all calldowns. 
---
I really can’t complain about a 60 killing 60’s. Also you can’t roll both factions on a blizzard pvp server (at least in vanilla this was true) so don’t have to worry about the spy
---
Mace Specialization makes more sense for dwarves than it does for humans, that’s all I’m saying.

My old guild did the same, except 1 was the instant win.
---
Where's your support for that? There is no mention in lore as to why bronzebeard dwarves (the playable clan) would use maces more-so than humans. "Makes more sense" "Humans would use maces less than dwarves would" is not a compelling argument, is all I'm saying. Hope you still roll dwarf master race despite this not ever being a change!
---
Rank 2 of gouge increases the duration I'm pretty sure so it's worth buying
---
Lag-free Battlegrounds, cranking view distance up to max... I can't wait.
---
I still to this day have never seen him in the wild ;(
---
Nowadays sure, there's literally no point to even have words in the quest you pick up. But back then Blizzard probably did it because they wanted to encourage players to actually read everything slowly to understand what they had to do since quest helpers BARELY existed. All you had were the information in the quest log.
---
Keep in mind that WoW is a role-playing game and it's suppose to feel like the NPC is writing down the quest on a paper for you when you go there to pick it up. Immersion you know.
---
I've played class, is there a specific one you want to know?
---
Mace specialization was given to dwarves in wrath, so blizzard agrees. 
---
The change should be in classic. It would make more sense lore wise and allow more interesting gearing choices rather than waste a specialization on humans because they will always be using swords endgame anyways.
---
It was never considered to be a 5-player dungeon, although goldmines were probably Dana’s prototypes for The Deadmines (which were always supposed to be an instanced dungeon). The two basic goldmines were easily the first micro dungeons that got textures, which was a big deal because then they could be placed into the game, spawned, quested, and tested.
---
We should just /ignore the people we don't like. Systems like this that erase people from the Vanilla world will discourage genuine communication. That's going to make introverted people stay quiet for fear of being reported. The cool thing about Vanilla was that many people who had trouble socializing HAD to come out of their shells. I'm confident that I helped a few people learn the social boundaries a bit better and I'm not sure they had the real life opportunities or willingness to learn. Hopefully they went on to better lives. We only spent time together because we were all immersed in a social experience together in which we were not afraid to be genuine. 
---
As always, the tool to make things more accessible/emotionally gentler makes things more toxic. I hate the idea of people withholding expression for fear of causing offense to the easily offended. 
---
Damn, I always wanted a Kobold dungeon.
---
Too many unknowns to answer really. Unless I get far enough ahead of the pack that PvP isn't really a concern anymore, I don't plan on gimping myself in PvP. I'd rather have a later mount than being gimped while levelling.
---
Mainly mage and priest frost and holy/disc
---
Hi, /u/Oldkent
---
Orc and tauren are pretty awesome for pvp. I plan on healing in PvE so troll racial is good. It increases cast time depending on your hp. The lower your HP the more haste you get from berzerking. There have been times when unless than 15%hp and full healed with healing wave+zerk while being attacked.
---
Hey I would be very much interested. Played as a kid from vanilla to WOTLK but never actually done a raid cause my mac would crap itself. Would be great to learn and experience with your group. 🙂
---
Chance is 1/10000. Not THAT low if you ask me.
---
&gt;Dark Mines
---
Lol bruh.
---
Interesting, I never knew mace spec was passed to dwarves in WoTLK. So I'll give you that! Lore wise is still making me scratch my head though... If only we lived in should land, we could see this come to light. I'm assuming you will be rolling a dwarf fury warrior?
---
You have to stand almost on them to see them in stealth back then, unless youre in grp. So its a VEEEERY rarely successfull exploit in that scenario. 
---
Poor sportsmanship, sure. 
---
My dream would be to play a dwarf arms warrior with might of Menethil and mace specialization in the talent tree, with a dwarf paladin by my side healing and supporting me.
---
no progressive itemization, nerfed "rush boss" av, loot trading, automated right click report, sharding, stale content with no dynamic for monthes cos of 4 stages release cycle, spell batching, legion servers no handling mass battles etc. 
---
I can't imagine them doing everything right honestly, even if they wanted, there are too much shit to fuck up and take a wrong road, that will fuck vanilla, you need to know too much about vanilla from playing it, to know what is imporant and how the game plays out, and you can only do it from the direct experince playing the game, basically from private servers atm. so if they don't consult with like ex nost guys or someone knowing shit from private servers. they for sure fuck up shit.
---
I second this! Couldn’t put it down from the moment I started.. you don’t know what to expect next and when you go deeper you’re always on edge!
---
Haha I love it! Don't let your dreams be crushed by a min/max racial though. You better be rolling dwarf and pushing for that mace even if you only get to lay claim to Gun Specialization, Stoneform, and Find Treasure!
---
I don't think housing would work in a themepark game like WoW. The world is too small for everyone to get their building, and if its instanced then that'd put people in little bubbles. 
---
Dead, friend, not dark.
---
Viper sting still affects warlocks nicely. The key to beating a lock is not letting them get a fear on you. So have to time scatter shot and Feign Death perfectly which is not to hard. They were much harder to beat than Spriests at least. 
---
I came from FFA PvP MMO's so it never bothered me anyway.  I look at it in the same way I looked at players who would invite you to group just to find out where you are on the map so they could race over to PK you.  If he was doing it just to break the language barrier and listen to the complaints fair enough.  It's a PvP game, PvP happens.
---
Arcane shot is a waste to train past rank 2/3, since you don't have pet/reliable source of damage until then. Completely useless past that.
---
Serpent Sting is pretty dope for levelling.
---
Aimed Shot is irrelevant until you get 51 and grab it.
---
Mend Pet/Aspect of the Hawk should be maxed.
---
Hunter's Mark depends if you use it or not, casting it on each mob adds up.
---
Raptor Strike is pretty useless to train past the first ranks because of the same reasons as Arcane Shot.
---
Mongoose Bite/Disengage are completely useless. Straight up skip them.
---
Wing Clip is doable with only rank 1. It's 50/55/60% slow and you can surely live with a 50% slow instead of 60%. It won't make or break a fight.
---
Viper Sting is OP in PVP and Serpent Sting is your go-to in grinding. Keep those up to max.
---
FD doesn't have a rank and it's mandatory. Frost trap isn't as good but it's only 1 rank and so useful you might as well grab it.
---
Ignite trap is worthless past the first rank to out-tag other players camping a spawn. Ditto for explosive trap.
---
Freezing Trap is important to keep up to date because it's 10/15/20s frozen.
---
Flare/Eagle Eye are extremely strong abilities, no reason to skip them.
---
Tracking is pointless outside of humanoid/beast/hidden IMO. You're not going to need giant tracking or elemental tracking. Hidden gives a bonus to stealth detection and Humanoid/Beast are useful to see incoming players as well as seeing where the mobs are before other classes.
---
Eyes of the Beast is a 4fun ability, you'll never use it outside of memes.
---
The majority of people are fine with the idea. They only ever complain when they are asked to split the bill. You could also offer to do runs at the cost of all the unwanted gear, and a few gaurenteed righteous orbs, or similar dungeon specific drops.
---
Been giving a lot of thought to making cash as a warrior. Don't really want to level another mage from 1-60.
---
If you're not fury then mace spec doesn't really matter so much.
---
There are still maces that are good for Humans too and if they had only sword spec, then they would be further limited by weapon choice, especially while leveling.
---
So because humans sometimes use maces, they get mace spec AND sword spec, and no other ally race gets a melee weapon spec? Can other races not be warriors? Why not split up the specs and give more reason to not just play humans for PvE
---
thats the thing with the combo i mentioned they don't have a chance to get a slow off if your a half decent enchance shaman you can kill any mage.
---
you seem to know your shit, any idea what the best counter-class against a similar-level rogue in wpvp is?
---
I’d say it’s less about ActiBlizz and more the industry as a whole. Look at the Metro Exodus last minute platform switch, loot boxes becoming outright illegal in some countries, increasing awareness and vocal outcries against aggressive monetization, etc. The industry is in a turbulent spot right now.
---
I swear Blizzard have said sharding will be turned off after a few days or weeks to help manage the initial flood of players?
---
It mostly involved corrupting eredaar (archimonde) and using fel orcs first time around
---
Also, I've stopped using fast travel in open world games and it's helped immensely.
---
