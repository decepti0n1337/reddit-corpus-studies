First time playing classic and idk why so many people hate desolace.

The eerie loneliness is really well done and I like the storyline between the feuding centaur clans. To top it off, you have shadowprey village which feels like a resort oasis in the middle of a wasteland.

I think Fear and Horror are on different diminishing returns too.

Hey, Ashbringer represent!

Breh, then evey addon is cheating. No one would react as fast as the DBM screaming "MOVE OUT OF FIRE" across the whole screen, even the cast bars or duration of dot-addons on mobs would be cheating considering they convey info much faster than a human would.
---
The off-hand is easy to get though.

Been playing WoW Classic on my phone (Asus ROG II) via SteamLink - play it on the train and at work, through Wifi and Mobile Data.

Never had a issue with it, takes a bit to set up but omg it's fantastic!

Using small fire protection pots in combat doesn't do all that much.

Ill be leveling with my 2 brothers who are new to wow. They'll be playing warrior and paladin, I'm trying to decide between warlock and mage. Which would be more helpful to the party? A warlock can easily summon randoms to the group for dungeons since we'll already have 3 but a mage can use portals and save the group a lot of gold with food and water
---
Just tell people that you killed the Alliance pig it used to belong to

No

100% ret, but consider respecting between 50-60. Keep a full set of healing(int) gear in your bags along with your normal Ret set. Paladins are outstanding healers and do very well healing lower level dungeons with ret spec and int gear. As for leveling, you won‚Äôt go oom if you keep wisdom up.

There are databases which have been used for private servers like [](http://classicdb.ch/) but the values are mostly guessed, especially the armor values.

For HP the addon RealMobHealth calculates it based on damage done while fighting ingame and I think it has a predefined database that grows with every version of the addon.

I occasionally level with another paladin friend. He's holy based and focused his gear for healing as his preference. I went Ret based. Believe me when I say it's a little embarrassing when SoC refuses to proc and he out damages me with SoR.

weird that people are still playing blizzards games
---
For mages on the same faction, you can simply use your cc on the mobs they are kiting. This will spread them out, which is super awkward for the mage to deal with.
---
My comment was very clearly for raiding as you don't totem twist outside group play, as enh your damage will at best be 60% of what any other pure dps classes can do. Enh is a utility class that brings significant buffs for other people. Most guilds are not trying to be min max right now because there isn't really a need to so playing enh is fine but in end game you are not ever going to be doing the dps others are.
---
It specifically states that it is a 20 vs 40 ... so you are telling me that this information is not supposed to be there to boast?^^ plus: salty? Yeah no man. Definitly not. I was just expecting something, and all i saw was a randomly cluttered brawl. I mean yeah, go classic, but why make a reddit post about it
---
Rurikar on YouTube
---
Combat is seriously noticeable. Having to worry about stealthing and positioning slows you down so much. As combat you can just run up to mobs and start attacking right away. MASSIVE time saver.
---
I do believe it will be a healthy server. It will take some time to stabilize especially with the server transfers being up.
---
Yeah it's awesome until you're suddenly stunned and covered in poisons and bleeds with no health left.
---
Horror is primal, it can‚Äôt be overcome. Fear is an emotion that certainly can be.

I did this back when I played retail. I'm forcing myself to not do it now. Basically, I'd like to at least have enough gold to fund my alt's level 40 mount, plus maybe some green gear / bags / potions. The reason being that I'd like my next character to be more relaxed, and not have to grind as much.
---
but more fun!
---
That was then, this is now. New decade new policies. People shouldn't have screamed no changes constantly if they did in fact want changes. Life sucks, grind some more.

The extra mana spent casting additional frostbolts also increases the time you need to drink every time you're oom. SP increases kill speed and mana efficiency, int really can't keep up as long as your mana pool is big enough to last for your average fight.

Molten core, 6 hunters including myself, I‚Äôm most geared by far... every pull every hunter immediately multi shots and aimed shots to try and do high dps... I wait 5 secs or so to start dpsing to tanks can build aggro, do a multi shot, every crit grabs aggro because other hunters haven‚Äôt let tanks build up aggro or feigned death at all. I‚Äôm second lowest dps and all the hunters feel fuckin great about themselves even though they‚Äôre the ones fucking around about to cause a wipe, someone has the audacity to say ‚Äúwhy is your dps lower bing? You‚Äôre usually top dps in dungeons‚Äù I reply ‚ÄúHunters, your high dps symbolizes the reason that the tanks aren‚Äôt building aggro well, you‚Äôre causing people who hit hard to grab aggro because you‚Äôre not letting tank build up before you start dumping mana for dps‚Äù highest dps hunter tells me I‚Äôm just jealous
---
I went from priest, mage, Hunter, warrior than lock. And I'm sticking with locks. The more I play the more I enjoy. Got pets, can tank, can rez, suck the souls out of things. Very dark class. What's not to love? Locks are the damage of mages (almost) the pets like Hunter the tank like warrior. So if your in between I'd def keep playing lock. It's a little of everything in one package.
---
Chances are good blizzcon will be a proper shit show.
---
I‚Äôve been having this issue as well. Mostly when I run dungeons. But occasionally out in the world. How do you check latency number? I know before there used to be a Latency number when you scroll over the PC icon in Options bar. But it doesn‚Äôt seem to be there in classic.
---
To your edit: yeah, cause that's what the guy you replied to stated the problem as. Your answer is correct if calculating the chance of 3 rolls being exactly 1 though.

wow...fugly ...but kinda cool
---
I mean... yeah noone likes loosing gear, but I don‚Äôt think it was unfair in this situation. They rolled for it and they lost, it happens. Most guilds would‚Äôve had them reserved anyway, and reserving them for rogues in the guild while rading with non-guild warriors would‚Äôve been even worse imo.

I killed the earth elemental guys in silithus for 2.5 hours a few days ago without a single drop.  Air elemental guys in the same area were far more forgiving.  I hate farming these things.  Absolutely hate it.

I was soloing the other night doing this same quest.   I had been there for about 30 minutes killing em all and needed only 2 more.   Enter these troll mages.   They come in and start AoEing them.   I ask in /s if they're doing the same quest.   They ignore me.   So I charge, intercept, and run to the next three.  Well they say wow and start spitting on me as they watch me die.  I whispered one and he told me that I deserve to die for doing the same thing they were doing.

Considering much of the BiS stuff drops in raids how does that even make sense as a question?

is it really that unbelievble? if i was going to do that level of effort, it should be more fantastical imo
---
I started farming it a few days after I hit 60. I was the only one killing the mobs for about a week so it was pretty relaxing. It was a good way to grind money and leather early on. I was thinking i would get one in a few days tops, but 3 weeks, 4 dragonlings, 8 robes, 30+ arcane prots later, still nothing. Bought mine for 400g which is honestly overpaying, but it just turned in to an obsession and I had to stop myself.
---
Got to 47, and I‚Äôm strongly considering making an alt. There‚Äôs something in me that simply cannot stick to just one character for so long. To be honest, as long as you‚Äôre having fun in the moment, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you are doing.

Hi! Just wanted to say that I've been using your macro from the first day I saw the post (probably the day you posted it because I'm on this sub daily) and I absolutely love it! I did however tweak a few things to my liking and I wanted to share them

/equip Big Iron Fishing Pole

---
/console Sound\_EnableSFX 5 
---
I changed the name of the lure to the bag slot since I never move them, and at the time i had a few different lures I was burning through. The other change I made was adding some additional lines to turn sound effects back on after closing the static pop up window. Your version was turning off my sfx and I couldnt hear the bobber splash when I caught a fish. With the exception of 1 fishing run, I havent had any problems with sfx turning back on once I added the extra lines.
---
Anyways, thanks for making the best fishing macro I've seen to date, you rock.
---
All good points haha. Just looking for something different, you read my mind.

Making 50-75g/day but have made 8k already? I call horseshit.

Silent bids makes people group up in secret to bid low in class gear, to have enough dkp for multiclass gear

Is it possible to solo brd arena as a hunter? Was thinking i kill the mobs spawned and just reset and run out if it isnt ghoros.

Im MM btw so thats why im wondering, BM would probably be pretty easy.
---
Beautimous. Thank you for the new megathread and keeping this subreddit clean of the trash happening elsewhere.

You don‚Äôt need to invade thunder bluff just blockade it and they‚Äôll run out of resources. I suppose you could use zeppelins and stuff to deliver supplies but if we use that route than the alliance could use zeppelins or dwarven wildhammer clan to attack also

If this is your metric of unfair advantage, lets cross all the other things off the list that are unfair advantages, such as:
---
Having more free time to play than other people
---
Having more skill at the game than other people
---
Having more friends in game than other people
---
etc etc
---
You can cry kick and scream all you want. This isn't cheating. this isn't against TOS. Carry on whinging in life.

Sure I've got alts. I'm a level 56 druid with a level 5 mage (bank/auction alt), level 5 rogue (cloth alt), level 5 Hunter (bank alt), level 1 warrior (bank alt), level 1 shaman (haven't even logged into this character). That's what you meant right?
---
Warriors can AOE fear and we have charge.
---
Because receiving info that you have enemy rogue around won‚Äôt make any difference on how you behave and how much attention you pay to your surroundings? Are you even for real?
---
Is there a reason why edgemasters are considered BiS for nonhuman/orc or am I reading this wrong? Isn't it not worth it to go above 307 weapon skill?
---
Obviously I meant pre raid bis..
---
FD + Jumpers alone is reason enough to raise engie on a hunter, it's saved at least a few wipes.
---
"There's a level cap, so I WILL catch up to you"

Any chance you got a good link for steps to setting this up?

It has.  The classic we wanted didn‚Äôt happen because cheaters were allowed to do this, kept the things they cheated toget, and only had a minor ban.

It‚Äôs a shit show, but since it didn‚Äôt upset the Chinese, they could care less.

I am also curious about this as a frost mage.
---
I do have Scorch and I use it as a quick single-target damage spell if I need to finish something off faster than I can cast an Icebolt, and if both Cone of Cold and Fireblast are on cooldown. Scorch has come in handy sometimes.
---
But I dont have any hard data to prove it or if there is another more useful spell for this kind of thing.

---
Sorry, I can only go based on what you said, not what you were thinking.
---
Well 20-40ish enh two handed with wf or rockbiter is best for kiting and the pure damage you can output with the 2h axes available too you
---
Loot Council was always a thing that *some* guilds did, but IMO unless you're a very tight knit group of players that don't  bring in many outsiders, its super biased and unfair.  Even when I was in a guild of mostly friends who did loot council I didn't like it as a loot system.
---
What I recall being more popular was DKP (Dragon kill points) which everyone who participated in raids earned at the same rate, then you spent X amount of points to buy an item (usually whoever bidded the most).  If you won, you get that DKP removed from your total, and the other bidders lose nothing.
---
Warlocks are by far the coolest imo. My first character I ever made was a warlock and that was going to be what I played in classic, but my rl went warlock so I didn‚Äôt. He hit 60 like 12 days after launch lol he yells at me for bsing with all of these alts
---
I'll buy a maccaw, I'm buying pets now while people are more focused on bis gear and mounts so I can have expensive pets that I payed very little for
---
that addon should straight up be banned IMO
---
Use it when you need a quick cast.
---
Not exactly what you asked for but I highly recommend the harpies in NW Feralas once you are ~48. Lots of mobs there and they all have caster like low HP values while most don't even seem to be using special skills.
---
Please don‚Äôt give these morons a voice here... This subreddit is supposed to be for posts about Classic WoW, not Hong Kong or boycotting Blizzard... There are plenty of other subs for that starting with r/politics... Furthermore, open the door with allowing the Hong Kong stuff to be actively discussed here, how can you not allow discussions about other political matters, such as the 2020 Presidential elections... Candidates that want to break up big companies is relevant when discussing Activision-Blizzard... Candidates that want to ban violent content in video games is relevant... It‚Äôs a huge can of worms that‚Äôs being opened here...
---
we had the same problem, 1 member of our group could not loot the skull, after setting loot ffa and returning later to kill him once more, he got the skull
---
That's awesome

I‚Äôm going to go full consumer this time, and not cancel my subscription. In my ignorance, I simply don‚Äôt give a damn, neither about the outrage nor Hong Kong itself.

Human rights and freedom of speech? Cool, sure, but better check where your shoes were made.

Its likely that those players came from ESO where its quite common to guild to charge weekly membership dues.
---
Classic WoW has been their best idea in recent history. Everything else has been crap. Case in point: Diablo, the mobile game.

Why do you have so many bank alts? Do you not utilize your mailbox and sending back and forth? Maybe I‚Äôm too lazy to use more than one, idk

Wait, you‚Äôre not even gonna tell me to go to retail or something? I‚Äôve totally expected that since you provided zero arguments other than ‚Äúlearn to play loooool‚Äù.
---
Ashbringer-Eu horde side anyone?
---
it's useful in pvp
---
For the threat part I think you're thinking of Searing Pain.  
---
As for OP, in very specific situations you'll need it, like when something counterspells you (like Shazzrah or those asshole mobs in Scholo that CS you for 15 seconds)  
---
But yeah, highly situational.
---
yea got a 54 warrior as "main" but at this level, questing as prot is just painful, rolled a warlock to lvl 25 , got a mage to 20, a priest to 10 and a rogue in the making. i guess im gonna use them as craftslaves once they hit lvl 35 and finish my main to 60. Im having fun doing it so i dont think much about it
---
Classic WOW isn't about having anything FAIR across the classes. If this is what you are looking for, move on, ubsub from this sub and move on with your life. The game is 15 years old and all this is known. What a dumb fucking question.
---
You use it in pvp a lot and some rare cases in raids to min max damage.
---
When I see a horde hunter taming some rare mobs I always kill the mob first and then the hunter. They deserve it.
---
In world pvp you are kinda fucked. Even if you see them coming, it will be hard to stop them.
---
Key to killing undead Rogues is seeing them first, forcing them to blow cooldowns, particularly vanish and cloak of shadows. If I had to bust those early in an engagement I would just leave or be a dick and stalk you until my CDs came back or you were otherwise vulnerable.
---
When BGs release, you have backup, and pvp specific gear, the tables turn a bit, but even then we had to watch out for our clothies.
---
What‚Äôs the copy &amp; paste for yelling that in orcish?
---
If by ‚Äúpower‚Äù you mean paying for a subscription, then sure
---
Hit 60 other day, most of the way to an epic mount, got to quest and play the game without thousands of people contesting every mob.
---
Personally layering benefited me greatly and hasn‚Äôt hurt my experience at all.
---
I'm very tired and thought you said "and blows a hole in my crotch" ... either works I guess.
---
50/75g on my alt character, that i spend 15 mins on per day. My main is where i make most of my money, this is my side business....

Lower your voice.
---
This. I‚Äôll easily take on 4-5 mobs my level with evasion + blade flurry + sweeping strikes. If I don‚Äôt get lucky with Crits I can easily blind &amp; gouge 2 of them to heal back up but they‚Äôre usually dead extremely quick. And it‚Äôs only a 2 minute cd.
---
In addition  in to that riposte is insane. I always fight minimum 2 adds at once to proc it faster. 1 riposte hits HARD  and disarms so I‚Äôm dealing insane damage while mitigating how much (if any) I take back.

Thanks for the info, that cleared up most of my confusion.

Sorry if this is a really dumb question lol I've been playing Classic since it launched, but prior to that I'd last played around Naxx getting released (I guess in TBC?) so a lot of stuff is really fuzzy still.
---
The way you explained it, it sounds like it won't work to let you drink for mana while you're already in combat? Like during a dungeon while the group is fighting, quickly heal/drink to regen mana while still being in combat?
---
Its always good to strive for BiS.
---
Ideally, I'd hang onto both. If you're in a situation where you don't anticipate having any issues, I'd equip the + shadow damage gear. If you're going to be in a tougher area, or maybe fighting some elites, I'd go with the + stamina.
---
Just like how the layer exploit was and how no one got banned except for some fake ban posts that reddit ate up? There would be no chance of any action taken unless maybe in a really extreme case, so grief away, gamers.

Protip: The reason that rule says "Real world politics" is because nobody ever thought Blizzard was gonna embroil themselves in real world politics.

Blocking out discussion of Blizzard's actions in whatever form they take really shouldn't be part of this.

Yes, the addition of Distracting Dagger and Mugger's Belt help dagger rogues a lot.     
---
For now, dagger rogue is totally fine in MC, and very strong if you get your hands on perditions blade especially.    
---
However, under perfectly even circumstances, a rogue with viskag/brut will always outperform perdition/core hound tooth.
---
"fake" cast scorch on a class than can interrupt a "school" of magic (ie:fire) and that opens you up to unload frost/ or that person needs to eat your scorch
---
1/10 troll
---
For dungeons and pre-raid, i think it doesn't really matter what spec you are - sure you can optimise, but unless you are doing timed runs for Deathchargers reins (the skeletal horse that drops off baron - requires a sub 40-minute run iirc) then i wouldn't worry.
---
Although, be open to input from the people you run with. Run a dps meter - I use details, it's quite good to gauge howyou are comparing with the other dps as well.
---
Void cannot tank, so really only good for sac bubble.
---
I was just caught off guard is all.  I think he was not happy to come a mithril node being mined by someone else.
---
Season 4 was great idk what you're talking about
---
This would be pretty funny to make a transmog out of in retail lol.
---
Obviously hunters can't be engineers. They're like always busy hunting and stuff, with arrows and pets. No time to go to college and learn engineering. Duh.
---
So, I'm leveling a alt rogue right now. I already have a 60 hunter with herb/skinning. My question is which account should i give engineering? I may end up making the rogue my main later on due to hunter scaling, but hunters are so good with engineering. Doing both pvp and raids. So what do I do?
---
Warlock can beat any class, insanely strong in vanilla and will just get better the more gear u get, summons, soulstone, needed for raids and easy to get into groups playing solo, also undead warlock is very cool and suitable.
---
Game prob consists of 60% mages right now, i dont see the appeal.
---
If you are a rogue, your global cooldown is 1 sec for all class abilites, but since blood fury is a racial the global cooldown will be the regular 1,5sec.
---
But dont hold my name to it as i havent done any testing.
---
But even when you get to Ony and MC it seems most dps warrior and OT are fury?
---
Just get WW axe
---
You can absolutely kill people who use this addon if they don‚Äôt care enough, it just makes it harder, cause much more people use addon with simple ui other than reading combat log. 
---
Once you I get the notification the only thing I have to do is smash my TAB. I can target you and attack first before you get in melee range for ambush/CS. Your actions now, smartass?
---
Relax pal
---
I actually think this is really cool.
---
Omg lolol. Genius
---
Harming my family, my ketamine addiction is.
---
Care I do not
---
I would consider somone using 1 keaboard split between 2 computers/instances of the game to be cheating if a single key press causes each character to do an action at the same time. Controlling more than one character simultaneously IMO is cheating. If you are physically switching between characters control, then I don't see an issue with it at that point. One person per character at any given time.
---
It's also the uncertainty of classic. Will the game die after phase 6, will they do classic+, will they do TBC? If you don't know the answer to that question, then are you really going to buy an expensive item that has no practical use at all?
---
I am the type that likes to rewatch a series when its been completed, but this will just piss me off at every turn knowing that they eternally fucked it all up. All the great moments and great conflicts and what ifs with our favorite characters literally means nothing when you've seen the end of the show. I keep telling myself I may watch it again someday, but its going to be a long fucking time from now. And im sure when and if I ever try again im gonna get to parts and be like "welp this is fucking stupid, i know where this goes....NOWHERE!" Like legit the end was so bad that I dont think I can ever make it through this show again. Whats even more sad is this show was a pop culture icon world wide which could've been remembered as something great, but as I said above history will forget about GoT because of the ending because of how absolutely shit it was to the fans and the actors. THe only fucks who actually liked the ending were those no talent hacks D&amp;D...Rant over.
---
it should work exactly how it worked in vanilla 
---
im not paying for classic+
---
Can do Molten Core, and tank dungeons etc.
---
Thralls Resolve (Tank princess reward) is pretty mediocre on warriors but prebis for Druids due to the large chunk of armor
---
Yea you can need anything in classic, that doesn‚Äôt mean you should, but they give you the option
---
Just go sit at the edge of a fatigue zone in the ocean somewhere
---
Wonder how this got so many upvotes. Fuck Blizzard
---
someone explain how this is funny or interesting or whatever? am i missing something?
---
These kids only know how to look at what can be measured on a spreadsheet. It's a common failing of modern people. They don't know how to consider second order effects.
---
That is built into the game and is not as powerful as external software doing macros in this nature. The game's macro system cant control multiple characters at the exact same time. That is the difference.
---
YMMV is the reason why it's hard to answer.
---
Essentially though, when you find yourself not able to heal effectively is when you should start thinking about switching. I would wait until I'm hitting a wall where no matter how good the other players are, I can't heal them.
---
But that's a bit mean on the group.
---
TBF, if your failing to heal &gt;50% of the time, (probably lower) then switch.
---
Not like this guy above me! Yeah!
---
I get to send my enemies in that corpse run, that‚Äôs all that I need to make my corpse runs more bearable.  That  whoever killed me will have one or more of their own soon.   
---
I don‚Äôt get how someone can happily grind the same mobs as the other faction side by side.  Not being able to murder horde would undermine the most basic understanding I have about this game.
---
No you don't even have to be 60, just have a full set of blues that aren't &gt;50 and you'll be fine
---
If u are a priest. Go to the corner and 
---
/target gor
---
Then use mind vision and you can look for jed patting. If he isnt found by the end of mind vision i /target jed a couple times for good measure
---
I‚Äôve pondered the idea of a main spec roll/dkp hybrid. Award a single point for attendance and per boss kill. If an item drops you want, /roll. You can then add to your roll with the points. 
---
For example, if you roll a 50 for an item and highest roll is 60, you can use your points to win (if you have at least 11). Using a points on a roll resets your points to 0, regardless. Winning with roll alone doesn‚Äôt affect points. 
---
I‚Äôm not a raid leader or anything, just thought a MSRoll+ system might be neat. Thoughts?
---
Hunter, I gotta find a way to average 30-35k an hour to achieve this. Ideally I'll also have all my dungeon quests queed up for 59 and Sunday night when I can finally run dungeons
---
If a group gets the kicks by hanging up on a single character then I think they are fine with a bubble hearth because it waists way more time for the paladin than a corpse run does.
---
My thought as well. Bioshock!
---
Where you been the last 5+ years?
---
"We've heard our female employees," he said. "And my daughter tools me out about it. She saw a World of Warcraft cinematic of the Dragon Aspects, and my daughter was like, 'Why are they all in swimsuits?' And I was like, 'I don't know. I don't know anymore.'" - Chris Metzen
---
Good to know. Without epics in the mix, how do they compare? Will Distracting Dagger + (No idea what would go in main hand) beat out Dal'rend's or is it outclassed?
---
I believe I did the first 3 of his quests. They were great. I don't mind grinding I've just heard at this point it's not really efficient without quests.
---
I just looted Papal Fez. What's the minimum I should sell it for?
---
Sub/assassin rogue with engineering will be godly in PvP
---
Here's some friendly advice: Don't project your ideology onto a fucking video game. Blizzard is not a platform to spread your or anyone's agenda, they're a video game company.
---
Look up 'spell coefficients'. Every spell gets a certain amount of benefit from +damage depending on how long the duration or cast time is. 
---
tldr you mostly get the full benefit, so if you have +100 shadow damage and your corruption usually does 200 damage over 18 seconds, now it does 300 damage over 18 seconds. If your drain life usually does 100 dmg and 100 healing over 5 seconds, now it does 150 dmg and 150 healing. Obviously this is really good. Things die faster, you heal more from your drains, you level faster, you are happy. 
---
On the other hand int and stam are not so good. There's basically no fights where you actually need that extra HP and mana.  Exception is PvP, where you want all the stamina. 
---
To answer your specific question, I'd use the +9 damage offhand.
---
Damn.
---
Its not a thing unless they are footing the bill for everything involved in running the raid, like repairs, potions, consumables and guaranteeing an even loot distribution, and even then 30 gold seems excessive for that.
---
Did you read what i wrote? thats my ALT character, im not including any of the gold i made on my main, which is about 85% of my total income. This thorium thing is small potatoes.
---
You aren't very smart are you...
---
I've been thinking that it would be cool to design a teamwork meter addon that measures things like spell interrupts, buffs, cleanses, decurses, battle res, soulstone, even things like mage water. Wouldn't be perfect but you could have a post-raid display of all those things and show the value of someone beyond what they do on the easy to measure DPS meters. Of course I don't know how much of that data the game would send to a client, but it sure would be cool.
---
it can tank 1-2 mobs. Especially if you kill the mobs within 2-4 shadowbolts.
---
Quissy and Pastaface on twitch did duo leveling as warrior and pally in the beta as well as the actual launch of classic, I‚Äôd watch their videos and see how they roll at a higher level
---
Honestly, what ever you want to do. There isn't a right answer or frankly a reason why both couldn't be engineering. Engineering is generally great for the use of the character in PvP and possible PvE, not specifically for all your accounts like herbalism is.
---
int only provides max mana pool and spell crit.
---
As a warlock you have a lot of dots and dots cannot crit.
---
Ya I used to visit r/asoiaf all the time but started going less and less until I eventually stopped
---
People like you are the reason I learned how to swim in lava the first time around.
---
You're performing a public service, really.
---
Because the whole premise of this thread is discussing a situation where there were only pug tanks, no guild tanks.
---
He can offtank if there‚Äôs 2 mobs and you don‚Äôt wanna fear, like maybe near a murloc camp where 1 fear might equal 12 mobs
---
I'm a recovering altoholic. Originally in vanilla I leveled a hunter to 50 then a mage to 47. Finally ended up with a level 60 warlock and druid. 
---
I rolled warlock this time around with no alt cravings so far. But I'm only level 33 atm (started 2 weeks late).
---
your not the only one lol everyone gets this
---
Go deep prot - that'll be different at least.
---
Also, go DW - it'll be different.
---
Not efficient. Not effective. But different. 
---
Personally, roll an alt if you are feeling a little bit bored. Have them take up professions that can help your main i.e. if you have BS and mining, have them take up mining + gathering prof as well. Then, if you like em and get em to 60, you can drop mining on one of them and take up another crafting prof.
---
I don't care about stats and faction for this choice, only looks and class fantasy...
---
Female human warlock vs. Male undead warlock?
---
Go read the first line of your post. Your say you made max 75g/day doing this and then also said you made &gt;1300 g in 2 weeks using this method. Your math doesn't make any sense.
---
I played an Orc Shaman until level 50. Just switched to a Dwarf Paladin and I'm a lot happier. Level 21 atm :)
---
I can't really agree.
---
While I agree with the kid's message about HK, I also agree with Blizzard's punishment of the kid. The kid used the wrong platform to voice his message.
---
That being said... It's best to have a single megathread for this so that it doesn't infect the rest of the subreddit.
---
You are paying for retail,tecnically classic is free.
---
Drugs are bad kids
---
you can be polite and say
---
≈† 1 √á√ç 11 √Ä 3 1 p
---
Weapon normalisation is only referring to white dmg right?
---
But the yellow dmg is based off the high-end dmg?
---
Honestly as a druid If you can just kite a priest that's most effective. We have no real way to increase our movespeed outside of that watch trinket. We probably won't chase you. Just kite us. Run us out of mana. Root us to put a second worth of distance between us and force us to waste mana on a dispel. Once we are out of mana we don't have many - if any - options
---
Ask a subjective question, get a subjective answer.
---
It‚Äôs ok today I still love you I‚Äôm sorry they banned your subreddit
---
Well I'm a dad so my shoes are New Balance and made in the USA.
---
apparently immortal has been play ready for over 6 months if not longer so im guessing they scrapped it.
---
like sure i can see blizz waiting for a good release time but not like years
---
i do miss back in the day when there was excitement about blizzard releases , classic is the only thing on the launcher i give a shit about
---
Protip: You have to be in charge of a big business that answers to shareholders before you could ever understand the responsibility of having to make decisions in the best interest of the company... They didn‚Äôt involve themselves in real world politics, they removed themselves from being involved with real world politics by disassociating with an affiliate that used his platform created by his association with Blizzard to declare his stance putting them in a position to risk losing an entire market segment, or cut ties... Their responsibility is to the shareholders who provide the investment for them to operate, period... Expecting them to take a side in something that, frankly, is not their business is completely inappropriate and irrational...
---
100% mount + carrot on a stick
---
It's okay lol, I was just a lurker
---
TRAITOR
---
Yes. Disenchanting doesn't have skill requirements.
---
This person's attitude is whats wrong with the world.
---
I am crying! Love everything about this.
---
That is not true. It does not show you enemies that are stealthed. 
---
The addon uses information available to you in your combat log. It can only alert you to a rogue if they cast stealth when you‚Äôre near enough for it to register in your combat log. 
---
It‚Äôs a cheap add on, and I‚Äôd love to see it killed by blizz. No need to spread misinformation though.
---
This is literally like shopping in clearance at a clothing store ahaha
---
The Chinese government has killed over 50 million, thats 50,000,000 of their own ethnic group since the Communist party came into power.
---
Has anyone noticed the trinket to be buggy?  Each time the trinket chimes, people start dancing for a few seconds, then stop, over and over...was it like that in vanilla?
---
Aw man, non boycott posts from blizzard subreddits are hitting the front page again...
---
Honestly and truthfully wish these hongkong spergs would fuck off to another place and leave wow to us who want to play and discuss it. We get it your offended but dont try to make us feel offended with you because not everyone shares the same opinions or have the same thresh hold on what makes us take our business elsewhere.
---
If your going to quit then do it but your not brave or outspoken or going against society by letting us all know that your quitting a fucking video game lol. The time it took to write this blizzard already made a shit ton of money so your subs won't be missed, blizzard won't suddenly collapse and wow will still remain online. So go do something that will actually make a difference if you honestly care about this situation.
---
quite frankly posting on a reddit post or the blizzard forums #Hongkong or #FreeHK does nothing but atleast you can stroke your ego's and pretend you helped make a change right??
---
And before you downvote assuming im against the Hongkong situation im not but I dont preach my morales and expect everyone else to jump on board because your beliefs arent facts they are your beliefs and opinions so make sure you do it in the correct place instead of plaguing us who really don't give a fuck about the blizzard situation.
---
You can all downvote me but you all know damn well im right with you thinking by making some 30 second reddit post China will suddenly back off from the HK situation your deluding yourselves and basically turning every forum into a circle jerk.
---
Eh? Reserve groups are doing the same content, they're just making things a bit more efficient for themselves. Buying BiS isn't 'paying to win', you're still participating in the economy somehow.
---
And you dare suggest such a thing as a loyal member of the alliance??!!!!! (jk of course haha)
---
I think dal rend outclasses, the +daggers isn't going to make as much of a difference compared to the attack power from the set bonus
---
I was chugging along at 49 but slowing down a bit, then blizzard sucking China's dick made me hit a brick wall.
---
I don't know if I even want to continue playing the remaining months I have on my 6mo sub.
---
I was going to make my decision based on Blizzard's response, but they've been silent so far, which is not acceptable to me.
---
you can quest 1 - 60 without dungeons so the answer to this is also YES! :)
---
Same can be said for grinding, and you can spend exactly as much time as you want doing that.
---
The attacking speed matters, you don‚Äôt have to fill it to the brim
---
Same.
---
And now go name your pet Catamine! Go, go, be a good hunter and make an original pun.
---
I'm sorry you are in a known ninja guild :(
---
&gt; without this retarded logic
---
It's called *me ne frego* and it's when you let Mussolini silence everyone he wants.

But Tauren milk doesnt spoil i heard...
---
Sigh, I thought with how much we are going back and forth you would have figured that out yet. Its getting to the point with people who like you have shit opinions on what "its all about" thats my thing I live for. Getting you to hit that ignore is the part of the game I love. Yes I realize you may forget or whatever but hey I had fun :) btw your analogy is shit because we dont need one. You are in the wilderness killing monsters and someone who is from your faction asks to group with you to aid each other. Thats what actually happens so no analogy is needed or warranted. Stop trying to change the topic... I get it dottie,,,,,,your a loner....a  rebel....well the dam one player games are out there and thats what my tell is going to say in all caps or something. I should make a macro ooooor you know whats funny I am almost exsluvily leveling in a group of real life friends so I never even see invites from others just people using /s to ask us so /shrug.
---
A week ago I had 2 runs in a row where this happened and in the 3rd run the OH dropped. Truestrikes in 1 of those runs, Reed in two of them. lol
---
Wow another fire mage, we are a rare breed these days. But I'm still going frost after level 40 ish. But fire at 60 for pvp is underrated, super Pyro macro shots are fun.
---
You can see the issue however you like... The fact is, it‚Äôs your choice if you want to boycott a company that makes video games backseat they didn‚Äôt tell China to go to hell... I, for one, will not cancel my account and will continue to log into the game every day... Millions of others will join me in doing so... You can protest all alone if you like, or you can go and do something that will actually make a difference if you care enough to do so...
---
Casuals.. The most pathetic scum on earth..
---
Ive probably seen 5+ people in /gchat saying ‚Äùthis is getting too far im deleting my character‚Äù, understandable and you gotta respect it considering how addictive and fun wow can be.
---
I swear to god you're mentally handicapped and cannot read or comprehend words, and you think im ESL?
---
  
---
LOL
---
Ignored and blocked. Nice troll man.
---
I feel your pain.  Back on Nost my druid had Healing, Dungeon Tanking, Raid Tanking, Fire-Resist, DPS, Open-World, PvP...
---
Meh. I look at it like this...
---
All it basically does is confines them all to this one jail thread that isn't gumming up the subreddit with more political threads, and it gives my report button a great workout reporting posts that break Rule 5.
---
But how can you say 0.5% DPS matters? And it's not about filling it to the brim, it's about sacrificing 25% of your bag space
---
yo...
---
I've been in the same boat. My advice really is to stick with it, it'll come around eventually. Also, getting a +5 mining enchant on any random gloves will help you push over the skill tresholds.
---
Yeah, no xp from battlegrounds. They eventually added it and it was hilarious to see the people who spent thousands of gold on their twinks so they could win without having to be skilled crying and crying.
---
So would you rather those people make a bunch of threads polluting the subreddit or just post in this one thread?  Not sure what you really want here.
---
I hear your opinion but mine is different and that's fine. I think it's fun to play as warrior Terrybruise. My rogue Bobfloss is fun AF for me. I'm bored of playing as Kiffen and nothing about that affects anyone elses ability to play the game or their immersion.
---
It's not about attention for me. I get to giggle to myself about it. Just because you playing under some weird name would be seeking attention doesn't mean it is for me. Stuff your ideas of a real name in a sack, mister.
---
No, it won‚Äôt be banned because it just uses information your combat log. You can set up chat windows that share the exact same info and alerts with you as the addon, lol.
---
I'm as loyal as a goblin. :P
---
I‚Äôll +1 that, I guess...
---
been playing blizzard games since 1995. not so weird that i check back once in a while.
---
I usemy mail box. I was storing enchanting mats for awhile to powerlever to SHoTM. I've got so much stuff I'm saving for when there's more gold in the economy though. Like alot. So Im trying to use the alts to keep it organized.
---
No the retarded logic is getting genuinely upset that a company did something you don't like. Pretty tragic to get upset over something that in the grand scheme of things with the Hongkong riots means nothing and makes zero difference to that situation at all.
---
Ima rename him that lol thanks for the name bro
---
I think if you don't kill *any* mobs outside ones you need for quests and don't do dungeon quests, you will find yourself a little short of 60 with no quests left to do.
---
Is the Dal Rend's better than Felstriker for rogues?
---
Again tab only works if you are visible anyways. Stop licking peoples noses.
---
what
---
Not really a unique place but a way to do a known place better:
---
Demonslayer + Demonslaying Weapon Enchant 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=13044 + https://classicdb.ch/?item=11208
---
This allows for better farming of Demons for warriors and works are a low level.
---
Crossroads, in the barrens
---
Unless blizz decides to completely break the functionality of the combat log, the addon isn‚Äôt going away. All it does is parse the combat log.
---
Horde being retarded, nothing new here.
---
Don't let that guy get you down. You are listening to your conscience and your inner conflict is important. I noticed that since this event happened, I have felt like cancelling until they either come out and clarify their stance once and for all or just ignore it. Should they choose to continue down this path I will be adding blizz to my boycott list, something I never thought would happen.
---
Right on
---
Wow, that really sucks. I never finished this quest chain on my hunter because BC came out and the bow became more or less obsolete.
---
I would rather see them banned from r/classicwow myself, but I‚Äôm not a mod, I‚Äôm just a regular that cares about the content of the sub...
---
It‚Äôs interesting some of the responses are that they‚Äôd never find me and some say they‚Äôd find you within 3-4 hours.
---
Oh, trust me. Fun is my middle name.
---
&gt;So over the past 2 weeks I've been selling thorium bars in the goblin AH   totaling profits over 1332g by selling single stacks for roughly 3-4x   market value. I make anywhere from 50-75g per day doing this.
---
How is this not saying you made 1332 g by selling thorium at 75g/day max?
---
Like, I don't know what is going on aside from this being a likely troll thread.
---
I did this fine for a long time and nobody ever complained.  Say it clearly at the start of the run and then follow your commitment. 
---
That said, if you win a great tanking item then it‚Äôd be a dick move to roll on DPS too.  Rolling for two roles isn‚Äôt the same as rolling for DPS. 
---
That said, you can make groups with only casters bc you‚Äôre the bottleneck in groups.
---
 [https://imgur.com/gallery/ogRs2](https://imgur.com/gallery/ogRs2)
---
Yo, how do I sign up for this?
---
Mmk well I guess you can join one of those guilds, plenty of em.
---
But to me, wanting gear for yourself over the main tank is the selfish play.  You are taking away from the group as a whole, for the individual. You are saying "I want gear for myself and it doesn't matter if the tank does sub par threat and the DPS have to throttle themselves" - thus making your entire raid do less damage and spend more time doing these 'easy raids'.  
---
Gearing out a dps warrior over your tank is actually pointless aside from just showing off gear, because like I said that warrior won't actually be able to use his full potential without pulling aggro.
---
I played with thotpatrol on the beta. Youve seen him in some highlights probably. He likes to try and kill streamers but fails mostly
---
No add ons
---
Great spell for pushback in pvp
---
That is exactly what happens!
---
Swords do magically become better when on humans vs gnomes.  Axes magically become better on orcs vs anything.   They have +5 weapon skill racial passives.  
---
I agree with you about the rest.
---
They didn't take a side.
---
They punished someone for attempting to turn a video game tournament into a political soapbox.
---
What was said is completely irrelevant. He violated the competition rules, he was punished for it, as he should have been.
---
Which "side" he used in that violation is completely irrelevant.
---
You can be full pre-raid BiS at 57 lmfao.
---
Race alone means racial passives which are not nothing.
---
Excellent.
---
Barman shanker is probably one of the better mainhand daggers to get, I think there's also some boe's that I dont remember the name of.   
---
Human dalrend rogue will win out assuming no RNG unluckiness. As far as horde, dagger is obviously closer. It can really be a toss up, but swords just has more going for it most of the time.
---
&gt; I simply don‚Äôt give a damn
---
The face of what you just said: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/47/Benito_Mussolini_crop.jpg
---
Me ne frego
---
I‚Äôd say no shadowmeld in the spirit of the hypo.
---
‚ÄúJust don‚Äôt be in front of the person trying to detect you‚Äù. Because they‚Äôll totally be standing still facing one direction. Really helpful advice.
---
You'll get bigger quivers eventually and your dps will scale based on gear.  Your pets dps will never change for its level.
---
Quivers are more important for bows and non-engineers.  While the bonus is good and will help kill things faster, it's not a substantial difference for your current level.
---
Literally only you can see that.
---
I r PVP warrior, he just dismisses the fact of a real fight because of a term. Hehe
---
You‚Äôre missing the point completely.
---
All of the data that spy presents is coming from the combat log and /target.
---
Mother of God, there I am!
---
GET OFF MY LAWN
---
Wtf man
---
I think you answered your own question.  Don‚Äôt use an ammo pouch if you don‚Äôt think it provides a benefit to you.  Though, I‚Äôm such the higher level you get, depending on your talent build, that 10-15 percent increase will mean more than it does at level 22.
---
Oh, that makes more sense.
---
He sounds really bad.
---
I consider it making WOW pay to win, and kind of make the person doing it seem anti social cuz they permanently have a full party of themselves. I enjoy soloing content, I'm the type the sees suggested players 3 and says "yeah that 3 is going to be a 1" but honestly even I recognize sometimes you need others around, and they can be fun to talk with. I joined a Battlefront on live and spent the first 10 min quoting the internets impersonation of British speak with a few ppl, you know the whole, "you 'avin yourself a giggle m8."
---
To really experience most all quests in this game, you have to start as Orc / Troll, Tauren, Undead, Gnome/Dwarf, and Night Elf, all on different characters, and progress naturally and locally through zones. Even night elves tend to skip Kalimdor and go straight to Elwynn or something. Kalimdor is practically Horde-only pre level 30.
---
But to me that is more fun and interesting than grinding for purple gear over and over on a single character. And it's fun to try out different classes and races and play both factions.
---
And yes, some areas lend themselves much more to Alliance or Horde, even the contested zones. Alliance actually have low level quests in The Barrens but you'll barely see anyone going there at all.
---
Ma plays a rogue, that's awesome
---
How? I tried to use the latest version and got spammed with LUA errors, had to disable it
---
Don't need to. Simply preclude the circumstances that cause the imbalance on certain servers and players will adapt, e.g. they would pick Alliance because Horde login queues would be unpalatable.
---
Do you know who owns hearthstone and who owns classic?
---
Standing up for your principals and attempting to do the right thing, even only on occasion, is better than not doing it at all. 
---
We don't need to fix the world all at once, every little bit helps.
---
Please make a video, would love to see it
---
Well done!
---
You're wrong, and should never give your opinions on Wow
---
Pointing out a error is not trying to make you seem dumb. Stop whining and realise you made a mistake
---
I In some cases get more skill points from green recipies than I do yellow sucks but it's a thing. As far as I am aware it's, orange 100% yellow 66% green 33% but you can roll a 3 sided dice 15 times and roll a 1 every time doesn't mean the dice is broken crafting is too small a sample size if you crafted 50 or 60 of the same thing and didn't get a level then maybe and even then I would ask for more data, but from 10-20 Your sample is definitely too small
---
The leper gnomes have mechanical spider tanks and we get robotic ostriches..
---
Human doesn't actually matter all that much. You already have 305 skill as combat which is the most important number. You just a minor increase to glancing blow damage.

But that's not an enjoyable activity to me, sitting at nessy doing essentially nothing instead of doing something else or playing another game. That to me is just not playing the game. I'm an adult with responsibilities, I need to min max my game time man.

The gold at lvl 40 thing is simple, Make a warlock and paly on ally side lol free mounts for both

I'm on Deviate Delights as well! I love this!

You used to be able to see your characters and gear on the official WoW site where they have the forums etc.

Probably still can, just log in with your normal wow account and see

edit: armory was added in BC so it is not and will not be in classic.
---
Dude what is this post? Shut the fuck up.
---
Shamans just kite them around in a circle, frost shock, searing totem, boom boom

Fuck the horde on Sulfuras. Spineless whelps. Always need a group or a 10 level lead.

Must had ordered from wish.com

Same thing happened to me a few weeks ago.
---
I had someone in Durotar spam invite my lvl 10 hunter while I was killing my last two harpies for a quest. After I declined them 3 times, they whispered me some angry BS, /slapped me and blocked me before I could even reply. The irrational anger is ridiculous sometimes lol.
---
Here's your answer:  no

---
Don't agree with Blizzard bending the knee on this...
---
However, I've been waiting for Classic WoW since 2010 so I'm staying subscribed. I have big plans in Classic and even altered my work schedule, I'm staying for sure.
---
Druids are S tier pvp tanks. I am levelling one in anticipation of warsong gulch and arenas. I literally cannot wait to be unkillable flag carrier god in bgs.

You have to rp to be in an rp server right I can‚Äôt just be in there for the environment

Can you share that spreadsheet

Note, you can do curse of recklessness whenever, it doesnt despawn him even if youre in combat with him.

That set up and experience sounds supremely comfy. I always enjoyed farming herbs back when I played in 08
---
What method do people use to reset mara?
---
&gt; apparently immortal has been play ready for over 6 months if not longer
---
Well, yeah, from what I heard, it was apparently just a pre-existing chinese Diablo clone, just re-skinned to look like Diablo 3.
---
Rough tldr, everyone selects 2-3 items they want. If an item drops and it‚Äôs on your list then you get it. Not sure how the ‚Äúties‚Äù or competition are/is handled.
---
I understand and agree with where your coming from. Personally I've already cancelled, but I still have a few weeks left on my sub. They already have my money, so me stopping playing won't really change anything, but whether or not I renew again depends on their reaction.
---
Nah it's super laid back.
---
If your guild is all around the same level and leveling at a similar speed then you'll eventually hit MC my guild has only just finished our second run of MC upto Major and we almost have enough douses for Major/rag and we have killed ony 3 times but we are by no means ahead of most guilds on my server if anything we were one of the last ones to start doing MC. 
---
We are a fully casual any class/spec guild with zero rep obligations and any other hardcore requirement.
---
What guildies including my self do is as much as we can for everyone and I grinded out honored with hydraxian to help us get to rag sooner totally my choice but when I play in hardcore guilds I get the sense of its more like a job rather than an enjoyable game so even if it takes me longer to clear content im still clearing it and our raids are genuinely funny we don't rage with people dying or wipes and try have a laugh and good time which from my hardcore experiences is vastly different mostly by grown adults shouting at other adults like kids for making a small mistake that inreality was totally harmless.
---
The guild im in has well over 80+ online every day and has 700+ members and still growing so by no means does being a casual guild hold you back or mean a death sentence but I will say that in time other guilds may try to poach your best raiders and if your not running consistently with a 40 man group week to week you may begin to lose raiders and that will kill your guild faster than anything.
---
Meanwhile on PVP servers...
---
I like sub much more for pickpocketing with Max stealth and ambush crits. Makes buying daggers which only rogues want much easier than trying to keep your mh updated.
---
How is this not saying you made 1332g over two weeks using the thorium method?
---
yup definitely doesn't require a video for that.   Thank you for your service - a warrior engineer who will be using this macro tonight.
---
If that was ever the case, it would make reviving after a wipe pretty much impossible.
---
They have two alternatives.
---
1) Do no business internationally. (which is not in the company's best financial interests.)
---
2) Ban any and all political discussion/mentions at their tournaments, and punish violators.
---
Number 2 seems much more reasonable (and is what most companies that operate in other countries do.)
---
Blizzard did the right thing in this instance, and the competitor brought it upon himself with his premeditated actions.
---
Do I agree with his message? Sure.
---
Do I think he chose probably one of the worst times &amp; platforms to give that message? You betcha.
---
i bought a ring for 15g today Firemaw-Alliance
---
&gt;As feral our DPS is utter crap compared to any other class
---
In classic you play a class, not a spec. Pure feral is for leveling.
---
&gt;Then there's feral tanking, utterly useless in raids because
---
There are select encounters where bear tanks are quite in demand. In particular for off tanks because they don't really compete with main tanks for gear and do a decent job.
---
You want to talk about bad tanks? Bears have a taunt. Shamans and Paladins were given tank specs, and they don't even have a sliver of viability compared to bear tanks because they're tauntless. Shamans can't get the armor/hp of a bear either, and paladins can't get enough HP to deal with crushing due to needing int for being a mana based tank.
---
&gt;Then there's Resto druids, ah, so amazing, cast a couple of hots in raids and you're out of mana. Oh no, but you can downrank. Sure, lets fucking downrank our healing spells so we get one or two more stupid useless heals and then go out of mana again.
---
I feel like you don't understand classic healing at all with this statement. All healing specs downrank, and resto druids are incredibly demanded and likely the easiest class to raid gear in the game. But do, keep on the salt train.
---
~
---
It sounds like you bought into being a meme spec and you're having regrets. You had the potential to know all of this beforehand, including the "You don't play a spec in classic". The fact that you either ignored it, or didn't educate yourself, is on you when the game is more than a decade old.
---
I apologize if my reply has been tart, but it's tough to be sympathetic when someone kicks themselves in the shin and tries to blame someone else for it.
---
Your welcome, glad you learned something.
---
Almost too difficult to watch his videos anymore... :(
---
Haven‚Äôt they done a good job with Classic so far?
---
Judging by the state of all the Blizzard game subs today, I don't think we learned it at all. Playing a nearly 20 year old MMO &gt; human rights.
---
It‚Äôs adorable when random people think their unsolicited opinions matter to anyone but themselves.
---
Dw is very hard to enjoy until you get some hit%
---
And then you can sell it for probably a profit.
---
Upvotes doesnt mean agreement. I upvoted too, since it was funny. But I'm right and you are wrong. You were mad, so mad that you made this post. Thats what you get for being a horde lover. Traitorous scum!
---
I am not even the one correcting you you little crying bitch
---
And 0.5 is not 5 you just dont know how to math apparently
---
its always the multishot...everytime
---
Reroll?
---
I truly think you are playing it wrong if you are having this many issues. I truly love my druid but you have to realize they are a utility class first and have one of the best toolkits in the game. 
---
Raw dps isnt a good metric to measure anything by in classic. Truth be told dps is limited by the threat mechanics anyway.
---
Things you did mention. Druids have the most versatility off all classes. A feral druid can easily flex into tanking or healing all by changing form. Druids bring a raidwide buff as well as innervate(the only mana returning ability with virtually no cost) travel form, stealth and FF for armor reduction. On top of that Guardian is the only tank with spammable AOE and is the highest threat generating tank even before warriors. 
---
Feral dps is middle of the pack. If you are not happy with that have fun rolling against the other 8 mages or other 8 rogues or 8 warriors in every raid for ALL of your gear. Complaining about rings is fucking stupid considering other dps classes are rolling against themselves for 100% of their BiS.
---
Resto I completely disagree with. If you are spamming hots on the raid, you are playing wrong. Downranking spells is a thing for all classes, you have to down rank for light healing as any healer or go oom in 3 or 4 cast. Just a fact of classic. On top of that using healing touch over hots is almost always better through-put and also results in less overhealing so better use of mana.
---
I logged into my Wowhead and found out I had like 32,000 reputation because of all the pet battle walkthroughs I wrote in MoP. üòÇ
---
i couldn‚Äôt do it, don‚Äôt care that the gnome racials are way better, human warlock all the way.
---
Oh shit. This sounds like a good way to get some free water before a long day. Though on my server I'd get a lot of angry horde falling on my head instead.
---
and spouting off on reddit helps how exactly? does it help the little HK rioter who's fighting for freedom? No, no it doesnt but people like to make themselves feel like they are doing something by typing something on an English forum about video game thats 15 years old. I agree with trying to make a change in general but this is totally pointless and is genuinely surprising how its still going on in the forums tbh.
---
&gt;Ban any and all political discussion/mentions at their tournaments
---
That's not in their rules.
---
It literally says at Blizzard's sole discretion, if you offend aaaaany group of people Blizzard can take all of your winnings.
---
This is what's known in contract law as "unconscionable" Though that is my opinion and not one of a court of law.
---
Lol ours was out of pocket, but we were so excited that we wanted to push it out.
---
If a player is getting ganked, the last thing they want to do is stay in the zone and continue getting ganked.
---
Excellent. It is excellent.
---
There were bear mounts in classic?
---
Not sure if bait but I'll bite anyways.
---
I played druid in vanilla. Besides having gear for, and being able to do all 3 roles, you are massively underrating the class. If you're just thinking solely for raids you can find plenty of videos of druids MTing classic content. Druid healers are great for their hots and valued in raids also. 
---
In terms of 5 man groups and pvp unless you're tanking or the healer it's a specialised support role. You have incredible utility and tools to save groups. If the tank dies you switch to bear and save the wipe, if the healer dies you can save groups with your heals. This is what hybrid classes are made for, and if you have a decent one in your group you'll recognise how much of a game changer they are.
---
Stop condensing everything down to min/max, if you wanna be the best healer roll a priest, if you wanna top the dps charts roll something else. You are forgetting that raiding content applies to well under 10% of the player base and is NOT the core focus of class mechanics.
---
&gt; It's not about his political views - it's about the fact that he's violating his employers (and fans') trust by pushing those political views on them during the course of his employment.
---
No it's not. No one expects football players to keep their mouths closed about everything. Everyone has free speech in America, including football players. Kapernick had something to say and he stood his ground, which was his right. If shit like that never interrupted people's football games and all the other entertainment stuff it'd be too easy to tune out important things. The purpose of speaking out is to be heard, which is why you don't do it in convenient-to-ignore places. 
---
Trust never factored into it. His employers can flex their right to penalize him, but fan's don't have an expectation of "trust" in the players to never voice controversial opinions. Anyone who gets upset that a celebrity or public figure says something controversial should be asked if they're new here and it's their first day in America, because this is the norm.
---
At 58 iust gather all 8ish strath quests and do both sides. You'll get close to 59 from just doing both sides and killing mobs, and handing in the quests will get you roughly 59.3 to 59.5. Then you can just grind mobs, spend some time in BlackRock spire stealing timerends set from rogues and warriors all the way to 60.
---
Well the Gnomish Death Ray should have included a warning that it might cause damage.
---
Back off in the case of taking back the punishment for the Hearthstone player? Okay I actually don't think he should have been punished or the casters but the whole #freeHK and what not being literally spammed on both Blizzard forums and Reddit doesnt help him because its not targeted at him. And if you expect blizzard as a company to abandon China your outta your mind because they probably put more money into Blizzard than US/EU combined.
---
You went ham! And benefited clearly haha. Nicely done.
---
I have never posted on Reddit, please be gentle...
---
I played a gnome all through vanilla and BC and I HATED it
---
I read: "lies/micropenises"
---
Good stuff!
---
Honestly sounds like you just want to keep playing wow so your making all sorts of leaps of logic to protect a company that clearly sided with a government the routinely violates human rights
---
PS the stream was a good a place as any to say what he wanted to say.
---
I'm sure you gave just one of many examples but I believe it's best practice to specifically full gear 1 hunter before others in MC.
---
Damage is only one part of the equation. If you die then the Rez time accounts for a lot more and frost has more defensive spells in cold snap, ice block and just generally slowing things. If you go elemental to get the frost defensive talents then you miss out on the mana and wand talents from arcane and cumulative time drinking accounts for a lot of your time leveling. So showing that it does more damage doesn‚Äôt solve the rest of the equation. Fire is a perfectly fine leveling spec. And single target frost should not try and maximize frost damage on items that‚Äôs not their best leveling stat.
---
&gt; Ban any and all political discussion/mentions at their tournaments
---
That leads directly to "offending" aaaaaany group of people.
---
Simply put: If the kid had not decided to break the rules and push his agenda on someone else's time, he wouldn't have been rightfully punished.
---
This is 100% on the competitor and not on Blizzard.
---
You're not going to change my mind, I'm not going to change yours. So, there's really no point in continuing to discuss this with someone that has already set their mind on virtue-signaling.
---
(And for the record, I am not with China on this issue. I simply support Blizzard's actions in this instance.)
---
You need to use the enter key.
---
What bombs should I be using when tanking?  The dense dynamite I have been making most recently is NOT cheap!  What do Warrior tanks usually use here?
---
Also, what about for PvP?  Are iron grenades the best choice?   
---
Poor warrior tank has run out of bombs, want to build the right ones from here out.  Engi 265, mining 300.
---
getting ganked and ganking people lower level than you has been a hallmark of vanilla and BC wow.  I‚Äôm giving people an authentic time. Anything else would be rude.
---
I've recently been getting every quest for a Dungeon before I ever step foot inside.  It's so awesome to complete all the quests in one run and then turn everything in.  I did it with ZF yesterday and Mara today.  Got all the ST quests lined up already for when I hit 50 and can get a group.
---
It is me saying that. This dudes trying to say that i've made all of my gold from this, which would be over 8k. He is saying that my math is wrong, when he just doesn't understand how to read. The 50-75g/day is STRICTLY from thorium. I dont know how much i've made on my main because its harder to calculate. I know all the gold ive accumulated on my alt is 100% from thorium, and i can do /played which is where i came up with the number. I even posted proof in screenshots for daily income averages per bar.
---
Also shadowy potions 6g each normally 2 max

He‚Äôs in Dalaran and he‚Äôs a draenai...

&gt;**very clearly** for raiding
---
Literally nobody in this comment chain was talking about raiding until you came along, just general gameplay. So how is that "very clear?"
---
I for one wouldn‚Äôt mind releasing TBC or even WotLK ‚Äúclassic‚Äù servers. But truth be told, it would be nice to see unfinished zones done or repolished
---
No one knows yet
---
How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren‚Äôt Real?
---
And has the added bonus of allow Judgement to proc SoC!
---
Arms/Fury is fine for tanking anything outside of a raid, as long as you have a shield available.
---
&gt;If the kid had not decided to break the rules
---
They're not a code of conduct. They're a blank check to allow Blizzard to make entirely arbitrary decisions. It's a clown contract.
---
&gt;set their mind on virtue-signaling.
---
You and I are done.

Oh fucking moonkin form, let me fill my bars with different ranks of moonfire. There we go, that's moonkin, that's it, nothing else.
---
So this image popped up on my Fb memories today from (10/10/2010).  Its a picture of myself (Crossdun), my dad, aunt, and uncle after successfully earning our war bears for the achievment "For the Alliance".
---
See I started playing this game when my dad (Kaal) purchased the battle chest (Vanilla/BC) for my then 6yr old son for Christmas of 2007.  I started that Christmas morning helping him make a toon... little did I know it would become my account and I would have to purchase a second one for him!
---
My Dad would absolutely LOVE the release of Classic and I think of him every time I play.  Unfortunately he passed away from pancreatic cancer in 2013.  This pic is what brought me back.  Family, friends, and fun times that we shared.   I know get to play classic along side my mother (who took over Dad's account) and my now 18 year old son!
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!!!!
---
Just curious to know roughly how much gold it took you in total?
---
I also am someone that has never watched a game of thrones episode.
---
3 minutes in and it's not a shit show in here yet? Damn. The shitwinds are brewing
---
*Times change.*
---
Sure, the constant danger can be fun... in theory. In practice it's just oh, this lv60 or group of 3 rode up, I'm still in combat, so I'm probably dead. There is no counterplay to this type of ganking other than going away or hiding. It may be me getting old, but world pvp for the sake of world pvp just seems boring as all hell in 2019.
---
Fortunately there are new games out that I want to play, and lately Blizzard's actions are pushing me to not re-sub. We'll see.
---
For Jed/Rend runs, yes. The packs before Rend can be slow to clear this way, but you get less competition on loot.
---
For a full run that won't cut, dragon packs up ahead are brutal.
---
Alright, I'll give you that one. I'll park it until BG's come out then rather than delete this shit class in frustration.
---
Youre fine.  But ive never seen social guilds become successful raiding guilds.  With 120 members online, you will have a revolving door of players with little loyalty imo.  And it will eventually be a headache down the line to deal with so many players at level 60.  Good luck
---
I'm guilty for tossing some dots as I run by.  I'm back I. STV so I try to be more careful since horde are plentiful there but alliance seem to always come for back up
---
Sounds like you simply want to virtue-signal and don't really want to do anything to actually help Hong Kong. You've simply got pent up rage to get out and Blizzard just happens to be a popular target right now.
---
As for me, I simply want to keep politics out of my gaming. The competitor is the one that brought it in, and as such should be punished. A lifetime ban would have been better for bringing in politics, but I can settle for a year.
---
I bet you play a mage or a warlock haha
---
What you didn‚Äôt hear is that it‚Äôs part of his origin story. When he was growing up he didn‚Äôt have any spare gold to learn new abilities because he was spending so much on food to keep himself alive. To this day he only knows how to charge and heroic strike because it‚Äôs all he can afford to learn.
---
:(
---
I did it too even tho I dont have any relatives living in hong kong. I hope everything is fine with your family!
---
This isn‚Äôt an airport. There‚Äôs no need to announce your departure.
---
Yeah, getting ganked by people with the emotional development of toddlers sucks. If it gets bad enough I'll probably just quit, but so far the prospect of world pvp being common keeps me going.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H3hXoiQHmHY
---
51 is the lowest i've seen
---
no.. read my text below for explanation.
---
&gt; You and I are done.
---
On that, we can agree.
---
I‚Äôve seen 4 leaf drops and no eyes
---
Our hunters all have the leaf while the many priests are slowly going insane
---
Must think he is playing ESO.
---
Honestly until around 50+, straying into the Prot tree at all is actually less effective over all.
---
You may take slightly less damage, but the chances of actually holding threat are much lower, and you do far less damage, the combination of which means fights take longer, and a higher chance that the dps or your healer are going to get smacked in the face because you can't hold everything on you, you put both of those together and it just means more damage going out over time, even if it appears like more damage is going out on the Warrior on each individual fight, it's lower overall.
---
correct... but I couldnt post text explanation to go along with pic from mobile so its in a different post.
---
Shit class is shit, no amount of trying to talk it up will change that, it's a worthless class in raids other than for buffing MOTW/GOTW and throwing innervate on a better class.
---
Meme spec, piss off with that crap. Face the facts that the class is shit, all around shit, good at nothing, an utterly worthless class used for buffing better classes in raids, nothing more.
---
Some people like gnomes
---
I'd suggest just respeccing at 50 then
---
Are you on Skeram? I feel like I've seen both of you, not that either name are very original lol.

---

---
Sure, but if you're hiding in ice block a rogue can just back off and turn invisible and wait for you to come out. You can sit here and come up with counters for anything I can type but the fact is that mages die in pvp, so obviously they're not immune to everything.
---
Yeah MT would get rezzed right on the boss lol
---
If people would just cancel their sub and refuse to come back Id actually find that honorable but its the people who go on forums and post the reasons why they quit which isn't needed and turns a forum that is for a video game into a #metoo spam session of 50 people all saying why and all 50 essentially saying the same reasons why and to me If people actually cared they wouldnt post about it in the way they do. It's like donating to charity and letting every single person around know that you donate to charity to make everyone think your a good person or doing something positive for someone who has nothing but recording them then posting the video let others see what a good person the guy behind the camera is. 
---
Its all self sastifying bullshit and I actually applaud you for  not making your own reddit post or blizz forum post explaining why you cancelled.
---
I'd hide in a tauren.
---
The worst part is that it probably did.
---
I love it! I love how goofy they look in all gear, how tiny they are compaired to everything. Its hilarious to see how they hit stuff with their toothpick sized weapons and slamming their opponents knees. 
---
For the little guys!!!
---
Ahahaha
---
There is this cool thing called context.
---
Character frames are retextured default ones, not sure which mod does the retexturing though.
---
The party frames are default, you just need to enable raid-style party frames in raid UI settings and fiddle with the options. This is very usable in retail without having to set up fancy party frames, but in classic this unfortunately doesn't scale well into 40 mans because you end up with a huge horizontal bar of 8 parties - seems they forgot an option to wrap them into a second row since it's not needed on retail.
---
blizz doesnt have a choice. china could just kick them out, seize all their assets, and just make a mirror copy government run clone. china is the worlds foremost copyright infringement leader. their economy actually depends on it, so when a foreign company is given a chance to profit, you can bet your bottom dollar they are going to stick to the party line. at this point, having based so much of their total profits there, they are chinas bitch.
---
Mage for sure.  water, food, portals, sheeps, frost nova and blizzard are superior to dots and summons.
---
People play games to get away from politics... keep your stance to yourself
---
Leveled a 60 Gnome Mage.
---
The trick is to pretend you are average height, and that everyone else is a tall freak.
---
Engineering is the best DPS PvE profession overall just because it gives you access to extra sources of damage outside of most Vanilla specs fairly limited rotations, I'd probably wait until your Rogue is getting closer to 60 and decide which one you're going to main and slap Engineering on them.
---
Some comments here are weird.
---
I checked your history because I thought you were a troll, defending China. I randomly looked at your comments \~1 month ago. 
---
On the 5 comments I selected, I found you were commenting on the reddit subject "Chinese woman working in Australia is sacked for saying Hong Kong protesters should be executed", and trying to defend China.
---
You were also commenting on "Twitter ran paid ads from China's state news media criticising the Hong Kong protests", denying the information without any proof.
---
My guess is your comment is not so innocent.
---
Make a character on Deviant Delight Horde ;)
---
I‚Äôm at 59. At the later quests it all felt like filler. They had me running around all over the place. Talk to this guy. Give this guys this. Grab this from that guy. It felt inefficient but it got me to 59. Getting chunks of xp 5-7k felt good. 40k an hour though?
---
By chest you mean the epic priest bracers from Molten Core...

Advice for making $$$? I am almost lvl 36 with only 25g to my name and I have to upgrade spells soon. :(

If any addon that Twitch recognizes is in the proper interface/addons path, it will add them to the list and they can be updated though the client.

We all find entertainment in different ways. Some people like to PvP high levels they shouldn't be able to beat and win, some like to PvP on equal footing and some like to smash the shit out of low levels. I'm not into the latter, but I understand it. Just because you don't find it fun doesn't mean it's unreasonable that someone else might.
---
As the other guy said, it's really bad for him because he has limited time to play and PvP servers are an even bigger time waster. Personally, I find the PvP interactions, good or bad, to be content. That is more for me to do. That is why I rolled on a PvP server. Do I enjoy getting camped by a 60? No, no one enjoys that, but it's an experience and adds to my struggle to 60. The struggle is part of what most people find fun, so while we may look at them as assholes and losers, they are helping some of us enjoy the game more, in a masochistic, roundabout way.
---
What do I expect from a rogue! Lol
---
Oh I fucking encourage anyone to roll a druid and see how utterly shit they are for raiding. Go, please, reroll and pick a spec, any spec, fuck it go with Resto and get all your gear from MC because there's only 4 other druids on your server because outside of Reddit everyone else knows the class is worthless.
---
Apart from PvP flag carrier in BGs, when/if they ever get released because we all got to wait for the casual shitters to level up first, jesus christ...
---
This makes me happy,you should make a compilation of getting killed trying to gank
---
I feel like the answer to this should be obvious, especially given the story.
---
Some of the healers he took gear from had been there just as long as he had. Had raided just as much as he had. But because he was in a role with a smaller pool of competitors, he had a much higher amount of dkp than the healers he swapped to. So are you seriously suggesting it's okay for someone to swap to your class and then take all the gear upgrades you had been raiding for for weeks, if not months, beforehand? 
---
Would you actually be okay with that?
---
Since I imagine you're going to say 'yes' to spite me, for the folks out there who've been playing since at least ICC who might be on the fence: Imagine if you had been raiding for weeks to months trying to get your Dislodged Foreign Object or Deathbringer's Will, only to have it taken from you by someone who had been raiding on your class for all of a week.
---
Fuck, now I need some lox.
---
So you know im right so you decide to point out something that makes no difference to my actual statement?
---
Good job.
---
Depends what level i am. For me, I mostly farmed beast to gather leather and sell on AH.

Different thing is what kind of group or guild you want to join.

Not sure about horde side, but every feral druid I've seen in raids stopped being feral after their first MC run, because they walk out of it with half a set of T1.
---
I've never heard of people being outraged about Classic+, only about the delivery of vanilla content modified.
---
There is a large following of people who like the idea of basically restarting wow and releasing an expansion to classic, aka Classic+, rather than continuing to TBC or WotLK. The primary argument being that TBC began the era of "Fixing problems by making WoW into a different game".
---
Of course the nostalgia types however often had their last good moments of wow in either TBC or WotLK. As such they remember those times fondly, and support pushing forward.
---
For the most part I hear about TBC/WotLK from people ingame, while this subreddit tends to favour Classic+.
---
As long as you feel like you've done something important, that's all that matters!
---
Oi lad
---
yup :P

Three out of my 5 bags are permanently full and I don‚Äôt carry any extra gear beyond a 1H + shield.

I don‚Äôt know how you survive carrying all that gear
---
Blizzard is silent because they face a Sophie‚Äôs choice. Any apology they make strong enough to appease their western audience will cost them just as much support in their Chinese audience.
---
It‚Äôs too late now to have it both ways - it would have been different if they had tried to be diplomatic immediately after the event, but at this point they have to decide whether they bow to China, or stand on the side of freedom. Either way they lose a significant customer base. And we are quickly learning which base they value more.
---
Should be well over 20 all together. The place is HUGE
---
My dad currently plays one and hes doing pretty okay. Hes actually playin g with my sister and her household and has had to reroll because hes leveling that fast compared to them.
---
Likely the visual bug thats being talked about a lot. Someone made devilsaur gloves and it showed as created but nothing in his bags. Just close down [Battle.net](https://Battle.net) and the game and reopen it. Should fix it
---
The key part is *for reddit gold*, as in,  a fair number of people here saw gold and platinum being thrown around and are actually full of shit and never planned on quitting.
---
I'm sorry if I wasn't being clear, but no. I didn't read it.
---
5 players have to press 5 buttons, and coordinate the timing, a multiboxer can press 1 button and cast 5 perfectly synced abilities.
---
What seems to be being slightly missed in the explanations here, is that servers that are regularly Full/High pop still have the layering in place (usually referred to as Phasing in Retail), meaning two people could be in the exact same location, but on two different instances of the game world to help alleviate potential over population in zones, so even if a server doesn't have a lot of people logged on at the time, it may still be a server utilising layering.
---
Low-Medium pop servers at their highest have had this removed for the most part, so it won't show up in the server list.

Double hunter might be difficult to play at higher than a very base level because of pet micro and deadzone.

That guy is an idiot. A healthy community needs both kinds of guilds (and also other kinds, like pvp guilds and small group of friend guilds) to be healthy. Back in the old days of Dark Age of Camelot I ran a top tier pvp/pve guild (as close to raiding as that came) and I was happy that the huge zerg guilds were around, because I could count on them to help fill spots for harder content, and I could also call them in to just throw themselves at a big problem like another faction holding our keeps. Meanwhile, they knew that if they were getting ganked they could message me or my officers and we'd send out the call and suddenly a group or two of top pvpers would show up and obliterate whoever was messing with them.  
---
That guy sounds like a toolbag, just put him on ignore.

Players are way to apathetic to do that.  I got silenced in 10 seconds from one post in two different channels.  It is not players bud.  Nice try to play it down tho.

I get we‚Äôre all excited for classic wow, but no idea how we can play on here like the Hong Kong business isn‚Äôt going on.

Am I wasting my time leveling as a feral tank? Every guide says I won't see any play in raids.

LOL! Sure.

Nice tinfoil hat you got there.

---
1. Thar's where most of the people with a life are at this point don't worry about it
---
2.  They should be able to understand just from looking at the guild panel that they are going to be waiting for raids, they'd be better off leveling an in demand class as an alt or farming the best lvl 60 gear they can get in dungeons with a pug. 
---
3. Guy sounds like an edge lord no lifer fuck'em
---
4. no, from my past vanilla experience casual guilds are by far the more fun way to play because of how intense and over the top crazy the people in "real" guilds can be when running raids.

&gt;I don‚Äôt recall any of this happening back in vanilla. I knew of some holy Paladins rolling on priest cloth but that was accepted, not warriors rolling on leather.
---
Are you sure you played much endgame in Vanilla?
---
Because DPS warriors in 3/4 leather were so common it was basically a meme.
---
Armor type may as well be irrelevant in Vanilla if we want to talk strictly efficiency.
---
15 years of my life is kinda hard to give up on.
---
Not only are you screwed out of loot for the first 8 bosses, but unless you do domo/rag with the people from that same ID or unlocked people (ain't happening), you won't be getting loot from domo or rag either.
---
I just rolled on shit and had no problems from anyone. It is expected that tanks roll on dps gear as well.
---
No, because a straight kill is a visceral satisfaction.  Knowing that someone has to spend more time running is just a mild, intellectual satisfaction. And if they were the kind of players who liked intellectual satisfaction, they wouldn't be ganking a lone player like schoolyard bullies.
---
My personal opinion; they had no real choice in the matter.
---
Choice 1: they did what they did and all this happened 
---
Choice 2: they didnt do anything about it and they would then be sunk a real good amount as well as still receive hate from the other end of the spectrum...
---
At the end of the day blizzard is still a business and they have to keep the servers up..this isn't a small little company that flies under the radar

While I believe not everything was right I do think they're getting just a bit too much shit over this when all they did was try to take the actions they needed to take as a business and not as a sympathizer of the people

There's a difference between buying products from china and them affecting how a company operates because you don't want to piss them off.
---
They bring a lot of utility to a raid group. 
---
When you say "shit" what you actually mean is "doesn't top meters" and you fail to realise that there is a lot more to it than that.
---
If you were right that this wasn‚Äôt a political statement by blizzard, they would have probably disqualified Blitzchung from the match, or MAYBE removed him from Grandmasters. Instead, they did that, then seized his prize money, then banned him for a year, then fired the interviewers just for being there. That‚Äôs what makes people believe this was a political statement.
---
Oh yes and then there‚Äôs the ACTUAL political statement posted immediately afterwards by Netease, the company that runs the Chinese side of all Blizzard‚Äôs operations, in which they promised to uphold the dignity of China.
---

---
It's like working at a huge store with only a couple managers or you have a very high student to teacher ratio. It gets hard to keep track of people you barely run into. 
---
Let's say you give up your time as a healer to do arena runs for mage belt and HoJ and shit. Or do jed runs with your guild for truestrike and Reed even though you have it. 
---
Or lets say you're giving out consumables every raid to people without a well fed buff. 
---
Unless you're doing it WITH people in the loot council or you're calling it out like I do by saying "Yo trade x if you need squid or nightfen", then nobody will know. 
---
It's just like a job I used to work at. Every time I did something outside of my job, or covered for someone else I let my managers know. When it came time for a raise they couldn't argue with me because they knew I had been doing extra. 
---
If you're some dude who just shows up for raid you'll just get pity epics. It's just difficult to spread 2 or 3 items evenly across 40 people every boss.

But your entire argument is purely self-fulfilling. You are the only reason your argument has any truth to it. 
---
A significant number of people are canceling sub payments permanently. News outlets and political leaders are picking up the story. This will continue through Blizzcon and the MW release. The news with the NBA and South Park happening at the same time only builds awareness. Now more than ever is an actual chance to see change. Don't hate on someone for sharing their feelings about whether or not to be a part of it.
---
They're a business at the end of the day and they have to do what keeps them afloat ..losing China would be a huge hit to the company and in the long run would potentially ruin them either way
---
They're a shame to Alliance everywhere. I've run into some a-holes like that.
---
Dps only warriors are memes and are the lowest of the low
---
The only disadvantage to having that many is that you'll have a lot of drama queens starting shit (inevitable), and you'll have people who want to raid and feel entitled to a spot. In my experience the best way to deal with the first is to kick them out at the first sign of drama. The best way to deal with the second is to have a trusted officer start a second, third, or whatever raid group. You have your trailblazing group that is fully geared and clearing new content, and then you have your second group that is less geared, and maybe getting swapped into the main raid to gear up a bit so they can help the second group (gearing up a second or even third main tank is never a bad thing, if real life comes in and swipes your main tank you'll be at a loss if you don't have a properly prepped back-up).   
---
It ultimately just comes down to how much administrative work you want to do, and how you want to run things. My rule as a guild leader was that we only had 1 rule: Don't cause trouble. If  you have a problem with someone, settle it in whispers, not in guild chat. If you have a problem with someone and you can't settle it, bring it to me, but if it's petty understand that I might kick you both out.  
---
I had to kick some good players for being toxic early on, and they formed their own little shitty guild and were awful to each other, but it left us with a nice focused guild that just did whatever we liked, because no one could stop us and we were all focused on having fun and playing the game.
---
Wanna pay me back all the game time I have?
---
I already have 5 alts. -\_- Finally convinced myself I'll stick to one characters until 60. xD
---
Yeah the idea of a dedicated gold farm toon is something to think about. I'm maining a hunter atm but am keenly aware of the potential for hunters to be less desirable later. However I hear they maintain at least some desirability due to the frenzy cleanse in tranquilizing shot. They also pair nicely with skinning/leatherworking, which for now helps with onyxia cloaks and can be tuned to do devilsaur armor as highly desirable. I've dabbled into alts of different classes and professions to extend my "account wide" utility for tradeable goods, and in case I eventually decide that any class is better for raid utility or just plain feels good. It's been immensely relieveing to take a break from the current grind I'm in with my hunter and just get fast and impactful level ups on alts. I'm sure in the 20 - 30 range, definitely by 40 or so it'll all start slowing down, but you can still get decent utility as technically professions can hit high levels around 35/40.
---
Also, hunters are one of the potential options to get relegated to Nightfall duty down the line. I initially kind of dreaded it, but by chance I happened to get Ravager easily and although it's definitely a meme strategy it's actually pretty fun when wing clip spam works and you put out respectable melee AoE. There's only so much you can do with ranged AoE as a hunter, especially if solo.
---
I could but i started on this server with some friends..I don't intend to go level up again on a server away from my friends and characters that I already have
---
You‚Äôre a lil ray of sunshine
---
Which is politics
---
Not my experience.
---
You can get to him as any class, just have to kill the 2 elementals just before him.

Couldn't solo him as priest though, guess I'll stick with my green bracers, the difference is just 10 fire res.

&gt;Don't learn Dual Wield if you're planning on doing this btw, unarmed = dual wield.
---
For anyone reading this in the future - I'm 99% certain this information is false in classic.

Anecdotally, if you unequip the off-hand weapon, I can confirm that you do not make melee attacks with the off-hand.

Should we assume you meant Seppuku?

üé• How Blizzard's Orc Statue Was Created - Wowhead News
---
Where is the alliance statue.
---
Congrats! I heard thats a pretty rare drop.
---
Engineering is always good. This is a rage comment because of competition
---
Fuck that. There's mages and locks and priests galore. Why have competition on 2% drop items?
---
That looks like a fairly straightforward, if not suboptimal, prot spec.
---
Super confused why you would choose to dual wield with this spec.
---
Super confused all around with what you're really trying to achieve to be honest.
---
&gt;Druid healers are great for their hots and valued in raids also.
---
Literally take a priest to just cast renew, there we go and sure the priest can do a ton more healing, so why bother taking a druid other than one druid to buff the raid,  cast thorns on tanks, use CR and cast innervate on another class that's better in every way than a druid. There's literally no other reasons to take a druid other than to use them to buff everyone else.
---
At what point in Vanilla did you get gear from raids as feral ? Please tell me, because I'm having a hard time trying to figure out if Blizzard just forgot to give feral druids gear in raids or it was intentionally so because Druids are only meant to buff others and cast 4 or 5 HOTS before going out of mana.
---
If raiding is only 10% of the player base then what the hell are other people playing Druids for now when we don't even have BG's ? 
---
The tanking stuff you're talking about it bollocks too, I have BiS tanking gear, including stupid fking expensive warden staff and there is NO WAY a feral tank can do anywhere near as good as a warrior or that the raid should ever take a feral druid as an offtank over a dps warrior who can just throw a shield and gear on to become crit immune. Unless you have the druid taking dedicated healers blowing all their mana just trying to keep him alive. There is little or no gear itemization for feral dps or tank druids at all and nothing for them in raids until AQ when they get a few pieces but going on how bad the casual shitters are crying out already to slow Blizzard down releasing content, that's a good 3 years away, if ever.
---
But sure don't listen to me people, go roll a druid and see how amazing it is and how much gear you have to choose from in raids, like all of 2 rings and neck for feral if you've not gone resto and enjoy casting rank 4 healing touches and a few hots before going out of mana.
---
It's like Blizzard just forgot to put any gear in raids for Feral druids or even give Feral tanks some gearing options with +def stats on them so they can become actually useful in raids without draining all the healers' mana.
---
Druid = Resto for raids = no really you're just there to buff everyone because they all know your heals are shit and you're already out of mana 30 seconds into the fight.
---
Ok thats literally not the same as a precedent being set for companies that don't originate in China are now bending over to what China says or they will lose their market.
---
&gt;Saying someone has "helped the most" is a ridiculous abstract reasoning
---
How so? 
---
If the class lead spent his time gearing up other players through dungeons even thought he didnt need gear, why shouldn't he get extra considerations?
---
&gt;Yes you do, you just didn't think about what 'politics' entails.
---
As it relates to WoW? Nah.
---
What you mean doesn't work? If they use any CD to get to you, you polymorph, walk away and repeat.
---
You'd generally not play fury in pvp though.
---
Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.
---
People keep saying that, but it simply isn't true. We've got 1.12 itemization, spellcasters are incredibly powerful with all of the gear available to them. There are so many stats available that just weren't there in vanilla, or don't show up on private servers at the same rate that they do here in classic.
---
I'm not saying that warlock/mage is a clear cut choice as winner, but arguments about how they get better later on because of unavailable tiers aren't strong enough to label these classes as inferior to any other.
---
I am neutral here.  As a rogue, all you bring is dps.  Helps the raid more if its given to a human.  Doesnt take into consideration guild participation and effort though.  Its the first brut blade, there will be many more.  Either be the dude who doesnt care about who gets loot as long as the guild gets stronger, or find a new guild that tryhards less.

China does not put the majority of money into Blizzard. Commenters have already dug out Blizzards official corporate financial filings, which show the Asia/Pacific region as a whole was only 12% of their revenue. And that includes South Korea.
---
Generally I agree with you.  That's why my post wasn't *"wah wah wah I'm unsubscribing."*  It was *"this sucks and I don't know what I'm going to do yet."*
---
You know, discussing things.  Like you do in a discussion forum.
---
I agree with this. Blitz was in a tournament at the time of the incident and a certain amount of decorum is to be expected. 
---
And political views during all that is not a good move ... he should have waited for his own stream to push forth his views..while the prize recinsion (?) Was probably a bit too much as well as the ban it was the wrong place at the wrong time
---
A similar thing happened to xqc which got him banned from s1 of owl ...he wasn't acting professionally in the environment he was in and it got him into trouble
---
&gt; Please don‚Äôt give these morons a voice here.
---
But you should have a voice on it you fucking retard.
---
Blizzard knowingly changed things. The example was lack luster. Here is a perfect one: 
---
Exp is scaled by how much dmg you do to a mob. In actual classic you could tag an enemy, and someone else could kill it for you, for the full value of exp. I know that for a fact, because they used this method on my server, to reach server first 70 in burning cruisade, so it was definitly in classic also. They just didn't want that, changed it, and didn't communicate about it.
---
Try it for yourself: being in group with a lvl 60 and make him kill 3 times more enemies is faster then you tagging an enemy and letting it get killed by someone outside of the group (depending and scaling up by how much dmg you actually did).
---
So yeah... this is not 100% classic, not just because of the finaly fading layering that fucked extremely with the server economy.  It is basically just a different private server. Possibly closer then the others out there, but the others out there are fan projects, and mostly free
---
Yes. It's pretty clear that Blizz took such drastic actions against Blitz and the interviewers to kowtow  to the authoritarian Chinese regime.
---
In pvp its good to fake cast for a frost mage. Particularly on a class that can interrupt you or lock you out.
---
shhhh
---
&gt; 1 in 10.000, assuming the rolled number doesn't matter, but the fact that 3 people roll the same.
---
Yes, that's what he was saying.  odds of 3 of a kind rather than 3 of a specific roll.
---
Uh.. no I'm not. The vast majority of people don't play the AH. I do, I make money. I never said it was hard, just more effort than most people are willing to go to.
---
You're really living up to your name in this thread mate.

25-40g
---
Found the rogue.
---
Nope. I played on my Dad's Dwarf Priest for awhile, but Ive never been able to stick with any tiny character. They're just too low to the ground and it makes me anxious.
---
Bursting clothies is fun. Hunters do crazy burst damage
---
i played mage for years and i am so happy that i decided to roll rogue (almost went for mage). i am also totally pissed by that AoE shit. 
---
i mean, i am 60 for 4 weeks now and i am still so pissed about not finding a group because of those AoE dungeon runs. 
---
now i can pickup ao many lowskill mages. its really a fiesta
---
Priest can solo any undead elite by using shackle -&gt; mindblast -&gt; repeat. Spammable CC is so great.
---
&gt;go to the dungeon entrance and find the 4 group that just had a guy dc
---
This works really well. Especially for places people like to do multiple runs of, like SM where groups have people leaving in between runs.
---
good rules. yeah I kick toxic members immediately. they make it pretty obvious usually. Thanks for the advice. Yes, two different raid groups would be ideal
---
&gt;So many children thinking it's a clear cut decision.
---
Classic redditor acts superior while also acting like a little bitch with his actions.
---
Get to running Scarlet arms a couple of levels and then do Cath.  You'll make over 5g a run there and you'll have to do it a handful of times each level.  You may have to wait a moment after 40 depending on how bad you need your 40 skill upgrades though.
---
The quest for the hunter's epic bow requires them to do a rite of passage style fight where they prove their metal and earn the right to wield the bow. This requires them to fight a mob all by themselves and if you touch the mob or help the hunter in any way it despawns and they have to start all over.
---
&gt;working as intended^? my ass^!

My server is a cold uncaring place.

So OP is a poser then, is that what you're trying to say?
---
&gt;Healers being geared is fairly trivial.
---
Afaik there's 1 piece and then rings/neck that priests and casters share that's BiS, and that's the on use spell power trinket. Everything else is class specific. Not to mention that geared warriors/rogues top meters, and you CANT share BiS with them

I‚Äôve played other things in retail but as far as classic/vanilla goes, I‚Äôve only ever played gnome!   
---
From my perspective, I love seeing the world from my little lens. Feels like I get a little better horizon view because I‚Äôm angled slightly more upwards, and I love running through all the gaps and spots other races can‚Äôt hit. For example, there are quite a few mountain climbing spots I‚Äôm aware of that are only available to gnomes!
---
Thanks bro!
---
I didn‚Äôt realize it till now but it‚Äôs the same for me. Before season 8 GoT was a show I thought about often concerning the story and my favorite characters. But right after it ended I stopped thinking about it completely and just forgot about it. Most shows I liked that much like Breaking Bad or The Wire or The Magicians, still pop up in my brain pretty often. GoT not so much even though it hasn‚Äôt been that long.
---
Funny you should say that since I only have one rogue and he is level three. Lol!
---
I may end up doing so. Literally any other class is more useful and better at everything over a druid, apart from carrying flags in BG's when they release next August.
---
Then why did you do it?
---
"You all have phones right"?
---
Now you are just feeding to the the culture that Blizzard want you to.
---
Next they will add Micro transactions to the game and block off lvl's behind paywalls.
---
NO THANKYOU
---
/roll 101-101 I think
---
Pretty much just the AH. Lots of guides online, if you're willing to spend time buying and selling you can make a lot of gold.
---
Thank you good sir
---
A number I've seen tossed around here is that China represents ~12% of their income.  Now the kicker here is that obviously they expect that to grow tremendously in the coming years.  Growth is more important that profit, here.  But IMO, it's a short-sighted decision to get in that bed, because China could turn on them for no reason at all, at any point, and just straight up ban them from the country.  That's what makes it so disappointing  --  they are seemingly choosing *potential* short term growth with a very high long term risk over both their local market and support of freedom of speech/expression/etc.
---
There are some census sites online, along with addons that get a rough idea of how many players are logged on.
---
But I always find a live approach is best, so as a general rule I just create a level 1 character on either faction and do some /who checks. Do some "/who &lt;class&gt; 60 &lt;mainbase&gt;" queries and you'll get a rough idea of how populated certain areas are with their respective faction.
---
You'll change your mind soon enough
---
Is it though? Bringing up politics of any sort and getting away with it would set a huge precedent.
---
&gt;where you take the piss out of jews
---
That's an extremely uncharitable interpretation of my praise of a former moderator of the judaism board on StackOverflow.
---
It must be nice to imagine whatever context you prefer.
---
Thank you
---
i just sheep them and watch them die to the mobs
---
Yeah yeah, we have been suffering since the beginning, our suffering will never end. It will just be by the hand of another, if not by this one. You might not know about it but people are suffering all over the place, they where suffering a year ago and you did nothing. You will do nothing now except expect others to stop doing something they enjoy. Get your likes on your Facebook/insta/wtgrthefuck social media you subscribe to and in a week will be bitching about something else that‚Äôs currently the flavor of the month.
---
Im on mankirk
---
I'd give you even odds that OP was as polite and the guild leadership was this abrasive in their response
---
Mmmmm your salt sustains me.
---
I agree, if you are not attacking said mob a voidwalker can hold aggro.
---
Why is it upside down
---
You were averaging 40k an hour?
---
There is a difference and it's that one requires 5 human players to coordinate together to spend the time of 5 human beings, while one requires 1 human player not coordinating with anyone to spend the time of 1 human being.
---
G &gt; N
---
Wait, Bacteria? Aren't you in Scarab still?
---
&gt;As for me, I simply want to keep politics out of my gaming. 
---
Then why are you in this thread about a topic you don't care about. 
---
&gt;Sounds like you simply want to virtue-signal and don't really want to do anything to actually help Hong Kong. 
---
Projection much? You literally admitted the protesters were right but you don't think you should do anything.
---
&gt; this will take well over an hour, plan accordingly
---
More like 3 hours.
---
this is great stuff, that's awesome that your guild outlasted everyone. I hope mine can do the same, but yeah if we grow apathetic and lethargic, we will die. I will keep our guild active
---
Chose it based off of the amount of intellect they start with and was advised by someone who played that they made the best mages. At about 40 I started to hate it, but hated the thought of re rolling even more. Played all through BC hating the character but loving the damage, didn‚Äôt have the will to re roll a character I already had just to be a different race
---
Very few people would actually complain. Vanilla was great and I enjoyed it a lot, now enjoying classic as well... but it was *far* from perfect and there are a lot of unfinished things as well as some poor (IMO) decisions that should be fixed.
---
Just as reference this is noted and I'll blur names in the future but don't you think people should be warned of people that may ruin there day that they've been farming for a bis for days having it finally drop just to find out the leader switched to master loot and had it taken from right to roll for it from under their noses or had a mage roll need on a warrior bis for the gold for their epic mount or etc and know they should avoid partying with them just like any other drama of some streamer who ninja looted?
---
Get woke, go broke. Leftism destroys.
---
I don‚Äôt want a voice on China... I could care less if Hong Kong fell into the sea... I want to come to a video game discussion thread and read and converse about video games, not politics... How much of a fucking retard do you have to be to understand that?
---
Glad to see you‚Äôre my number 1 fan =) you‚Äôre following me all over this thread =)
---
See who controls Nessingways camp in STV
---
All those epics your guild gave you, and you're not using Thorium ammo?
---
Love this.
---
don't learn/upgrade all your spells
---
always accept the quest reward that will sell for the most 
---
skin and vendor the leather.
---
I have a gnome warlock I‚Äôm leveling and I initially picked it for the extra mana boost but I just find playing him funny. I don‚Äôt really see much of a difference besides a different race, and I think it‚Äôs funny being tiny.
---
Blizzard is doing what every single multinational company does.  This one happened to just go viral.
---
This list is going around and by no means complete but as you can see you would need to start boycotting everything to avoid companies that cater to China.

Warrior leveling took me about 7 to 11 hours at this level questing in Western and Eastern plaguelands
---
just wanna say: you don't need thick hide.
---
at all. ever. I've feral tanked everything up to the raids (just finishing pre-BIS before I try) and I have zero points in thick hide.
---
focus on armor/stam/agi/str while leveling for tank gear. for the most part, my cat/bear gear was identical. now that I'm getting close to pre-BIS, I have separate resto/cat/bear sets
---
580g in epic drops is pretty unusual tho
---
When I was horde I always thought this was big bullshit. Now that I'm playing alliance I still think it's big bullshit but I'm not going to die on this hill. :)
---
Exactly. I just don't care.
---
Humans have been this way since the beginning and people want me to give up my freedoms and things that I find fun because hongkong? Hongkong is at the point were they need to start fighting. Not protesting. I've played WoW for 15 years. I'm not giving it up for someone else because I'm not a hypocrite. 
---
Americans destroy and murder civilians. Am I suppose to move out of america and protest american products? No fuck that. That's world will always be a terrible place and trying to make it not is a waste of time.
---
Reported for being a whinging pussy.
---
Yup. It's pretty clear when someone is being lazy when they don't have their Devilsaur gloves and pants + enchants on pre-raid BiS pieces. They're just waiting for the raid loot.
---
Uhmm... im kinda sad i must be the one to inform you but.. Arenas were non-existant in classic, and won‚Äôt come :-/
---
More like a shit blizzard bubbles.
---
Not even the characters were the same. The master of whispers ran a superbowl commercial for treason, the smartest dwarf in Westeros got an off-screen lobotomy, the 8,000 year old prime evil was killed by a 12 year old drop out, and the woman who spent her life helping oppressed people became a homicidal maniac after her incest fantasy was shot down.
---
Like I said, its a shame the show never got finished. That's the only way I can engage with what's nice about it without getting angry about how totally they fucked it up
---
The census data has been blocked by Blizzard. Because of this, no updates have been done to the data in almost a month. Using census for classic is now very inaccurate
---
I'm also considering cutting out 3 hours if sleep  for the next two days take ease up my pace. Still can't do dungeons till Sunday night. Maybe Saturday day if I'm lucky.
---
EPL was a bitch to do. There‚Äôs a dungeon there so a lot of raids meet up at the FP and start ganging the other factions. Be careful!
---
Got a priest to 24 before rerolling as a pally (PVP). So far go to level 45 and I've been wavering since last night. Thinking about going warrior, hunter or warlock. Getting very bored of leveling via quests and I can't do too many dungeons in a row without losing interest as well. My mage friend is consistently 5 levels ahead of me.  Going to try keep playing my pally and when I get bored, work on my alt.
---
And put that shit up on BB AH please!
---
- a completionist Horde
---
Hey OP can you still get to the Deadmines secret on Classic?
---
They‚Äôre not supporting shit, my man. There are rules and using your tournament-winning podium for politic messages is wrong. Get a grip on real life!
---
All the tea in China....plus the rest of China

Classic horde scum wording...
---
Every time I have checked no PVE servers are listed, just other PVP servers, and this is when most servers are at the lowest population for the day, is there something I am doing wrong?
---
The unfortunate reality is that you will do more DPS with the whirlwind axe unless you are fighting mobs a few levels lower than yourself.   In that scenario your 1 handers will not miss all the damn time which is what kills your DW dps.
---
As for +hit that is going to be more important when you have to deal with level 63 bosses, as they are 3 levels higher than you.
---
So, what I would do is give it a try, see how you like it, but don't bother respeccing to DW fury until level 58+
---
Blizzard knew maybe 1,000 people would actually cancel their sub when news broke. So 1,000 vs the entire Chinese market... No brainer. You can say what you want about the "moral high ground" but they are a video game company. They don't care about morals they care about money. I'm not naive enough to think otherwise and you can say "well companies should be better blah blah blah" what are you, five years old? Welcome to capitalism kiddo, where profits have always overshadowed every other aspect and they always will. Without it none of us would even be on this thread and would have about 75% less possessions than we do. You can mock outrage all you want but if you really wanted to boycott all the companies doing this type of thing, because God knows what happens behind closed doors, you wouldn't even have a device to act mad on.
---
Shhh! Don't just tell people.  Buy them and sell on the AH for mad cash.
---
Shaman and paladin. This is too perfect.

If u get silenced your frostspells go for fire spells

I pulled Forest Tracker Epaulets from one of the chests that spawns in that goblin camp.  It was on the tower where the named mob lives.

Is it worth a lot? Only like 28g on my server.

---
1 in 1,000,000 chance.
---
I actually don't mind all that. The thing that got me annoyed when I rolled up to STV at level 38 was a group of 5 Alliance level 60s who all had T2 helms (not exaggerating) camping Nesingwary's for like two hours killing all Horde on sight.
---
Is this serious?
---
I can't tell if this is serious.
---
You **actually** played a druid and can't tell they're the classic OP class?? 
---
That's.... That's hilarious!!
---
Dude, reroll. Go on. Enjoy your one trick. I suspect that's kinda all you are capable of.
---
But as a very casual reminder, the sites that aggregate progression in classic are showing druids in the #1 **world** position for DPS, and the #2 **world** position for healing. 
---
So it's more probably that you are just kinda bad, and maybe a mage or rogue is more your speed.
---
Nah your animations are better and your /silly jokes are God tier.
---
check with your guild leader / head mage about frostbite before turning up to a raid in that spec imo.  Safety first

I dont remember slot numbers for trinkets but main had is ‚Äúequip slot 16‚Äù and offhand is ‚Äúequip slot 17‚Äù
---
RIGHT? 
---
Lol I was expecting it to look weird but not this messed up.
---
Out of state of what?
---
I don't run with my guild, they ain't raiders yet. My thorium is reserved for raids/high level dungeons and not for just outdoor grinding
---
I tried to do EVERY quest I could on a main, just to get the experience of drinking it all in. In practice this meant I ended up with tons of green and quite a few gray quests in time, and I still missed *some* quests due to like being tied to dungeon drops and such that I never got and would be pointless eventually. With this route I was basically overleveled for every single dungeon I did, though I'm nearing 50 and grind may slow things down.
---
Point is, with alts you really don't HAVE to do the same quests and areas per se. Like humans don't have to do loch modan, dwaves don't have to do redridge, night elves could just take a boat early and skip ashenvale and maybe even darkshore etc. I've seen plenty of low level elves in human lands for instance. Once you know what quests and areas you like from a main I feel like you can be a lot more choosy with an alt. There are tons of quests that are pretty long and don't actually offer that much in the way of gold/gear/xp relative to alternatives.
---
I'm not a big fan of typical hunter DPS rotations, by which I mean auto shot a lot if you don't want to kill your mana (though if in a fast dungeon group you can drink to help that, since mages and healers might be doing the same). I kind of made the regrettable mistake of not picking up aimed shot due to going deep beast mastery for leveling, and this tiny rotation change will only hit at level **51** for me. That said, while the actual character's rotation can be pretty braindead, there can be a lot of finesse in using your pet away, as well as doing stuff like mixing in traps *in combat* via feign death (ideally with a macro). Traps are slow enough outside of combat to be almost unrealistically unusable except in rare scenarios IMO, but the feign death technically makes it MUCH more flexible, plus the feign might be useful for a threat dump anyways. All that said, from what I've experienced and read about other classes it can often boil down to simple or repetitive rotation anyways. In big groups classes can lose out on their DoT options. Hunters basically only have DoT to worry about, whereas for instance warlocks have quite a few as a counterexample and can get stuck spamming shadowbolt (or early on spamming a wand til mana efficiency gets better).
---
Look I know I‚Äôm an orc and I‚Äôm supposed to hate humans, but someone please give Nat Pagle a hug. Does he have family? What is his story? I am concerned
---
Usually 50-100g on my server
---
Pick any 4 of your friends and try to convince them to follow you around so you can blap randoms in the world while leveling. See how keen they are. That is why multiboxing is not at all the same thing as 5 actual players.
---
I loved my gnome. I would drink a noggenfogger elixir to make him even smaller. Cutest mounts ever! I liked his dance moves as well.
---
I ponied up for three months' subscription just for classic, hadn't played in over a decade.  I knew I would enjoy WoW but I hadn't expected exactly how much I actually I loved being back in Azeroth.  I'm pissed off.  I quit the day the news broke but I'm unhappy putting down WoW.  Sucks not being able to play a game I enjoyed immensely but I don't regret my decision.  I hope Blizzard goes down in flames over this.

Swatter doesn't have Global errors, it catches Global errors, or "swats" them.

You want your tank to have 1000 gold worth of gear or an epic mount?

yeah exactly

You spelled hordies wrong

Right?

A wyvern is an unintelligent dragon with only 5 limbs (wings, hind legs, and tail) as opposed to 7 (forelegs, hindlegs, wings, and tail)
---
I still prefer the Stormwind Chef [Steven Ryback](https://i.imgflip.com/175duc.jpg) because he teaches me karate.
---
Why support Blizzard?
---
Same thing but with Alliance on Yojamba. There is often a group of 5 level 60's all with T2 helms that camp level 30s at Nesingwary for hours. Like, where's the fun in one hitting literally every single player who goes to turn in a quest?
---
It's easy. Just like a maze. Always go right and eventually you have found your way out.
---
That's a mighty big range.
---
Dumb people.
---
Getting into a raid fast is far better. Because of you spend 6 weeks getting your pre-raid BIS, it'll be replaced in 5 minutes in a raid. Meanwhile if you get into Raid with greens early, you'll save weeks and still get yourself gear that is better than pre-raid BIS.
---
Get into raids as fast as a guild will let you of you're interested in gearing up. Gathering pre-raid BIS is what you do when you're bored and log in before raids.
---
Just a little wall jumping. I could send you the video if you'd like.

This is actually my first time ever playing vanilla, I started playing WoW in 8.1 BFA. I haven't been burning/rushing through, I've just had a lot more free time than most others had since the release, so I've just played a lot
---
260 was the teleporter to Gadget/Winterspring. Then after that I just wanted to get it to 300. 
---
300 recipes are rare drops. No real reason to unless you want the really rare ones. Some of them are very useful.

---
I didn‚Äôt see the edit when I posted that, so I‚Äôll just cop to my mistake. My opinion on the overall situation doesn‚Äôt change since it was a free roll, but I y‚Äôall were right about the pvp. I concede that fully.
---
Your apathy doesn‚Äôt make you cool or smart.
---
Supposedly we have Jeff Kaplan to thank for that.
---
Theres an addon called BuffWatch that makes it really easy to keep people blessed including pets.

Looks good to me

If I ever played a mage (or the melee mage, a rogue lol) I'd quit.
---
Such a boring concept. Although teleport is nice.
---
I'd like to try a warlock one day, but so far I haven't in 15 years.
---
Get your alt character into your party by using a friend/guildie to invite while you switch over. After you finish a run, log out and switch to the alt in your party. Party lead will switch over after 2 minutes. At that point reset the instance and log back into your mara runner.

Name of orc? PM me

Thank God I'm pve lol

Dang dude.... do you feel it?
---
I don‚Äôt see why you think that, people expect his book to be on par with the rest of his books and to tie up all the threads he‚Äôs been weaving over the course of his entire Game of Thrones career. People are not simply expecting him to be better then the show. Seems to be a sentiment from someone that is show driven, but the books aren‚Äôt just a supplement to the show that existed. I‚Äôm sure you could make a sound argument that expectations have dropped, but they haven‚Äôt dropped to the level that you‚Äôre commenting or anything close. That would be a ton of pressure, u would argue that pressure is actually augmented by the shows poor performance in the final seasons even.
---
And then suddenly it won't be. People are gonna farm DM thorium.

I ponied up for three months' subscription just for classic, hadn't played in over a decade. I knew I would enjoy WoW but I hadn't expected exactly how much I actually I loved being back in Azeroth.  I quit the day the news broke, leaving two months' worth of sub time.  I likely would have played for over a year.  I'm very pissed off. I'm unhappy having put down WoW. it sucks not being able to play a game I enjoyed immensely, but I don't regret my decision. I hope Blizzard goes down in flames over this.
---
It doesn't show up on mine. But it works
---
Do the quests in trisfal glades and silverpine.
---
That's rough. I'm a hunter so my time is alot easier but WPL was a bitch. I just got into EPL didn't seem to bad but I'm also alot better at dealing with shadow magic so we'll see.
---
Well, that's just like, your opinion, man.
---
what you wanna do is type /join lookingforgroup
---
Sweet glasses dood
---
My retaliation + overpower would like to have a word with you.
---
Agreed. If Blizzard had doubled down on the mechanics introduced in BfA, I'd be a little unsure, but considering the direction they've taken with 8.2, and appear to be taking with 8.3, I think it's clear they've learned their lesson in messing with class feel and boring, grindy gameplay.
---
Ah ok thanks for clearing that up. I completely forgot about flurry but that makes sense
---
The timing is just too perfect for this to be genuine. The guy just has a sense of humor.
---
&gt; mana regen.
---
because warlocks give a shit about mana regen..?
---
Not the most experienced Tank - but here's some stuff that I do and could possibly help you. :D 
---
\- Make sure you get use to switching stances. Also, make a macro for switching between tank weapons and dps weapons. 
---
\- If you're in a group with someone who can burst down and kite the mobs. Then don't worry so much about obtaining threat on every single mob. This is where you either dps or stay in defensive stance to pull mobs off the person kiting. I usually grab the mobs closest to the main dps dealer; so they don't have to deal with unnecessary damage or slow cast times. 
---
\- If you're confident in your group, ask someone to help you pull and gather the mobs for quick clearing. 
---
\- If you can, interrupt as much as possible. 
---
\- Buy some potions, flasks, &amp; food to help with your health and dmg output. 
---
\- Always prioritize mobs that are running towards another player. (I'm usually in a group with a mage. So, I'm constantly having to pull aggro off of him.) 
---
\- Your AOE taunt (challenging shout) can really help in a shitty situation when mobs are scattered or multiple mobs are hitting another player and they're about to die. 
---
\- Demo shout when you're pulling to grab quick aggro.
---
\- Battle shout to bump up your dmg and threat generation. If you're in a group with melee, then your battle shout will help pull aggro from their attacks. (supposedly)
---
\- Download Details! and use Tiny Threat. When you target a mob, Tiny Threat will show if you have threat on your target or not.
---
\- Make sure you're using shield block, it's an important spell to use when you're about to take heavy damage. As well as, last stand &amp; shield wall. 
---
\- I always start off a pull by using bloodrage, then run in and demo shout. 
---
\- When you're pulling, prioritize the caster or casters. If there's one caster in the group, attack him first so the rest of the mobs gather on top of you. If there's multiple casters in the group, make sure you interrupt and then run to the next caster so all the mobs are in a nice group for easy aoe damage. 
---
\- Make sure you don't keep moving around when you have aggro of the mobs. It's easier to just spank &amp; tank. Plus, the melee won't hate you for constantly making them move. xD 
---
\- Do not let a priest shield you. You won't get rage. 
---
\- My rotation usually goes: Bloodrage, demo shout, sunder armor, revenge, then heroic strike. You can replace heroic strike with cleave, if you're in an AOE group. 
---
That's all I can think of. :D Hope it helps. Lol.
---
I......I have no rely for a comment this stupid. I dunno, where is the statue?
---
In the laughter of children and the hearts of whores?
---
What kind of retort is that?!?
---
Dear god man.... Sack up and reply with something interesting.
---
"wHeRe'S YoUr sTaTue?!?"..... Christ.... Talk about a herp-a-derp argument.
---
Anyone else find it odd that these ‚Äúapathy is the answer‚Äù comments seem to appear in every thread related to HK/Bliz?
---
You can‚Äôt get all 20+ in a single run, though, because the arena is boss roulette.
---
Coward...
---
one of two things has been happening recently re: that attitude.  People are either getting past that as they level up, or those people are still in SM.
---
I haven't had to deal with that crap since ZF, thankfully.
---
Aren't most zones easier to quest in as horde?
---
A disguise to surpass the box
---
I haven't tried it yet but it doesn't require wall jumping if I remember correctly so presumably you can.
---
scan each AH and see how many auctions are on each
---
Is that all, there's no other areas?
---
They should be leading off with agony/curse of weakness depending on the party comp and corruption but only after you pull and get in a swing, then they should have the imp start attacking and then cast immolate. If they are running the demonology spec having their imp out also gets them -10% threat generation making it even easier to avoid pulling the aggro off you. I've been doing this all the way to 42 and have not pulled aggro yet regardless of whether the tank is a druid, pally or warrior, granted I'm not winning a DPS race with a rogue or mage, but I'm also not wiping us.
---
Yeah, So I just did it. Once I factor in what I recouped by selling stuff to vendors it was about 53g. Would've been less, but there are some shenanigans being played out on our AH in relation to the price of mithril by the looks of it. Still though, you were both pretty spot on!.
---
Nah it‚Äôs just me.
---
a reasonable answer to make the boss seem more boss like is to give them actions equivalent to a challenge for the party, if you don't want to throw trash mobs in to even the odds. like give the boss 6 actions for his one turn.
---
I felt the punishment was too harsh. And the local Twitter post about being faithful to China felt even weirder. Mix that with the tension between Taiwan and China and you got a mixed bag. It almost felt like Blizzard over enforced.
---
Month ban, sure. Player fine, yeah maybe. But a year, no winnings, and firing the casters? A bit much in this climate. The punishment felt like a statement and that's what is rubbing people the wrong way.
---
A random and I both rolled 69, then he rolled 1 and I rolled 100... it is one of my wow high points
---
There's others. But the 1-10 and 10-20 zones have enough rep giving quests to get you to honored.
---
I too am curious about the nameplates
---
Ok
---
Just ask for help in trade or lookingforgroup.  There will be a bored high level warrior somewhere, they will help you out because they know how hard it is, and how good the axe is, and someone probably helped them out at your level.
---
Just ask imo.   You can also hang out near the objective and wait for another group to turn up, help them kill it then ask them to help you.
---
Very fitting, 1-225 fishing so far today, omw to speak to Nat and checking reddit :P
---
My comment was more about burst damage. I agree that using all these abilities is inefficient.
---
Shamans *can* use these abilities if they need to. Paladins are stuck with an auto attack+seal, and a periodic judgement. You *need* those procs to hit, while a shaman who doesn't get a wf proc has other means of burning down a mob.
---
just listen to yourself in this, if you think you are in the right you are just dumb
---
What am I missing here?  Did we all decide to call this titanforging in classic?
---
Canceled my wow classic account due to this.  Shame, it was fun while it lasted but I won't support Blizzard any longer.
---
&gt; Arena runs do nothing but the arena arena repeatedly, because it has good loot and xp. Run with high and low levels.
---
To add to this, arena runs are often under 15 minutes each and you can add Roccor/Houndmaster to the runs since you can only do 4 per hour anyway.
---
this is the druid mood I like to see
---
can't you just sticky the other thread
---
I love how quickly this sub has turned around from there not being enough servers to WoW is dying.
---
Give it a month and people will stop talking about this.
---
That's pretty much a 60 right there.
---
You don't seem to understand that we're turning the 7/minute into a "chance" because it helps people understand how and why slower weapons are better, so I'm gonna just stop.
---
Please enlighten everyone then
---
ThreatPlates too.
---
It's not like there's a lot of unknowns we know what people will farm and how they'll farm it.  We know there's and fuck ton of mages and their dicks get hard for aoeing.
---
Red shoulders pads and a hand me down shield? Must be a Weasley
---
 Yes, because my post definitely says WoW is dying, you are clearly very high IQ.
---
This speaks to me so much right now, canceled my sub already but the last month or two of gaming playing wow has been amazing, I missed it so much the planning and execution of completing my goals in wow was giving me so much reward but now I really don‚Äôt even want to log in.  I‚Äôve tried giving myself the go ahead since I still have the rest of my month left but even then I cannot log in at the moment. There are so few places or reasons in life that easily butt up against my principles (first world problems and all /s) and this one seems so obvious above and beyond most other things that if I ignore it I‚Äôm clearly doing more harm to myself than any amount of gaming will justify, and believe me I‚Äôve used gaming as justification for ignoring just about every other problem I have.     
---
I feel petty not being able to just put it away easily for my principles. I think I‚Äôm going to , I had just hoped it would be easier. 
---
Then in a perfect world blizzard would lash out at China and say fuck this shit , free HongKong  and make events for it inside WoW itself supporting human rights.  It‚Äôs an American company , I thought that meant something different growing up I guess.
---
Devilsaur is way better than other pre-raid options.
---
Yeah, I didn't either when I first started and had to be told. I remember it being a huge relief to finally have some more space to place my buttons.
---
Sounds like you need to have a sit down and look at what a friend is to you. A friend won't get shitty at you for something like this (unless he is only playing because you want him to)
---
Rockbiter is higher average DPS and you don't deal with this crap. It actually feels way stronger because you don't need to heal/bandage anytime you get relatively bad RNG or WF proc when a mob is at 5% health.
---
Pservers hamdle it fine. It's just that even modern blizz servers don't for some reason.
---
Rockbiter is just straight up better than WF. Paladins don't have the luxury of SoR being consistently better than SoC do they?
---
15 and 19 dude?  I don't think this game I for you if you're burnt out at that point.
---
I never got burned out, so I guess you're just not into it. I also only play 1-2 nights a week for maybe 5 hours tops.
---
Its almost like a market of 1.3billion people isn't something to be taken lightly
---
Yea mats have double to tripled in price on my server. Thankfully already got them.
---
Friends. Really i more enjoy just chillin with the guys in Discord. WoW is a happy byproduct.
---
Fkn Hate multiboxers. And blizzard even more for allowing it.

---
What does MS&gt;OS mean? Seen it a bunch but cant quite make it out
---
You've just described every economic system. What changes would you propose to alleviate that?
---
The only thing that actually needs to change is that consumers need to become more concerned and informed. We'd demand companies do the right things, and if they didn't we'd stop giving them our money. And presto! The whole system is turned on it's head and companies are suddenly competing over who can be the most moral!
---
The trouble is getting people to become much more concerned and informed is a realistic task which requires much patience, intelligence and hard work. It's about a thousand times harder than for example... voting for a "well meaning" communist government...
---
If i enlighten everyone, protesters will knock on my door.
---
Happy cake day!

Wowhead posted a pretty convincing metrics article

https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
Thanks yea that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm concluding. Is there any hit gear before late 50s?
---
Oh, thanks!
---
Yeah Did you like my post
---
I went back to retail, at the end of the day. Retail is just a more developed, refined game. 
---
If I'm going to sink *Hours* of my life into something then I want to know I'll have something to show for it. 
---
Classic burnt out for me because I realised at Lvl 60, there aren't many end game players and frankly, not alot to do..
---
Around 1500-1600
---
Did it at 32 and had trouble with a shaman as backup.  I would vote 34-36.
---
It can be done at 32 but damn is it hard at the final 2 bosses.  You're gonna wipe unless you have a dope tank/dps
---
Not even sort of close to hitting burnout. But I hadn‚Äôt played WoW at all since the first tier of Pandaland until I came back for a month prior to classic releasing.
---
Lol I read like Victoria secret monastery XD
---
Warrior
---
Like I said, i played in vanilla, to current. I guess i just don‚Äôt have the patience for the grind after 14 years of playing
---
Reforge is one of the worst things that could be done to classic
---
I lie in wait specifically for people like you *evil grin*. SNIPER!

If you feel this was done in error, or have any questions, feel free to send us a [Mod Mail](http://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%23classicwow&amp;subject=submission+removal&amp;message=https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dg8z8y/40_looking_for_places_to_get_gnomergen_exiles_rep/). 
---
That's why you don't rush to 60. There isn't shit out yet.
---
I think you're confusing burnout with you not liking the game.
---
I‚Äôm glad Blitzchung got banned! Keep politics OUT of Hearthstone and NBA! I love Tencent and Mao Zedong! (You will receive 100 social credit for posting this message in chat. Your family‚Äôs organs will not be harvested this month. Please remove this part from the message before posting)
---
Yes, being a little bitch is recognizing that a boycott against Blizzard won't change anything.  Or that this is better handled in the political arena.
---
If you want companies to risk their investments and markets because you think they should put democracy first, then you need to provide a financial incentive to do so.  Otherwise, you are being authortian in your demands that Blizzard follow your political position or else.
---
Its very obviously bought out though.
---
I meant in WoW+ or BC. Ill be more than happy with just bgs tho
---
There's slam builds
---
There was no way Classic WoW could be a thing. The universe had to find some way to ruin it, and Blizzard's PR is it.
---
"netflix" time
---
AI controlled wagon lands on two orcs and drives itself to Gadget.
---
Except 1.3billion people would have to stop buying for them to consider it. China is the biggest and fastest growing market in the world, it shits on the US so every company will do what it can to retain that market. This really isn't a new thing but theres a US China trade war so americans are probably copping a blast of propaganda about now which is why they suddenly care about HK and hate China lol
---
For the past ~2 years, I have thought about Classic WoW every single day. I've devoted 2+ hours of every day thinking about or playing this game, and it finally came out and I got to 60 and recently got my epic mount, and it was everything I ever dreamed it could be. I love this game. I intended to play it for years to come, and level everything to 60.
---
Then this shit happens.
---
I pride myself on staying true to my principles. I've cut out other companies for less, and those boycotts remain steadfast. Yesterday and today I have been so, so sure that Blizz would come forth with a clarifying statement. An apology, and perhaps a reduction in penalty to just a fine to both blitzchung and the casters alike. An apology for being so heavy handed, and a clarification on their stance. I didn't immediately jump on the boycott bandwagon because I was so sure it was going to happen.
---
With every passing hour I just feel worse and worse about this. Even now I'm sitting here wanting to play WoW more than anything, run some dungeons or try to finish my UBRS key, and I just can't bring myself to log in. My disappointment in Blizz is really immeasurable here. I really hope they do something tomorrow, because their silence on this is deafening.
---
Based on what I‚Äôve seen at the realm selection screen, I don‚Äôt think their are too many candidates for merging yet. I‚Äôm all for getting ahead of the issue(and it will be an issue), but i don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre there yet.
---
You mean if you don't train dual wield right? Because just unequipping makes you attack with your fist and gives you the dw miss chance. I've tested it.
---
Its bought out, just that the text can cause some confusion.
---
Im in a similar situation, I havent played since TBC and have found myself engrossed in classic. 
---
Yesterday I cancelled my subscription. I will keep playing until it runs out and unless I see a big change from blizzard I will walk away.
---
Pray I'm not a hcim
---
Not nearly as high of an IQ as would be required to suggest server mergers.
---
Did you complain about the queues?
---
because you're not supposed to ask questions on reddit. it's a site for memes and daddy jokes.
---
Not really it's called a tremor totem. Any tank worth a spot in a raid can easily stance dance
---
For horde it's very unlikely
---
Explain to me how clicking 2 buttons and posting thorium, and then logging out is considered more effort than most are willing to do.   
---
Are you that lazy?
---
Tastes change. If you're sub 20 and burning out, I really don't think this game is right for the current you.
---
Neither, you do need to find the recipe for it though. Luckily it was cheap for me on the AH.
---
Nah man, it‚Äôs burnout for sure. Can‚Äôt say i hate a game I‚Äôve played for 14 years ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø . I mean i have played every night this week and I just don‚Äôt feel like the reward is worth the time put in

This mainly, heaps of my mates were talking about rushing to 60 and then... waiting for everyone else to hit 60.

so horde rogues, orc male, and all alliance players? got it

Warlocks: is [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/45002035122011051-20303-50500001) a decent leveling spec for a PvP server? Also, how useful is improved drain soul and improved drain life?
---
Oh come on... You gonna bitch out that quick?
---
Since there's no pvp, it's mostly just an influx of gold. Meaning farming greys outside DM will become basically worthless compared to farming items to sell other players.
---
It can't be burnout, you're fucking level 14/19 lmao.
---
I‚Äôm in the same boat. I‚Äôve tried countless times throughout WoW history. And I just can‚Äôt. I want to. I love the look and they seem fun. But it just feels off. I guess it‚Äôs good that Blizz did a great job making their height seem as legit as possible. But I can‚Äôt do it.
---
&gt;they're getting just a bit too much shit over this when all they did was try to take the actions they needed to take as a business and not as a sympathizer of the people
---
The entire point here is to make it uneconomical to make these sorts of calculated decisions to appease brutal dictatorships. 
---
Blizzard deserves no pity, they're a corporation trying to maximize their profits and completely neglecting their moral responsibility as a big actor in the world. 
---
That is only sustainable as long as the consumers let them.
---
In guild we did DKP despite flawed in vanilla. Loot council while a thing should be clearly printed via spreadsheet and communicated and linked prior to any raids. Changes shouldn't occur mid-range.
---
It sounds like your guild has a core that is entitled to loot after losing rolls and started to take control to re-distribute loot without clearly communicating this.
---
This is easily and clearly would cause most guilds to have members leave. I've had this happen in vanilla and we re-formed as a new hardcore raiding guild with somewhere around 75-80% of our raiding group and continued raiding successfully, more successfully than the core, and pushed for server firsts. I left weeks and re-rolled with some friends on a new server and I couldn't handle the 4-5 days a week of 5-6 hours raiding that the new guild wanted (Working on Chrom and then Nef before either were down world-wide)
---
MC and Ony is easy and there shouldn't be huge demands on time for raiding at this time. And if you're already 60 in a group of 60s then you already sunk in, assuming and likely, more time than an average player or older player. Leave or re-form a new guild of the animosity if enough without the 'core' or 'leaders' in the current guild.
---
You could have done what most AH whores do and just bit on it on an alt, or get a mate to bid on it at the price you wanted to action it at.
---
Nobody actually cares about this, many people pretend they do because this conflict has entered their echo-chamber. They will stop caring about this in a few weeks, like all conflicts.   
---
Nobody actually cares, and if you do. Go move to China and do something about it, posting on twitter/reddit is not going to accomplish anything.
---
Do what makes you happy man. Healing is fun. I played a holy pally all the way through Vanilla and had a great time doing it.
---
Making me want another pally. Might go start my alt.

my realm is full as fuck what do uw ant

We have known about Chinese atrocities for decades, and Blizzard has had a very large Chinese audience since the early days of WoW. You've been supporting them the entire time, it makes little difference that they are so flagrantly defending Chinese authority now. The people who made the games you love are likely just as upset as we are, the problem is within the corporate conglomeration that cashes the cheques. We really can't expect a private corporation to do anything less than following the trail of money, write to your members of government and protest your nation's Chinese policy. The Australian government has been Kowtowing to them for years, and it disgusts me, but I still love my country. Hopefully this helps a little.
---
You are lvl 22. this just the very early beginning of the process (44~ is 50%). I would Level as you like and see later on :) you get your mount for free so you have some spare gold to respec
---
I don‚Äôt trust Pantheon to be a good game with Brad McQuaid at the helm.
---
Dude, it‚Äôs burnout, too much time, too little reward.  There is plenty to do, just burnt out on it
---
I don't care for add-ons, I just Google the world map, look at the level ranges of an area and go there. No one seems to be mentioning here that quests alone won't level you up completely. You'll need to do a little grinding where you can. Usually dungeon runs are good for that.
---
Of course they are, no one can deny that. But it's also the right thing to do for this sub.
---
r/hearthstone is letting the topic run free because it happened in a Hearthstone tournament. If it happened in a Classic WoW PvP tournament instead, it would be appropriate for r/classicwow to allow more freedom and r/hearthstone to have a megathread.
---
Why were you ganking lowbies?
---
hahahahahaah, mate if only you knew what pretty much every company you ever supported has done, probably far worse things than this.

You are delusional if you honestly believe you're accomplishing anything by not playing.

TBC is something I‚Äôm fine with as long as there is no fucking flying. But it does make azeroth feel a lot more dead since everyone is gonna be in Outland and the old content becomes useless again.

Ruined *their multinational growth and investor assets*
---
See no reason why they couldn‚Äôt just plateau and make games outside of China
---
This isn't about a moral high ground for me. These events simply broke the spell that Classic WoW held over me. I had been eagerly anticipating the release of this game for years along with the rest of you. And I have sunk far too many hours into it since it was released. 
---
But after hearing the news about what Blizzard did I was enraged. I canceled my account that day.
---
Now I don't feel that rage anymore. I have come to realize that there is no ethical consumption in capitalism. And while Blizzard's actions were certainly deplorable, they are far less odorous than the actions that virtually any other corporation one cares to look into. 
---
However,  I still will *not* be continuing to play Classic WoW. This decision isn't based on some sense of moral superiority, or any duty to the people of Hong Kong. I do care about their freedom and human rights. I care about freedom and rights for all people. But if I still enjoyed Classic WoW I would probably still play it.
---
But I don't enjoy Classic anymore. I have logged in several times since the incident, and each time it is the same. The joy just isn't there. The sense of disgust I feel with Blizzard's actions shook the fun out of the game for me.
---
we've known about american atrocities for centuries so should blizz stop providing wow to Americans or what???
---
It happened, Bryce was there.
---
good, leave. Fuck HK and the protestors, long live china.

Sure retail is great

Though classic is better

Oh a great experience

Lots of cool quests

I‚Äôm not going to play

Zoning issues with WiFi
---
Zarya is also a cool blizz character
---
Bro, idk what anyone else is saying, but Fury all the way. 2h is the way to go until you're 60 and get at least 6 to 8% hitcap from gear. Its super fun, it's great getting a tiny sustain buff from Bloodlust, and Dual Wield later feels phenomenal.
---
Just to spite you
---
Raiding, I said raiding. There's no pvp in game yet, no BGs, just pointless killing. There's no gear for Ferals, nothing, it's utter shit.
---
Sure, I'll wait for another 2 years for BG's to appear in game and start playing Druid again.
---
Until then, it's a worthless class for anything other than running around picking fucking herbs.
---
Some gear is bis for a long time.
---
Riddle me this! I have a Lenovo Legion Y520 PC with NVIDIA GEFORCE GTX. I was playing WoW Classic no problem whatsoever. But, suddenly, I get this error message. I can't play WoW Classic but can play regular WoW.
---
Cause it's fun. Sue me! I'm only level 32 so once more than 3 show up I go to the other side of the map.
---
Since blizzard hasn't committed to it, we have no idea of knowing what Classic+ would be.
---
Many people talk about new zones/raids for sure. I haven't really seen level cap mentioned, but occasionally the concept of linear progression raiding shows up.
---
Aka you'd need to get enough people in T1 sets to be able to do T2 raids. Continue that each step until you reach whatever ends up being the final raid.
---
There's a sub called /r/classicwowplus but I don't think it's overly active.
---
This is it. Too much time grinding or waiting for a group for a dungeon, and walking, I can see how a lot of people used to have time for this, and how people such as myself just don‚Äôt anymore. I just was hoping i would have gotten further down the road before i hit this wall
---
This is pretty lame. Despite being a small (and hilarious) issue, spending time fixing this while there are still actual real issues deserving of their attention is just obnoxious. I will start caring about Infernals once my random DCs stop, people stop inviting me to gold selling guilds, crafted items stop disappearing, AH sniping bots disappear, and for god sake will someone please fix the missing diplomat quest? I have done it in two servers now and needed multiple tickets each time to complete. It is a great game and people fucking with each other is part of what makes it great, this did not need fixing
---
That's not even remotely close to true. I've described the current system - the world economy hasn't always been commodity production for private profit of the owners of capital.   
---
I think one way to alleviate the issues of the system would be to increase the role that democracy places in our economy. We're much more likely to treat people fairly when the economy is under the control of everyone, instead of a small, rich group.
---
And top the meters!
---
No they don‚Äôt. If you don‚Äôt put in the effort, you don‚Äôt get loot. Very simple
---
Classic wow wasn't even their idea. The community wanted it. Blizzard even told the community they didn't want it and they wouldn't make it.
---
Bryce probably managed to grab a Hunter bag instead of TBC.
---
Wolf need to be in melee proximity to buff them... Eat a single cleave and die.
---
That's pretty common as far as a response goes. Just doesn't line up with me personally.
---
AQ won't be out for another 2 or 3 years, at best.
---
Sure, I'll wait until then to play the Druid again, at the moment it's a worthless and pointless class for raiding with. I know you're feeling pity and stuff for druids and talking them up and all that jazz but be honest, you know they're a shit worthless class until BG's come out.
---
Funny future scenario where China runs a clone of retail wow for their audience; but all future creative content from American Blizzard is just banworthy enough while well designed so there‚Äôs still Chinese demand for it
---
&gt; Paladins don't get fun to play until ~~BC~~ WotLK.
---
Stealth classes can also run right up against the UBRS door and /tar Jed for around 10 seconds to find him. Note that many classes can get to the door for a few seconds (as a shaman I can Stoneclaw/Earthbind and get there safely) but unless you can stay there for a good 10 seconds there is a chance you could miss him.
---
Also to note Jed's patrol is around 6 minutes long, so if you zone in and don't go to the corner (shown in this video) immediately, you can miss him and have to wait around 6 mins for him to be in range again.
---
It is but it's your best guess at assuming the percentages of horde to alliance. Nothing beats data when making judgements.
---
Also, in a close finish and with lots of start attack macros it's incredibly easy to dish out an accidental killing blow 0.2sec after the duel ends.
---
People do it for the fun and challenge.
---
That's like asking why people play on the hardest difficulty on games.
---
I guess you can't see so well anymore since they lost their shit and got modded on so many comments.
---
I‚Äôve no issue sticking with a character but my issue is I‚Äôve had to start again. On a PVP server because I wanted world PVP and so I‚Äôve had to ditch my level 42 on a PVE server, but I‚Äôm just not feeling it too much especially cos in alliance but that might change once i get into neutral zones cos I‚Äôm only level 20 atm.
---
I dont believe in boycotts personally. Every company has the right to their opinion. I don't have to like it or support it to enjoy the fruits of the companies labor. 
---
Personally i think Hong Kong is screwed, as the rest of China has been - and i feel for them. This is what happens to a country when you limit speech and criminalize opposing views speech. I just hope america figures that out before we see this here.
---
Inaccurate and outdated data is worse
---
Oof. That‚Äôs sad :(
---
Nay incendius
---
They won't do plus cause it's risky and requires far more effort, I think, but I'd really rather plus. Ik people love tbc and wotlk but a new twist on the classic would be great

Dude sounds like a sweaty neckbeard. If he and 39 other people had so little going on in their lives that they could afford to spend a week sitting in their chairs grinding 60 and getting geared, and were then shameless enough to think they should be BRAGGING about it, they're either still in K-12 or NEETing hard. 
---
Either way it's kinda sad that it's something dude is proud of. Fact is, all it'll take for them to splinter and fall apart is one misstep that enough people don't like, and with the egos I'm imagining, it's when, not if.
---
Not me, hit 60 finally today because i stuck to my lock.
---
i doubt it after the reaction when they announced it 
---
do you really think they woukd release it then?
---
it was supposed to release this year and was ready to release in febuary
---
if its not playable with a rock solid release date at blizzcon its not coming out at all, i think thats a fair assumption
---
Combat is a blast and fun for me.
---
I'm still subbed even though I barely play. I'm getting overwatch on switch in a week too!
---
I mean the int bonus is a non factor at 60 since it's base mana.
---
For sure I love the GM to death, but there are a lot of shenanigans and dying when we bring some of these people into runs.
---
I was listening to a podcast with ret pally that should know what he is talking about. The answer seemed to be that no it is not necessarily any better. Obviously there are a lot of factors though.
---
Yeah I mained a pally in vanilla in a guild that downed about half of naxx before everyone didn‚Äôt want to raid as TBC approached. I pretty much just spammed low rank FOL and cleanse on fights and the most outside of buffing was auto attacking and rejudging seals. I never went OOM and had pretty great healing efficiency but it wasn‚Äôt particularly fun. Mained a warrior from TBC onwards lol 
---
Solo play you can certainly get creative. I was 31 in holy but 15 into ret for SOC and with some decent gear like judgement and BWL 2hander a shockadin/ret combo was a PITA to kill and could hold its own. PVP healing was a lot more fun in general because of the pally toolkit (BoS to avoid CC, BOP, BOF, etc) when I played with the GM groups

Lol... well were ranked #2 on our server for speed clearing mc... guess we are shit cuz you say so.
---
Is this the thread for this, man? I mean, I understand the disappointment and all. Although, this is a simple 'I'm Horde wearing an Alliance shield'.
---
I'm about to drop my guild. They rushed to 60 so quickly and have been clearing raids for a while now. I'm still around 40 and feel like there's no place for me. It's my first time playing wow, so I didn't want to burn through it like the rest of my guild. Here's hoping there are some guilds like yours on my server lol
---
10g short of.. 100?? Or 10g short of 90? Either way just Google a raw gold grind and get at it.
---
Totally normal based on my experience
---
Reminds me of ants for some reason.
---
&gt; But then there's PvP, which will likely be very mage-oriented, so maybe Hunter? Hmm.
---
Hunters do not counter mages in classic. Only warlocks and shadow priests do.
---
Just watch south park: band in China.
---
My guess is the +5 applies to your ambush opener and the strength from crusader wouldn't apply till after?
---
The funniest thing I've heard from this game is the idea that raid gear should go to people without pre raid bis, so that the raid as a whole gets stronger faster. Like why would you bother gearing for raids if it disqualifies you from getting gear.
---
Not directly related to your point but a similar sort of sentiment that I have heard regarding effort in the fight.
---
If your raid guild cares that much then they are not worth raiding with.
---
Hunters in pvp never drop off they basically have a giant "clothies fuck off" zone around them. Add in the raw utility they bring to battlegrounds. They are arguably one of the most reliable classes to pvp with.
---
Traps, flares, tracking, a spammable slow on druids, two bodies to interrupt flag caps, hunters mark for stealth.
---
They have strong points in all 3 bgs.
---
Pve. Yes they fall off but rarely hard enough to be a problem. And as idiot proof as rotations are in classic the fact hunters still do damage while oom means that honestly the floor of them is higher, for casuals who don't manage Mana or consumables
---
Reserved groups make sense. If you only want/need one piece of gear from a dungeon, why not maximize your chance to get it? As long as you're transparent about it I don't see the problem.
---
Ultimately, IMO at least, reserved groups are better than groups who simply don't take certain classes because they would be competing with the group leader for certain loot.
---
After Vanguard I wouldn‚Äôt trust another game by McQuaid.
---
I meant 5 hours between the 2 nights. I mean I still find it rewarding but I'm only level 44. So I certainly have a lot to do. Especially with DM coming out (I disagree with). There's so much to do I don't see myself getting bored for a year.
---
Really want to see his pets name.
---
You've got a lot of good advice already so I'll just mention that you can use the terrain near the AQ gong to kite Solenar and/or his bugs onto a little ledge and then jump off it. Makes the overall kite a bit easier.
---
Hayven‚Äôs videos were awesome. He put a lot of effort into them and really seemed to enjoy what he was doing.
---
It was really hard to hear him get weaker and weaker as time went on. Fuck cancer.
---
Greens are prebis for some people. Sounds like your leader doesn‚Äôt understand the council part of loot council.
---
&gt;Have you given any thought about canceling?
---
Not even a little bit.
---
&gt;Like why would you bother gearing for raids if it disqualifies you from getting gear.
---
Yea we had to have that conversation in my guild a while ago. People who put a lot of time into their character care more. Gear should go to the highest performers first and foremost so that gear can be put to the best us.
---
&gt; No, the world economy has always been about that.
---
It hasn't. For most of human history, people produced for themselves, their families, and their communities. Commodity production and exchange didn't become the dominant form until relatively recently.  
---
&gt; That's rather vague. Can you elaborate?  
---
Sure. One method of increasing democracy in the economy is by democratizing workplaces: having workers own companies as co-ops instead of being owned by shareholders. Another approach is to have the government control production of certain products, so that the population as a whole has control over production (although this would also need significant democratization of the government itself, so that it is beholden to everyone instead of just the rich and powerful).
---
Free Undercity!!!
---
*Cancelled*
---
My flatmate was doing the quests in Felwood in that Dread Tunnel with all the demons, invited a hunter because why not.
---
3 blue boes and a 16s bag all went to the hunter within the next 2 hours.
---
I laugh.
---
You'd think the hunter would have some shame and pass on at least one piece.
---

Agree on tauren i honestly like night elves though they are kind of a close to kinda far second. You mispelled it btw, it‚Äôs correctly spelled as ‚ÄúGnomes‚Äù
---
Don‚Äôt stand for this poor etiquette and rules. Keep your values strong and join the other more respectful guild.
---
Is the rotation dual wielding in defensive stance using revenge and hs, switching to a shield for shield slam and eventually to berserker stance for whirlwind?
---
Also I personally hate playing without tactical mastery which you will max out at lvl 50.
---
No. 
---
Now go ahead and unsubscribe from this sub as well, so we can continue talking about WoW.
---
Use eagle eye to scout all three of his spawn points from one location
---
All you china hating inbreds are too funny
---
That's fine, but this guy seems to enjoy multi boxing.
---
I was getting a cathedral group going and there was a warrior who refused to tank.  After an hour of looking for just a tank he offered to tank if the rest of the group paid him 25 silver each.  That's not a big sum of money but honestly the idea of supporting that behavior kind of turned me off and I just logged off for a bit.
---
If that is the case, how would +5 damage on ambush be stronger then the multiple 15 seconds of 100-200 strength that would follow afterwards during the fight with crusader, consider that is 100-200 attack power.
---
I went ahead and specced full feral for leader to make things a bit easier. You made a great point I never considered which is I‚Äôll never get NS till 60 anyways. I‚Äôll just grind out dungeons and change at the end game depending on my needs. Thank you for the response!
---
12% is not just china, it's the entire Asia-Pacific region, so that's including several other large markets for Blizzard.
---
Just keep questing for your gold. You'll have 10g by level 41-42.
---
I am tanking MC in a HotW / nature swiftness build (like many other ferals) so the build is solid. I would get applicable talents in feral and then start working on the resto tree. Forget balance. You can then join as either a healer or tank and by the time you hit 60 you will be BiS tank &amp; heals and probably DPS too. I think gearing now is best because I was pretty green on the heal set at 60 and I struggled with groups having a dps pissing contest and pulling agro which is every non-guild run
---
What the fuck are you even on about? 
---
It has nothing to do with any kind of ‚Äúspotlight‚Äù given to any group of people, you fucking dingus. 
---
It‚Äôs about the silencing of Blitzchung and taking away his tournament winnings, and also firing the casters. 
---
Pay attention some fucking time.
---
But what kind of father blames his kids for being a ninja?
---
That only works when the maze doesn‚Äôt ever loop back on itself.
---
uhh, pretty sure you don't need to go to Hong Kong to see what's happening, there's hundreds of videos and tons of articles about this.
---
Farmed the owlkins southeast winterspring. Giant eggs and they die easy
---
I'd guess shamans have mana issues too, eh?
---
The int bonus isn't a non factor, more int is always more valuable. 5% bonus into is calculated after int from equip. For every 59.5 int you have you get 1% crit chance. It's become more significant the more int you have. And more mana is never a downside.
---
Also, escape artist is insanely useful in PvP and pve. The human racials are just objectively bad.
---
Play each to 20, I think every class changes and finally feels like the real class around 20 or so.
---
Low effort my ass, I had to modelviewer that shit!, and also.. why you so angry..
---
I'm playing with a friend and it's a struggle to wait for them to login some nights they're busy. On launch I left them behind and they basically quit after playing solo for a few days. I'm loathe to speed off like that again.
---
So a question for you. Do you:
---
A) Split up and just chat in discord while you play
---
or 
---
b) Pick zones to do together and do different ones solo so you're on the same quests
---
Yes but allstar points are calculated in comparison to the same class not overall
---
I am leveling my as holy. It might be a touch slower. But I also never die, and can get into tougher fights than a ret.
---
Retailers have used this addon for over 10 years, so no use telling you to go there.
---
Keep painting your figures and editing your comments you creep lmao, get a life and maybe U won‚Äôt die a virgin.
---
I'm proud of your mom for showing all her action bars.
---
If you can‚Äôt even take the time to spell opportunity right, it‚Äôs low effort.
---
Razorgore?
---
I‚Äôll play with you
---
the thing when they bonded the classic wow to subscription is a fine example of their rotten soul.
---
I prefer just rolling. Let the RNG gods decide who gets stuff. DKP is lame because you shouldn't be punished for not making every raid and should be able to roll on loot you helped get. And a loot council is always a shit show and people get favorited.
---
;-; whats your ign
---
The game literally gives you queues when there's a rogue nearby. You hear the stealth noise and can target them for a short moment. Spy doesnt notify you of anything you couldn't normally see.
---
I'm an idiot and wasn't spamming - wrongly assumed hitting it once would work. Thanks for the tip
---
Heres the problem, you see what other people are doing and think, thats cool, I wanna be like that! 
---
But what you must do is think about what you wanna be and whats cool to you - only then can you find yourself and rise to 60 with a main.
---
I'll add my two cents to the discussion: 
---
Fuck Blizzard. 
---
Fuck the Chinese Government
---
They were absolutely making a political statement. Did you see Blizzards embarrassing response where they apologized to China? Their political statement is that stock price is more important than human rights.
---
Dm east has guaranteed rich veins at the end and 2 man parties can easily solo runs there in 10-15 min each.
---
You don‚Äôt need to be exalted with your faction to get a mount. You only need to be exalted with another faction to get their mount.
---
Save Hong Kong fuck blizzard
---
I have cancelled all three of my wow subs it'll end 13th/19th/22nd of October. I really love classic it freaking amazing but I can't support a company that would do this. Basically turn their back on the rest of the world to keep Winnie the pooh happy.  
---
I am still playing until it expires as I have a couple thousand black dragonscales. I intend on making a few people that I really enjoy playing with really rich before it expires
---
They could have as easily given Blitzchung a light slap on the wrist and say they don't approve of political messages in their events. But instead they dropped that hammer, shut down 3 careers, and apologized to a government while waving the apolitical flag. We're all used to companies appeasing the Communists, but we shouldn't be okay with them challenging our rights as equal consumers.
---
&gt;you wouldn't be able to make use of the information as quickly or as consistently
---
Sounds exactly like recount, dbm, and just about every addon ever.
---
Ohhhh you‚Äôre just here to be salty.. warcraft logs did. Ya know the website apes uses for logs?
---
"Bought by China"
---
As I said some classic gear is just stupid, wouldn't hurt too much
---
If you don‚Äôt have the money to buy your own factions mount at level 40 there is no way you could possibly afford the materials required to get exalted with another faction just to get their mount. My advise would be to get your own races mount at 40 because it will save you so much time then when you get close to 60 you can start working hard at getting the runecloth and money you need to do so.
---
Spend the 90g by getting your racial 60% mount. At max level you‚Äôll get more runecloth than you know what to do with and can donate cloth endlessly for exalted easily for the epic mount.
---
Not gonna lie - classic has been the most fun I‚Äôve had in 15 years. Not gonna let some random tweet from a blizzard account in one of their smallest regions sway me from playing a quality product. Sucks that the guy lost his winnings, blizzard is a shitty company for doing it, but damn the game is so good.
---
I like your style of thinking
---
We all can‚Äôt have good taste.
---
I assume if you raid, you wouldn‚Äôt use deadly boss mods, exact same concept just in a pve setting.
---
yep you were always allowed to do that.
---
Blizzard in full SquadW mode
---
His level is showing as '??' which I think means he has to be more than 10 levels above me
---
Daggers are generally a lot weaker, so the extra damage helps with ambush etc since alot of the abilities multiply directly off weapon damage which multiply‚Äôs with crit too? 
---
I‚Äôm no expert just giving my 2 cents, let me know if I‚Äôm wrong
---
Blitzchung knew the risks when he did what he did. He broke rules when he used a victory speech to address politics. You guys aren't even making good memes.
---
Don't think Deadlyboss mod is affecting Ragnoroses stealth.
---
&gt; Economic exchange, trade, has always been amoral. 
---
I think I agree with you here - it's probably always involved some form of exploitation. My point is that exchange has not always been the core of the economy - people have produced for themselves and their communities. Also, none of this means that it's impossible for a future system to be free from exploitation.  
---
&gt; What makes you think that workers would choose the well-being of others over themselves?   
---
They're not guaranteed to do the right thing, but it's more likely that they do than shareholders do. As an example, a worker-owned company is less likely to pollute: the workers will actually have to deal with the consequences of pollution, while the owners (who may not even live in the community) is more likely to be sheltered from it. It's the same reason why we have elections instead of a monarch - democracy makes it more likely that the will of the people is represented.   
---
&gt; Regarding your second point, our governments generally already control the production of certain public and strategic goods.  
---
Yeah, my point is that this could be expanded
---
You'll have to go off the grid and become self sustaining to stop supporting anything that caters to china.
---
Kill all rouges, bastards were made for one thing.

I did the same thing in star trek online once.
---
Got a rare ship that was worth about 750 million credits, an absolute shitload of money , especially at that time. Accidently left a zero off the price and sold it for 75 million. It was immediately purchased by an auction bot the instant it posted. I quit playing STO for 2 years after that.
---
discord.gg/9GX46yp
---
Yea Scarlet arms not a bad idea. What lvl is that? 40?
---
Reminds me of how Mal'Ganis during Wrath had &lt;Goon Squad&gt;, a guild that you had to pay a monthly subscription to be part of. They had various tiers, the highest of which was above $100/mo.
---
At some point you have to drop the facade of ‚ÄúBUT THE RULES SAID‚Äù. 
---
We‚Äôre talking human rights here. There‚Äôs a tipping point where you choose a side between rules and morality. 
---
You know Blizzard went above and beyond in their punishment of not only Blitzchung but the casters to only hopes to appease China.
---
It‚Äôs not the Chinese audience but the Chinese government they are worried about.
---
It's called ppm, or procs per minute. The amount of time crusader provides you 100 ap, gets outweighed by the +5 damage, which equals out to around +25 str with 100% uptime, vs 100 str with 15% uptime.
---
I've been leveling as holy and I'm nearly level 52 at about 7 days played (including afk time, professions, and not such a strict levelling regime.)
---
It's not so bad. I wear full healing gear in dungeons and wear a mix of int and str / warrior gear for soloing. For some reason, sword and board has been working better for me than a two hander, but it comes down to whatever best weapon I've got.
---
I've been having a blast. When soloing is going a little slow, I throw a Holy Shock and judge a little more often. I'm almost always using SoR, but judge Wisdom for the mana recovery. I can burst things down if I have to.
---
I'm comfortable as hell with Holy and I'd do it all over again if I had to.
---
My two cents.
---
Salty fucking neck beard . Go shit in your own soup and stop pushing these false statements as fact . Druid is one of the most fun classes to play imo. And I know that doesn‚Äôt mean dick to you or most people .  But People who play a Druid fucking love playing a Druid . It‚Äôs not for everyone , clearly it‚Äôs not for you . Re roll you‚Äôre stereotypical fuck boy class and leave playing a Druid to the big boys .
---
Get any mount right now. The cheapest one available to use. It will pay for itself.
---
Anyone playing alliance on Myzrael after midnight server time?
---
Have you seen your current administration?
---
It's a +5 factored into every ability. Dagger spec has insane scaling and dagger is really low base damage. Also the opener is really important.
---
I just tamed him today.
---
I spent 6 hours on that rock and cast eagle eye over 1000 times.
---
That's all I can suggest.
---
If you're not griefing the people who do and your name is reasonable no one will even notice you're there.
---
DD's a good place, and more times than not RP servers have the best and most helpful communities.
---
I‚Äôve been playing pretty much every day since launch for average of 2.5 hours per day and I am just approaching 40, granted not going speed run or anything. 
---
Many people on my server and on here are 60 and for weeks now. in one thread someone farmed dragons for 70 hours after hitting 60! my question is how long per day are you playing? are you staying up all night? after school? what are your lives that allow you to play so much?
---
There is a baron run, but that‚Äôs for the expanded t 0.5.
---
Capitalist company cares about money? Shocking. Communist government working to control what's happening to it's country? MORE shocking. You're just being annoying. Go into /pol to talk about it keep it out of here. At least we can both agree it's a clear and direct violation of the rules.
---
Hey look at that, I was right! Other subs were wondering why there was no mention about HK on this sub, people were asking the mods what the hell happened, so they posted **another megathread** to clarify it. 
---
Which they could have avoided if they had simply stickied this one. 
---
I‚Äôll hold my breath while waiting for you to admit I was right.
---
God I hope so.
---
Like first name last name? Or like nothing stupid l/ offensive
---
60 priest, 22 druid, 10 hunter with The Rake., 10 mage. I have a feeling I'll end up playing then all
---
But if that is true, then the same should be true for swords aswell shouldn't it ?
---
Theres a mega thread for a reason, because these posts are allowed
---
Axe in ST +1 hit, Rune of the something trinket from Mara quest, +1 hit.  Mara ring +1 hit... There's some +1 hit bracers that I think are lv 55.... 
---
So, no.  Not that I can think of!
---
‚ÄúAltitis‚Äù: inflammation of the alt
---
I did EXACTLY the same thing
---
Toon - 42 then reroll for a PVP server
---
&gt; Literally no way to break it without breaking recount/details/DBM and most other combat addons too.
---
Not even remotely true.
---
Details doesn't do a ton of combat log parsing. It does some, but mostly for your own abilities. That's why it relies on everyone having it to have accurate data.
---
Besides, Blizzard could scrub specific messages from the combat log with ease. For example, scrub messages related to players entering and exiting stealth. That doesn't break any of the other add-ons you mentioned, or any add-ons that I'm aware of (keeping in mind that obviously an add-on can still see if *you're* stealthed without the combat log).
---
You better be trollin', or at least consider using punctuation next time!
---
Wowhead

And tape yet fheet to teh groond

How does seal if wisdom give aoe threat apart from allowing you to cast more consecrates

If its a PVP server it's horde.  Rest its Alliance
---
You forgot the potion that Wildeyes sells that you need to use to disguise yourself and visit the dreadlord at the end of Jaedenar, that costs 6g.  
---
So 406g, minus 250g if you got another lock with the DM items.
---
I'm in a similar boat, and I decided to cancel my sub and I can't even pull myself to log on before my game days expire. Blizzard just isn't the company I remember any more. They are too busy sucking off China to realize that they are condemning people's cries for freedom.
---
Where is LSD consumption legal? Or do you only give a shit about rules when they don‚Äôt pertain to you? 
---
Get off your dumb shit high horse and realize this is a real issue and belongs in these avenues because it directly pertains to Blizzard. 
---
If you don‚Äôt like it or have the mental fortitude for political discourse, just scroll past it.
---
Mega threads provide actual discussion. If topics like this aren't contained, the rest of the sub becomes unusable. It devolves into memes, the same topics get posted over and over, self-righteous self-posts, the content related to the subreddit gets drowned out.
---
Depends what you're asking.  Of 2 back to back rolls being the same on a 1-1000?  It's 1/1000
---
My main issue with these posts is all these people didn't care about Chinese influence before their precious blizzard got involved, they don't actually care about China or HK they just care about blizzard
---
Laughs in rogue
---
First or last, and yeah. That's accurate enough.

are y'all in The Banished?
---
That‚Äôs not how procs worked in Vanilla.
---
Cya
---
I was honestly dumbfounded when I saw this guy while I was farming the distress beacon... quested the whole zone and farmed for at least 5 hours, no damn beacon.
---
There is a bit more. Such as Blizzard saying they want to preserve the nation‚Äôs dignity. 
---
A bunch of US Senators speaking out against the company.
---
But... companies are going to company. I hate the Chinese government,  but I‚Äôd be in an empty room if I boycotted every company that would have done the same thing that Blizz did.
---
I also eat bananas... and the Banana Republics were almost as bad.
---
It's definitely a weird grey area and nobody involved feels good about it. I think the thing to pay attention to here is that other players are involved. When it comes to dungeons or general monster pathing, it's not only hard to enforce, but it's not really hurting anyone. 
---
The intention with the guards is specifically to protect other players, and by using terrain exploitation you're are "hurting" someone, and it's certainly a lot easier to enforce because people will be reporting you.
---
Bruh my name is Sublimaze!
---
When you see a really good one you get it.
---
Being brain washed must really suck. I wish you luck.
---
Anyone know what to type to say this? Been looking for something so that I can tell the horde anything.
---
Do you even need to do that? Can't you just walk/fall into that crevice halfway down, then walk/fall onto the ramp?
---
I cancelled my subscription but I was doing it at 6 month intervals so..
---
Where are the Alliance quest givers in the Barrens?
---
&gt;Also I wonder if his character creation was permanently cocked up due to flags for both alliance and horde characters showing up on his PvP realm
---
He couldn't create any additional characters on that realm.
---
What‚Äôs the nameplates addon?
---
How does it use /target? When a stealthed rogue comes in range to be revealed, that doesn't show up in the combat log, so is it automating /target?
---
If it takes you 6 swings to get 1 proc for 100 damage it would do less damage than the 6 swings with +20 damage each.
---
Burst damage looks better in real viewing because it feels like you‚Äôre actively doing more in that time. Consistent damage will always be better in situations that call for it(less than 3.4 weapon speed) outside of lucky procs.
---
Probably a streamer

---
What does crowd pummeler drop off?
---
Blizzard definitely goofed here and they definitely punished the guy so severely because China was involved, but that being said any other large company would've done the same. Instead of trying to kill blizzard and punish innocent blizzard employees people should be supporting HK and their movement against China
---
You use a lot of loaded terms and I'm not sure why.
---
First, trade is fundamentally different from exploitation as it's by definition voluntary. An exploitive regime would be called extortion.
---
Now, you say workers are more likely to do the right thing. What is "the right thing"? I don't really agree with your example, but to stay on point: do you think the employees at Blizzard would agree to a pay cut and layoffs to support Hong Kong? If the answer is no then they are no different than the current shareholders.
---
The reply was from blizzard China division.. not blizzard HQ..
---
More so our set bonuses aren't that great.
---
If people are having fun while being in your guild while lvling, then that's fine - if you eventually decide to make the switch to raiding, it's gonna be tough as that is a pretty big hurdle to overcome successfully for a more casual roster, but not impossible.
---
Take one thing at a time, keep your attitude of being open-minded towards those who decide to leave in order to pursue raiding, and you will keep your guild the way it is.
---
Oh, really now? That‚Äôs news to me.
---
In my native tongue my name means dances with tassles.
---
ClassicDB basically steel the data accumulated and use it for their own
---
&gt; It does not show people that haven't done anything to be in your combat log
---
But someone flying over you isn't doing anything to trigger a combat log message, right?
---
In a perfect world, yes, but that genie has been out of the bottle too long and as I understand it Blizz designs encounters now with the assumption that you have that mod. But i do think it really over simplifies the game and lessons personal responsibility and awareness as you don't have to think about what to do, you just have to wait for the alert and do what it tells you "couterspell now!"
---
Thank you for the clarification! Much appreciated.
---
It was probably almost immediately snapped up by an AH addon or something similar, so no time to do that.
---
I'm gonna upvote this every time
---
I personally won't be unsubbing, and I won't stop playing Blizzard games. It's unfortunate for the people in Hong Kong, and I acknowledge that I'm a horrible person for thinking this, but their issues are not my problem, and I'm not going to miss out on enjoyment just to stick it to Blizzard.
---
Is there an Addon that could show me my bank while on the move ? Like s little button or command that I could input so I can see the content. 
---
I have trouble remembering all the stuff that‚Äôs in there so to have it on display at all times would really help.
---
Have you seen the front page of /r/classicwow, today? There's literally just a single post about it...
---
Plenty of other content here if the human rights crisis in Hong Kong and China are too much of an inconvenience for you.
---
They are a private company, providing a service you can freely choose to not participate in.
---
As such they don't need to define any of what you say.
---
why?
---
Because no one is forcing you - or a pro gamer - to play in their tournaments.  Vague doesn't matter unless its a public service, or some service that a resepctive government deems 'critical'.
---
You're right. It's vague. I'm telling you why it doesn't matter.
---
I mean, they wouldn't be worried about the Chinese government if they didn't want access to the Chinese audience. They're absolutely worried about losing it.
---
I used to actually do this a ton as a kid while waiting for a group to fill or just bullshitting with the guild.
---
&gt;What did you mean by trade being amoral, then? Trade isn't really voluntary in a lot of cases - it would be foolish to say that me giving my waller to an armed robber is a voluntary transaction. Similar power dynamics exist in the economy. 
---
It is amoral in the sense that both sides are being driven by a profit motive. If one side doesn't profit, the trade does not happen. An armed robbery is definitely not a trade.
---
&gt;I think it's much more likely for that to happen than for the shareholders to do the same. 
---
We disagree then.
---
&gt;In any case, I think the government is better equipped than individual companies to deal with big, international issues like this.
---
That I agree with. Companies are fundamentally incentivized to maximize profits; governments can take different actions such as sanctions. However, anything that limits trade also disadvantages yourself. Sanctions tend to be unpopular because of that.

not gonna die in mc with 10k+ health and 75% dmg reduction

Ok just curious why the different wordings, +crit strike chance for spells/+crit effect chance for spells

Blizzard's official account on the Weibo platform published an apology. From what I've been told it would be like if a Chinese company posted an apology on Reddit using their corporate account. It's localized to Mandarin and on a Chinese platform, but it would be pretty stupid for them to apologize on Western websites that their Chinese users cannot access. Besides all of that, how would it remove responsibility from the parent company if a branch office went rogue? They would essentially be condoning the message with their silence and inaction at that point.
---
At which level could i aim for Emperor Runs?
---
I'd love thecDreadforge Retaliator for my Shaman as soon as possible.
---
Adding on to that which items do i need?
---
Lol who the fuck cares? Why do you people feel pressured to level so fast? These raids aren‚Äôt going anywhere regardless of how long you take to level. You‚Äôre already out of the race to the top so why are you even worried about content coming in too fast if you‚Äôre taking your time anyway?
---
I have mining on my hunter as well. Paired with skinning, I sell all my findings to help fund myself. Had a mount at 40 with zero issues. There's reasons any class might take mining.
---
Guess what buddy? I've seen multiple mobs that are not listed on that site, using the same move and getting 2x extra swings randomly. It's even called the same thing in the combat log. Either Blizzard is applying this ability retroactively as a dynamic difficulty bug, or this database is seriously lacking in complete information.
---
Yeah remember that - Rallon Zek or something
---
Also I believe the PVP was split differently depending on the server.. I played on a "team" pvp server where it was split between the races 
---
something like:
---
Dark races = dark elves, iksar, trolls ,ogre
---
"shorties" = halfling, dwarves, gnomes
---
Humans = barbarians, humans, erudites
---
Elves = high elves, wood elves, half elves
---
Also remember all exp was basically just grinding mobs.. but you would have to camp certain areas and usually with a group just to do that... especially certain classes.  
---
nostalgia rush over here sorry
---
I would go to thousand needles and start the test of endurance quest, just chill on top of the lone tower it sends you to. It is in the world, but you can only get there via the quest.
---
well said!  Where are your upvotes? 
---
cmon people actual irony called out as irony?  Thats rare
---
Hey look, racist shit on a gaming forum, no way!
---
Tell them the author supports hong kong
---
Have you seen the open protests about the current administration that, shockingly, don't end with thousands of protesters openly slaughtered in the streets?
---
Consecration, shield spike, Ret aura, free divine favor crit heal (helpful but not necessary) pull 5-10 mobs, AOE them down, drink and repeat, is how I leveled my holy paladins to 60 twice now. Auto attacking single targets is so boring to me. I much prefer the aoe grinding/questing capabilities of a holy paladin. 
---
The shield talents in the protection tree definitely help a bit and the pulls go smoother once you get seals of wisdom/light around level 30.
---
My friend was thothunter and he got reported, a 3 day ban and a forced name change (he had a forced name change during legion as well)
---
u need to support blitzchung to gain 200g
---
But I'm not the one arguing anyone should be boycotting anything lol.
---
...and it irritates the ever-loving turds out of me that doing *nothing* (as in, not renewing the sub) is literally the easiest course of action here, yet there are so many nerds that "aren't affected, so they'll keep playing", and paying, and voting approval with their wallets. For F's sake, just play a different game! WoW is not *that* great. It's fun, but it's sure not the end-all-be-all of gaming. Have a sack.
---
This is glorious
---
How do you turn them into arrows?
---
You literally just replied with complete bullshit and trolling, then called me a troll. GTFO.
---
Congrats though I guess on trying to fit in with the clique replying because I pissed on their shit class that Blizzard could not have been arsed to even give them a feral loot set from raids and ferals really have to wait now 2 years for AQ to release to get any gear upgrades because all the window lickers are begging Blizzard to slow releases.
---
I dont give a shit about HK. blizzard could glass HK and ill still be playing classic the next day. Keep your bullshit out of my video games.
---
So how is this game..... I have never played it but have played runescape and took me a year to get hold of the way the game is played .... does it have a story based gameplay or a RuneScapeish one I need a few games like these any ideas??
---
OP is talking about alliance, otherwise the entire premise of BT&gt;WW&gt;HS would be completely wrong.
---
If you're alliance you go imp slam, because you can't spam hamstring.
---
He‚Äôs talking about how you can click the name in the GUI to target them. It uses a /target and the name of the person.
---
... you buy cat?
---
Looking for a gear ranking list or spreadsheet for warriors (tank and dps) that‚Äôs not just bis, but all items similar. 
---
Because classic bis website only shows one option per slot. Realistically I might want to go for second or third bis. 
---
Thanks!

PVP servers all skew horde, PVE all skew alliance.  RP also alliance dominated.

Lol! ‚ÄúLives‚Äù
---
Lmfao
---
Nice straw man there. Be a shame if someone were to point it out.
---
While simultaneously using DBM. The same fucking thing for PvE.
---
It's been awhile since I watched it last. I imagine there is a cliffhanger or some other major event at the end of 5 you could go with.
---
Very. They all seem to share the exact same talking points too. Hmmm....
---
Confirmed I leveled with the SFK dagger and a shield for a while and it felt pretty nice
---
56+
---
Use trueaim till you get both devilsaur pieces
---
I want so badly to be on that server now...that's just awesome!
---
It's incredibly frustrating! I'm either on the top of the bottom of damage meters in raids. It's all up to RNG.
---
I think bagnon does this?
---
Being passionate about things isn't cringy. Grow up.
---
Bingo. Still waiting on them to fix their mistake.
---
Thanks for the tip
---
Yeah, but it's the same spirit of things - that the story told is visual and meant to be intuited from what you find in the world. Knowing it from exploration, not a questline or anything, and all.
---
I‚Äôm lucky to play about 2 hours every other day
---
If we're playing the stereotype game, I can definitely see an argument for erotic RPers versus toxic douchebags...
---
but of course both are stereotypes and ya never know.
---
I think SFK has some good items for twinks you can sell!
---
Shoot your btag I‚Äôll level an alt
---
Yep, it‚Äôll show one ‚Äúbig‚Äù bag and what‚Äôs in your bank
---
That's a funny point. Their best thing in years wasn't even their own idea, it was the community's. Even funnier, it's one they basically publically insulted as a bad idea!
---
People who are trying to min/max this game are shitters. Every spec is viable for clearing every bit of content without a problem. The community are the only ones making it unviable by saying you can't get gear if you don't play X.
---
Niiice
---
not what i was talking about. If you succeed at your end goal, blizzard shuts down, how does that help the people of china?
---
That's not bad considering you're in an airplane, you could easily grind mobs and farm and stuff with that MS.
---
Silithus I guess? Gets you hydraxian rep too
---
Those are all very good points. I think my talent order will be hard affliction first, all the way to shadow mastery, then into demonology.
---
What do you think about [this build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warlock/5502203512201105-2030320142/0BEAjggMKgpqDhShhhh1AcccEffhjjjjK) instead? I removed points from destro and put them into demonology.
---
For the alliance.
---
True!
---
Thats disturbing, why not? Its not needed at all?
---
There is a massive difference between unknowingly supporting atrocities and knowingly doing so IMO. One involves making the conscious decision to turn a blind eye to what your actions are supporting and the other doesn't. 
---
I'm not judging anyone, as an aside. I understand the sadness over this very well... I canceled my sub but am playing through the end of the month. Unlike the OP, I like Classic quite a bit... but not enough to overlook this shit. 
---
&gt;We really can't expect a private corporation to do anything less than following the trail of money
---
I can, actually. That private corporation was founded and thrived in the U.S. If that market no longer accurately describes its values, then perhaps Blizzard should consider moving markets entirely to one that's a bit more welcoming of their brand of censorship.
---
America has many issues, but the pursuit of freedom and democracy are two intrinsic values that most of us hold dear. An American company just blatantly said "fuck those values" and supported a regime actively murdering their own citizens for pursuing a democratic form of government, among other things. I absolutely expect a corporation to *not* do that. Jesus fucking christ, are standards really that low?
---
&gt; write to your members of government and protest your nation's Chinese policy.
---
I can do both - it's pretty easy.
---
Past 2 days I have killed 2 Ally warriors. 1 I killed 6x the other I killed 4x. Both were nelfs my level. They came into my farming area and got a lil cocky, so I destroyed them many times and they kept coming back for more. 
---
 Never did I corpse camp. But one of em brought 3 buddies and we had a nice 4 v 3 battle and I still killed that Ally turd. 
---
 
---
For the horde!
---
He is 59, right? 55 would be somewhat able to hit him I guess
---
we'll have fun paying our druids, and people will be happy to have us as they always have :)
---
maybe you had a bad experience, maybe you just can't play i don't know. But you're not gonna convince anybody either way :p
---
The amount of times I've said this on my warrior when I get doged/parry/miss 7 or 8 times in a row...
---
I am right there with you. How do you think I feel after foolishly buying a 6 month sub? They were great times, although short lived. We can only hope Blizzard speaks out over the next few days.
---
It's not about being good, you can be the most skilled player in the world and you'll still be shit playing a Druid because the class itself is shit. There is NO GEAR UPGRADES from raids for ferals until AQ and even then they're still going to be left miles behind trying to play catch up.
---
Druids could have been fixed if only Blizzard let them compete on a gear level and not shovel them into a corner to be shit resto buff bots that run out of mana on a stupid level of easiness. 
---
Rogues get amazing gear from raids, Druids get poxy resto crap, that's not even very good, they get literally nothing to improve themselves and compete. It's about the lack of vision and pure laziness from Blizzard.
---
Once you've got all your BiS gear from dungeons, that's it, That is literally it until you rank up in pvp when it releases next year and can buy some upgrades.
---
It seems like none of you here raid, or play a druid to "run around as a cat, hahahaha, aw so cuddly" because you just cannot be happy with the way things are for feral druids and the lack of gear upgrades to improve.
---
Buff bots, that's it and nothing more, whether people are honest enough to admit it is another thing.
---
Please post your findings.
---
I mained feral druid all the way from the beginning of vanilla ( 2 mnths after launch) until MoP came out.This is my opinion.
---
All 3 of the multi-role/utility classes are hot garbage in classic when compared to the pure classes.
---
It's like blizzard didn't have a fucking clue what to do with them, so they just said "fuck it, you're a healer with 2 shitbox alt specs."
---
Pallys - ret dps fuckin' blows, tank spec has no real taunt trollololol
---
Shaman - enh/ele dmg is shit , hope you like totems and chain heal.
---
Druids - feral/balance dps is shit, you better be good at handing out buffs and battle rezzing. Feral druids got shit on extra hard because there is absolutely zero serious itemization for them for most of classic, especially bears.
---
You want to be the absolute best at one thing? Better roll one the "pure" classes. Warrior,priest,mage, or rogue.
---
Assuming equal gear and skill, a pally/shaman/druid will never top them in that one particular role.
---
That being said, i still enjoy all 3 classes, and they all bring unique benefits to the table. 
---
Meter topping damage and heals are not among those benefits. 
---
i think pally/shammy/druid were designed with a different game in mind than the one that the players ended up playing.
---
Players end up focusing on just swinging the dps/hps meter epeen, and ignoring anything that doesn't put thier name at the top of those meters.
---
Druids are not meant to be main healers, or main tanks, or purely dps. They can do it all in one fight. I can't count how many times i found myself saving groups from wipes by shifting out of cat to tank that add going after the healer, or toss out heals when the healer got overwhelmed and couldn't keep up.
---
To really push druid to it's maximum potential, you have to accept that you will not be the top dps, or top heals. You have to be flexible, be where and what the group needs you to be at that critical moment. It can be a frenetic and demanding play style, little of which will show up on a meter, But pulling off those game winning clutch plays is what makes a druid worth playing.
---
Why is that? Any specific reason why horde players pvp more? 
---
Or it‚Äôs just been like that since WoW is wow?
---
Hahaha, ah sure isn't it great clicking a button to turn into a cat, wheeee, look at me mommy, I'm a cat, hahahaha, ah druids so amazing.
---
Damn you got me.
---
Fascism is okay when it's in America
---
The Paladin trees are a complete mess and should be reshuffled. There's too many abilities that you want spread too far apart around.
---
Holy tree is okay, but if you go Defense you want half of talents from Retribution anyway, and if you go Retribution you want half of Defense tree talents...
---
Will do; I've got my screenshots and such of the non-caster pet ready, but getting the Frostwing might take a couple of days. I'm level 49 and wasn't planning on hitting up Sunken Temple until I hit 50-51. I'll make a post about it in the sub when I do!
---
This is not a "great change". At all. Infernals were funny and frankly a much smaller issue than ganking in general.
---
This just removed one of the fun features from the game.
---
I am right there with you. I am dying for them to do the right thing and every day it feels as if they are just about to do it. I'm keeping my hopes up that they surprise us.
---
Pretty sure that got me temp banned in TBC :D
---
How much longer do we think phase 1 is going to last? Phase 2 is not very raid intensive so even by then I don't think anyone needs to worry about being behind, but still curious.
---
I will always choose to be the better person. I encourage others to do the same. Some people are stupid jerks, and that can‚Äôt be helped.
---
Awesome :)
---
only reason I play alliance is because I can be a gnome.  If I couldn't be a gnome, I wouldn't play alliance
---
Neither am I, so what's going on here? You free this weekend?
---
Some of the items in engineering scale with your level of your using an engineering pet it is pretty much a requirement to get to 300 otherwise they can‚Äôt hit lvl 60 mobs
---
Soooo what would a typical rotation be in PVP and PVE?
---
Just trying to picture how it'd work lol.
---
Moonfire -&gt; swarm -&gt; chicken form -&gt; run at someone with your stick
---
Bai.
---
Anyone else sees a human face in the shadows on the ground?
---
It's almost always more time efficient to farm the gold for the essences, rather than buy them. Depends on your server though, but they shouldnt be more than 14g per (for fire and earth at least)
---
What don't you get, you literally CANNOT gear up as feral from raids. There is NO gear. You get your BiS gear from dungeons mostly and then that is it, until AQ, which is at least 2 years away. 
---
You CANNOT gear, it's not about not wanting too or someone saying you can't, there is just no gear available, the class was forgotten by Blizzard.
---
It's nothing about "saying you can't get gear if you don't play X", there is NO GEAR to upgrade too.
---
Thanks for the clarification B
---
if you are fighting green mobs then the +hit isn't (as) important.   Until you get close to max level +hit is a) not found on gear and b) not super effective, even when dual wielding
---
Nope.
---
He's just a BFA baby trolling.
---
You should keep it and get together a disguise
---
Also it‚Äôll show any characters inventory if I remover correctly. Sorry I‚Äôve been drinking
---
Lol seriously. The CEO or whoever was like " you think you want it, you really do, but you don't." Or some shit like that.
---
r/honrar
---
this is pretty huge! grats!
---
When you extract it from the zip you then have to open that new folder and copy and paste the 20 or so folders into addons directly. They cannot all be under one folder called Auctioneer v 1.13
---
Mostly for tanks, for bad situations u have fire protection potions
---
Finally, an honest reply from an actual player who played/plays Druid, thank you.
---
Welcome to Reckoning
---
We have also a guild tax of 20 Gold per Raider per Week.
---
But the guild also buys flasks, food, resist potions, enchantments are free, if we craft something which needs raid materials like firecores we get those for free as well and they provide multiple repbots depending on the demand.
---
We also sold a lot of the BOE T1 items for 250-350g.
---
I am totally fine with a fee of 20 Gold per week, if I dont raid that week I dont need to pay, if I do want to raid that week, I dont need to spent hours to gather everything myself and I can just log on for our raid and have no farming to do whatsoever.
---
We have 2 40man raids going, a third is in the making and I think 120 times 20 - so 2400 gold per week is a reasonable amount to provide everyone with everything.
---
I mean a single big firepot costs like 4g on our server and we get a stack of 5 every week for ragg, I can see why you are confused but the idea is not even that bad at all and makes raiding much more pleasant, but I am sure you find other guilds if you dont like this idea.
---
You shouldn't even use devilsaur if you don't have a +weapon skill racial. Trueaim have 4% hit on them.
---
I just started a priest the other night and I love it already. Incredible survivability. I made it to level 12 in about an hour and a half without dying once. And that was with taking on 2 to 3 mobs of the same level at a time without breaking a sweat. You'll also always be wanted in groups. If I wasn't already so dedicated to my paladin I'd be playing priest.
---
Dominos worth a try.
---
America is stomping china into the ground on trade and is essentially in economic warfare, its a shame american companies are siding with the "enemy", and i mean come on, they are the enemy. They are a communist authoritarian regime organ harvesting, persecuting minorities and causing violence against the people.
---
People don't want to discuss this, they want to upvoted a funny picture that basicly says "China bad" so the feel like they are standing up against blizzard and china. People (bots) are headline upvoting.
---
how many runs did it take?
---
went to UBRS so many times, didnt even see one drop :o
---
ah ok.
---
Just talk to the guild. That would be your best option
---
Thanks! Can't wait to try this tonight.
---
Where and what would you farm that you have that much?
---
everyone in this thread is 90% of the way there but the second you draw the parallel between their concerns and capitalism and their brains explode
---
same boat, i think its our duty to make people aware ingame about this issue, if enough of us threaten to leave it could sway them.
---
The + healing is more relevant than the armor, and the only difference between leather and mail items is the armor.  So, your resto shammy is just as interested in cloth +healing gear as leather and / or mail +healing gear.  
---
DPS warriors rolling on mail and leather items is the same situation, just because they can wear plate does not mean it is necessary or even important.
---
Considering it was a guild run and the healer rolled need, I think you did the right thing and your good karma will pay off in future guild runs.  Try not to get all tied up in knots about it like I did when a guild shammy rolled need on the SM Helm when I was tanking.   I won the roll but was still pissed as hell that the shammy rolled need against his guildy tank on a mail item he couldn't equip for 6 more levels.   There was no need to be upset!
---
Still not tanking anything for that shammy ever but eh, ive moved on :P
---
You running this with 6 people? I mean I guess it‚Äôs possible just a tad slower but makes sense :D
---
Agree with this.  There is also nothing wrong with asking someone if they mind if you roll need against them on an item, usually people won't mind, but if they are desperate for that item they might, and thats probably the time you should let them have it
---
Don‚Äôt forget the dumb gnome mount too my god, but escape artist and 5% intellect is worth it
---
Literally the current CEO said that.
---
At least that way someone other than you is getting fucked
---
Yeah I made one alt. Level 5, it's my bank.
---
Yeah but this is just the straw that broke the camels back, so to say,
---
Eastern plaguelands or silithus come to mind!
---
It will come down to which stance costs them more. Someone said China accounts for 12% of their annual revenue, so the only way they'll flop is if enough western players drop Blizz to cost them more than 12%.
---
If you want a whole UI change check out elvui classic.
---
I did this while selling deviate fish on top of the bank for 5 hours to get mount money lol
---
I saw a video a long time ago of a Paladin single pulling SM Cath with it. Of course he has bubble so it's easier but he equipped the shield at low health and it procd like crazy and his health shot up and between that and concecrate the enemies died no problem.
---
In other words, if it still works like that then I'd say the shield is worth holding onto.
---
Fuck you and fuck BFA, I fucking detest retail, it is absolute fucking shit and designed completely to cater to those on the autism spectrum with all the shit grinding and pokemon azerite/essences shit.
---
So try again shit head.
---
Congrats though, another loner trying desperately to fit in with the shitter clique.
---
But rockbiter is better on a slow weapon.
---
Thanks for being reasonable. We were just out there having some fun, not trying to prove we are pvp gods or anything. 
---
This is a PvP server so part of the fun is always being ready to fight. Also I wanted some payback for my alt dying to much in random zones :P
---
True, but that doesn't mean you have to get everything before you can raid.
---
There is no glancing blows for ranged weapon so + skill is irrelevant for hunters. They only give 1% hit nothing else.
---
Assets don‚Äôt have bugs, code does.
---
43 paladin, 42 rogue and 34 priest here. Man I wish I would just have stuck with one, would have been 60 a long time ago.
---
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs under powered, it‚Äôs just that he‚Äôs not allowed to extinguish the fire.
---
I was thinking about using it when I sooo lashers in dire maul east. Which I would be getting hit during that.
---
Only the OH has dropped for me and it was taken by a Hunter. /cry
---
Yeah. Wish I could find out if it still benefits from spell damage. Can‚Äôt find the answer tho
---
5 gold a run? That seems way high maybe 1 gold a run.
---
Hey there, I am currently leveling a resto Shaman and I am at level 50. I have to say, that I didn't ran in any problems with it yet, sure with mobs my level up to +2 levels I have to drink after around every third mob, but under my level I can just farm like endlessly. Quesss have been nice, can't really complain. Just keep an eye on having a good staff with you, that you get nice windfury procs, it does the rest for you.
---
Totally agreed! Good work. Was looking out for ya guys tonight before the raid haha. We learned our lesson ü§£üòú
---
Our guild is running lootcouncil. But the way we have done it is to have clear rules on how it is going to work.  
---
I'm an officier in this guild and we pretty much are focusing on "what will be best for guild" kind of way.
---
As it stands now we have given 2 pieces of loot to officiers rest has gone to the guild members. And befor we are giving an item to one officier all other officers have to agree that this is the best for the guild.  
---
I would recommend you to change guild or ask for clear rules on how the loot will work. Sure officiers spend alot of time managing the guild but in the end you are not doing it for loot. As our guilds RaidLeader I'm focused more on everyone to have a good time and to make the raid as smooth as possible. Loot will come and go but having trust from your guild is more important.
---
In Legion specifically you casted frostbolts until procs. Procs themselves were not rare but due to randomness it could be up to 13-16 frb casts in a row
---
You pay more to have no risk of getting banned
---
Lots of things are already affected, larval acid, pristine black diamonds etc. all gone up in anticipation, I made a fortune buying all the pristines I could afford when DM was announced, couple hours later they had doubled then tripled in price. 
---
As for what will actually go up and down, large brilliant shard and all things related to thorium (bars stone arcane crystal, blue sapphire) will all go down due to 2man DME farming. Some herbs especially dreamfoil will probably decrease in price although that information is not yet 100%. The economy will be heavily impacted in terms of inflation with all the gold generating methods being out, so I would advice against having gold on you instead of buying resources.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure skullflame doesn‚Äôt scale anymore (was revamped after patch 1,7(?))
---
Im also hunter with skinning/mining. Had my mount money at level 37.
---
At 49 now with 350g. Will buy epic mount at 60 and switch skinning to engineering for pvp.
---
haha, &lt;Jelously Noted&gt; got us once on the way to MC, we definitely travel as a pack ready to fight now.
---
Crack is nice
---
i dont know why people dont understand this. no one can use the platform given to them for politics or religion shit. its easy lol.
---
Yes but as players who don‚Äôt but gold estimated 90% of the player base. How is it different?
---
5 for 35s
---
Are you sure you used the vanilla version ?
---
They've put together a very faithful recreation of vanilla, so to that extent, yes.  But any sort of creative decision...no, the confidence isn't there.  Activision-Blizzard is not the Blizzard of old.
---
Yeah Sleepless here. Saw the forum post but I avoided it. Didn‚Äôt want the way people reacted on some of the posts here on the official forum haha
---
There's no room for nuance anymore.  Both sides just assume you're on the opposite team.  I haven't even looked into this any more then the headlines, so I have no real right to take a side.  I have a feeling most of the people taking a side haven't either though.
---
Had the same problem, I stoped wow and play another game.
---
Yassss. Guess I'm buying some.
---
Isn't it more 4 rolls a day where each person rolls the same number 3 times, not necessarily 3 ones?
---
mugglers belt isn't worth it, distracting dagger is a nice new prebis offhand though.
---
Isn‚Äôt that add on against tos? I can‚Äôt imagine how it can‚Äôt be.
---
Yes... just a couple expansions closer
---
You didn't really counter my argument, you just called me stupid.  I guess you win.
---
so many guides forget HUGELY good ‚Äòof healing‚Äô items
---
head, back, wand and bracers are extremely good choices to have ‚Äòof healing‚Äô greens
---
If you're coming to a gaming sub-reddit to have fair and balanced Geo political debates, you're gonna have a bad time.

Druids are superior to warriors in MC, as warriors lack the gear to get proper threat. Most guilds back then ran warriors due to the lack of knowledge. Druids are more than capable of beating warriors on many bosses (they are however not possible to use on a few such as chromaggus). Just because someone did something 15 years ago, doesnt mean it is the best way of doing things.
---
&gt; no idea where alliance [Princess] quest starts
---
Ironforge throne room. Great guide otherwise. BTW the Alliance melee ring is BiS for several classes pre-raid. Not sure about the Horde ring. https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12548/magnis-will
---
Any that wants to do dungeons or raids. So i'd go with "find any"
---
but WF has a +31% more fun
---
It's funny how you can form a connection to someone you've never met nor spoken to, first Hayven then TotalBiscuit. Their deaths fcking crushed me. Fuck cancer.
---
yeah, I will keep an open mind. thank you
---
Bye
---
So in a raid a gnome comes out on top. Good to confirm what I already knew.
---
Also, picking gnome that's already superior for casters, AND has the insanely useful racial ability escape artist which has it uses in PvP and pve, makes it the clear better choice. But if care about aesthetics than the otherwise objectively better option, pick human.
---
This is a 15 years old game. Loot is not a big issue in retail. There are plenty of loot for individuals compared to classic and people get it personally and they can only trade it if it is not an upgrade for them (in terms of item level). Also people have individual way to target specific bosses with bonus roll. No matter what you win out of bonus roll, you can‚Äôt trade that.
---
I just hit 31 and I feel like Im struggling to find quests that are in an appropriate range. Most of the quests available are in STV, Decolace and Hillsbrad but they are all 33 or 34+. Is there anything im missing or should i just retreat to doing dungeons for √† couple of levels?

Hi, /u/Grogolo

The difference is much smaller than what it was. Instead of 30-40% less stats it‚Äôs 2-3%, barely noticeable if you aren‚Äôt min-maxing.
---
Heroic Strike.. With a twist?
---
This post makes me realize how high pop my server really is. There are at least twice this number there on my server even in the early morning.
---
Sorry dude, you made a valid argument, so nobody here likes you anymore.
---
Seems like it's down again.
---
Hi! Welcome to the fold.
---
Tank is the most reliable part of the dungeon group. No one wants to tank because your are dumped with all the responsibility.
---
And you gotta have your shit down too. 
---
Beyond anything else you are the flight Attendant. Your job is to make sure everyone is all cushy and safe.
---
Your actions and words are what makes Safe. Your job is to communicate and inspire the group to a good time. Nobody cares about game mechanics if you are having a shitty time. And the opposite, even if your group composition straight up sucks but you make the run fun. It is fun.
---
And the ways to make people safe and satisfied are just as wild and elaborate as they are in real life.
---
What I did was going to bed early and getting up at 4am every day for 3 days until I got him. Easier to tame during hours where less people are playing/looking for him
---
I'm with you, minus Cata. I really didn't enjoy Cata. TBC and Wrath were the absolute peaks of the game for me, though I also really enjoyed MoP.
---
When I hide my helm, do the other players still see it?
---
Yeah schedule reasons.  I am not going to get any pugs at the time I play I'm sure.  At least at this rate I'll be like 15th in line for loot.
---
Do you have a source for this info?

Don‚Äôt get turned off of loot council because it is too big to ignore, some guilds have also had a hybrid system. Super rare pieces or certain things were loot council and the majority of everything else was DKP.  Or loot council is a backup to someone abusing DKP such as not getting any gear... stockpiling it. Then taking something off spec with it... let‚Äôs say a holy pally.... not using ANY DKP then Ashkandi drops so he spends ALLLLL of it for his ret weekend PvP spec. That hurts the guild so a council can stop that. 
---
If the guild is fresh it doesn‚Äôt look like it‚Äôs off to a good start but remember, they were there leading a raid maybe asking them privately and respectfully after not to cause a scene and risk the whole thing going under would be better. It‚Äôs very possible those 6 people did A LOT of work to even get the guild there and so the first couple good pieces they wanted and then it all evens out. Our GM is constantly getting people attuned, geared, going to UBRS to even just open a gate for people forming their own groups, farming materials, recruiting etc. Ill tell someone to stfu if he gets his leaf for his bow first. But Probly say it more respectfully and say ‚Äúyou can ask after the raid if there‚Äôs something that concerns you‚Äù
---
You can't.
---
I‚Äôm pretty sure classic party frames aren‚Äôt a creative decision.
---
Why people hide the name's of the players in screenshots? I really can't see the reason...help me out please
---
Are we still on this topic, its a social game I remind you and your going to meet people you dont like. I play an undead warlock so the edge meme I mean, dead on there. Thats kinda what I have been telling you, I got demons running all through me. Now look at your last post.....now look at mine......now look back at yours......you also have demons now. Do you read Sutter Cane?
---
Almost every company has policies to prevent their employees from voicing their political stances while on the job. It prevents arguments and possibly ruining the company's PR.
---
yeah its always something with them, classic is secretly the most difficult game ever! then it releases and theyres a million excuses as to why all these ppl have hit max level, cleared mc effortlessly and or already got there epic mount all in the first week. 
---
then they start with "well actually, this patch made everything easier so its really BWL AQ and NAX that are tough, this is the easy stuff" once we hit phase 6 and some rando guild World firsts nax in record time, the excuse is going to be "well theyre pserver tryhards, ofc they did it. they prolly did that dungeon like 1000 times already".
---
&gt; And the fact that it works means that yes, it is too much effort 
---
Hold up... you think because something makes money, it's too much effort?  
---
Maybe i can explain it to you, tell me if this is too much effort for you.

Step 1: log in character

Step 2: post auctions with Auctionator

Step 3: log out

The sheep explode into a giant fireball if you click them too much in Warcraft 3, and the units get steadily more frustrated with you if you do the same to them. Blizzard is known for its Easter-eggs.
---
His videos are great, one of the best WoW content out there on YouTube. And his voice is really great for that job. He always seemed so calm. It was really sad when I heard he passed away. 
---
I think Blizzard should honor him somehow by creating in game reference. After all something like Thex meme got NPC so I think that guy who put his heart and soul into creating content and explaining things really should have something in game to honor his memory.
---
I've had the same experience. The loot has been distributed very well since week two yet we still have few members who haven't received anything as there isn't that much loot to be shared. Some people tend to forget that MC will be on farm forever and we keep clearing it always even after other raids are out. We are not supposed to be fully geared within a month after classic release
---
Wow. Rude much? Go learn some manners kid.
---
I'm sure Blizzard cares a lot about a handful of subs from people who play a handful of hours and haven't even hit 60 yet.
---
Then play it?
---
Price for salt is like 15g on my server, for a 3 days cooldown
---
ive seen it done. there was a guy on here who posted couple weeks ago about doing it
---
No, this is just for 1s specifically. It's a hundred times more often that three people roll the same.
---
There‚Äôs 3 ways. 
---
* jumping on a ledge and abusing pathing. The jump is also hard to learn. 
---
* going to the spectator area right after starting it and kiting the trash around the area up there. Easiest way. 
---
* making full use of your kit down there. Every pack is doable. Stand on the opposite side from where the mobs spawn. Fight one pack at a time and kite the scarabs while cleaving them down with multishot. Good gear recommended.
---
Right, what are we looking at here?
---
What in the acutal fuck...
---
Oh, the warlock
---
They have agi on it. They are more hunter loot than mage/warlock.
---
Can‚Äôt you just mind soothe your way to the ubrs door and very easily target Jed at any pathing point without even opening the door?
---
This is the current hunter situation. Since hitscope isn‚Äôt in the game we either gimp our DPS to hitcap or lose less dps on average running DPS gear instead of Warmonger.
---
Oh Jesus Christ just stop, the gear Druids get from dungeons is the same gear rogues, warriors, shaman and hunters roll on, then they also get to upgrade and improve their gear from raids while feral Druids get fuck all. Druids are STUCK with dungeon gear until AQ raids release and even then it's not enough and we're FAR behind other classes at that stage.
---
Feral druids COULD be better, they COULD improve IF there was gear for them from raids, like other classes get.
---
What the hell else is there to do in Classic other than raiding once you hit 60 and have all your BIS gear from dungeons ? There is no pvp yet, and they will most likely not release BG's now until Feb/March next year due to all the pressure being put on Blizzard from window licking casual shitters telling them to slow down because THEY are still only level 32 ffs.
---
because of what? i didn't see a reason to report
---
Then play it
---
Haha, I can't twitter very well. It's all great though.
---
Wowhead is usually good but wrong for some stuff (like the elites in Tyr‚Äôs Hand, wowhead says has 0 loot and they drop all sorts of BOEs and recipes)
---
Just bring a set of green pieces you equip once it‚Äôs time for looting and bank on your GM not doing regular inspects.
---
my beautiful collection of 1000+ devilsaur leathers
---
The better course of action would be to turn a character from every Blizzard game in a Hong Kong supporting mascot as ppl are doing with Mei in OW (like Pandaren in WoW, Chen/Lili in HotS, etc.). 
---
It was right from Blizzard to cut out after the call of the player for HK liberation as it would be for any political call in a game tournament, yet it was mischievous to reach the level of punishment they did with him and even the casters.
---
&gt; I bet 90% who claimed to boycott Blizzard are full of shit.
---
We've been through this a gazillion times and people either don't unsub or unsub for maaaybe a month. It's insane to think it'll be any different this time.
---
Multiple people reporting this difference in stats in the hunter discord. I‚Äôve never bothered with caster pets so I haven‚Äôt checked it myself.
---
I do this when the person messaging to join my group is too low lvl :)

Horde Gets Level 60 From Discovering Stormwind
---
I had one goal 15 years ago to get level 60 on my first character by discovering Stormwind. I failed this task by getting 8 experience from discovering Goldshire.
---
Thank you blizzard for giving me my second chance!
---
People didn't like my dumb joke haha
---
Yeah but you are a druid, being goofy is normal for you.
---
Some people are able to stick to their values. No need to be an ass about it
---
Makes sense!
---
At that level, shimmering flats is also an option. Or a couple of RFK runs.
---
Ye
---
Not enough for it to matter.
---
I‚Äôm just glad you don‚Äôt play pally much anymore, as a pally that leveled prot till 58 and bugged every 3 minutes and only stop for mana for 5 second intervals i can say that you really don‚Äôt know how to play pally.
---
The episode is literally called Band in China, it's a pun.
---
I have about 20 days to go and I requested a refund, it will tell you you played too much but you can open a ticket. Try it, nothing to lose.
---
An American company is appeasing communist China by penalizing a player advocating for FREE SPEECH.
---
Call it pointless to 'stand by our principles' all you want, but corporations will continue to abuse their greed and power unless their customers communicate in the one and only common language between us: MONEY.

They do not.

God i hate when highlevel guarding opposite faction and just murdering everyone around him
---
Weird... I work at best friends and one of the cats I care for is named Lightfoot... coincidence?
---
If you going to min max why bring people who couldn‚Äôt even bother to farm pre BiS?
---
They are role playing pro guild for no reason.
---
You can use /tar gor at the spot you spawn in at the entrance and cast mind vision on him, then just chain mind visions to the other mobs in the room he‚Äôs in until you find/don‚Äôt find Jed. Takes me 15 seconds at most to scout for Jed
---
Badlands and earth elementals. Grinded those out for about 3/4 a lvl between 40 and 41 and made like 35g. Round up 3 or 4 and blizz them down. Sell the solid stone and elemental earth on AH and vendor all the other stuff. Money.
---
My current plan is a 31/5/15 build
---
What‚Äôs the actual speed increase on this?
---
Ally Scum... great written story though!
---
Yeah you won‚Äôt play a pally end game at all lol, younolay hour class not you spec. You buff people while tanking, dps‚Äôing, or healing. Doesn‚Äôt matter what role you play, you just aren‚Äôt a good paladin :/
---
Safe fall, baby
---
Ehh... slightly better. 3/10. Showing improvement.
---
Happens almost everytime i stormstrike with my troll shaman as well. 
---
Shit's hillarious!
---
Join better guild, or id say bigger, with more ppls. Yday my guild was doing MC, invites went of in 19:50 and at 20:05 we all 40 was in MC. Its all about leadership and ppls in guild.
---
I prefer arkInventory over Bagnon personally, take a look at both. In addition of showing your bank from anywhere (Bagnon do that also) when you mouseover an item it tell you how many you have in your bank and in any of your other character in the same realm.
---
I have different solutions for situations like these. As a healer, I'll usually just not heal people who aren't behaving correctly. Like when warlocks life tap to get back to full mana even though they didn't even use half of it yet. Or if a dps feels like pulling, I'll just let them die. As a tank I just throw on a 2h and start dps. When confronted, I just state that I thought they intended on tanking since they pulled. I'm a spiteful person though, so I have no problem cutting my nose to spite my face.
---
Most undead rogues are pricks. I just kill them on sight. I become more of a bully when I see undead's. Don't know why, but 90% of the time when I died from the horde ganks, it was always the undead players.
---
I have a rogue at 60 with engineering and now I‚Äôm leveling a warrior. I‚Äôm really debating going eng again because Deathwish and Recklessness with Death Ray is amazing.
---
Flexing 2 hands of rag on warriors. Bruh.... That's a shamans weapon!
---
Census addon is working again
---
There are a good amount of things you probably consume on a daily basis that have strong ‚Äúno politics policies‚Äù, you just don‚Äôt know about them...
---
Robe of the void is better for warlocks.
---
My man. Doing the lords work .
---
The same people normaly dont give a fuck if its a bis for you and just an upgrade for them.
---
The only thing that would change is their reasoning.
---
Loot rules were clear, Warris and Rogues are allowed to roll, you rolled, you won, they lost.
---
So have fun with the legendary hopefully one day!
---
0 as its a movement speed increase
---
It's been said that there is a horde bias from Blizzard many times before.
---
Main spec before offspec. So prot warriors would have priority on tank gear over dps warriors, and the reverse is true for dps gear.
---
You smolderweb? I'll throw it up for ya for vendor price
---
No, I just charge an item fee per wipe to cover my repair bill. Makes me a few gold and most of the time people‚Äôs greed will keep them in line so I stop rolling need on greens.
---
Interesting idea:)
---
This is not just about putting  muslims in concentration camps and harvesting their  organs?
---
I'm going to go right against the grain and clique here and just come straight out and say I really couldn't give a shit about what Blizzard did nor Hong Kong for that matter.
---
A LOT if not ALL of the trouble going on in Hong Kong is being directed and led by the British secret services to stir up shit with China.
---
China are entitled to protect their country and its territories from being influenced, especially by oppressive former colonial masters.
---
Good on China, fuck the British secret services and I hope China crack down harder than what they have been doing to weed out the antagonists and bring Hong Kong fully under Chinese rule and laws, like it should be.
---
Fuck Winnie the Pooh too.
---
And yet here they are releasing content in advance of what was planned already. Anyway reading the comments i relaized youre just trolling so im gonna move on
---
I don't suffer from altitis. I am so happy that my warlock is 60 and I can finally focus on making him better without the pain of leveling. I really don't like leveling.
---
this is downright awful I love it
---
You'd be surprised. There are other things out there than WoW, and most of are here playing classic because we've already given up on what modern Blizzard does. This is going to end up hurting Blizzard
---
havent logged in for 5 days. just not feeling it anymore tbh.
---
Sort of. These elites are no joke to fight, requiring the majority of the Hunter's toolkit to solo with a good helping of other preparation besides. 
---
I'm pretty sure to get hit by them at all is death.
---
It's also all anyone has to go on, and it's unlikely that the ratios of alliance to horse would change to a degree by this time. It's safe to say those numbers are more or less a good indication of what you may expect the ratios to be.
---
&gt; This is going to end up hurting Blizzard
---
Sheep
---
Ide have to find it but there was a post last week saying they are putting the finishing touches on it as we speak. Its going to release at blizzcon.
---
Likely they were so afraid of the failure they put more work into it to try to polish the turd and dip it in chocolate. Unfortunately when we bite into it, it will still be a turd.
---
yeah, what my group did was arena / argelmach / angerforge runs usually for HoJ and Second Wind chances as well. really just depends on the wants / needs of the group in most cases, but i rarely see any arena groups only going arena because waiting outside the instance for reset can be a pain.
---
&gt; So what‚Äôs wrong?
---
That it doesn't work "better" with slower weapons. It always adds exactly the same DPS per minute no matter if your swing speed is 1.0 or 4.0
---
"boycott blizz/deleted my account" starter pack:
---
*Still buying cloths made in swettshops
---
*still buying fast food
---
*still killing the climat
---
*still not thinking about the Meat industry when buying food.
---
Look, im not trying to defend blizz.
---
BUT. lets be real here, if this is the worse offender a company has made that you use then your world view is scewed alright.
---
I dont give a shit about the points above and so does Most of the "boycott blizz" eighter. So lets stop pretending for fake internet points and just enjoy games that you find fun, okay?
---
Thanks
---
Horde has faced with superior PvP racials (mostly undead and orc).
---
So are you also going to boycott every other major company that supports China?
---
Sure, I‚Äôll bite. For the record, I mained a Resto Druid in Vanilla, and loved it.
---
You wanna be mana efficient? How about using THE MOST EFFICIENT Healing Spell in the game (rank 4 Healing Touch)?
---
Still having trouble with mana? Did you know you can spec into clearcasting in balance and can auto attack a mob for a free (any spell will do but I prefer) max rank Healing Touch? Plus, I think it‚Äôs more fun than standing in one spot and healing.
---
Your group is taking too much damage?! Good thing I Macro‚Äôed my Trinket(s) onto Tranquility, which is a godsend (though you can pull aggro like a motherfucker with this).
---
Between Innervate, Battle Rez, Thorns, and Mark of the Wild your utility is top-notch! (Plus if you pvp, you can stealth and pop out to save someone, or run the flag in wsg).
---
You‚Äôre stuck healing the main tank due to an unfortunate damage spike? If only you had stuff like Nature‚Äôs Swiftness and Swiftmend-OhWaitYouTotallyDo!
---
Also, on another note, just remember that if you roll a priest, Power Word: Shield will fuck up a tank‚Äôs rage generation!
---
I hope this helps!
---
Everyone is farming BiS
---
Like you have any idea. Now stop being triggered that people with some integrity are leaving your beloved game.
---
Maybe It's not the best but i Heard that hunters change weapon to a more higher speed when they are low on mana and to regain focus on their pets? I have no idea of the specs of these hunters though
---
If you have public DKP records, its very difficult to abuse a DKP system. As well it is much easier to be a bad loot council than to be a bad dkp system. Like an average DKP system is better than an average Loot Council. People make mistakes and give items to the wrong people for the wrong reasons. DKP on average wont make these mistakes, and without someone intentionally abusing the system wont have cause any issues. LC will cause issues even if there is no intentional abuse.
---
I have cancelled my sub. Playing out the final days I have already payed for and deleting my account when they have run out if nothing changes drastically. Not expecting anything to change. Sometimes you have to have principles, if the cost is an old video game it's very much worth paying it.
---
It does. Got it in LBRS.
---
In general, you don't get aoe buffs if you're flagged and the person  handing them out isn't.
---
Also, I think you'll cause them to flag themselves if you're out in the world and they use any spells on you at all. I don't believe this is done in dungeons.
---
I agree, I'm not for loot council personally. Just stating that for a loot council this doesn't seem unusual, and explaining why they would make that type of decision. This is all coming from someone who was reluctantly in a loot council in my bc raiding days.
---
As someone who has played sc and sc2 since release... i feel your pain.
---
[Try this one.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1YXJpasqqodeq9B4jeUZDP9khFQf5QocyMby6moydJWk/edit#gid=1107319288) It has a BiS list, as well as alternate options that you can run if you just can't get the BiS stuff to drop. 
---
The first page tells you exactly what the goals are. Not sure how people here feel about Fight Club's stuff, though.
---
He was punished by Blizzard China, the apology note to China was written by Blizzard China. 
---
I wouldn't be surprised if head office had no input and is now smacking their head against a wall, as coming out and apologising for the apology will cost them big time. Not only Chinese players but all their staff in China as well.
---
As the same has been said for alliance. What is this comment even trying to say?
---
I'm 17 points in combat and now planning to go deep in sub. I wanted imo sprint, parry talent ect.. sure swords and is faster but ALOT less fun. Especially in PvP, which is already pretty common at my vol (35) in stv, Marathi highlands. I'm sticking with daggers and sub :)
---
if im doing ubrs with decently geared 60's and trying to kill drakk, how many people do i need? full 10?
---
I farmed this fire res for like 20 hours and now you say its useless üòÇüòÇ gz for me
---
I think the proper response is, "Can I have your stuff?".
---
Rallos Zek. Named after Rallos Zek the Warlord, the god of war and a boss in the Plane of Tactics in the Planes of Power expansion.
---
How's that for a nostalgia hit :P
---
I still played EQ up until the release of classic wow, best mmo ever made imo.
---
I think Blizzard had every right to ban the tournament winner for using the tournament for political reasons, which is against the rules. This whole boycott Blizzard is just pretentious western outrage culture, and will be forgotten in 2 weeks. Also, boycotting Blizzard will not help the HK issue at all.
---
Daggers will actually process crusader significantly less since because it's based on ppm this means that proc chance is normalized to weapon (slow swords have a higher chance per hit to proc crusader than fast daggers).
---
But the chance derived also applies to instant  attacks, so while using swords you use many more instant attacks which each individually also have a higher chance to proc crusader. Which makes crusader far better for (main hand) swords.
---
.3% is pointless.
---
You'll need it given a month.

When I got my Warglaive mainhand as well, the other rogues were pissed in the guild. Like some said, some will just get pissed about not getting the virtual orange.
---
Kill once and move on. I make an exception for mages aoe grinding, I corpse camp them sometimes
---
&gt; But I'm done now. I don't even entirely disagree with their stance of wanting to keep events non-political, but I do strongly disagree with the absolutely disproportionate overreaction.
---
If you don't enforce your rules, people won't obey them.  They did what was necessary to protect their interests.
---
10 recommended yes
---
We were fighting fuckin' ISIS together. We promised support and then broke that promise with no notice which will lead to way more deaths of our ISIS-killing buddies. In short, our government showed itself to the world to be a lying sack of shit that shouldn't be trusted (again).

Give it a rest you jive turkey.
---
&gt;You wanna be mana efficient? How about using THE MOST EFFICIENT Healing Spell in the game (rank 4 Healing Touch)?
---
Stupid shit, I have no interest in resto, it's shit compared to all other healing classes, fuck it, even bandaging yourself is better than shit resto druid heals.
---
&gt;Still having trouble with mana? Did you know you can spec into clearcasting in balance and can auto attack a mob for a free (any spell will do but I prefer) max rank Healing Touch? Plus, I think it‚Äôs more fun than standing in one spot and healing.
---
Really, you played Druid in Vanilla and you're quoting me a fucking clearcasting build that can only proc on melee hits, so you want me to run in to the bosses in MC or Onyxia even and stand there autoattacking, so I can get a clearcasting proc and then heal the MT ? FFS.
---
&gt;Your group is taking too much damage?! Good thing I Macro‚Äôed my Trinket(s) onto Tranquility, which is a godsend (though you can pull aggro like a motherfucker with this).
---
It's a useless healing spell, it heals the party not the raid, it's a fucking stupid waste of mana.
---
&gt;Between Innervate, Battle Rez, Thorns, and Mark of the Wild your utility is top-notch! (Plus if you pvp, you can stealth and pop out to save someone, or run the flag in wsg).
---
There's no BGs in the game yet, nor any honor system for that matter. All the other stuff is just backing up what I'm saying, that druids are just buff bots, so thanks for that I guess.
---
&gt;You‚Äôre stuck healing the main tank due to an unfortunate damage spike? If only you had stuff like Nature‚Äôs Swiftness and Swiftmend-OhWaitYouTotallyDo!
---
Again, fuck resto. I'm well able to use macros and I do and I have one set up just for an instant big heal when I played resto but so what, big deal, woo, you might get the instant heal off before another of the load of proper healing classes in the raid have fully healed the tank, grats on the overheal I guess.
---
&gt;I hope this helps!
---
Nah, was all shit. You might have played druid as a shitter resto buffbot in Vanilla but that's only because there was literally no point in doing anything else as Druid, a shitty resto buff bot. Better save enough mana to put that innervate on the priest boy...
---
Maybe you should first learn what that means before you throw around with it like candy.
---
This is fucking hilarious. You're a subscriber of r/fuckepic with the flair "epic account deleted", but when people are doing the same thing with their wow subscriptions and Blizzard accounts you post a bunch of passive aggressive comments and shit like "it won't matter".
---
Does anyone else's batteries "Overspark"? lol
---
You'd need really high speed internet and you won't get that on a plane.
---
You can do what you want but so can the down voters.
---
Im triggered
---
It doesn't. Epic is doing just fine without me, but it's fun watching them fuck stuff up.
---
I've never raided, but I've played in various bands of 4-6 musicians over almost 20 years.  If that experience is any indication, I can only imagine how difficult it is to orchestrate a raid of 40 gamers.

Hello, when I'm creating macros for casting a spell, do I have to use the Rank in the macro as well or is the macro taking the highest rank of a spell automatically? Thanks a lot in advance!
---
*moo-ther
---
&gt; I hope Blizzard goes down in flames over this.
---
They won't.  Nobody except the outrage squad really gives a rat's ass.
---
welp... here is what I gotta get on to doing this weekend.
---
But really, they just followed their own rules and banned a player for not following the rules. What's the fuss about? Really.
---
Removing the ban would be to welcome anyone on their tournaments to spread  their political agenda  on stream.
---
Does Blizzard make a good game?
---
Do I enjoy playing it enough that I'm willing to pay $15 a month to continue playing?
---
If the answer is yes, as far as I'm concerned the conversation ends there.
---
The fact that there are, without a doubt, people out there right now sitting on their beds thinking "man, I'd really like to log on and run UBRS right now, but I'd better *make a statement* by withholding my $15 from a *multi billion dollar company*" is frankly ridiculous.
---
Every one of us is just one player out of millions. Nobody is "making a difference" by ceasing to play a game they would otherwise enjoy because of some mild political controversy that has happened once over the company's 25+ year history. Besides, Blizzard has already had enough public backlash and negative publicity from this whole ordeal that they're already going to be cautious how they handle situations in the future, no doubt. We don't also need to go out of our way to smugly withhold our pocket change and deprive ourselves of something we'd otherwise find enjoyable, out of the misguided idea that it somehow makes a difference. It doesn't.
---
ye and now its more than 1.5 months

According to Wowhead, the buff MCP applies is [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/spell=13494/haste), which has the effect: "Apply Aura: Mod Melee Attack Speed."
---
So I'd assume it doesn't work on ranged attack speed.
---
Extra salty

Moved to Seattle from NYC last year and I miss bagels and lox so much üò≠
---
Ah okay. Im alliance so i couldnt know :p
---
How do you get ganked by alliance on a corpse run when you only resurrect after entering the instance?
---
Both are nice
---
I know you trying to sound deep and all, but this is just embarrasing to read. 
---
You judge classes preformance depending on what you inted to do in the game. 
---
If you wanna duel alot, you weight every benefit there is to be had in duels from the entire fucking spellbook of each class. Locks and rogues excell here. We claim this not because of the dps or hps, but beause when know what they can do and what all other classes can do agianst them.
---
Wanna focus on raid, well we already know all the bossfights so its pretty easy to determine what will gain us the most in any encounter. And guess what? DPS is what matters. You cant do patchwerk with 40 druids regardless of how nice it is that your a hybrid that could potentially help out with tanking or go cat and dps or even owl and dps. All that are irrelevant. And not only on patchwerk but on the vast majority of  bosses. 
---
We do however know that havign a few ranged dps classes is really nice to ahve on certain bosses. Also its pretty hard to gear up a raid with 30 fury warriors. So even thou one class clearly has the highest dps, we still bring most of the classes just for the support they add aswell as excelling on handling certain mechanics.
---
We‚Äôre MC raiders, we ain‚Äôt go no liiiife
---
just dont miss 4Head

Dude, drugs are bad.

I'm sorry but no country that has toppled it's dictator in the last 100 years has been anything remotely close to China's size, military power, or control over it's citizenry.

Had something similar the other day. I was questing and for a good 30 minutes I was on the lookout for a Mage to ask for some water. There was no one... I'm running down the street and there she lays. A poor mage just dead in the streets. As a good shami I resurrected her, and was awarded with 40 water and food.
---
It's sold by an NPC in Azshara, but you can swim up the coast from Durotar to get them. They're in the metal gnomish house.

Why are you mean. Something bad happend to you today? We can talk if you need someone
---
How did he whisper you?
---
What's your raid profile add-on?
---
They had to use the staff to make the portal. Which can only be done when alive and outside the instance
---
Levitate, skeleton and tiny.
---
All 3 is possible to combine.
---
I‚Äôm a rogue doing the Klaven‚Äôs tower quest in Westfall. I‚Äôve killed at least 10 Malformed things trying to get the Defias Tower Key, not a single one has dropped anything at all. It doesn‚Äôt even show the bag symbol, just the click button. 
---
Is the quest bugged or does the key have a low drop rate?
---
Uhm... Eastern Germany? Controlled by the Russians? By the Stasi? People dying in political prisons? Spy state?
---
I made all my 16 slot bags and BiS chest and dropped tailoring like a bad habit.

How many people did you Rez that said nothing?
---
Fuck China for becoming wealthy and powerful right ? I mean fuck them for standing up to war mongering imperialist nations like the UK and trying to integrate Hong Kong back into their country as a whole.
---
Where did the UK want to send all the Hong Kong people as an option before it was handed back to China ? Northern Ireland, during the war there, where the majority loyalist right wing terrorists detest anyone that's not white and protestant and would've most likely murdered hundreds of thousands of Hong Kong immigrants.
---
Hong Kong belongs to China, It is not its own country, it does not belong nor should it have any links with its former colonial imperial masters in the UK and the UK should back the fuck off interfering in Hong Kong and Chinese affairs.
---
Lol no alliance for fairies
---
Currently 50, but some tanks don't seems to grasp that tanking with a 2H with their backs turned will increase the damage they take...
---
You need the rank, in parenthesis, in the macro. Also there is no space between the last letter of the spell name and the parenthesis.
---
Example:
---
Scorpid Sting(Rank 2)
---
&gt; using his free speech.
---
I agree with you on the whole "vote with your wallet" mentality, but this isn't a violation of free speech. They're a private entity and not the government, they have every right to dictate what can and can't be said on their platform.
---
My employment contract literally contains a clause stating that if i'm in uniform / acting in an official capacity i'm not allowed to express political / religious views to the public, that's not a violation of my free speech.
---
Last i checked hunters cant use maces? correct me if i am wrong,
---
huh?
---
Isn't that exactly what I said?
---
10/10 cringe
---
&gt; I told him to wait for me, but he said he doesn't want to waste his time. 
---
Good friends you have o.O
---
Horde is not better or worse. They have one big advantage, which are _way_ shorter traveling times to very popular dungeons.
---
If you like your Rogue, tho, there is no need to reroll.
---
Simple solution, don't invite hunters!
---
Guild name checks out. Now you can have the largest totem to party at.
---
Deviate fish: 
---
one of the five possible effects after eating this fish is Sleepy. 
---
Sleepy - Magic - Makes your character sleep. 30 seconds
---
Im playing undead right now and it is unable to use my racial Will of the Forsaken, it say that I cannot use this ability while stunned. But Will of the forsaken exactly says that it can be used while asleep. Why Sleepy debuff cannot be dispelled by wotf?
---
all gnomes are bastards
---
thats my mouuuse
---
oh, sorry, I didn't know.
---
Nice karna farm lol, the dude definitely checks reddit in heaven and really appreciates your very meaningful comment.
---
Considering you could just kill mobs in the open world yeah its possible
---
And you claim that this anecdotal evidence is a good indicator of an individuals behavior? Do you know if these hypothetical past leavers have actually returned? WoW's shrinking playercount points otherwise. I think it's pretty clear that everyone doesn't leave at once, but each fuckup cuts a little deeper, and Blizzard isn't doing much to win anybody back
---
The post saying you have to include the rank is incorrect. If you do /cast [spell name] without the rank, it'll default to the highest rank you have. You only have to add in the rank if you want to downrank.
---
That really the best you can come up with? Super convincing bud
---
Yes.
---
It annoys me that so many people don't get this. He has every right to express his opinion of China, but it was a conscious decision to use the platform that Blizzard provided for him, rather than say a blog post, twitter or walking around the streets with a megaphone. He abused the power that Blizzard gave to him so they had every right to act on terms in his contract. He forfeited his prize, they didn't steal it as some commenter seem to think. He has achieved his aim though of reaching a MUCH larger audience - how many people who have heard about the controversy actually watched the stream? I didn't even know there was a hearthstone competition going on. He still won even if he lost his money.
---
Feelingcute
---
I main a rogue.  And again it only shows the abilities you use in range of a player.  If you are already stealthed this add-on tells them nothing until you open on them.  Same as chat log ;) 
---
We obv have diff views here tho so I'll leave u to yours.
---
It is already on them. A writer got sent to prison for writing the wrong kind of fanfiction. That didn't circulate widely outside of fanfic circles, but many fanartists are building bases outside China. And if companies like Blizzard and Epic truly defy the government, then the Chinese people WILL feel the lack at some point. And it's always the young ones who are the angriest
---
was i karma farming when i posted almost the same message on his last video about a month ago (shortly after classic launch)?
---
So a whole or at every WoW site was talking about the same deleted post claiming you get BFA and a chat boost on retail if you get a classic dude to 60. 
---
And then no one ever talked about it again, neither confirming nor denying that it was true. Anyone know? Gotta be some 60s that went to check out retail because of this, right?
---
I'm afraid that's not gonna happen. Maybe if they will ritually kill some animals at the party in their offices, than maybe someone would boycott them. But as for now they are more of a religion than actual company, especially Apple. While Google is responsible for a huge part of our everyday life with Android, search engine, mail, etc. So while I agree with you that there are worse popular and well known companies than Blizzard, the latter is one of the few people can and actually want to do something about.
---
ur only level 46, slightly past the halfway point. i say don‚Äôt play something ull regret especially since u still have so much to play, and it‚Äôs not even a race to the end so it doesn‚Äôt matter when u get there
---
My lock is lvl 23, the succubus quest is super far away for alliance should I do it? My current solo style is dot targets have VW tank it‚Äôs slow and safe and I rate have downtime but does feel slow
---
Why do you think no hunters want / use these gloves? And also why for example warriors want Edgemaster handguards which are bis till like naxx for them?
---
I don't like playing alone either, I've got a 46 hunter and started playing with my brother to begin with but he doesn't seem to play much now.
---
It's definitely worth playing the horse side and there is nothing wrong with playing both. I'm about to do the same, haven't played horde on classic yet either.
---
this trinket is no joke cant wait to get it again, makes you feel like emperor palpatine when it hits big :)
---
Honestly I hate him, but with so many Americans pissed off at China I feel like now is the time for him to make another move against them in the trade war. He will have more support than ever.
---
Disney owns starwars. Doesn‚Äôt mean I like to hear about starwars when I‚Äôm interested in marvel.
---
Thank you for playing this game the way it's meant to be played.
---
&gt; I just think Reddit thinks that by blizzard taking the route they took means they agree with what China is doing in HK, which I don't think is the case. 
---
If only blizzard were to come out and make a clarifying statement so we wouldn't have to guess. 
---
Shame that hasn't happened.
---
Should probably just stop responding to him, he clearly had some hypocrisy and cognitive dissonance going on, but fuck if someone like him will admit it. Probably takes pride in being a troll.
---
I canp the same spot to kill low health horde lol
---
From what I've read online crusader is slightly better in PvE on a mainhand dagger than +5 damage.
---
I can't fathom pretending to give a shit about the current cool to talk about social issue that people will inevitably move on from within a few weeks. Oh that's hey remember the Amazon? Still burning but oh well, not hippity hip with the epic le redditors anymore
---
You probably just weren't that into classic to begin with, around this time the players who aren't bothered to play just drop. Most players never hit 60.
---
I would love a Classic+. This is a chance for Blizzard to take WoW down a new path, I don't see the purpose of going down the same road of TBC and WotLK; that road ends with sadness and boredom.
---
Classic+ could provide horizontal content with new gear to beef up other specs for classes other than the standard tier gear; it would be great to see other specs become more viable. Arena PvP could be added, and maybe even hard-mode dungeons (for example, a level 60 version of The Deadmines).
---
Don't raise the level cap, don't make gear too insane, don't include flying mounts, etc. As long as this is followed, it should always feel like Classic even with new content.
---
Love it
---
It can be dispelled, can't it?

Maraprincess.com

 *Please get up, Mr. Bubbles!*
---
It's because you don't have strong moral convictions about things outside if your immediate scope and you're not afraid to admit it. I'm the same way. So are 99% of the people "boycotting" Blizz from their iPhones. I wish HK the best. I really do. But it's not my problem and I don't care that much. Neither do the majority of the people in these threads.
---
The biggest challenge in WoW raiding has always been organising the raiders and simply getting people online, on time, ready to go. You get 40 people who are actually going to show up on time every week and ready to go, knowing the fights? You *will* clear everything up to and including Naxx.
---
I've run more raids than I care to count and it really is like herding sheep. Infant sheep. With learning disabilities. 
---
"Raid starts at 7? Oh that means I'll log on at 7.05, it's only 5 minutes late. Hang on guys I need to repair. Can I have a summon? Oh you're mid fight I'll wait. Guys it's been 10 mins where's that summon? Oh you sent it? It expired soz was having a shower can I get another. Fuck I forgot ammo I'll just hearth can you summon me back real quick? OK I'm back shit forgot potions can I have some please yeah I know I never farm them but I'll die otherwise and you need my leet DPS lolz"
---
And so on. What truly infuriates me is that it's so hard to take a more relaxed and casual approach to raiding with these people. I mean if you're a casual sports player and you're on a team you show up for practice and you show up for games... you don't rock up 30 minutes late expecting everyone to have waited for you. Same shit.
---
Personally when I was leading the raids I would cut anybody who was late more than 2-3 times without notifying me in advance.. and if you *were* going to be late you needed to find 10 minutes and get all your shit sorted out then go park yourself outside the instance so that you could log in, walk in, be summoned to where we were and that was that. Emergencies happen to everyone, but if it's every week it's not an emergency.. it's your failure to plan ahead.
---
Anyway. All I can advise is that you try to find a decent guild and make sure *you* show up on time and ready to go every single raid night, as that's how you get in to and stay in good raid groups.
---
I'm not defending retail, don't try to imply that I am. I'm implying there's more important things at hand than "me no like retail"
---
jesus I guess that‚Äôs true but still!
---
Maybe you could just... not level as prot lol
---
You can get better gear while also not getting BiS pieces. An arcanists belt is better than the lvl 48 green quest reward. Does not make you entitled to get mana igniting cord.
---
I know, right? As long as we don't peel the target off the tank, locks (especially affliction) can sustain both HP and MP just fine by ourselves. 
---
If said theoretical lock is ASKING to be healed afterwards... then they're probably terrible.
---
Also there is a couple of Debuffs that reduce your Cast Speed. That is not as much PVP besides that one Curse of Warlocks - but in PVE there are a couple that last 2-5min.
---
It is very minor but still a negative Point. I'd still always get the class Mount just becasue I can and wtf do I care about the disadantage I'm by no means hardcore or a min-maxer
---
I know right? I am the guy who is having fun reading most of the quests in order to discover the stories behind them. I told him that amd he told me that I'm having fun wrong, the fun begins at 60 :/
---
Wow really? My tarot readings said it's about 42,000. But personally I like just making up statistics that j have no way of actually knowing, since I'm just overexposed to the majority of posts and comments of people claiming they did something, but provide no proof, but I'll eat it up and upvote it since I want to feel like I'm part of a social change and that I'm morally following the correct direction even though I don't actually care enough to not move on from a social issue since it isn't being discussed anymore, which will be in a few weeks.
---
Back in vanilla I didn't know you could preview items. So I bought some stuff with cool icons, and was dumbfounded it looked so different when equiped!
---
Well then I'm out of ideas.
---
Hard to tell you what would be best for you to do. 46 is quite a time investment for someone who is playing casually. You also said that you have a "friend" at 60  and at 60 is when social connections matter for everything from world PvP to dungeons and raids. At lvl. 55 and you and him can group with 3 others and start Dire Maul next week. 
---
On the other side, if you always feel like you play the wrong character it is not great. I personally prefer alliance in classic for the better quests when leveling, barrens is my least favorite zone.
---
Did BRD 2 days ago, with a group of 3 mages. After the 3rd or 4th pull, 1 of them /w me saying let them pull as it would be faster. First pack, they pulled a few, did the frost nova/ice block thing &amp; we killed everything. Next pack was a few more mobs than before &amp; they got their ass kicked &amp; died. 3rd pack "OK tank, you can pull now"
---
Let em die, they learn quickly
---
Your so cool man! If your group can‚Äôt manage that pull then I would have left in a heartbeat. No reason to waste your time in one of the easiest runs.
---
Assets are things like 3d models, they don't have bugs.
---
There's not any equivalent, as far as I know. For that matter, there's not many cooking recipes given out as quest rewards in Horde-only quests.
---
I know this might be unpopular to say, but the HS player broke the rules. Yes China sucks but he broke the rules and Blizzard me him pay for it.
---
&gt; WoW's shrinking demographic
---
I wouldn't worry too much about that. Classic saved this expansion and they've got a billion other fail-safes up their sleeve. Like imagine another expansion surrounding Bolvar, WoW TBC, or WoW Classic+.
---
Plus nobody will turn down Diablo 4, (hypothetically speaking) Warcraft 4 or StarCraft 3 over this little shpeel.

---
He said from his iPhone...
---
I feel you, but for me, it's mostly happening in instances. I'm happily healing one and see how many tanks are just very bad. So I'm like "I can do this better" and level a tank. Then I see DPS being terrible, pulling aggro because they hit mobs before I even touch them, so "I can do this better" and play some DPS, but it's an endless cycle... I eventually ended up with my love the druid, now I can do it all in one class :)
---
Well I get you friend. While it isn't nice not to wait for a friend - I also get that he wants to Level when playing. Getting Level 60 is a big Thing and important. You should have made a "Play together char" and a "Play alone char" and Level both when together and alone.
---
My friends and me wanted to Level together but we only made it to Level 21 before Splitting up xD
---
I'm 54 now, one is 60, one is 41 and one is 46 - that is very different Level Speeds. So I  get that didn't want to wait. I wouldn't want to wait right now :P

Yes. People are morally inconsistent, and like to feel like they're morally superior, or at the very least following the correct moral compass that others are to give themselves more meaning in their lives, when in reality they do nothing to actually make change.
---
This social issue topic is just flavour of the month. Give it a few weeks and people would have moved on. Hey remember the Amazon? Still burning.
---
God I find peoples pseudo outrage so pathetic.
---
So long as it is a fair roll dont feel badly. Most people will agree though that it is primarily and tank weapon because the proc causes a lot of threat. It is, however a special case where dramatic effort must go in to assembling the weapon and it isn't as simple as just giving it to the main tank.
---
I have seen pugs pick any variation of: all melee who can use it roll, just human or sword spec rogues and warriors roll, just warriors, just the prot warriors, or reserved for guild main tank. For bindings being such a low drop, requiring both crazy low drops, and requiring so much material effort, I think any of those arrangements is fine for a pug.
---
We had a similar situation somewhat reversed happen in our half plugged run, where we said tanks roll on the binding, and all of the pug warriors seemed fine passing for the tanks who were all in our guild. We then had a 59 mage (3rd lowest dps behind a 57 warlock btw) leave the raid and rage in world chat about our guild taking the binding on reserve when we didn't say bindings were reserved beforehand. Highest priority on that weapon, on the off chance both bindings actually drop for one person, goes to tanks and no pugs claimed to be tank or tank specced :/
---
But then what happens if the two numbers are still equal? The system of a hidden roll after a tie solves itself because any subsequent ties can be resolved with another hidden roll.
---
Destroy her ego squadW
---
The fun begins where you have fun. For some it begins at 60, for some it actually ends there. Find people who enjoy your style of playing.
---
I got ganked and they said you lose. Was pretty funny I thought.

Anyone have other recommended mage farms besides ZF?
---
Facials always matter.

Pretty sure that was never legit

---
Ask them for fireshield buff.

Problem solved. In case its still a problem kick him for doing it on purpose.
---
Imagine not knowing that rend is one of your highest DPR abilities while leveling for a really long time
---
I play both retail and classic.
---
Why? As a hunter you use hunters mark, serpent sting, autoshot. You benefit from the spirit more than a mage casting, not letting the mana regen kick in. Mage armor comes with lvl 34, so no infight regen either while casting. You are getting hit as much as a mage or warlock as a hunter.
---
Prio for this item is priest &gt; hunter = shaman = warlock (imp drain soul) &gt; mage.
---
I have one in my bag, debating whether to sell it or use it
---
I feel like this should be kinda duh.  Of course 50% attack speed would be by far hunter bis on a melee weapon if it worked for ranged lol.
---
As a warlock, ignoring the epic mount quest, what should I be looking forward to in DM? 
---
I‚Äôm approaching 60 now and want to avoid wasting time farming certain dungeons this week.
---
I was really hoping for their stock to dip huge and buy the dip, but it didn't. Can reddit try harder pls? I want a blizzard stock sale.

---
Is levelling as Holy viable for a pally?
---
Nothing bad about it.  It's kinda incredibly selfish to expect someone to basically stop playing the game so you can keep up.
---
This is a grim warning of the near future. The Chinenese government's opinion means more than the rest.
---
When I tank right away I say something to the effect of: "I set the pace, nobody pulls anything other than me unless I ask. DPS please wait 2-3 seconds after I have all the mobs, NOT 2-3 seconds after I start moving. Sorry I don't mean to be a asshole or anything but I want to have fun as well and DPS constantly pulling mobs away from me because they want to have the prettiest number makes them not fun. If any of that is a problem feel free to find someone else, otherwise lets all have fun."
---
And honestly? It's been a success. Yeah I've had a few "OMG LOL THIS GUY", I've had a few people kick me or just look for someone else... and I don't care. The groups I run with are fast, efficient, and a lot of fun. I almost always have people want me to do other shit with them.
---
Tanks don't struggle to find groups and I am playing this game for *fun*. When the DPS play the damage metres instead of the game, I don't have fun.. if I have to make a pretentious little speech to make sure I enjoy myself then so be it.
---
Tanking is a lot of fun, so long as your group works with you.

That sounds like the worst.

These are the same people who overlook everyday atrocities committed by American corporations but will bend over backwards to call out successful Chinese markets. It's almost ironic how much they'll support what they hate others doing.

&gt; At the moment I am level 46 Rogue, but It's like I'm playing alone. I was thinking for some time to reroll to horde. 
---
Keep in mind you won't be any better off starting Horde. 
---
Personally I agree with your buddy not wanting to wait on you to catch up -- I have like 4 alts that I don't play with various people. Granted the highest is a level 20 that I havent touched in a month lol.
---
Chinas growth is insanely impressive. The progress they made as a nation over the last few decades is insanely amazing, it's no suprised that the majority of the Chinese population are faithful to the CCP, who changed turned the country into a superpower, but at the cost of having control of their population, different freedoms were taken away. No other country has seen such economical growth like China, but things seem like they might crash in their economy.
---
Personally, I see the reduction of liberty as a cost for the growth of China. It's a utilitarian argument, kill 500 to benefit 500 thousand? Fair trade.

 New to WoW Classic - Played for a long time but returned for the classic feeling- what realm should I go for?

EU Alliance. Will probably do the slowest casual leveling.

Going for some NE hunter for some questing / exploring, maybe a rogue for pvp.
---
Come on over to Bloodsail Buccaneers! 
---
It's an NA East RP Server.
---
Don't let that RP part scare you though as some have said. :p On retail, I used to play a lot on Normal servers (never a big fan of forced PVP when I want quiet time). However, I swapped over to an RP server a few years ago and I love it.
---
RP Servers tend to have a wonderful community with players of all backgrounds that are usually very helpful! Just tonight I was leveling my alt in The Barrens and a Troll Priest was helping me kill a quest mob she had already killed - fast forward an hour later, she's killing a quest mob I had already killed and I was helping her! :D

As for the RP part, I haven't actually seen too much of it except for little groups here and there. All it is is getting into character and talking/typing as if you truly were the adventurer on your screen! However, there's also a large part of the server that simply is here because of the great community that RP servers typically gather. And who knows - maybe you guys will take a break from the grind and dip your toes into the water to try RP! :)
---
Of course we have our fair share of grumpy Warrior tanks in dungeons or the silent non-grouping levelers - but I think they're definitely far and fewer between than other servers. 
---
RP Servers do tend to lag behind other servers though. People reach max level slower, people clear raids slower, auction house prices can be a little wonky: it's basically a slower pace in general which might be a good thing from what you're saying you'd like! Usually the Alliance side on RP servers also tend to be ahead by a week or two compared to the Hordeside and their AH a bit more controlled (Lok'tar Ogar though! ;D).
---
If you end up rolling Horde here on our server of pirates and buccaneers, feel free to send me a message! :) I'd be glad to point you in the direction of some great social guilds as well as provide any advice if you need it! :p
---
As a Affliction Warlock I don‚Äôt expect healer to heal me at all.
---
Yeah that's fair enough. I come from a group of fairly hard core decently talented that now don't have enough time to dedicate to wow so we tend to run with semi hardcore and play at the top of the pack.
---
I am on pvp solely because friends are, I can't stand it (especially on a massively unbalanced server).  I feel like early vanilla world pvp was awful due to being pointless and largely just griefing.  
---
I've never really liked wow pvp, but was more than happy to run in nullsec in Eve online where you die you lose all your stuff.
---
Again, anything that allows you to autopilot combat awareness is game ruining to me. Repeating yourself over and over again will not change my mind, it will only diminish your argument. I parrot your use of again to make it clear to you how stupid and obnoxious it is.
---
There will probably be people willing to buy it for 1k+ :D
---
Only way to go if you don't want a million alts around lvl 20 is to pick one and stick it out till 60. Don't touch another character until you're there. No matter how bored you might be at e.g. lvl 48 just stick through it and it always gets better. Also look at a leveling guide to get you through the humps
---
well... 1/100 \* 1/100 \* 1/100 ...
---
Vendor it :P
---
That's bait!
---
haha xD
---
The ultimately frustrating part is that, up until S8, yes, they were veering off course, but they could've still salvaged it with a great final season. With 12 episodes, s better storyline and plenty of time to let everything play out.
---
But that's not what they did.
---
It's complete trash.
---
Tbh no, i haven't heard about any real protests when there really should be given whats going on.
---
Well, for me its easy, i dont even roll. We have hunter, shaman and warlock only. Also 3 hunterleafs so far and 0 staffs...
---
I played during vanilla and never heard this. Could it be a US/EU thing?
---
Haha god damn that is some spastic min maxing, you better fucking lose your shit if a human ever gets a dagger. Perditions Blade and CHT are all yours.
---
I switched at 54 to full heal spec. Leveled to 60 in dugeons, farming prebis. 54-58 BRD, LBRS. 58+ Strat/Scholo. I hit 60 with almost 2/3 of my prebis items already equipped :D
---
Assuming alliance then i'll add darkshire and ashenvale to the list. Stonetalon is okay quest wise but very horde dominated so if you're on a pvp realm that might cause issues. 
---
As already mentioned wetlands is great at that level too. Dont forget some quests that you outlevel might be the start of higher chains!
---
I can't thot patrol you without getting closer!
---
You wont even remember this whole deal by then, and if you do the whole situation will be luke warm in your mind and you will probably wont care enough to unsub, youll probably just continue. Just quit man, now. If they man up and apologize and reenstate the player, then resub. Other than that, why bother?
---
So there might be a horde bias when it comes to what the developers liked more but in the actual game there is more of a alliance bias because a lot of horde stuff was done in crunch time mode.
---
That was the plan, thanks for the reply! 
---
(Oh, ich auch! W√§rst du lieber auf einem pvp Server?)
---
Stacies mum has got it going on
---
All he has to do is what he has always done, which would be easy for him. But I think he wants it to be 120% perfect now since it's one of the biggest things out there
---
Stop wasting rage on heroic strike. It costs rage, only does a bit more than a normal swing and negates your rage gen for that hit. Heroic strike is a rage dump for when you have too much rage, so basically never. 
---
Just charge &gt; rend &gt; demo shout &gt; spam sunder to 5 stacks &gt; hamstring if it's a humanoid &gt; overpower if it's available &gt; melee down or execute once you have it. Also keep battle shout up. When you get close to 40 rend starts to fall off and stops being worth the rage cost.
---
While I have trained the riding and have the money for a regular mount, I decided to just keep saving for the epic mount at this point. 53 shaman getting the long haul use out of ghost wolf. At this rate I may be able to get it right as I ding 60. 
---
Gold really picks up 50+. Quests start giving gold rewards, trash grey vendor weapons from dungeons are about a gold each. High lv Herbs and felcloth can be multiple gold per item. Rugged leather stacks. 45+ green gear. And then all you need is to get lucky on the right world boe epics and you‚Äôre set. 
---
With out ghost wolf though I wouldn‚Äôt be leveling nearly as fast running everywhere and would of bought the mount at 40. 60% speed increase is extremely noticeable and is a game changer over running. You‚Äôll need some kind of speed to cover the distances of some of the bigger zones for turn ins that are on opposite ends of the map, avoiding having to fight every single monster that attacks you, and fleeing from enemy players trying to chase you.
---
This is why you want Linken's Boomerang from Un'Goro as a paladin.
---
haha for sure... although I have noticed that some pple are aware of it and stop it right away... had a rogue blind me at the end of the cast which meant I only took the dmg, didn‚Äôt do any in return
---
You look like a tool
---
Man-wolf-cow. He's real.
---
It's a pretty good game.
---
You are exactly correct. Accounting for each number being a 1 reduces the probability by 2 orders of magnitude, which imo is important to consider since it's part of the memeworthiness of the post.
---
So that would mean, based on the math of approximately 4 sets of rolls per day achieving the same number of 1 three consecutive times would actually equate to about 0.04 rolls per day, or 1 roll per 25 days. 
---
So if we go by those numbers and assume the amount of players stays the same as at launch for a year and keep all the other rates the same (realistically players at launch would be closer to peak players than the actual sustained amount of players) You come out to about 14 occurrences per year. And again, those are with some pretty optimistic estimations of active players. Wouldn't be surprised if the true number was half that or less considering the rate of active players over time would almost certainly suffer from a slow decay across the period of a year until it reaches a more stable number. But that part is just a hunch.
---
DPS warriors are in high demand. You're gonna get passed over when people need drops. That's just the way it is.
---
You not that kind of orc
---
People will make scummy deals like rogues whispering each other and agreeing that tier items go for 10 dkp to save their DKP for multi class items.
---
bank circles ain't going to run themselves
---
"become a master adventurer" damn that made my day. :)
---
Yeah I heard it can scale up with multiple things, it‚Äôs just hard sometimes to get it off vs people who know what it is
---
Oh the irony :P
---
hmm didn‚Äôt notice
---
The problem is Trueaim only give a maximum benefit when you have 4% hit or less in the other slots. Most of the preBiS gear in other slots have +Hit on them too, so to gain the maximum effect, you sacrifice it in the other slots resulting in less power overall. Even next week where Mask of the Unforgiven is replaced by Backwood Helm, and Slashclaw Bracers replaced with Bracers of the Eclipse, you still end up with Tarnish Elven Ring x2, Truestrike Shoulders, Windreaver Greaves preBiS for +5% Hit. Trueaim Gauntlets would only give an effective +3.6% out of the maximum 4.3% hit bonus, whereas with Devilsaur you're pretty much always going to be taking full advantage of the stats. I suppose at +3.6% hit, the gloves would be about on par with Devilsaur if you paired them with Legguards of the Chromatic Defier, or Giantstalker Leggings, but it would be much easier to just get the Devilsaur set in the first place.
---
UD has the flip animation for melee which is pretty cool
---
Don't worry man, you'll be grinding tonight. Your doubts will disappear as soon as you sit down in front of your PC.
---
Step 1: Set chain lightning on keys 1 to 10 on your keyboard.
---
Step 2: Roll your face on the keyboard.
---
Step 3: Profit.
---
You're welcome.
---
Huh? There isn't any bad gear in retail wow, it's all perfectly itemized, that why the game fucking sucks
---
People reassuring you are fake as fuck. You are a big time piece of shit for rolling on bindings when you aren't even 60. But take the pats on the back from the phonies :).
---
I agree.  Giving tf to a rogue right now hurts your guilds future.  I would look for another guild asap
---
Shaman is a funny class in classic. They have the weakest itemization and the leveling process is not what most people expect.
---
Elemental sham gets much stronger after level 40 as some of the most powerful talents are deep in the tree.
---
Most players recommend leveling as enhancement and switching to elemental after 40 (when you have collected replacement gear)
---
2h is the fastest way to level but can feel a bit inconsistent. 1h shield is the slowest by about 15% (my estimation) but considerably safer.
---
i thought dire maul was called KG (King Gordok), my bad.
---
It is done to them, but they are brainwashed into believing that it's normal and that the people its happening to deserves it.
---
Man you're posting a whole lot of comments about an issue you supposedly care very little about lmao
---
- Without raiding Robe of the Void is bis.
---
- Without taillering and raiding Robe of Winter Night is bis.
---
You can also use the rocket helmet from any form which is nice... not sure about other trinkets, this is my only one
---
Oh god I forgot about that - I thought it was a huge buff when they let the seal stay on after casting judgement in late BC. 
---
Side note - at least you can wield 2H without spending a skill point ...... you filthy alliance scum.
---
ive played for years its old af lol
---
As a lock, you bet your ass I'm gonna pop some Curse of Tongues on enemy paladins and warlocks before I die.
---
What game have you been playing bro lmao
---
Got them as well, completed my full pre raid BiS for p1 week ago, finishing with Cloudrunner's Girdle. Damn it feels good!
---
280 is probably the main door. I dont think you can lockpick the Viewing Room Door.
---
you cant hear pictures silly ... looks at the picture .. nvm
---
Tbc without flying
---
Of course, tailoring is a useless profession after you've crafted your robe.
---
The majority of players NEVER hit 60, and the average player takes 12 days of game time to hit 60.
---
Your group probably wasn't that interested to begin with, and played since their other friends were playing, but eventually that niche wore off and they lost interest in the game too. They just weren't bothered.
---
Also, leveling with some is a chore. You can't go off and do something on your own, you have to intentionally slow down so you don't level faster. I can't imagine having to slow down for you since you want to read every single thing, at that point I'd just level alone since you'd be hindering my and I'd be hindered yours, and I'd be frustrated by wasting my time waiting for you. 
---
Just play on your own, or don't play..your friend clearly doesn't want to go back and boost your. You should either catch up, or give up and play alone. 
---
Most of the time unless you have a dedicated person who ONLY levels the character with you, you'll constantly be playing with different people, either randoms, guild members, or people who are in your level range who you've dungeoned a few times with.
---
If you could get above 25g for it I'd sell it otherwise just give it to an alt for leveling.
---
Come Blizzcon people would have long forgotten this just like they forgot people were gonna storm Area 51.
---
D a p ee Bb is y o u lo se from common to orcish if anyone wants it
---
Do good for the sake of it, not for gratitude. Also he was afk, he might not know what has happened. Also if you play a rogue, you are rolling just so you can gank people so.. ye..
---
&gt; it's a site for memes and daddy jokes only.
---
And arguing obviously.
---
I pity people who give Activision their money. Pathetic commie bugmen.
---
It's a known COD scam. You mail something worthless and hope to make the other guy think that you're giving him money when instead he ends up paying you. Hopefully OP reported him.
---
Pull yourself together kid. You did nothing wrong!
---
Blizzard
---
Are you sure
---
Fixed now.
---
Wait so your argument is you're morally superior to everyone else, because you acknowledge how immoral your consumption is; but you just don't give a fuck?
---
I played on the EU RP-PvP server Defias Brotherhood back in the day and this seems about right for vanilla too. I didn't really RP much but the community was amazing and way more chill than normal servers.
---
As I recall, the general RP etiquette was that people didnt break character too overtly in /s, /y or gestures. And if you wanted to ask someone out of character you just whispered.
---
naw
---
I canceled my sub because of this, its truly disgusting behaviour from Blizzard. I've been enjoying classic a lot, but can not continue to give money to someone who supports what the Chinese government are doing
---
That put a big smile on my face. Some of those replies were gold
---
Join ZF, sit back relax and grab your self a consujed beverage. 
---
And let the 4 mages do there thing.
---
Free Hong Kong, Reveloution of our times... isn‚Äôt that what your shield says?
---
Does no one take improved sap?   One of the best rogue talents.
---
What don't I care about, by your interpretation? 
---
I don't care about the blizzard China topic past commenting on a Reddit post about it. I do care about people being morally inconsistent about topics, and the idiocy of pseudo social outrage that is just flavour of the month.
---
 You don't have to cancel your sub.
---
Im looking at this with kind of a fatalistic attitude. 
---
Western Markets are too small to actually have an impact. Even if so many people on this sub cancel it, i'm not gonna join in because i dont want blizzards fuck up to ruin the fun im having now that i can finally play this game...
---
Also, i feel like many of the people who cancel their subs and make a post/comment about it just do it so they can put themself on a moral high horse.
---
people have jobs, families and they want to entertain themselves to rewind.   EVERY MAJOR multinational I  MEAN EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM does shitty stuff.  You can't crusade against everything. That means you can never can drive a car , never fly anywhere ever again, can't buy most food products etc etc etc. 
---
Protesting against China is good , but you can't expect everybody in the world boycotting every company that does something bad.
---
Balance is fun in wpvp and gear is easy to get because there isn't too many druids.
---
Aww, this was me playing with my mom back in Everquest days when I got stationed far from home. There was one time where my niece about that age told her to kill the other person on screen (me). So, me and mom dueled.  I felt bad because I knew I was about to teach her a lesson...then she WTFPWNed me!!! She started out by stripping my buffs off me (didn't know she even knew all her spells that well) then she commenced a beatdown that had me in such shock I couldn't regain my senses in time to win.
---
She never let me live that one down :(
---
Even the class checks out...
---
Personally, I do Holy Fire &gt; SW:Pain &gt; back up a couple steps &gt; PW: Shield &gt; Mind Blast &gt; Wand; gotta make full use of the dots and spells on gcd.

Reply to my other comment sheep
---
I've just noticed so far I only run into people who are higher levelled than me. I think I've had maybe 2 winnable fights so far at level 30.
---
I wouldn't switch. I prefer the flavour of horde too but really it's all the same. 
---
Having said that, do what makes you happy. That's what counts in wow and life
---
^^^except ^^^axes
---
As a priest I will tell the lock at the beginning that I'm fine with life tap but I will only cast renew on him. They are always thankful and life tap as much as the renew heals. Super as and low efford
---
Play wow. Give Bliz crap in Barrens chat. Go join a server close to China and yell about whinnie the pooh.
---
Why u call soviet union Russia? It wasnt even ruled by Russian ( Chruchev was Ukrainian)
---
As an old veteran of the RP-PvP realm Defias Brotherhood that didn't RP but joined because of the community, I'd say you'll be fine. I mean, in real life not everyone engages with people that start talking to them on the street which a lot of RP in wow boils down to.
---
People tended to RP mostly in /s, /y and gestures so don't say/do things too overtly out of character in those out of respect for those that want to RP. In general use /w instead to ask people game related questions.
---
yeah report those threads we need more images of dad gamers clearing rfd

Wowhead all day long. The director of Wowhead has publicly stated that ClassicDB steals their assets/data. CDB even stole the gnome error page from Wowhead.

"A¬†straw man¬†is a form of argument and an informal¬†fallacy¬†based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent"
---
That's exactly what you did. You inferred that you making a comment against Khadgar refuted that other person's point, when that was never part of their argument. So actually you need to learn what a straw man means before you claim to not have used that fallacy. Classic being better than retail doesn't mean you can just lie, bucko.
---
What did I say that implies that? 
---
I put I eat meat in brackets to avoid the ah you're a vegan sjw hahaha.
---
I eat meat since the suffering of animals, and the impact farming animals for consumption, is clearly less important than my enjoyment of meat, otherwise I wouldn't be eating meat. I do care deeply about the suffering animals go through, it's like being raised to just be tortured and slaughtered. It truly is horrible, and it makes me sad. Although, I enjoy meat more than I care about the suffering of the animals. I've  killed and butchered cows and chickens before (digging and hole and cutting their throat so they can bleed out) from a young age, so I've experienced their suffering first hand. I've also been to factory farms to see how they suffer. Regardless, I enjoy eating meat more than I feel bad for their suffering.
---
Seems a bit wasteful if you're not actively trying to keep aggro against someone else. Just use Rend &gt; keep up battleshout and various debuffs (demo, thunderclap) then fish for Overpower with any extra rage by spamming hamstring. And use Overpower whenever available obviously. Hamstring works on almost any target btw
---
I have omni cc and classicauras but the dots are too small imo where can I configure this? Can't find any way to access the mods like you can with atlas etc
---
Whats a good enchant for a newly obtained WW axe? And how much gold would it cost?  Level 34 warrior.
---
I think you will do well. Back in vanilla I was an elitist raider. On our server there was a guild that was considered kind of a joke, lagging behind on content and posting mc first kills while most serious guilds were downing  chrom and nefarian. 
---
But they killed rag soon enough. They worked through bwl while the rest of us through ourselves at cthun.
---
Now I'd probably elect to join a guild like that.
---
E) If I out gear them, out level them, and when they are attacking a mob and low on health.
---
We call that a wasp waist
---
I‚Äôm fucking jealous... but gz!
---
Bugmen are IN LOVE with China, it represents everything they are fighting for in the west; a single unified party, media and corporate entity working together to enrich each other and fuck their people. It's the model for the EU and the Democrat party in America.
---
Agreed
---
Its actually way better.
---
people have jobs, families and they want to entertain themselves to rewind. EVERY MAJOR multinational I MEAN EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM does shitty stuff. You can't crusade against everything. That means you could never drive a car , never fly anywhere ever again, can't buy most food products etc etc etc.
---
I thought people were boycotting Blizzard?
---
Might as well run through wpl/epl and get started with argent dawn rep, can knock out the major quests in a day easy.
---
Maybe do the hydraxians if you want. 
---
Then finish off with dungeons. Best of both without getting too bored.
---
I mean they literally are china didn't even have to ask them to do anything they could of let the country do what it wants. Instead they did what china wants them to do on their behalf.
---
Blizzard does what ever china wants I don't know how this is shocking to you they did it within censoring their game they just did it to a player this time.
---
I do sorta thing business is bad but it depends on what you want to call business. I would call a business that bends the knee at every form to a authoritarian government bad. Even to the point to silence someone who's advocating for rights. I'd also call businesses bad that exploit the labor of their workers.
---
I'm not sure how that's not bad there sure are some companies that don't do that but most major one's are fine with exploiting the workforce catering to authoritarian governments. Companies lobby against your rights and would still work children if they could. Your disposable to the company it's why they try to get around the law to deny you heal insurance or union bust because then they might treat you like a human. 
---
They don't see you as that though your a disposable peon.
---
&gt;If you couldn‚Äôt trust your guild leadership with loot council, why would you choose to raid with that guild?
---
Because deceptive people dont make their intentions known beforehand
---
&gt;If someone wants to abuse a system DKP won‚Äôt stop them.
---
DKP system makes it easier to tell when the leadership is being abusive, because a DKP system is transparent. Furthermore if officers default loot to themselves, guess what, it's not DKP anymore - it's loot council
---
&gt;If classic really is about the community, why is there always so much bullshit surrounding loot?
---
Because it isnt, classic is more about nostalgia
---
See, you don't even have to feel moral outrage to not want to sub to the game anymore.
---
If someone who won the freaking tournament can get that harsh of a punishment for a crime that's honestly not that bad, what the hell's gonna happen to me if I just mention it in the game? 
---
I'm not gonna pay $15 a month when I could be permabanned and basically have a wasted investment.
---
How? If the dps are mongoloids and don‚Äôt let the tank actually tank, then everyone ends up taking a load of damage draining my mana meaning more downtime.
---
Let the tank pull and get aggro, if your dps and have the retail attitude of not being able to have an ounce of patience, I won‚Äôt heal you, you will either learn or be kicked and easily replaced.
---
I farmed the airs as the mobs were squishy and there were plenty of them with a nice respawn rate. The fires i got then through BRD runs and the last two off AH for 5g each.
---
The water and earth i bought - looked for stack deals in /trade and if not just pit bids on cheaper ones on the AH
---
What's the name of this shield?
---
I love zones in this game at night.  Don't know exactly what it is but I like the atmosphere of nighttime.
---
For some reason the people who cry "fascism" the most are usually supports of authoritarianism in the west, Democrat voters, EU supporters etc. It's extraordinary cognitive dissonance.
---
Still one of the greatest postsin wow history.
---
I tanked 52-60 dungeons as feral to get all the BiS needed feral (or resto) gear for raiding. Got to do dungeons like brd 5+ times anyway, so why not while leveling?
---
Well I guess it would be considered griefing if you do this intentionally.  So you might be right with that.
---
It can be any computer, really.
---
People have jobs, families and they want to entertain themselves to rewind. EVERY MAJOR multinational I MEAN EVERY LAST ONE OF THEM does shitty stuff. You can't crusade against everything. That means you could never drive a car , never fly anywhere ever again, can't buy most food products etc etc etc.
---
Warrior supply is so high that the demand is very low at 60 and its much much worse as a dps throughout.
---
Its also an auto attack bot with some buffs/debuffs til 40 besides WW. 
---
Holy Paladin will have a much easier time finding groups from 1-endgame and have pretty good raid viability from what i understand. (Im Horde though)
---
To be fair, it turned out he was right in my case. Not that I want retail either, mind you. I don't want any of it anymore, it turns out.
---
Anyone knows of a great vanilla pserver like what Light's Hope was couple years ago?
---
Listen, that's my owl's name. Get your own.
---
I was like that before, and I always regretted it, even if I got some sort of an endorphin rush every time I decided the "new class". This is it, this is now gonna be my char identity, Poggers!!! Because of this I didnt even hit level 60 in the original vanilla.  
---
Now, to change this I've figured out some ways for myself to fight that urge and stick on one char.
---
1. Have a long-term goal in mind with the game, and how you want to play it. It can even be type of tier 3 gear you want the most. That will set you a specific goal during Naxx, which is a long time from now. 
---
2. Chase the endorphin rush and the short-lived motivation spike in other areas, let wow be the chill, relax and enjoyable fix. Not the "WOOHOOO" feeling 
---
3. Sit down and figure out what class actually fit you best, and will give you overall the most enjoyable adventure. Dig deep, figure out pro's and con's
---
4. Try to make a deal with your char, you need to deck him out in gold and gear. Make the char the best you can, be disciplined about it.
---
Crusader is good. Costs roughly 50 gold though. Suppose fiery weapon is a budget alternative.
---
Yeah that's not really helpful. He has two old laptops with integrated graphics and shit cpus, they don't run it above 10 fps.
---
The thought of a pitch black catacomb is giving me anxiety
---
test
---
Classes that can only wear cloth or leather get salty when classes that are capable of wearing higher tiers of armor roll on those pieces. But an upgrade is an upgrade and stats are more important than armor type/rating. Continue rolling need if it's a legitimate upgrade and you plan on actually using the item.
---
Source: Paladin that's decked out in cloth and leather +healing power gear.
---
Good luck.. It has been in the game since vanilla. Dont think they'll do something about it 15 years later.
---
Test
---
I apologize. The USSR, of course, the leftovers of which we today call Russia.
---
Though Nikita Khrushchev wasn't even alive anymore in '89
---
loooollllll
---
In true druid fashion, I'd do a mix of all of the above.  Unless you're trying to get there as quickly as possible, in which case there's really no substitute for dungeon grinding.
---
Im triggered because you cry babies are the reason i cant do dungeons on my alts. Suck it up and stop wiping the group on purpose for egotistical reasons. Lower level dungeons are bad enough with people making ‚Äònew player mistakes‚Äô if you truly are a veteran carry the group and stop acting like elitist when you probably dont have a single established raiding achievement on retail. 
---
Tldr: IMO keep this whiny ass attitude in lfr
---
Not everyone is a soulless bugman like you
---
Look for a server with a good faction balance or favoured towards alliance.
---
Is it really 1 sec GCD for all rogue skills?? :O
---
I started playing Wow back in late BC, picked shaman because they looked cool, picked tauren for some reason. 
---
My first name is Axel and I was playing horde, the bad guys so Axel-ond (evil). Leveled straight to 55 and got sidetracked and leveled a shiny dk in wrath. Took a break for a while because nobody wanted to invite me to groups as a dk. 
---
Well, my shaman was already 55, so I went with that. Raided ICC heroic as resto shaman, all of cata, got every cutting edge achievement in mop as resto, same in WoD, got some top 50 world in legion before I decided to peace out on retail. 
---
Now I'm playing classic and, always be playing that Tauren resto shaman.
---
Iam going back to private servers. There are other ways to play the game you want to play without supporting the the chinese dick sucking and freedom of speech oppression.
---

The best race, you gnome hater.

You can probably save a few slots in your backpack. Bring 1 stack of bandages (make more if needed from the cloth you loot), 2-3 stacks of food, 1H + Shield, Hearthstone, Mining Pick, 1 stack of Deviate Delight (ideally 0), no Blacksmith Hammer (store it in your bank or mail) and you can choose to not bring your fishing rod and lures at all or bring them but then only take one stack of lures, unless you plan on fishing for a long time.
---
Those items would fill 11 slots at most, so you'd have at least 5 free slots in your backpack.
---

---
What an incredibly naive thing to say.
---
Food and drink is underrated. Speaking as a warlock.
---
Nah the only Prot tree talent you want is Hit % as Ret (or Kings depending on Paladin headcount/comp).
---
Prot tree is pretty bad, otherwise, unless you‚Äôre grabbing PvP talents specifically. Look at that glorious opener of either ‚Äúincreased aura that you won‚Äôt be using unless running multiple paladins‚Äù and ‚Äúshield block after getting clapped,‚Äù which the 2h guy won‚Äôt realistically get to use. Even the ACTUAL tank pally doesn‚Äôt make use of either of these once they‚Äôre crit immune (they want Ret for threat or the buffed Concentration to not lose their whole kit to silences).
---
Making Consecration baseline is clearly the first fix for Paladins and was the smart move in TBC. That allows tanks to flat out wander further down the Ret tree and actually get more threat increase, and allows Ret to decide if they want healing backup or utility backup as their 2nd tree.
---
Shit tank are a dime a dozen and easily replaced
---
It‚Äôs really not that hard. Hardest part is keeping others from despawning the mobs. Every demon has a specific mechanic that makes them a lot easier and doesn‚Äôt actually need your entire toolkit; just that one mechanic.
---
Hope you all enjoy your 3 hrs dungeon runs.
---
Lookin' GOOD (; dangle that carrot boi
---
&gt; The thing you‚Äôre missing out on here is the fact that the instant spell cast can (and should) be used to insta-hearth out of a compromising situation. This is the true power of Edward
---
Or to melee a mob as a raid is getting wiped to save your buffs.
---
No, you're wrong.
---
actually while you queue up heroic strike it increases your chance to hit during that time significantly
---
Everything these days devolved into an us vs them mentality
---
Awesome! Is that the druid wolfhelmet?
---
Judging by your comment history, you're very childish.
---
 You complain about the effectiveness of a boycott whist actively not helping it. 
---
Its fine if you don't value your principles over classic but we don't need to pretend there s more nuance to it.
---
Sword and board bro
---
Where to see realm stats for classic?
---
Well if they were a rogue they could take a few with them lol
---
Is there a long version of this? I dunno why but I love watching time lapses of cities and this is amazing.
---
&gt; So totally not worth the money?
---
It's BiS for a Shaman Tank Aoe gear set if you ever decide to tank. It's also BiS for Premade PvP.
---
Why not sticky it?
---
Why do you want to switch to horde? Just because of that its not worth to reroll.
---
I too value my entertainment over my principles.
---
Drop tailoring unless you plan to be the guild tailor and farm any rep/drops for rare recipes. Every guild needs a tailor.
---
Mooncloth is not nearly as profitable as alchemy being able to transmute on a shorter cooldown.
---
Gather professions are great as well if you put the time into farming with it.
---
Once ZG is out, you can power level tailoring again for cheap. You should get plenty of runecloth from endgame, and can farm lower level cloth if you don‚Äôt want to spend the gold.
---
I just ran lbrs, star and scholo. That was good xp. Also did my attunements but that's obviously not very goid, xp-wise.
---
well, I'm stuggling with the same thing I'd say
---
They guild I'm in is fine and I like the people here. We quested and ran a lot of dungs together and had our fun.
---
Our first 4 raids were fine with the loot rules. They were the same as you described here. But from 2 weeks ago we switched to "loot council" and I'm starting to think that I'd better run pugs.
---
First of all I've never 'reserved' any items ever in WoW and always stood for rolling because it's fair. Ofc you can negotiate with other players beforehand, that's obvious.
---
But having 0 chance at looting the item (I'm talking about caster weapons from Golemagg) is kinda bullshit. Our "loot council" already decided beforehand who gets the 'X next' weapon drops and I'm not in that list implying I will not be having at least a chance of getting a weapon upgrade for months.
---
So what do you guys think about this? What would you do?
---
Rogue is easy to get it off, gouge is long enough o cast it.
---
Warrior theorycraft discord has some nice info on what to do. Demo'ing or thunderclapping isn't worth it. SA = sunder armor HmS = hamstring and HS = heroic strike. Basically you apply sunders to a certain % of life of the mob then stop and pool rage for the next mob. Fishing for overpower procs with hamstring. starts to be worth it once you get a corpsemaker.  
---

If you read my comment again, I said I don't play or want retail as well. I'm done with WoW, all of it :)
---
I mean, take a few minutes and go look at the loot tables of DM.
---
*laughs in druid*
---
I can say from experience, getting head would be distracting but not enough to make misplays. What is this, amateur hour?
---
You know what I do when tanking? I pull a group and expect the DPS not to be AFK macroing or retarded and focus the logical first target.
---
yep, keep in mind though that it does about half the damage to you (half the damage of the non-crit amount)
---
Everybody run by themselves, usually group up happen inside of the dungeon.
---
From one second on google: https://www.wowhead.com/news=295075/classic-wow-realm-population-report-data-aggregated-through-community
---
no, classic is very casual friendly. i'd suggest anything but a warrior, since they are the biggest pain to level and gear.
---
I sure hope you don't have an iPhone while writing that. Nor using any of the Google-related products for that matter.
---
Happened to me. I feel your pain.  
---
Think of it as you are helping another one with the mount :)
---
Especially in classic where even just alone levelling takes a shitton of time and bis gear for pvp is obtained in endgame raids. Even if 90% of the players were mainly pvp focused, they still spend way more time doing pve/solo content because its required to compete in pvp, and because pvp'ers need gold too.
---
The only reason why I'm on a pvp realm is because a couple friends absolutely *insist* on being there.  I imagine a sizable percentage of the population of pvp servers is in the same boat.
---
Wait. Wait wait wait. I'm currently full ret paladin. Are you trying to tell me by simply slapping on a shield and a 1h I could be the tank for some BRD farms? My gear is not set up to tank in the slightest.
---
Can you explain how combat sword rogue is hard to lvl? Not sure if that was sarcasm but imo rogue is as easy as a hunter. I can 1on2, even 1on3 with sap. You can solo elites as soon as you get adrenaline rush. And if shit hits the fan you can still vanish.
---
This has got to be one of my favorites zones.
---
I accidentally stole this mob from someone the first time I did the quest. After I realized what happened, I used my horn to spawn it for him though. Can't believe someone would purposely be that much of a dick about it.
---
Reduces their armor still, so you deal more damage. And it can proc overpower, so you‚Äôll get to use it more often.
---
So much this. I was having such a blast playing it again. I, like many people here, was looking forward to it for years. But I haven‚Äôt been able to bring myself to log back in since the Blitzchung stuff. If they don‚Äôt release some kind of actual statement to the public outcry and reverse some portion of their decision, I‚Äôll likely just cancel my subscription  =\

Winter nights are so majestic. The contrast of white with the sky

This is BiS for a Melee Hunter. Which has been tested on pserver to be the highest dps achievable by a Hunter in the game. This goes into it in more detail https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZdUJmFm1EOE

Triple need / huntard

someone send me a screenshot via whatsapp in the first week where he had his whole backspace filled with arkane crystals and 6k gold, I reported him and he's still online every single day, abusing to his hearts content
---
ok but can i LFM/LFG while sitting in Ironforge for example?
---
Yesterday I was in a party of 4 and we were waiting at the SM entrance for 5th like 20 miniutes so its seems like a big waste of time to start running before you have full party.
---
Let's have a minute of silence for all Blizzard's PR and moderator who didn't asked anything and have to handle a enormous shitstorm they have nothing to do with.
---
Remember guys, the average blizzard's employee have nothing to do with it. Be nice with them.
---
I love Dun Morogh, it all started there for me 14 years ago...
---
It was so "immersive" for me at that time, that I asked myself why everyone run back and forth instead of going around doing quests. (The differece was in the pace)
---
Leveing guild, not a raid guild. Thats anyones first hint.  
---
600 members? So its FFA invites.  As in not actively recruiting via applications for raiding. 
---
Im not shitting on OP, im wandering what people expect of the guild when it is what it is.
---
You can‚Äôt mount while in combat anyways so your last point doesn‚Äôt matter
---
Someone is begging for a report, I guess.
---
Thanks for your take, appreciate it.
---
Ooo.. scary
---
Giving recipes to officers makes sense since you don't want someone to receive it and leave the guild.
---
Jesus...
---
I love how OP chose the bar colors for Hunter, Mages and Paladins.
---
I used to swap to 1h but now I think it's too slow and I'll stick with one handed
---
Agreed. Clearly he never REALLY liked the game. He's just virtue signalling, after all its not like people have principles and are willing to make sacrifices for said principles. That would be CrAzY.
---
Seal of Command is limited to 7 procs per minute I think. It should be only used if your weapon speed is above 3.2 seconds.
---
If you already got your 5/7 procs in the last mob, then you only got 2 left, it means the percent chance gets much lower.
---
Maybe if he is afk. Even Aoe grinders have enough muscle memory to frost nova blink when they agro something unexpected like a warrior charging them and to ice block when needed.
---
Care to enlighten me why it's suspicious? Just because my POV is different?
---
98g is good for it this early, yes its worth more later but count in the inflation too.
---
low quality bait
---
I ran sunken temple today with some pugs and it felt awkward. Like we shouldn't be playing and the fact that we were was dirty.
---
But what do you do? Cancel your sub and move on? I doubt they'd ever change their minds. They're investing in the bigger market.
---
Well the odd fact is that in this case western capitalism is falling in the trap of being dictated by a communist buyer.
---
It's perfectly fine to wait until you have a full group.
---
‚ÄùAt least I have chicken‚Äù
---
Sounds like the tank should be doing his job. ;)
---
Charge rend then swap to berserk instantly and pop berserk rage then hamstring and wait for for that 30rage cost fury spell
---
\*Laughs in Briarwood Reed\*
---
As a DPS if there's no mark I'll just dps priority mobs like healers, stuff that does a lot of damage, stuns the tank or whatever whilst throwing in some cleave (nova/CoC &amp; AE depending on number of mobs). 
---
As a Tank, other dps don't follow marks half the time anyway so it's no surprise people don't use them often.
---
absolutely not ok
---
thats what the two buttons are for:
---
need - I need this for my character
---
greed - I want htis for money
---
That makes no sense
---
good
---
Did you explain the issue to them before you let them die? Did you let the healer die for this as well?
---
I'm not sure if mouse/keyboard/monitor also need to be bought. If not, this configuration should be within your budget:
---
* CPU: AMD Ryzen 3 1200 boxed
---
* MB: Asrock B450 Pro4 (AM4 Socket)
---
* RAM: 16GB DDR4-3000 (e.g. G.Skill Aegis)
---
* GPU: PowerColor RX 580 Red Dragon V2
---
* HD: \~500g SSD (e.g. Curcial BX500)
---
* Power: be Quiet! Pure Power 11 500W
---
Let them die each pull :D repair costs will teach them
---
I wish there was more to it. It was completely unsolicited.

I assure you your report won't be in vain. They take real life threats like that pretty seriously.

---
&gt;See no reason why they couldn‚Äôt just plateau and make games outside of China
---
Because they're a publicly traded company that experienced explosive growth over the past decade and investors expect continued growth. They're shackled to their stock value and anyone in a management position would commit career suicide if they turned against China. 
---
That's why they'll continue to lick China's boots, because it's costing them less potential income than standing up for western ideals. 
---
Not defending this behavior, just stating why it's happening - in my opinion ActiBlizz could probably survive a stock value crash and even if their current senior management was never making a single additional cent in their life, they'd be more than fine with their current wealth.
---
Demand is too high. Noob tanks will get in groups regardless if they're good or not. No reason to improve or consider they're in a group task.
---
The thing about classic is that people have been theorycrafting specs for over a decade on private servers. The reason why popular specs exist is because they are better than others. You can of course go for the talents you came up with if that makes you happy but you will be leveling much slower than you could otherwise.
---
Blizzard will act if you reported them or wrote a ticket. 
---
You can still do it. 
---
Happened to me two times, just opened a ticket with timestamp, server and everything. Done.

Seems like this to me too. I‚Äôm finding since hitting level 22 that Combat Rogue is an absolute beast with Riposte and two swords off AH. I‚Äôm taking 4 mobs at a time if I have evasion or stoneform up. What level are you? Perhaps Rogue gets harder later on.

No, it retail it is

Okay i'll make sure to get one made right away.

Now that's just neat! Great job, the double sulfuras is absolutely frontpage material
---
When I installed auctioneer on twitch wow said it was out of date or something and disabled it, said it could interfere with gameplay
---
More acceptable when it is just a death and can be ressed after the pull. Making people corpse run is taking it too far.
---
Fairly difficult to do my job when other people try to do it for me, and then proceed to run around like idiots leaving me to chase them down.
---
Should be your first step immediately next time :)
---
they're from like 2007-2009 :D
---
It screams to be made into heatmap of common playerpaths. Love it!
---
It doesnt go against my principles to keep playing a game i enjoy because the corporation behind it fucked up. Looks like we're quite a bit different.
---
Also, the classic dev team doesnt deserve this, it wasnt even them who fucked up
---
Nice overlay on your stream, I like it.
---
Yeah jed+rend farm runs are often just 6man.
---
This topic gets always an half k of up votes.

I think I will also repeat it in a month or so.

I'm a horde druid. I got my mount at 40, and have a secret farming spot. I had some leftover gold so I bought some gear upgrades. I didn't have enough for a wardens, shits like 200g on my server already. So I bought that 1h mace that has like 160 armour and 5 defence. Basically a ghetto wardens. But I have my wolfshead helm too. 
---
 Hitting 40 gives druids so many upgrades too man. Dire bear, mount, innervate and a bunch of other goodies. I was starting to feel weak untill I hit 40. 
---
 Enjoy the druiding brotha.
---
5 eyes and 0 leaves here.
---
If you change to ecosia, you could even support planting trees :) But I am not sure, if you are satisfied with the search results, since it is a German search engine.
---
I tanked mostly on whitemane server. I have two macro to mark "skull' and "X". I always mark before each pull even if there is only two mobs. Unless healer pull aggro, I won't chase loose mobs. 
---
I charge, beserker rage mid charge, sunder skull, sunder X, then focus back to skull.
---
My problem always arise when the dumb hunter/mage/lock just switch back to "skull"/"X" after pulling aggro on third mobs. The healer has to heal so much the dumb dps that healer pull aggro from the dpser, then I have to chase after the loose mob now it is on the healer and 30yd from me.
---
The actual fuck?
---
Long fights where you've run long enough to get out of combat occur, granted you should have enough mana by the time that happens to use your class mount, but youre likely using a large proportion of remaining mana to mount up, which is less mana for combat.
---
And the again, class mounts are just shit due to being able to be counter spelled, which gets you combat raped.
---
One of us! One of us! ONE OF US!
---
I‚Äôve had one of those before. Told them to go ahead as I‚Äôll be sure to have my Glock ready to shove down their throat
---
the only thing that needs to be bought is a keyboard - they'll use an old tv as monitor and I'll send them my old mouse.
---
I'm aware those specs will be fine, the problem is buying a pre-built pc with them. Most pre-built pcs will either cheap out somewhere, or not be sold with older hardware. Heck, every website I've been to doesn't even list Ryzen 3 cpus anymore.
---
Saw some on my server today goin for 200.
---
Skinning mate
---
Not true, heroic strike just has a higher chance to hit compared to the white hit it could've been, except it doesn't give rage. So it's basically a small amount of bonus damage for 15 rage plus the 10-20 rage the white hit could have generated but didn't because it was turned into heroic strike. I don't know exactly how much bonus damage it gives buy it isn't worth 25 rage and it's certainly not worth 35.
---
it needs to already come with the gpu inside. No work on it.
---
Human rights violations and torture is very much american values though.
---
Famous last words.
---
I know your joking, but for thoses that don't know. Warriors have to be 'hit by mobs' to generate rage. This rage is then spent on threat generating abilities. So if the dps pulls then they get hit and its harder for the tank to taunt and keep the aggro. Also if this happens as a dps please stop hitting the mob and move ' towards' the tank please don't kite the mob away while constantly hitting it. And use the option to target the tanks target so your hitting the correct mob too. Thanks
---
I don't think that's true. [This was certainly not written by Blizzard China](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/blog/23179289/hearthstone-grandmasters-asia-pacific-ruling)
---
I know, Im just pointing out that you are a minority, you are tired of wow, it's ubderstandable, me personally after BFA disappintment have played tons of games from JRPG to FPS, and I can confirm that I rather play WoW than most of those games, it's way more immersive for me even tho the combat system is outdated.
---
Won't work, requires working on it. I wrote that that's not gonna happen. Even just plugging in a gpu would probably scare him off.
---
Could make a Horde on a different server and keep the Rogue around. I find playing with people is what makes this game. Perhaps you jut need to get into an active levelling guild or be a bit more social and group up with randoms in the world.
---
Most of all, if you like the class fantasy of Horde and it‚Äôs important to you and you are regretting the choice then go Horde. Often RL friends will peel off (I‚Äôm lucky, mine are almost as obsessed as I am right now, almost) but you can find people online to play with.
---
so the bigger the heal you use the more mana you save. Because if i heal a target 3 times for 200hp instead of healing them 1 time for 600hp i have more mana regen.
---
just another argument why smaller heals are bad.
---
Its funny how everybody on this shit subreddit throws around the term downranking without even understanding its purpose or even why it works
---
orc warrior is slightly better dps and equal tank with different strength than undead
---
more like ‚Äúdont need any friends, so nobody will betray me‚Äù , which is yeah, simpler, but also more sad :(
---
After Diablo immortal last year I don't think they needed the grandmaster debate to make it a shit show. Think a lot of people had lost faith after that and the many misfiring updates to wow
---
I still don't understand how EVERY SINGLE pserver got it wrong on how many times the RTV can be mined
---
It always depends on the group. If someone clearly doesn't know what he/she is doing and they start pulling mobs i just let them tank. No taunting in that case and i don't even move from my position. They have to learn a lesson.
---
Most dps know my intentions by setting marks on mobs, though. If a pat is about to getting close to another mob group i'm glad when any dps makes a good pull with an instant cast, as i as a warrior always have a delay when using my ranged weapon.
---
If I remember right, The first boss(fire giant on highway) on brd drops a one handed mace with armor.
---
He has Warmonger... probably bought it.  You know, that's what you do with things that can carry you in to raiding...
---
Yes, I ended up doing this after the plane's wifi cut out. Could have saved $8!
---
The world benefitted so heavily from using Chinas cheap labour and goods, benefitting from their suffering for decades, but they're only mentioning that now because of Hong Kong.
---
People somewhere always suffer for you to be able to not suffer.
---
The world is at fault for giving China so much leverage over them, and the same way that Saudi Arabia holds leverage over the world too.
---
Grabbed a warmonger which is my BIS weapon, have 80g I just made from flipping essences on AH pending, and wild leather working quest was expensive.
---
Nah I can't stand that kind of thing. I think like I'm playing every role no matter what role I'm actually playing. 
---
Mob runs away from tank? I've already r1 Frost bolted it to help the tank catch it . Other idiot instantly AoEs before tank gets agro? I'll nova to make sure he's got more time before threat is ripped. Healer pulls? I already sheeped it before it hit him. 
---
I'm not perfect, nobody is, but I'll do what I can to make runs go as smooth as possible, I just wish everyone would instead of like you say, playing dps so they can "brain afk". My Irl friend does the same as me, and groups notice it when you play to help the group. As a Warrior he's constantly intercepting to interrupt a cast or taunt a mob off a ranged/healer and bring it back to the tank.
---
Hey, if it was goblin-engineered, that's exactly what it'd do.

What? All the private server experts said you'd be exalted by level 42. This has to be fake news.

This. Thank you fellow huntard
---
Holy paladins in PvP are so stupidly good, all the utility, insane single target healing, ridiculous survivability. Gets my vote every time!

If you don't want to heal though you're probably better off going druid.

At least The hinterlands is a great questing zone now. I went there with pretty much an empty quest log and still had to abandon a quest or two to make room.

APES uses a druid tank, so the idea that feral tanks are "bad" is something that really annoys me.

Druid tanks are fine, obviously warriors are better because of shield wall and shield block, druid tanks were fine in vanilla, they're fine now.

Same! Really fun to play spriest but I have to come to terms with rerolling healer at 56ish and farming gear as a healer. I enjoy it also though sp no biggie for me.
---
In most dungeon pulls though you're not going to use all your mana so yes you're right it's pointless to do it in combat. There are a few reasons someone might want to though.
---
They might be lifetapping in anticipation that they will heal themselves in some way. Also Demon Armor regens HP so warlocks will usually avoid being at full HP to take advantage of that. Lifetapping is also way to manage aggro, taking a GCD to lifetap while the tank gets more threat. Also anytime you need to move it's a good time to throw in a lifetap.
---
Too bad you are so close to gadgetzen. Would be cool if you killed her and then she could see the logs.

Never tell me the odds.

I‚Äôm right there with you. Playing WoW Classic has been the best gaming experience I‚Äôve had in such a long time, but I can‚Äôt continue to support this company until they apologize and rectify their actions, sadly I know it won‚Äôt happen.

Dont threaten me with a good time!

No wonder then, that's ancient by now :D.

I mean, to be pedantic, you said lax was the "correct" spelling, but in English it's not, it's lox. So as I said before, I meant lox, because that's what it's called in English.
---
Druid set in unfortunately total garbage sans a few pieces.
---
Have grouped with skilled tanks and many noob tanks. The good tank always marks and has macros. The noob tank runs in when while the healer is oom and dies, then leaves the group.

Afraid yes. Every point you attempted to make was false/irrelevant or both. Just read through my comment untill you can follow the argument. Youre in over your head kid.

I am not sure how their refund policy works in that case. I went to refund my war3 reforged preorder, and I could see in the transaction history that I could request a refund of my last monthly wow sub.
---
Maybe you have the option to refund your 6 month payment ? I imagine this will remove the mounts and whatnot if it goes through
---
Nobody cares dude everyone dies it‚Äôs the way of life. Stop trying to get attention

false information my guy

Im Just new to the game

Never!

Nope. It acts as though the cast timer is still 3 seconds. You don't get penalized for taking the talent.
---
Do you play on a PVE server?

Druid / Pali hands down.
---
Couple of questions:
---
1) Rag AoE knockback even if you resist does it have a threat drop mechanic and if so its it a number or a %?
---
2)  If you are tank at 100% threat on a mob attacking you, a melee is at 105% threat, and a mage is at 115% at range, if you use taunt does it set your threat higher or does it only set your threat to the person currently tanking the taunted NPC which in this case would be yourself so 0 threat change?
---
3) Anyone have numbers for threat per rage for Shield Slam/Revenge/Sunder.  I know the order if you aren't budgeting rage but I often am not rage capped and have to pick and choose.  Are shield slam and revenge both better than sunder per rage spent?
---
His 2.9 speed weapon still has about \~30% procchance on SoC, and at that level his SoR definitely wont hit for 20 unless you're counting in JotC, which would also push SoC to about \~120-130. 100% chance for 20 extra dmg (\~12-15 without JotC) or 30% chance for \~130 extra dmg (\~100+ without JotC) is really very easy math.
---
Of course it can happen in some fights that you wont get a single proc, but it can also happen in other fights that every single hit procs. If you want to talk about consistency you have to count with the statistical factual % average, not 15-20 second fights with 0 procs or your personal feeling on how rare it procs.
---
Also btw: SoC procs can crit (using your melee crit chance), SoR cant.
---
You cannot lockpic the viewing door, you have to kill rattlegore.

Thanks for the feedback! I figured I‚Äôd spend more time drinking, but that‚Äôs not a deal breaker for me!
---
The values for those will stay roughly the same. Dreamfoil is one of the most sought after right now and is the most abundant in Dire Maul. 
---
Silversage on my server is already pretty high selling for 50-60 silver each. And plaguebloom is easy to gather and not as useful right now. Icecaps could raise a little though since you can only get them from Winterspring.
---
I chimed in with a "haven't you druids ever heard of, opening a god damn door no, it's much better to do those kinds of things, with posable digits one would think!"
---
My problem is that I haven‚Äôt built up a good int set! I have a few pieces, hopefully they‚Äôll sustain me for a bit while I farm dungeon pieces. Thanks for the feedback!

The backbone of society is suffering, and in a world of globalisation, people must suffer around the world for our happiness. It's only natural for people to be controlled, and manipulated by their governments to be kept in line to keep social order. Only a certain amount of freedom and social disorder is allowed, ironically to keep social order. For a country with almost 1.4 billion, a sense of nationalism, fear, and faith in the government is necessary to keep so many people in line, to not disrupt social order. A government that is not fundamentally controlling their populace, be it through ingrained societal or inherited beliefs, will not last.
---
Your life is a direct result of people's suffering, the phone you're using, the clothes you're wearing, the food you eat. Likely someone slaved away in terrible conditions for you to enjoy the life you live. (I'm assuming you're not a self sustaining citizen)
---
I care more about play classic wow than I do about pretending unsubbing makes a significant difference, apart from feeling good about myself and getting those epic internet back pats.
---
It's a shame though, I hoped the le epic redditors and pseudo morally outraged people would cause the stock to dip way more, I really wanted to buy into a big dip. Hopefully it drops in the coming weeks. But let's not forget that the Amazon is on fire! Hey guys don't forget! You care right? You weren't just talking about it since everyone else was?
---
Honestly, the early 30s were abit of a dead space for me questing wise. I found I had to travel too much between different zones on both Kalimdor and the eastern kingdoms.
---
I‚Äôd actually recommend setting up shop on brill and basically living in scarlet monastery. You get some decent gear, nice gold and plenty of silk cloth (which is good if you‚Äôre a tailor, and if not you can sell it). If you get fatigued by the dungeon spam you can break it up by questing in nearby hillsbrad/arathi highlands.
---
It makes me feel better so I don't think it's for nothing. I still love the game and I'm hoping for some big reversal but not holding my breath either.
---
Idk about Ironfoe vs mirahs for tanking. I have always been a Ironfoe fan boy. But definitely go for Quel'Serrar, that thing is awesome.
---
Ehm. Seriously, thats your answer?) obviously the idea of his comment was ‚ÄúBlizz wont ban people for this shit like they didnt ban people for cheating with layers‚Äù. And then ur answer ‚Äúman, this post is not about layering‚Äù. wut?? Yes its not, but we spoke about bans and he told an example.  ‚Äúthis isnt relating to layering at all‚Äù, ok huh.
---
Me and my dad still play wow together too. Started in vanilla and played every expansion. Now I'm 37 and he's 70. It keeps us close and even though we live far apart it allows me to easily keep in touch every day.
---
Yes
---
U Can't Touch This ttttttttttttt td d, td td
---
&gt; Oh god, forcing your raid to play around your garbage class choice is not a solution, its a bandaid.
---
&gt; 
---
&gt; You are just dragging 40 ppl around so you can feel special. I feel bad for them
---
forcing? are you aware of how easy Classic is turning out to be? You seem to be under the impression everyone needs to be min-maxed to kill a boss with a warrior tank. There so much room for allowing off-meta stuff to happen/try.
---
You mean the community told them: "you think you dont want to do it, but you do" ?
---
Awesome to hear that you still killed things pretty fast. I think I‚Äôm convinced, time to respec!
---
Bro, that name, guild, and rank combo tho
---
i know the feeling, normally i am just not the type to farm or whatever but i dont even feel like i can turn in the bow (assuming i get onyxia sinew on sunday) until i have th blue one lol, it's a signature class quest and i've invested so much time into the blue one that it would be very unsatisfying to leave it!
---
Tanks aren't the only one that can mark.  If a tanks not marking ask if you can.   Why does everyone expect the tank to know everything about a dung?
---
This is so stunning, makes me fall in love with the game all over again.
---
Maybe Noescape is his nickname because he can't escape his gf?

---
They punished someone for breaking the tournament rules. I don't think it's crushing anything.
---
If your not Dungeon grinding, Fury 2h will always be superior to arms for leveling.
---
I‚Äôve been playing for a month and I‚Äôm still only 35. But again I have a full time job and family responsibilities, so I only get a couple of hours or so every other night.
---
I also play other games too, I‚Äôm adamant this game won‚Äôt take over my life like I it took over my teens lol.
---
please believe obvious propaganda. its hilarious to read.
---
Nope, PvP for life.
---
Lots of hypocrites in the comments, its cute that you guys atleast try look better then you are for those sweet internet points :)
---
&gt; Other than that, why bother?
---
I dont want to leave my raid team hanging, and there's no benefit to Bliz for me to use my remaining time. But since I already unsubbed, it would take a conscious effort to subscribe again... which wont happen unless Bliz shows some moral integrity.
---
The improved talent...
---
Stormstrike: Gives you an extra attack. In addition, Nature damage you have dealt is increased by 15%. Lasts 20 sec. 18% of Base Mana. 20 sec cooldown. 
---
The new talent... 
---
Surging Momentum: Every critical strike dealt, returns 1/2/3% of maximum mana. Requires 20 points in Enhancement.
---
Hunter doesn‚Äôt do damage...
---
Uhm what? Hunters and Rogues ARE the 19 twinking bracket.
---
I love playing as many different classes and roles as possible. To get the most out of the game.  
---
But to that end, I make sure to at least get one lvl60 as fast as possible to support the others, then I start leveling 2-3 other characters in paralell.
---
&gt;ok but can i LFM/LFG while sitting in Ironforge for example?  
---
I saw that people where LFG SM, while doing quests in Kalimdor or STV )
---
And I had few situations where people joined SM party without even traveling north of IF, so they needed to walk all the way from IF to SM. And of course they will take detours to Southshore/Plaguelands to open FP there.
---
They will also see attrition from their employees too. A highly technical company already will be struggling to find people with highly technical skills. 
---
I'd bet money that many employees are considering if they really want to work for a company that does this, and many potential applicants who are less invested before they start work there, will also likely be influenced.
---
similar story to me i was 7 when vanilla was around too but had to share one computer between me and my 4 brothers. now we all play together on our own pcs :)
---
What class
---
you are still playing a game that is directly supporting the lizard people that run the shadow government?
---
disgusting
---
When will Dire mault be released plz ? 15 October morning at reset time ? Thanks in advance
---
The saltshaker is a Leatherworing item that has a 3 day cool down. It changes deeprock salt (maybe 40s on my server) into refined deeprock salt (12.5g On the AH). It requires you to have 250 in Leatherworking to use.
---
Some animations just look better with certain weapon types. Taurens look awesome when they swing a big 2-handed mace, orcs swing animations match well with axes, undead have a stab like move that goes well with daggers, etc.
---
Male troll animations are way to over the top for something small like a dagger but work well with big scimitars or swords.
---
As said in the links, this only applies to off-hand attacks while duel wielding.
---
Wow, that's amazing. üíô It definitely doesn't feel like my dad is a few states away when we're playing together, it's so awesome to be able to keep in touch this way!
---
This is where I'm at. I leveled prot, but respecc'd Fury/Prot after hitting 60 because of these stupid AOE people.
---
I would MUCH MUCH RATHER tank, but it's not worth the effort right now.
---
I don't know when you'll get poisons but don't worry it's soon enough and it doesn't affect the following, which is:
---
1) Use your highest dps weapons
---
2) Among your two highest dps weapons (who will probably be and remain swords during your leveling), use the slowest one in the right hand.
---
I think people do that for leveling because you need a dagger main hand for some skills, it's just convenient at lower levels so you just get whatever dagger you can get and your highest dps offhand with it.
---
Also, you can get poisons at 20 but the quest might be hard. For Horde, you need to kill a lvl 25 monster, or 50% of a 24 elite's hp for example, which might be hard if your gear isn't too great. 
---
Ask for help if you can, definitely worth going for it asap. I made 120 poisons right away and i'm still having a third of these at level 27, and it barely cost anything.
---
That‚Äôs what he means... someone found it immediately with an AH addon :p
---
Yeah it's default ElvUI but the shadow/backdrop has been enabled.
---
Okay this is weird. I just tested two windserpents of the same level, one "caster" (in Vanilla at least) and one not. Their stats are identical *except* for damage. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/9TNef5o.jpg
---
But I've heard rumors that casters do slightly more damage with Lighting Breath, and the bit of testing I did suggests that might be true. I'd need to do more though.
---
So they're not behaving like they did in Vanilla, but they're not completely normalised either.
---
You know its a matter of how much you punish someone. First I wanna say I hope the people of HK get their freedom and I support the protests. I also understand that sport events are not a place where athletes should talk shout their political opinions. In the end blizzard could have made a statement about that this is his opinion and he should not do it again and let it be. But ofc they have to ban him I mean cmon this is ridiculous
---
Nope, to prevent spam-switching)
---
You let them suckers die. Tank is priority.
---
Realistically, before 60 dps is about the only stat worth choosing on, there just is not a lot of competition in the weapons available if you aren‚Äôt going to drop a mountain of gold on BoEs.
---
Have a ticker with current average deviate delight prices.
---
Put free trap, unlock the cage, start taming.
---
Right, just gonna pretend i understand your crippled english. Really gets the Point across

Threads like this make me understand how Nazis could survive so long.
---
What the hell....
---
Through layering it is not like we have more Gold in the economy than we should have.
---
We might have more mats than we would have but probably not - because as there were more layers and more nodes/arcane crystals etc. there were also more Players to use that shit.
---
Therefore it all evens out. I really don't get how People are still outraging over this. 
---
More Players on a Server = more layers = more items  - it just doesn't make a difference.
---
As an example. You have 1000 items on a Server of 3000 Players.
---
Now you have a Server or 9000 Players and 3000 items. It is still 0,33 items per Player on average it literally doesn't Change a Thing.
---
The only Thing could be that single Players have more Gold than they would usually have because they were able to take Advantage of having more than one economy to buy things from. 
---
That only affects the very first 60's that were investing in stuff. But that would have happend anyways because there is always People at 60 first.
---
Now layering is removed anyways and I don't see a Problem. Prices are high for things it should be - and low for things it should be.
---
I don't have an influx of certain items on my realm. All good.
---
Instead of calling it Rich they should just call the small one Poor.
---
Just a funny information, the quest actually states something in the lines of "you should not harm her" which starter the debate of can we hit her for aggro or not? The answer is yes, you just can't kill her.
---
you are a shit team mate, and your excuses doesnt change shit. i cant tell you how many bad pulls ive saved with solid healing and people were just happy after those.
---
It will still happen if you get in a group with windfury.....every time I hit stormstrike on my shaman when windfury goes off I get a supermodel troll.
---
Woot! Man, I could barely handle sharing our computer with my dad and brother I couldn't imagine 4! That's freakin awesome though...especially having a perfect 5m group haha
---
Imagine writing this on reddit instead of just going to wowhead classic.
---
What does that 55/65 and 54/65 below the portraits mean?
---
20 is the earliest you can get poison, some don‚Äôt get it until 20 because the quest can be a challenge solo.  But this advice is spot on
---
I did not want to know that... Also, we have 10 priests in the pool. I guess I will have aq20 mace before this one.
---
Go to Shimmering Flats.  
---
If you Alliance, there's perfect Jame's Alliance leveling guide 30-41.
---
I have absolutely zero sympathy with the people who are taking this to a disproportionate levels. It's the whole "like on facebook to help this and that" levels of commitment. They lose nothing by showing support online for someone across the globe.
---
If we take the situation, without political context (which I believe is best to get a discussion based on facts), Blizzard have a rule which tells players to act appropriately within their tournaments, which includes leaving your political opinion outside official broadcasts. If anyone disagrees with that, they aren't just idiots, they're retarded.
---
If the Hearthstone player in question had shown his support on his personal twitter without doing it on a live broadcast, nothing would have happened. Blizzard couldn't have cared less. The fact is though, that he abused his position while being on Blizzards broadcast, to show his political support, which is entirely against Blizzards rulebook for participating players.
---
You simply can't have sympathy with someone who is on the wrong side. It's completely wrong to target anger at Blizzard. People can target their anger at China, but Blizzard is caugth between a rock and a hard place here where they need to follow their rules or show support for a political situation they have no interest in.
---
Honestly that hurts you way more than them.
---
DPS 101 is Healer &gt; Caster &gt; Melee.
---
I am a warlock and I never expect the healer to heal me in dungeons from taps. I have my own tools to handle my mana/health economy and restore health during pulls, like spamming drain life/tap if needed. If I am completely spent after a pull, I can drink and eat like everyone else. I appreciate getting a HoT or something, but I would never expect constant heals - I am not taking any damage except from myself, so why would I need to be topped off? If I take aggro because I messed up, I have healthstone and death coil to stabilize.
---
If it is slowing down the group that you have to heal the warlocks, just stop doing it. Any good warlock won't complain.
---
The snowy zones have always been my favourite areas of WoW
---
Keep a list of these people as I am sure familiar faces will pop up, have a three strike and blacklist rule. 
---
If you are a tank, you have the power to kick people from the group. 
---
As well as once you get the swing of things and you make a few friends along the way, you know the healer who put up with all thedumb shit and kept the ball rolling. That hunter who actually knew that they can control their pet. The mage who understands you don't need to pull 15 mobs at a time ect. 
---
After a little while and you are able to do some. Networking you won't run into pug problems any more.
---
I only mark targets when I feel dps can't go without them. There is no need for a detailed target setup if it works well without.
---
As if Hillsbrad is not full of high lvl Horde herbing/mining/going to Arathi/Hinterlands ready to wipe all Alliance players in the area after first call in general.
---
Find a better guild.
---
Just sell them. +32 armor is nothing.
---
Locks use their health interchangeably with their mana. Don't stress about topping them off all the time. If you have spare mana, sure, but if not they have drain life/healthstones/etc to gain it back themselves.
---
I couldn't agree more. My husband had been a champion of Classic for years, followed every thread and was active in every public discussion for over two years. He hyped me up on Classic. I resubbed for Classic. I've been listening to this hype train for longer than I cared to but I was pumped when it dropped. 
---
The Vanilla experience is fantastic. We played every single day since launch, took a week off work at the beginning to just play like basement dwellers instead of responsible adults.
---
But the day the Blitzchung news hit we both cancelled our subs and haven't logged back in.
---
No amount of personal fun is worth aligning myself with this bullshit. 
---
I'm not waiting out an apology, because the apology came and it wasn't too Blitzchung or the casters, it was too China. Blizzard is bowing and scraping to a totalitarian fascist regime and punishing a young protester. 
---
Are we so far removed from the massacre at Tiananmen Square that we will be so selfish about our game time? 
---
My sub is a drop in the bucket, but if all of the people waiting for a response would just sack up and drop Blizzard like the steaming pile of shit they are, they'd have to respond or really slow their true colours.
---
At the end of the day it boils down to Personal Enjoyment vs Human Rights Issue.
---
Blizz made this into a far more politicised issue than Blitzchung ever could have on his own and it's up to the remaining players to decide which side they're on. 
---
I truly hope that this community is less self interested than the wait and see approach or the ignore it and play blinders.
---
Yeah... I'm talking about the leveling experience. And thorium shells are very specific
---
Yippee-ki-yay motherfucker
---
Yes albeit bit odd. You'd go for any int/spelldamage (which means just int as spelldmg is hard to come by pre 40 and even then it remains rare) piece and do Judgement of the Crusader &gt; Seal of Righteousness &gt; Judgement of Righteousness. Keep Devotion Aura on as you'll be wearing some cloth/leather most likely. It's viable and plays like a melee caster of sorts, relatively comparable to standard Ret leveling (but I'm rather convinced it's not as efficient as Ret though).
---
Looking at spell coefficients at  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list\_of\_spellcoefficients\_1121/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/) 
---
you'd want to go for fast 1h weapon. Note that I have no clue how accurate these coefficients are.
---
Haha, this is brilliant!
---
I did not even know it is on fire. But like you say, i would not give a shit, and I dont do now, so why pretend to?
---
People are so thirsty for fake karma points that its gone from retarded to funny
---
Just your typical toxic private server player who after 10 years of no moderation still think they can behave like that. Just report so they are banned from the game, the less of them there are the better.
---
&gt; Chances are good blizzcon will be a proper shit show.
---
Can't wait.
---
Yeah I know but I see people run the opposite which confuses me which is sword on offhand and dagger mh which is to the left
---
*Laughs in priest*
---
Hey man, just wanted to let you know that this is now my desktop background. Thanks!
---
Well, It's hard to say. I'd say that if 15% agility gives you less than 60 agi, it's pretty bad..I heard people with naxx gear were usually going with this build, so people with over 500 agi unbuffed.
---
If you play your build right, you probably have the +20% crit chance for raptor strike.
---
Go for a big 2hander and weave in a raptor strike  in your dps rotation, this should provide some boost to your dps. Of course, this is doable with 20/31, but you have bigger chances to crit!
---
Neat
---
Yeah I was running SM the other day and this warrior DPS kept switching targets so I couldn't keep threat, then ninjad the wand at the end. Fuccnut-Flamelash, fuck you
---
If this is your goal I suggest looking into a holy-reckoning build. You lose some spell crit and holy shock but with a nice 2-h or something with an on hit effect you can knock people out
---
Can you tell me what are you doing on a daily basis about basic human rights being violated besides being angry at an american corporation?
---
Isn‚Äôt it slow on your mainhand and fast on tour offhand? Slow is 2.40 speed right?
---
Full Quest run: expect these to take 2-3hours. more if you wipe. Youll do the whole instance. 
---
Emperor runs: Groups take the shortest route to the last boss. Sometiems involve lava swimming to skip sections of the dungeon. 
---
Arena/angerforge farm. Usually done by mele groups farming two of the best in slot drops for them. A trinket and a chest. Both a quite rare. Casters how some good loot that can drop in the arena so sometimes they tag along aswell. 
---
Jailbreak: (ally). You clear the entire area at the start to do the onyxia preQ where you excort a guy around the place. 
---
Torch farm (no longer a thing since exp was nerfed): This was for a short time an absolutely insane exp farm for caster aoe groups repetedly farming the fast respawning mobs in one section of the dungeon.
---
That's complete nonsense quite frankly. There are quite a lot of lvl 60s but they are mostly the unemployed or the experienced non lifers not meaning to offend anyone. Theres tons of people still leveling, the majority seem to be around 40 still so forget that guy. Complete ass.
---
No no, that‚Äôs only cause you‚Äôre a dwarf. Things tend to look bigger
---
Interesting that you need to save her before you can murder her for loot...
---
Looks like a undead Variant of "I have the Power"
---
wow I so want this too! Sounds so cute
---
it's a bit more than that, since you pool energy anyways as a rogue, instead of spamming.  and not to do 100% of the time, but when you are more "waiting" better to time it with the swing than right before, and essentially waste an extra attack
---
If you‚Äôve got a 38-40 tank and at least one good dps and some cc then it‚Äôs definitely doable, but body pulls are gonna be an issue unless you‚Äôre careful.
---
You followed the same rules everyone agreed to when joining the raid. The threatening whispers you got are just from salty morons who deal with not getting their shiny loot by throwing temper tantrums.
---
Kick is like 5s lock out.
---
Was doing RFK where our hunter was complaining about our tank.
---
Like "do you even learned taunt?", "I have never seen you using taunt" etc. and then he pretended like he only wanted to give advices to the warrior
---
Like if you dont focus the same target as warrior and you start dps right of the bat then ofc most likely gona pull some aggro, be a man, deal with it
---
Furthermore the mobs in this dungeon were a joke so not like any of this did matter
---
I so regret not having "Salt" for this dude
---
you don't know what happened to them previously. violence begets violence. when I started classic I was initially friendly to all horde, they didn't attack me either, but on higher zones and more contested quests it kept becoming worse and worse... and now after getting killed 3-4 times just to enter any blackrock instance, because there's always 50 hordes camping there, I do get the urge to just go and gank some horde, because they WILL all camp blackrock once they reach lvl 60. I don't do it, because I have smarter things to do in the game, but I do get that it can be a nice vent for pent-up frustrations caused by the other faction.
---
Absolutely stunning.
---
Everything up until Drakk is a piece of cake.
---
1. For Drakk you want either a hunter or mage to pull Drakk into the other room and start kiting him.
---
1. When this happens, tank the adds and kill them 1 by 1 (off-tank can be used for other add but doable with 1 tank).
---
1. When adds are dead, hunter or mage uses feign death or ice block to cause boss to run back to raid.
---
Then you kill the boss, simple.
---
I‚Äôm 24 as ret, and have healed DM and stockades with no problem. Healing dungeons is doable at any level (at least below BRD+) based on having a good group and some int gear to wear.
---
If you want to go holy your solo will be much weaker and your dungeons will be easy to heal. If you stay text your solo will be stronger, you may find groups as dps, and you will still be able to heal dungeons just fine. Seems like a simple decision to me
---
That‚Äôs awesome! :)
---
No, because being angry and voting with my wallet is enough for my conscience, we all have to draw our line somewhere. Have fun on the game!
---
Please upvote me please please my beliefs can only be validated when I get upvoted more than the person I disagree with please upvote me
---
I'm the opposite version of this. My son started watching me play, when he was 5-6. Not long after, he was my "ore farm bot" &amp; then not long after that, he made a rogue on my account that I poured gold into to twink him up.
---
Fast forward 15 years, he's moved out &amp; playing WoW with me. He's now ahead of me in classic (he hit 60 2 days ago I'm only 55) &amp; it's been fantastic!
---
Could I interest you in some Dark Souls 1?
---
As an alliance player, what you describe is 100% of my leveling experience past level 20/25
---
One day, I'll grow up. And I will lean on to this fence like other giant bipedal races!
---
The feeling when after one tour in ungoro and you have 17 quests to turn in.
---
49 priest, 38 hunt, 32 druid, and now a brand new 18 mage.
---
Help me.
---
Free roll is free roll, you won it fair. We had a druid win core hound tooth in a PUG run and it got so bad we had to kick some rogues and warriors from the raid.
---
Yah i seen them too but dont worry about those people focus on yourself and do it the right way mh is always slower than offhand remember that and spread the word to those that got it the otherway around:)
---
I didn't forget it. I just didn't put it because it's no money compared to the total :)
---
Play better?
---
&gt;  spam sunder to 5 stacks
---
Not true, depending on your level.    
---
Optimal rage use during leveling is (from Classic warrior's Discord):
---
Level  | Priority | Note                                     
---
---|---|----
---
4-19 |  Rend &gt; HS                     | 
---
20-21 | Rend &gt; SA until 70% HP &gt; HS   | Pool rage for next fight, only HS if about to cap
---
22-25  | Rend &gt; SA until 50% HP &gt; HS   |    
---
26-35  | Rend &gt; SA until 50% HP &gt; HmS  | HmS fishing beats HS around your first big weapon upgrade (Hydra, Corpsemaker)
---
36-39  | SA until 85% HP &gt; WW          | From now on, only Rend if fight &gt;15 sec
---
40-45  | MS &gt; WW                       | Only SA if your first auto missed and target is still 100% HP
---
46-57  | SA until 80% &gt; MS &gt; WW        | Never use Rend anymore past this point
---
58-60  | SA until 55% &gt; MS &gt; WW        |
---
Get poisons asap because it's a massive dps boost. Always use a slow MH and a very fast OH so you'll get more poison procs. 
---
You sometimes see people with a dagger in they're MH because they're leveling with Backstab.
---
As a healer I approve
---
Is there a list somewhere of items that sell a lot but most people don't realise? Would love that....
---
It didn‚Äôt age well at all
---
In classic they went back and added extra details/foliage to the environment to give it a bit more character. Desolate is just.. well, desolate. It looks like a work-in-progress zone where they just went through the first step of mapping the terrain.
---
I'm on my 4th alt, I cant make it past the upper 30's before I'm like wait... wouldnt i like this other class more in the end game?? Thus the new alt is rolled.
---
Yeah. Locks take alot of damage,  but its slow, controlled, and predictable damage.
---
/castsequence [nocombat] find herbs, find minerals
---
I think that should do it.
---
I think they get confused they see 1.40 speed they think it‚Äôs slow but it‚Äôs the opposite LMAO
---
Thanks for sharing it!
---
I am currently in a similar situation with a different starting condition. I haven't joined any guilds on my way to 60 but I was thinking about what I want to do with my current character ( raiding or dungeon running / gearing ).
---
Come yesterday, I was messaged by a buddy of mine which I met through some ST and BRD runs we did in the last 3 weeks. Has issues in his current guild and wants to start a new one which focuses on dungeon running with casual raiding and possibly some PVP once it's out.  So currently I'm actually really enjoying gearing up / dungeon running a lot and I do want to raid at some point but it might take a while before we have the numbers to do so. The biggest influence for me though is being able to have people around that I trust and have had previous experience with. So I'm really in the same boat as you said, I'd rather wait a bit ( there is no rush really at all to get MC / Onyxia beaten ) and have people around that I have fun playing with.
---
It's up to you of course but the main thinking point is what people you wish to run with:
---
Someone you don't know and have to get to know, possible taking time before you're really accepted into their ranks but they can raid immediately *or* a guild that'll time to grow but you know some people already and can build something from the ground up with people of similar mindset ( which I assume you have because otherwise you wouldn't have joined them in the first place ) and make something good out of it.
---
Pathetic! Get on my lvl. I'm so smart that me and my friends have started a new IQ scale. I have 7 IQ, which means  700 for you unintelligent beings. You need to be a 5 or higher to join our book club where we CREATE A NEW ERA OF BOOKS OF EVERY GENRE OUR SELVES.

Hi,
---
Do you have an article or somethink that I could read about the myth?
---
I'll prob never go 0/20/31, but I might go like 13/31/7 or smth.
---
For now, going with 2/31/18.
---
Get some keybinds m8
---
Also got BT easily through dumb luck and just got Old Cliff Jumper after checking him morning and night for the last week or so.
---
This is the correct approach. Any DPS that is focusing on damage numbers rather than helping their team is actually holding the team back. I'd bunch rather have a DPS do 30% less damage and be reliable than someone doing huge damage at the risk of killing the team.
---
I don‚Äôt know, that outfit‚Äôs kinda badass to me...
---
I dont mind healing the lock with efficient heals to get the group going faster and help with mana in aoe situations, but if he refuses to drink/eat after a pull and just lifetaps he can eat shit haha. Big difference!
---
I unsubbed. Normally I don't care about the abhorrent things corporations do but corporate censorship can have possible ramifications in the US and I can't abide by that.

L0l this Looks really messed up xD
---
It's obviously no fence - it is early Versions of a target dummy. Made for 40 People to fight it
---
My mage is main but I can't decide between leveling my druid or priest alt. I really enjoy healing a lot more than tanking, but my mage is already a cloth so I wasn't sure if I should switch it up. Druids have amazing perks like travel form and stealth but priests have the best heals, rez, and mind control ! Who would you pick for your alt, or even your main? There are just so many Mages now it's ridiculous, but whenever I play with a bad mage it makes me want to continue as mage to be the good mage that everyone wants.
---
it's so damn far of the mark I can't even comprehend how you would come to that thought
---
1) Most 59s will have a decent chunk of either Quest and/or Dungeon blues and not just be in greens.
---
2) Not ALL Attacks receive new ranks on maximum level
---
3) It's true that his overall performance will be less, I'm not denying that. 50%, however, is most certainly NOT the number
---
4) DONT INVITE HIM IF YOU DONT THINK HE PERFORMS WELL. IF YOU INVITE HIM YOU HAVE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT. PERIOD. If you invite someone to help you (no matter how much he is able to) then you have to allow him to get rewards. Everything else is just an utter douchebag move no matter how much you try to argue against it.
---
Seriously, thank you!
---
Yes it is slow MH and fast OH because you want the higher base damage (slower weapon) used for your sinister strikes etc.
---

---
I was able to tank St as arms with my 2h equipped with no problem. The heal was level 49 priest. The group was decent though. Maybe this shows that it's doable without speccing into prot. 31/5/15 is a great spec for dungeon dps / dungeon tanking / and light pvp, but it's not optimal for raiding since Ms uses a precious debuff slot
---
that's what i did
---
More like Rouge = Dead
---
How can you be "pro" in classic wow and not be a streamer?
---
Till u meet a soulstoned priest who mc's you i to lava
---
That‚Äôs exactly the experience im having. It sound like i should follow your suggestion of spamming dungeons for a couple of levels until im at a decent level f√∂r STV and Arathi

You send your pet on a mob, dot it up with serpent sting, autoshot, it dies, pet regens super fast, you don't use your life pool at all.
---
However! frost mages are very nice at killing stuff fast (faster than hunters imo). You will have to drink every 2 mobs until you get a bigger mana pool.
---
No i mean, price is kinda low atm, i was lucky enough to sell first salt for 50g and second for 40 at the start, i hope price will increase with dire maul, u need 3 refined hides for Hide of the wild epic cloak (dm recipe drop)
---
As a DPS with a brain, I approve.
---
I don't see any leather or mail
---
Btw as soon as you hit 20 make sure you carry atleast 2 stacks of poison with you while you grind mobs/dungeons/quests its a massive dps boost, i usually have instant poison over the others (poison damage overtime) i dont think they are really worth it for solo grinds
---
first time for everything /s
---
But wouldn't I suffer a great loss in heal-ability this way? leaving me "under-qualified" for raid content?
---
He had several friends nearby following after him
---
Found the Alliance player.
---

Not on Alliance either - the BRD jail break part is independent of the princess chain.
---
Your guilds seem to cater to different people, don't take his advice on it. Yeah you will probably have some turnover due to people being casual either because they don't have enough time to come raiding, or if they want to start raiding more they might leave, but the success of the guilde will be closely tied to how you manage it and how you occupy your members. Try and focus on acquiring people who have the same vision/project as you instead of just filling in ranks, because people might come for a glimpse and leave, and if you rely on these people who will leave, you might struggle to reliably go raid which in turn will frustrate people that they can't at least have their 1 raid night per week when you guys get to it. The most important thing is to bond with your members, so they are attached to the guild and want to invest themselves and succeed together, instead of seeing the guild as a reliable PUG
---
Yes. That's exactly what you do.
---
Cancel your sub and move on.

I am guessing that my old AMD graphics card is on its way out because I don't see any sun glares like this in-game, resulting in the sun just looking like a light point with sun shine looking slightly green on characters/buildings when facing away from the sun in Stormwind.
---
There's always several sides to the stories. I was helping the week prior to that on Ragnaros, too. At that time I was 55. We managed to kill him and I wasn't allowed to roll on the T2 Legs.
---
Honestly, that was totally fine. I ONLY helped on Raggy (not the MC clear) and I've been 5 levels away. It took me a full 7 days to get from 55 to 59 for the next ID. Whoever won the legs at that point was able to put it to good use.
---
But when I'm 59 I'm basically - at maximum - two days away from max (turned out to be less than 5hrs). Giving me such a bullshit reason "level not enough, cant even wear it" after I've helped the second ID in a row. That just hurt and I honestly felt unjustly handled. 
---
Long story short, we've had discussions about it and we've came to the agreement that it wasn't handled properly and that this restriction shouldn't have been in place. While it doesn't help me personally we're having a 2nd raid-group and there's a bunch of close-to-60s partaking, too, and they'll certainly reap the rewards of said discussion.

---
I just hit 52 and specced to holy. For me that‚Äôs the cut off (st/brd) when healing with shadow becomes hard enough that you have to be picky about your groups (no low level or offspec tanks). Going holy means I can confidently jump into any group set up with no issues and gives you plenty of time to get comfortable with something close to the spec and bars, bindings etc you will be using at 60. 
---
It makes soloing horrible though, I‚Äôve gone from being able to easily take on 2-3 mobs a couple of levels higher than me, to single mobs 1-2 levels higher and needing to drink after every fight. It really depends how you plan to spend your time the rest of the way to 60. Solo, stick with shadow, dungeon grinding, go holy now.

I was like this too, long ago in vanilla. Never got a character over level 40. Then something changed, I made a character who I really enjoyed. She wasn't perfect, but she felt "mine" somehow, in a way no other character was. I sometimes wanted to change characters, but despite many mistakes we made, I stuck with her. She became my first level 60, and is still my main now in retail.

Reroll on a p. server with your buddies. Win-win, you get your classic wow and won't support today's blizzard.
---
This isn‚Äôt about bad pulls, this is about dps consistently making bad pulls. Are you even reading what I‚Äôm writing? This isn‚Äôt about mistakes or fuck ups, this is about dps who pull ahead of the tank which leads to constant bad pulls and extremely bad down time.
---
Healing people playing badly is being a shit team mate. Dps who makes runs terrible need to learn, normally after I let them die once or twice, they get the message, listen to the tank and the run is a lot smoother and faster.
---
Healing people like that just promotes that sort of behaviour. So you‚Äôre a bad team mate.
---
You should watch "Why Blackrock Depths is the Greatest MMORPG Dungeon of all time" in youtube.

Its hard to disagree after that video.

It's good to see a couple of people coming up with the exact same reasons I've brought up in our internal discussion. I feel approved. Thanks :)

Let's say there's 10 mages and 5 warlock regularly raiding from the beginning of times. Everyone knows each other and had their time together while levelling. And then the LC  "decided" on 5 ppl who gets the caster weapon fro Golemagg in order. That means that 10 people won't even have a chance of getting a weapon for several months if not more. What would you do?

Bahahahah what are you saying fool? You cant understand theyre asking for america to support HK not the other way around. Where did you get your education and are you mentally challenged by chance? Youre saying outright ridiculous stuff that is widely known to be false. You try to make it somehow about USA in your every pathetic comment. This was never about USA so stick to the point, fool. You havent made 1 real argument and my argument has been from the start that youre not educated enough on the matter to discuss it with anyone. Youre intentionally attempting to make it about USA while spouting chinese propaganda yourself. Ever wonder... maybe youre not as smart as you think you are?

It's not elvUI, I'll check the font name in a little.

Yeah you need to buy the Shadowy Potion to be friendly with the Jaedenar demons. But as it is just 6G I didn't take it into account.
---
"Everything else" Overwatch in recent history is everything but crap. Maybe you don't enjoy it, but it's original enough and well designed enough. Hearthstone, even if it's being a bit old now (2012 :O)  also designed a whole new meta for TCG game. Simple, yet deep, many had to copy the gameplay (Shadowverse, Scrolls..).
---
So I'd say, 1/2 of their recent history is crap.
---
Report this to the police, it is a death threat, blizzard can provide the details of the player and they will be charged. If people think under any circumstances this is acceptable then they need to learn it is not.
---
Wasn't there also a trick where a mage sheeps another player at a duel in the throne room in front of the locked door?
---
[Try this one!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bu0-SwfmtgM)
---
It's pretty easy to do, and doesn't involve switching weapons, just changing your seals.
---
As every one else has said 1 hot is nice but no need to heal warlock unless they've got aggro.
---
That's the thing, you can never know with rogues. It doesn't help that it's a class that tends to attract trolls and assholes so yeah when i quest and see a nearby rogue vanishing, i pop shield and prepare for war.
---
"There is always going to be war in the middle east. No American is responsible for it, or european. It's the responsibility of the various governments there and their fanatical religious populations."

Spoken like a true American, IE someone who has 0 understanding of history.

Nope they didnt. As a dane playing on firemaw i can confirm at level 60 that i am still to do a random pug dungeon without a fellow dane or a norwegian. Usually 3+ in groups are norwegian or danish
---
Repair your shit.
---
Perfection.
---
Why engineering doesn't have bow schematics as well is beyond me. A well made bow is as much a feat of balanced engineering as any gun.
---
Plus imagine if you could make your own arrows and have the ability to loot a percentage of them back from dead mobs.
---
That‚Äôs completely understandable but if the dps won‚Äôt wait a split second and pull ahead of the tank, the tank now has no rage and it‚Äôs an uphill battle.
---
If the tank pulls, does his thing and a dps gets aggro that‚Äôs absolutely fine.
---
But pulling instead of the tank, is just shit behaviour.
---
Good ol candy nose mcquaid.
---
Still gonna play Pantheon.   Vanguard was a near miss.
---
Kronos WoW used to be really good when I played on it, basically Light's Hope in terms of scripting minus all the chinese players.
---
I've had a Strat UD run as a Druid Tank where I was decursing between fights and some warrior kept pulling while I was out of mana (my innervate went on the healer). I used a total of 4 Major Mana Potions as a tank over the course of the run just because of someone's impatience.
---
Plaese read the note at the bottom of the image :)
---
Blizzard will take serious actions to these types of treats. 
---
I had a similar experience playing diablo3. A player made a death treat in the clan chat for a player receiving an item which he wanted too. So me and two others reported him for that. In less than 2 hours he received a 7 day ban.
---
Aw, I wish I‚Äôd gone for ret paladin... there‚Äôs something cozy about that spec. The sounds, the visuals, the spell icons, the armor...
---
Doubt it. When DM comes out I will probably stop respeccing between raids. As a disc priest you can easly do the DM:E lasher farm solo. That should net you a decent amount of gold from vendor trash + a lot of herbs you can either sell or keep for your own consumables.   
---
Not having to respec 2 times a week really does help, cause that respec cost quickly builds up to where you have to farm a lot more each time to justify it.
---
Report him IG, they will definitely take action. This kind of piece of trash doesn't belong here (or anywhere actually...). 
---
One tiny thing though, I'd be careful with giving out his name, last time I called out someone (on a blizzard forum, not reddit) for shouting neonazi stuff in the chat (with screenshot proof, and his name) I got banned a week for harassment...
---
What if i use the SHIFT autoloot option?
---
Like, i have option to only autoloot when i hold Shift because sometimes i dont want pick up every bits and pieces.
---
Man. That‚Äôs a selfish thing to say. You never have to help someone. But they must like you if they are messaging you for help. Sorry for annoying you with my friendship...

you're an idiot

considering that the record is 1-60 in less than 5 days, it should surely be possible to do 10 levels in 3 days.  But it will be hard work and you need to stay focused on questing / dungeoning.

I don't think he's that much of a minority, my Classic server is slowly draining if I'm being honest. I'd say 50% of my guildies don't log in anymore - the servers feel a lot more empty too, even without layers.

I am happy for the people that did turn out to want it - but "you think you want it, but you don't" turned out to be true for a lot of people.
---
while there is a lot of greed in dungeons in particular, showing up for raid after raid after raid with tens of golds in consumables every time and not getting any actual raid loot to show for it absolutely sucks. I don't even know if my guild is gonna last so gearing up guild members has only a possible benefit for me

Having the combat log open requires an immense amount of attention to be effective.  You have to be constantly starting at it, ignoring chat, ignoring everything else.

2 locks is rough. Focus on your timing so regen kicks in. Always toss a DoT after a heal if it can be used somewhere. Let natural healing take care of as much damage as possible. If you are chain healing the tank then something is wrong.

It has really good stam and intellect so it's awesome gear for AoEing. When I did my mage I rushed 22, did sfk till I got the arugal pieces, and AoEd till I could farm dungeons for prebis. The robes and belt were awesome cause the only way to get AoE gear is usually to buy - Of the Eagle gear, and on my server people sold them for high prices while offering less stats than the SFK armor till the early to mid 30s
---
1. Highest damage weapon in mh (it would be slowest if weapon has close levels)
---
2. The above is true for combat builds. For builds with backstab/ambush you have to use dagger in mh. Yet max damage dagger would be great here as well.
---
I fully expected to do exactly that since I played EVERYTHING on retail, but fell completely in love with the rogue class fantasy - picking locks, crafting poisons, stealthing elite and dungeon quests. Got to 60 and have absolutely no desire to start an alt. Another unexpected reason why classic just feels better. There is no class fantasy in live anymore.
---
That‚Äôs why loot council is bullshit. They are always gonna reward themselves and their friend. Anyone saying there is no bias is delusional.
---
It is 40 people effort, someone is always going to be pissed if there is no fair and transparent numeric system, like dkp or epgp.
---
Yes, you might be first on dps charts, but other 30 people are not going to like it when you get best items.
---
one part of this  (I played a lock a lot)  is that as a warlock you get often a whisper from a healer 'go life tap' when you are NOT lifetapping.   SO this can lead to warlocks being used to do that everytime , without checking if the healer is ok with it. there is a big difference in healers , one with full heal spec will have plenty mana , but a dps or tank specced healer who is just healing off spec  doesn't have that luxury.

Are you a skinner? If not, you didn't lose the pristine hide. It should be rolled for by skinners with the ability to skin the beast

In classic do you need to learn the epic riding skill for each individual faction to ride their epic mount? Or can you learn epic riding from your own faction and then still be able to ride all of the  faction's epic mounts?

I've spent a lot of time following the protests in Hong Kong.
---
I live in a city that sees a lot of HK based immigration and I grew up with a woman from Hong Kong. We are still friends. 
---
So yes, Blizzard's actions go against my values. I cancelled my sub. 
---
I didn't cancel my sub to sit on some high horse and tell a lot of people how shiny my halo is this week. 
---
I cancelled because freedom and free speech mean more to me than empty buzzwords to be thrown around. I believe the people of Hong Kong deserve better from their government. 
---
And, I understand that while Blizz had to do something with regard to Blitzchung, what they actually did was violently polarize this issue and martyr the player. 
---
All they needed was a shady statement about how Hearthstone is not a political platform and the views expressed by the player are not the views of the company, etc jargon yadda yadda...
---
Middle of the road, non committal enough for the centerist or self interested gamers, but dismissive enough for the Chinese.
---
Instead, this ignited something in democracy loving circles since the actions taken are anathema to even partially informed North American society. Free speech, the right to protest, freedom, all values held in the highest regard. And when thought of in those terms it's pretty easy to see why people feel guilty for playing or not cancelling their subs. 
---
It's not about punishing the devs or whomever. It's about showing a massive corporation that kowtowing to one superpower may mean alienating another. These, "think of the little people!" claims are always ridiculous. There will always be reasons not to protest, but we have to decide whether the larger issue is worth tackling, and I personally believe it is. 
---
If anyone thinks China's reach stops there, it doesn't and it won't. Hong Kong is a tipping point and they're coming for everyone else. This isn't fear mongering, do some research. Look critically at where China is investing in North America.

What's the energy timer/tick addon?
---
I levelled as Ret to 35 now. So far its fine. Since I'm just mainly doing quests it's ok. And with the auto attack and I can just chill and watch Netflix whilst I play. But at 60 I wil definitely going to respect. Especially since it's cheap for us as we get s free mount. 
---
Right now I'm mostly playing solo so it makes sense
---
As a rogue in early 50s, should I focus on saving for an epic mount or instead spend my cash money on the Devilsaur set first (they can be equipped pre-60 if I get the money).
---
Fein death frost trap, reset. Load aimed shot, cast cheetah and stay at 41 yards until your victim is dead or start fleeing opposite direction.
---
Can be done every 30 seconds. 
---
You are beating bad hunters. We are the king of world pvp no question.
---
it'll be totally easy to do it in 3 days if you are playing 12-15hrs a day, as you suggested.  Try to get into instance runs. at 35, just spam SM, and run it constantly, even if you dont need gear. The XP is good. Also, questing in STV is good as the zerg of lots of players will be way beyond there now. So should have cleared out. Go do all the nessingwary quests, and such. tonnes of xp to be gained in STV.  Also the shimmering flats have good quests at lvl 35. 
---
Once you get to level 40, if you havent already done so, you have  Dustwallow Marsh, the badlands,  Swamp of Sorrows, all good for questing with lots of mobs to easily grind on too, so your XP per hour should be very high.  
---
Once you get to level 43-44 - then hit ZF in tanaris, great XP cos of the amount of mobs to kill. 
---
If you are playing for 40-45 hrs in this 3 day period, there is no reason you cant get beyond level 45.
---
Probably also looked at games like Everquest which has done it the past years with success, and thought they might as well too and reap in the money.
---
Just take it all yourself and leave ez
---
Does anyone know if speed increasing enchants/items such as the Carrot on a Stick or Mithril Spurs work with elite mounts too?
---
I'm about to buy the 900g mount and wondering if they still work on them or if I can stop using the Carrot in case it doesn't give any benefit with 100% mounts.
---
&gt;I mean we know companies don't want you to have rights they lobby for it all the time just trying to justify it because it makes them profit is a meme
---
neither do governments
---
Thas it mane. Chase that little imp around
---
Agreed! This is one of my biggest struggles as a healer. Sometimes we overpull or find us self i some situation where a pet is holding aggro on a mob for us, and when i start healing the tank and the renew runs out the pet will just die without me noticing it.
---
Would make sense. DM east, kill pussylin, get they key, enjoy the rest.
---
Well, it's not that case of "Say nothing and nothing happens". Xi jinping and winnie the pooh meme is a good example for that, but Blizzardgate is not in that category YET. Might be if we know more in the future.
---
Anything that tracks users or displays names with their class/level, like Puggle, ClassicRace etc

You can also discuss it freely on r/HongKong I think.

Lot's of Blizzard talk there recently.

you are very rude so I will cease this conversation, and block you goodbye

Someone looked for a UBRS Rend tank yesterday. They started pulling without me (fine for me), and when I arrived for the first boss it turned out to be a guild group who just lacked a tank. Then the DPS kept pulling stuff, and I struggled to gain threat on multiple mobs (really, I NEED that first hit to go on me for some rage ...). Said nothing, kept going, because you just know how toxic guild groups can be to an outsider. Somehow made it to Rend, mostly because their healers were able to compensate for their dumbfucks of DPS. 
---
Main Hand dropped, I rolled and won. Silence in chat, you just knew their three Rogues exploded in their coms. I happily ported away, Karma was served. I was only there for the bracers and would have happily passed on the weapon if they had made this a slightly less pain-in-the-ass run for me.
---
Seal of Judgement? Do you mean Seal of Righteousness?
---
Exactly.
---
Before AS normalization, the AS was a factor in how much damage your abilities would do, leading to some weird scenarios where a 2.00 AS blue dagger was a lot better than many of the epic weapons available.
---
They actually are around 20% because SoC proc can miss, dodge and parry :P.  Some days though, it feels like you get 80% procs and destroy everything. Biggest eye opener is how bad Sanctity aura is while leveling at least. From my tests I have to go all out using max rank Soc and Consecrate to even get close to the same damage retribution aura does. I mean. When you think about it. You need to do 1k holy damage to get a shitty extra 100 holy damage.
---
If its slowing down the party (like in this case), then it IS a issue. Its not that you cannot heal the warlocks, its that if you do, you spend 2x much time drinking (when the warlocks could just tap little less and eat+drink the same time as you do).
---
Just let them die.
---
If they pull, they tank.
---
Not your fault, wait the healer tell them that they shouldn't tank.

I still remember the feeling. My fist toon was human and after spending a lot of time in the zones around Stormwind I finally discovered what the deeprun tram was. After quite some time exploring Ironforge itself I ran out the gates and down the path into the snowy wonderland beyond. About half way down I stopped an looked back the way I'd come, and wow! (no pun intended). I had to stop and soak in that view for a while before I could continue.

Yeah and Arcane Might is the best spec for Mages right now, that doesn't mean deep frost can't be surprisingly legit. What's your point?

Is anyone else's game fucked today? I've gotten kicked off like 6 flight paths. It just drops me from the flight. Sometimes I can't even get on the flight in the firstplace. I tried taking a boat to Kalimdor, and once the map screen showed up I spawned in the Wetlands graveyard. My Hearthstone won't work, it just loads for a while then puts me back to where I was when I tried to use it. This can't be just me right? It's only been happening today
---
Im doing this now, makes me wonder if wetlands used to be down here somewhere instead. the zone is quite similar to swamp of sorrows compared to whats surrounding it now.

Level 19 druid here, checking in. My question is around the "Druids are a meme" thing... i just don't get it personally? Thus far I love the class as I enjoy being able to fill any role. I can deal with not topping DPS meters,  not being a main tank in raids and working around rez. Am i just too low level to experience the negatives? is feral dps just completely pointless at 60 or something? I'm just not understanding the hate
---
Answer me _only_ when youve come up with somehting real. Untill then, I shall chuckle at your irrelevant/false comments.
---
Great, now you can start a patreon.
---
You got any diverse characteristics to play up?
---
This is only accurate for 2h, which is the best way to level, but OP is specifically dual wielding, that's what causes this bug.
---
Heroic strike is absolutely worth using dual wielding because it negates the additional miss chance from dual wielding, and you still have your offhand to generate rage. What you're saying is fine-ish for 2h arms (demo shout is of questionable value, and sunder you should stop sundering at different life values as you level because fights have to be long enough for it to work out), but not for DW
---
Yup. Although wool has always been good to make gold. It drops during a level bracket that people tend to get through quite fast. So it's actually a good way to make gold, going back and farming low level materials.
---
Have you ever grouped with rogues? They will NOTORIOUSLY AND ALWAYS hit their own target, as they like to build combo points and execute them...
---
If you have a problem with the way loot council gives out loot you should talk to your officers/raid lead in private. If they are unwilling/unable to give you transparency on loot decisions you should jump ship immediately.
---
The thing is officers and raid leads generally have loot priority. For someone new to classic raiding this can seem shitty, but the reality is the people leading your raid put in the most time and effort into the guild and therefore deserve loot more than someone who just shows up and presses buttons. The amount of spread sheets and organization that goes into getting 40-60 players to raid together is almost like a part time job, especially if you're in a serious raiding guild.
---
When Mageblade dropped for our guild it went to our mage raid lead. As far as I know no one was upset, we were all happy that it dropped and it went to the person who puts in the most effort. The way I look at it is now there's one less person to roll against me for the next Mageblade, and if you stay dedicated you will eventually get the loot you want.
---
He probably watched too many esfand streams , illuding himself he would be able to get the right gear to be mediocre .
---
Out biggest weakness is our deadzone. Get in close and stay there, but not too close so that we can wing clip.
---
Ay dude send me ur gold before it runs out, I'm fine with being morally gray as fuck as long as I get to play Classic.
---
Yes. Because there is clear wrong in the world. There are direct correlations that we can draw between now and historical atrocities. Because we have historical lines of cause and effect to review we can actively say, "This is the turning point of the very bad thing." And those turning points are occurring now.

I see a hell of a alot more druids on my server than most people anticipated. I was a lvl 46 lock but rerolled the the master race, druid. 
---
 Classic druids will break the "they can only heal" stigma. 
---
 I've literally heard from so many people on different servers already that they are HotW/resto hybrid tanking or dpsing raids. 
---
 Kitty power!
---
I still do it now when waiting. I like to play the roof is lava and jump beam to beam.
---
Flapping orc capes though
---
Don't think those really exist in Classic. Haven't paid as much attention to other classes but at least for druids hots became mana efficient in TBC. Before that it's Healing Touch and hots only on tanks.
---
25 at shimmering flats? thats a nightmare..... I suppose you could limit yourself to the northern mobs.
---
What twisted logic. If you go to the server select screen, do you see any character versus character (CvC) servers? Or do you see player versus player servers (PvP). Blizzard confirms as much by always referring to PvP, not CvC.
---
Same question, but for Paladins.
---
Well.. if you do decide to quit.. can I have your gold? Cause I give no fucks about bending my morals as long as I still get to play Classic.
---
At least no horns are sticking out
---
Wreck em!
---
Told the locks I only heal their lifetap if I see the bandage debuff. 
---
Poor tailor lock died a lot.
---
I would try to dot the hell out of the hunter, and burst the pet down w/ mind blasts and flays. Keep your shield up + renew of course. Physic scream if you need to pop a big heal/ get some aggro off you and burst the pet down.
---
I had been thinking about a Tauren warrior walking through Goldshire in this armor and trying to act like a guardsman.
---
yeah, it's pretty normal. Wool was usually the most expensive cloth cause it drops for a relatively narrow level range, and no one really wants to waste time farming it.
---
on my server though all cloths still go for barely above vendor price.
---
Feral dps is a lot more work to achieve similar results in single target than other classes. If you are happy not topping meters then go for it. I frequently play my Druid in every role. The versatility is a lot of fun.  Most guilds will probably  be happy for you to play whatever you enjoy.
---
Do your best to get close to the hunter. Ignore the pet and just blow him to pieces. If you get close to him, he‚Äôs in a lot of trouble. 
---
Blackout stun will help you get close to him
---
Makes sense if you think about it lmao
---
I've seen this referenced a few times. The thing is, that 5% doesn't matter against the Total Addressable Market that China holds, widespread Chinese adoption has insane potential revenue while the Western market is largely saturated.

Is this some kind of troll attempt? Your group finished the task, you never mentioned anything about having a problem and then all of the sudden you ninja a pretty fucking rare item you can‚Äôt use?

The only problem I see in this story is you.

Alright, that confirms that it does not have 100% drop chance. But still does not confirm if it can drop without a hunter on the quest though.
---
play with their deadzone, or be first one to initiate the fight.

Its a pretty hard class to master if you want to be competive. From min max perspective its never going to be the best. Who cares though? Fun to lvl and good nevertheless.
---
Dont forget they cleared MC including raggy with 25 man. Not even everyone was lvl 60. There will be a spot for you as long as you are reliable.
---
I have no problems tanking with my PVP healing setup https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/05503112521051-05321103032 these talents are also good for healing and off-off-offtanking in raids depending on gear.
---
You forgot Lava runs, which usually go through the locked door to the room with the shadowforge lock mechanism, run through all the mobs down the hallway and jump through the window, wait for aggro to drop, jump down to the pathway to Lord Incendious. Kill Incendious and jump down into the lava, hugging the wall on the left while spamming jump. You end up at the MC attunement area and only have to go through the Lyceum to Magmus and the Emperor.
---
People obviously care and enjoyed his videos. Take your negativity elsewhere dude

In wpvp scenario where the hunter is the opener, a shadow priest doesn't really have any gap closers save for a lucky blackout proc.

As I'm strongly considering rolling a Druid as a 19th level twink (I like druids but I wanted a class with strong farming as my first 60 due to limited play), how good were DRUIDS really in 19th level WSG?
---
Nug
---
energy
---
This is exactly how I feel as well. I have canceled my sub because I want them to graph my stance on this, I could technically log on and play since it won't need to be renewed untill somewhere in november but I won't. I won't renew my sub either unless they give me a reason to.
---
Jed spawn rate has been annoyingly low for me so far, but luckily I finally got that reed on my healer. I basically got my guildies to come farm Jed and Rend specifically, and there's a place at the entrance where you can target Jed if he's spawned. Rend's event is super long and boring but it drops stuff for other classes giving them another reason to come, plus without Rend the instances are being reset too quickly, so including the Jed checks you might get locked out if you're not careful.
---
This is nice, but I am **so incredibly triggered** by your unit frames not aligning at the top D:
---
Absolute favourite zone in the game. Even though I'm a horde player now, I will never not miss this zone its actually so fucking perfect.
---
I think a problem is a lot of people have been misguided. Before release of the game lots of threads were promoting optimal build while claiming anything else was a memespec and useless. So anyone who didn't know otherwise, probably felt pressured to play a spec that is known to perform well, regardless of if it suits the players playstyle ect. I blame a lot of the confused newer players on the bad advice of tryhards who prioritise damage numbers over fun.

Do you wanna tank or do you wanna dps? If youre dpsing, get the lvl 40 helmet, go 5 into furor, go get your omen of clarity and then rest into feral. If you wanna tank, you go all in on the feral tree. Most important thing here to get is the one where you get rage ehwn you crit.
---
Im not sure reckoning works anymore, I read they removed your ability to control when you are crit by sitting.
---
Laughs in "walks around the normal way"
---
I think druids shine in solo PvE and PvP  where they can better use their entire toolset instead of being pigeonholed into a defined role. Organized PvE tends to set a higher bar (ultimately depends on the guild/community); druid dps falls behind other classes that can do what a cat druid does but more easily and without as many strings attached. So most druids are stuck in supportive roles like healing and tanking - especially as healers they offer strong utility that no sensible person would turn down. Nothing wrong with that though!
---
After this combo you are basically out of mana, keeping renew is not that simple when you need to get out of shadowform, and back into again to deal dmg. If you fight hunter in open zone as spriest, you have really low chances, i would start with reducing his range attacka, then dot him, and his pet, keeping pws on yourself, and trying to fear hunter, if there's no chances to fear him, use it on his pet.
---
Use healing stream totem, then.
---
I agree.  The problem isn't blizzard, it's policy, and not reigning in China's behavior.  Respect of property rights is a two way street, and they aren't holding up their end.

So your saying Paladins need more than 20 points to heal due to Illumination not being good enough?
---
Deathbringer is worse for a human losing your weapon skill is a dps loss if you are interested in being efficient you can use the spread sheet from the warrior discord to see how much damage item choices will give / take away. You'll need to get excel to use the spread sheet but it's fairly straight forward. There's also a mechanic you can do by queueing up heroic strike and canceling it right before your main hand hits because while heroic strike / cleave are queue'd your off hand can't miss. The reason I mention this is because with deathbringers 2.9 speed it'd be much more difficult to utilize this bug ( which wont be fixed btw because that's how it was in vanilla according to blizz ).  
---

Heres a link to the discord its super organized and helpful and will answer alot of your questions.
---
 Okay call it 2% would still be a significantly  actionable amount. Blizzard stance will not change unless their net numbers drop below the potential loss of Chinese income. Tough position - lose investors and long yield or eat short term domestic loss?
---
If that's true, I definitely think this is messed up. 
---
Imagine having blizzard spying on you depending on what you write and being able to contact any police station to check on you. How did this happen exactly? Absolutely hard to believe, really.
---
I'm pretty sure in my country, Police wouldn't give a flying fuck regarding what is being said in a videogame
---
They have tools to regen life: drain and death coil. Basicaly if you give a hand to a lock he will take your arm and shoulder. Heal them if you can afford it and if it wont slow the group
---
I'd say just stick with it. It's the home stretch and you're nearly there. With that being said, BRD is great because for most classes it has some pre-raid bis that you might want either way, so running at pre-60 will at least get you some xp while you do it. On the other hand, I found it to be very slow leveling (early part of the dungeon netted me around 30k exp/hour, later parts somehow down to 20k exp/hour, and this was with a decent group).
---
I would go back to questing for a few levels just because it's faster, unless you still have a bunch of really good items in there.
---
I do this fairly often or help out an ally from dying. Then time to time a higher level rolls on by and stares me down with said ally I helped still by. I like to think they sometimes message the higher level "I'm cool" and then they leave me be.
---
My point was more that this is the gamer equivalent of "thoughts and prayers". People who are already quitting or not playing at all are patting themselves on the back for their efforts, when its no real sacrifice on their part.
---
Don't gank mages while combat specced, you're asking for trouble
---
&gt;I see a hell of a alot more druids
---
I second that, I used to play rogue back in the day and decided to go druid for a change and because I thought its a neglected class. I see them everywhere now, even in my guild we have 10 active druids and only 5 active rogues, weird.
---
I have joined at least 20 dungeon pugs and I have never had a rogue in the party yet, there have been many times that I was tanking and had another druid healing or dps.
---
You might want to try retri or holy for a change and see how the other roles get you going. But I wouldn't recommend respecing to holy until you give healing a try and you get closer to lvl 60 as it is my understanding that you don't need to be holy to heal in dungeons until 60 and questing in holy is not the most effective.

don‚Äôt listen to the haters, if you like shockadin go for it its all about having fun. You won‚Äôt be able to really do much damage before you stack high spell power gear but it‚Äôs still fun and you can be an amazing healer as well
---
Renew is decent HP/mana, when it fully ticks. Just need to downrank it, no point using max rank on anything (well  priest in raid should have it on MT). Same should go for druids. Slower hot, downrank it. Its not supposed to heal them to full, just take them out of the sub 20% hp.
---
I'd go dagger from the get-go, as swords are in high demand. If you compare BiS to BiS, sword probably comes out slightly ahead, but that does not factor in how unlikely it is for you get ot get BiS swords over BiS daggers...
---
isn't flash of light like bread and butter for paladins because there's high chance it'll return mana?  
---
and healing light is only reserved for gigantique dmg spikes on tank
---
This, and how most class tiers are based on lvling speed &amp; endgame raids. Those are possibly the two LEAST important factors to a new player, who needs to consider lvling speed or what happens in the endgame if this if your first time playing
---
I'd say you're right, I've had people get very angry over me giving people advice on things like enha/feral, when someone who doesn't know better sees people getting angry at the mere mention of those specs, they're likely not gonna play even though Vanilla is very lax on min/max requirements if you're not desperate to get through the content week 1 or 2

The "I still enjoy this and I really haven't done enough research to understand the long ass fingers of China so I'm going to continue to bubble myself" approach is beyond laughable and entirely frustrating.
---
If you paid a child to mow your lawn and every single time that child was at your home they would take a break to go murder one of the cats belonging to your elderly neighbour with various utensils they purchase with the money you pay them AND your neighbour cried to you about their losses, would you say, "Sure, but I still need my lawn mowed and that's the kid that works for $10...sooo"
---
That's what all of these "BUH MUH GAAAAME" people sound like. That kid mows in nice clean lines, it's none of anyone's business what they do in their own free time with the money they get paid... The rest of the neighbourhood may be outraged, but hey at least they can distract themselves with that nice ass lawn.
---
Esc &gt; key bindings &gt; target markers
---
It‚Äôs beautiful...
---
But where is she?
---
What happens if I attack someone who is summoning his normal mount, won‚Äôt that put them in combat, unable to get their mount out?
---
ay dude send me ur gold, i'm not about to make my life less enjoyable to have zero impact on something happening on the other side of the planet that has zero impact on my life
---
This is based on extensive and extremely easy to collect data at the time, and it‚Äôs not any different now.  Load up a damage meter and see how many procs you get compared to your number of auto-attacks after hitting mobs a few thousand times, and there‚Äôs your answer (within 2-4 percentage points).
---
Poor. Your lack of Cat form and travel form are huge issues.  
---
Twinking at 29 might be viable since with talents your cat form will still provide a speed boost, but I think you'd have to go to 39 before Druid really gets it's full PVP kit (ferocious bite, their stealth openers, travel form all come to mind). At that point you've unlocked the ridiculous flag carrying potential that druids have and also can better hold your own against most classes.
---
I did that...Didnt even go to sillithus...
---
How so? Currently my realm transfer options are only to other PvP servers. I'm on Bigglesworth and was essentially abandoned by my friends on the realm..
---
Must be nice and cozy in all that apathy. I hope to hell your freedoms are never severely impacted or removed least you require help from literally anyone else.
---
As a 58 warrior I had trouble setting up groups for anything but LBRS, people would rather wait for a lvl 60 tank for 2 hours instead of moving out. That said, LBRS is pretty great. Decent xp, decent gold and it's challenging to tank so you get good practice.
---
haha yes :D
---
I believe this is intended. Finishing a spell cast resets the attack timer, mechanically Slam is identical.
---
You betcha. My alt is doably close to SW and I could fly it to booty bay. Do you want an alliance companion critter as well?
---
I think this is a terrible idea :( Imagine a raider saving up like 35 dkp because they really want a specific item, and then losing the roll to someone who bid 0. This system is just asking your raiders for drama.
---
Lol agreed. Guy comes off as an entitled asshole
---
Just got him, roughly 1hour 40 minutes after I started looking I got him.
---
At first I placed my hunter between all 3 spawn points and spammed Eye of the Hawk or whatever it's called, so I could scout all locations from one spot.
---
After doing this for about 10-15 minutes I got bored and decided to try and find an easier way.
---
Downloaded unitscan addon, plopped in broken tooth and AFK'd between two of the spawn locations until I heard a notification.
---
EZPZ Japaneezy
---
maybe she got sick of faking it if you know what I mean
---
Depends on if he's fury or not. I wouldn't call it being a ninja needing on Dal'Rends as a warrior, unless you're planning on raiding as prot.
---
That's how I've farmed all my pre raid bis gear, by tanking even though I'm fury.
---
I'm a middle-class straight white male in America, they won't be.
---
Yeah i wish they would be if back OpenGL support - was doing 60 fps medium graphics 
---
Now I‚Äôm at lowest graphics 45 FPS
---
Yeah, In vanilla I remember having to explain to people that my druid was in fact capable of tanking dungeons. In classic I am frequently /w'd to come tank.
---
My guild isnt even full BiS (some are quite appalingly gefared) and we average 23-28 people for raidnights having not that big issues downing content. Last night was onyxia with 25 people.
---
Correct.
---
Wtf, this is some next level psychopath chaotic evil shit
---
I've been dealing with something similar as priest, just let them die once or two, and they will learn to regen with you after pull, especially when there's mage with food
---
Xloot classic might work for you or if you guys change to a council type loot system then RC loot council should work too.
---
Really, then why does it trigger from horde flying over me on a flight path.
---
I don't get what "lesson" is learned?
---
That some people are big sholes?
---
There is much quoting in this thread so let me put it this way:
---
"Human beings have always been the same, some nice, some nasty, some clever, some stupid, there is always a Blackadder and there is always a Baldrick" &lt;Baldrick&gt; ("Blackadder: Back and Forth")
---
Reminding me of my cunning plan that I wanted to do a Blackadder show with WOW machinima in those days, but I never made it...
---
1 agi = 2ap. masons fraternity ring and the ring that drops off princess in mara are your pre bis i believe
---
So you are never going to play wow again?
---
Keanu Reeves found this post on Reddit. Keanu reads.

Perfect thank you
---
What items to stock up on now when dm releases? Any real items/mats that's gonna sky rocket in price?
---
That's what you think. First to go in the purge...
---
This is why I use Auctionator
---
thanks a lot sir
---
then they will call it censorship
---
cant win vs stupid

Rank 6 tank rank 2 feral here willing to answer any questions about feral or resto

Did you do strat live pre 60? If so how did you find it as feral? I'm running 0/30/19 atm and wanna know how hard it's gonna be. If you have time to answer that would be amazing, thank you.
---
I assume you're not using Google anymore either? They do a lot of censorship work for the Chinese government along with pulling protest apps. Same situation for Apple.
---
thanks a lot sir, do you recommend any quests for dm?
---
Which game is this ?
---
veryh much with their offensive spells, ha
---
People were playing it for free, obviously looking at the numbers and being greedy as fuck they changed their mind. The Chinese market has so much "potential" that they are more than willing to risk losing some players/payers in the rest of the world.
---
Possible but not probable.
---
Fuck blizzard and fuck china. Cancel your subscription #freehongkong
---
Very cool guide!
---
I just drop a rejuve on them for a little bit of help and that's it
---
There isn't "surprisingly legit" in a 15 year old game. The secrets are out and the numbers have been figured out long ago. No one is making crazy new discoveries on mechanics.
---
Yesterday, I saw a lvl 60 run around in Northshire with a bunch of new characters following him and auto-attacking mobs. What is that?
---
I'm horde
---
Literally why are you in this sub then
---
&gt; subjecting ethnic minorities to "re-education" camps
---
Not exactly the same, but doesn't ICE put ethnic minorities in camps?
---
That is very true, I thought of my own position as a druid tank. No ninjaing then, still dont really see a problem with his group.
---
Fair, still a downside to have your primary school locked right at the start of a fight for any duration. Not really sure why i'm being downvoted for stating that lol.
---
beautiful timing makes me wanna roll a druid
---
Primadonna tanks like this are the worst. Lets ruin  everyones run and waste time to teach this one guy a lesson. Imagine canceling a raid night because someone stole aggro.
---
They have specific weaknesses to certain rogue skills that makes them die in 1-2 hits.
---
sence
---
What's the femur thingy? I have the ardent custodian now tho, but not a good offhand.
---
No, that's not what's happening.  This is not a private company attempting to please a subset of consumers by avoiding politics.  This action was to appease Chinese censors, who would ban their game from all of China.  They already got flagged by censors and had to make numerous art changes.  Which is why the punishment and response was over the top.
---
What would be great is a private server that copies your EXACT character so you can continue the adventure without paying a sub to blizzard
---
We managed to group until level 30, after that it became unbearable and we leveles separately
---
So either I'm on the most unlucky streak ever, or Flamekin Ragers in Burning Steppes no longer drop elemental fire. I used to do these packs when doing my mining route there, but the past two days have had no elemental fires. Anyone else notice this?
---
Does anyone have a list of best pet skills to use for DPS/Levelling/Tanking?
---
E.G at level 60 it won't have enough points for max claw/bite + max armour + max stamina + max resistances so what should I use?
---
I'm horde. I have ardent now, what's the femur thing!?
---
White hit is slightly worse than crit (assuming you're not capping either) - they give the same amount of damage to your white hits, but crit also increases your yellow damage. Obviously you want plenty of both, but the question is about the yellow hit cap.
---
Because they wanted a character and not a game object. You sadly cannot talk to dead npcs
---
Dun Morogh is the best starting area in the game, beating even Mulgore. Absolutely love it.
---
When someone "loads" into your viewing distance, or logs in near you, the client applies their auras as if they just casted them. This is actually how the stealth sound works, it was an unintended side effect of the sound being used for casting stealth, but the devs liked that the client still played the sound when a stealthed unit loads near you.
---
Hmm nice. And at the end if you wanna go agitn you can log out for 5-10 secs and then u are teleported to the start of the dungeon.
---
Some healers even get offended when I tell them that they don't need to heal me when I see they are struggling with mana. It's usually the same healers that do more overhealing than actual healing.
---
Lol why do you need to tell us that you edited it...
---
So depending on your class its a different person in a different location also you can ask a guard where a profession trainer is and he will direct you
---
Lol, how the fuck is rolling on my BiS weapon ninjaing? I'm just a kind person and usually pass on it, if I like whoever else is in my group because I know the pain-in-the-arse farming this thing can be.
---
How do I solo the last part of the fordring questline (In Dreams)?
---
I got to the point at which Taelan dies but his father didn't show up to rezz him. I've waited for like 3-4 mins.
---
It depends on your class. The trainers are in different positions
---
Could just be killing mobs that the other people tag so the low levels still get full xp for the mob kills but the mobs die instantly.
---
Bigger revenue keeps the lights on.
---
I tested this and the "timer" doesn't start until your first reset. Each individual reset "timer" is gone after an hour. You are allowed up to 5 "reset timers."
---
nice, the angerforge bit was new to me
---
Dammit really? Thanks man. I'll let him know.
---
You can say whatever you want about the US government.
---
Really? Talk about DPS in the early moments of the game. Funny guy.  
---
If quest your lvl are doable/easy. can you kill mobs same lvl without much problem? Then your DPS is fine.
---
Worry about DPS when reaching 60 and start raiding. For now. Just enjoy.
---
Yeah I'm totally fine with there being less incentive to camp towns.
---
You expect wow streamers to stop streaming wow ?  
---
It's their job.. Would you quit yours ?
---
Is heartseeker available in phase 1, and can you use barman's shanker in raids or does it take a debuff slot?
---
It's OK, they ended it with a :D
---
Nice work!
---
you cast immolate, curse of agony, corruption, and then shadow bolt with imp nuking, probably the highest dps in the game once it's all rolling. It's just common sense to use your spells appropriately and past that you're as good as glad warlocks at lvl 20.
---
Keanu Reeves reads this chat, Keanu Leaves
---
It is a beautiful scene even today. But I love snow zones in games anyhow. It reminds me of home. Of silent winter nights were you hear nothing but your own feet crunching down the snow. Where you intentionally stop walking because them you can take the blissful silence all in.
---
Only deep space comes close (I know it is essentially just a sky box).
---
If anyone hopped into a druid tryna top meters other than the people who willinglydo it just to prove people wrong, they picked the wrong class.
---
In any melee group windfury is king by far.  It procs extra attacks with increased power.

He‚Äôs 47 and it‚Äôs ZF. They could have taken him unless everyone else was terrible or like 42
---
Then maybe you need to seek some therapy. 
---
I'm not trying to be an asshole, I think therapy can benefit anyone who is open to it. 
---
WoW addiction is real, dude. 
---
I played from Vanilla through Lich King and stopped when I realised that I didn't know what I did with my time before WoW. That's really bad for a human being. 
---
Genuinely, I hope you find something fulfilling outside of the game. Assuming you didn't murder puppies for fun pre-WoW, you deserve it.
---
I love that this wasn't a problem before the Hong Kong protest, now everyone is acting like China hasnt been like this since before our lifetimes.
---
One handed and super fast. The melee damage from it is not significant
---
I am working on a healing pvp set. What sort of gear do you run in yours? I‚Äôm looking st starting with some death bone and some lightforge until I get t1
---
Proving people wrong. I love it.
---
Kinda funny that you are the only one who have acted butthurt and definitly bringing in the same repetitive argument over and over again. 
---
The other guy really just had a friendly conversation about it.
---
Well shadowboly is 51 dmg at almost 3 seconsa per cast. Searing pain is about 35 smg and half the cast time so the math adds up to that being slightly more (until the next rank of shadowbolt)
---
I unsubbed. Fuck Blizz, can't wait for them getting booed @ blizzcon
---
Lmao fucking diva healer making the run slower for everyone because they can't do their job.
---
lmao, best thing since walker texas ranger .. I forgot his name
---
Oh, dear, another dogged contender.
---
It's all good, it was 2 years ago. I have moved on, I mean I still think about him from time to time, especially when going to where he worked at for over 20 years and seeing the things they have hung up in dedication to him.
---
It won't 'undo' what happened but I feel like they can, and should be allowed to, apologize and make things right.
---
People, and companies, make mistakes. Sometimes decisions are made very quickly without time to think and it ends up being a very bad call. I think they deserve a second chance here so long as they truly make things right.
---
Unfortunately their relative silence on the issue doesn't bode well for actually getting one.
---
I've died doing that. I'd have to paus and eat for a bit on that crevice. Lava jump seems faster.
---
I am not a student. I was there.
---
But economical factors certainly played a role, as well as pressure from the outside. Which is why it's so important to put this pressure on the companies bending to China's will.
---
China's government is extraordinarily reliant on outside companies doing business there, so forcing them to take a stand is the first and most important step.
---
It is NOT a human right to interject your opinions at a privately held event that you were invited to participate in.
---
Yea man it's a great little laptop.
---
If you're alliance, sure.
---
As horde you wont be switching from 2-handers for about a year.
---
Dark Souls 1 is actually the only souls game I didnt play so far
---
One of the categories that Blizzard do not slack on is "Real life threat". If you report this, they will act swiftly.
---
I can confirm it, our first Hunter to get Rhok had the sinew before we even killed domo
---
Not sure why but after seeing this clip I kind of wish my toon was a baldy bean
---
Same as me lol.   I won't give character name publically but as said I never expect a heal If all I'm doing is "warlocky" things.
---
Doubtful since adds
---
I've just started WoW and atm all I've seen is the Undead place, Undercity and Orig I wouldn't even know how to get to these places haha ok.
---
If you really wanna party like a sub-ambush rogue, get the widowmaker. That shit is sublime. Pop a +3 dmg on it and get stabbing
---
Yeah i usually dont care i just never used the addon before. I have maxxed a few toons since vanilla but im a self proclaimed altohokic lmao. The nu.ber of toons ive abandoned at 40 is too damn high!
---
If the customers ain't happy they won't exist.
---
Why are you questing as prot?
---
Get another level or two in brd and then go fucking grind lbs to 60 easily.
---
No....Just no..
---
I don't think there's room anywhere, to be honest.
---
A Big Daddy from Bioshock.
---
Got positions already as had some friends help me to the top of the tower after a DMines run, that might be why I‚Äôm experiencing some what of an easy time right now.
---
My 16 warrior is horridly slow to level.
---
As other users have said a good warlock will help you counter the pressure of life tap and will never complain about not being healed to full.
---
The pressure of having 2 warlocks however is enormous.
---
In your situation of yesterday I feel it was a lack of communication. A beartank can use his Mana to help the warlocks heal themselves while your regenerate your Mana after the fight. This will also help him keep aggro if he keeps hots rolling on the warlock.
---
Yeah, I def remember wool being high back in the day...most likely for the reason you said. I'm always flooded with silk and linen while leveling and wool I'd have to intentionally farm if I needed it.
---
Not sure about mages sorry, but a Lifestone or two is actually amazing for just grinding mobs as a warrior. Basically no downtime, and no need for food is such a luxury. They go for around 20g on my server, so worth picking up a couple just for that.
---
He didn‚Äôt want to assume the op‚Äôs sexual orientation
---
Have you heard of "running out of Light Feathers" and not thinking about it?
---
The minimum is depends on gear/skill. 6 people is enough with a good team of pre-raid bis players, but it can be tough. Id imagine 4 players or so is the absolute minimum just because of role requirements (1 kite 1 tank 1 heal 1 dps).
---
Most people will just do 10 man.
---
Not in vanilla. There is a talent that losers Slam casting time but it still doesn‚Äôt make it instant.
---
How are Pickpocket loot tables dertimed? Say at lvl 60 do mobs that can be pickpocket all around the zones drop the same stuff?
---
Bioshock anyone?
---
It's a circlejerk.
---
The point is that it doesn't do anything that isnt already a part of the UI. Get used to it, because it's never getting removed.
---
The cleaner comes for hunters too
---
My point.
---
Additionally, run TO the tank, don‚Äôt just run aimlessly away from everything. You risk pulling more and the tank now has zero chance of pulling off yoh
---
The drop rates are unrelated.. We have 4 sinew in our guild, but only had one leaf
---
Get the add-on threat plates, and then dual wield. Tab sunder/ heroic strike and revenge on CD taunt one target if it starts running away. Maintain demo shout. Thinking you need to stack sunder on every mob to 5 is just obsurd there's no way I want to be in a dungeon at a speed this slow.
---
Dont really see the issue. It wont affect anyone else than me.
---
Asmon tanked Rag and Ony with dual wield fury... still laughing?
---
I have a skull/FF macro I use to mark targets.  It doesn't help as much as it should.  I think a lot of players are coming over from retails and expect retail-like threat generation from the tank.  It is very rare that a group stays on the skull.  I find in most fights Im dancing all over desperately trying to take aggro back from dps, and not having taunt for the healer.
---
I think you've got the right idea with the 'save the healer' button and leting dps tank if that's their wish.
---
Protests like these do generally make a difference. Only thing I'm worried about is that the known rabidness of this community has somehow desensitize blizzard CS/Marketing to outraged customers, this wouldnt be the first time. 
---
I'm amazed how easily they throw their US PC gaming base under the bus though. They legit turned Diablo franchise into a mobile cash grab to rake in cash in Chinese markets, why risk having their IP banned in China just because of a few vocal gamers on their platform?
---
That is my plan too, i'm currently using 4/5 deathbone with whatever int/stam/mp5 plate gear i can find. Bonus healing and spelldamage is good too
---
From what I understand, Spell damage is your most important stat as a caster by a huge margin.
---
Awesome to see :)  
---
Any tips for aspiring droods?
---
The farther into the game you get, the better kings is. Once you get AQ gear, or beyond, kings is better than might because you've got so much raw stats.
---
Thats not how it works i think.
---
Tried it with my friend and the exp was shared depending on %dmg done
---
what is the range on it? I had other addon for this purpose but it registered enemy players like after I have already noticed them (40y?) making it quite useless.
---
So I was lucky enough to get BT tonight **(Thank the gods)** and I was wondering what other two pets I should aim for so  I have a nice stable of pets to tackel any situation. Everything I have looked up has all been different answers. I'm level 42 if it matters.
---
To cast spells from a form :
---
&gt; /cancelform
---
&gt; /cast Your_spell
---
To instantly switch from one form to another, make macros for all forms as such :
---
&gt; /cast Nameofnewform
---
You can add [noform:2] to not cast it when you already are in the form. Example, spam Catform when you're already a cat. "2" in the example here is cat. noform:1 is bear, noform 3 is travel etc..
---
For mouseover :
---
&gt; /cast [@mouseover] Nameofthespell  
---
is the default way of doing it. You can add a lot to it, so it only works on friendly targets, with key modifiers aswell (like if you press the macro while pressing shift or alt, it goes to you, etc).  Google mouseover macros for more info, or install the addon named : "Clique".
---
Tanking macro, maybe use the /cancelform + /cast a Rejuvenation and then have a /cast Bearform ready. You can cast a HoT on yourself and switchback to Bear in no time.
---
Regarding the bar switching while in form. Make use of the extra action bars available, and any macro to cast a spell that starts with /cancelform
---
It's an OH with only +50 armor
---
ONEPUNCHHHH
---
Here's one for rejuvenate, can substitute for any spell.
---
#showtooltip rejuvenate
---
/Cancelform
---
/Cast rejuvenate
---
If your horde this one is super nice. 
---
#showtooltip regrowth/healing touch(whichever)
---
/Cast war stomp
---
/Cast regrowth/healing touch
---
I use those alottt.
---
Free for guildies 100g for non.
---
&gt;Crusade guildmembers in confussion
---
On mobile btw, so it'll probs look dumb
---
Would love that one
---
Political correct psycho.
---
Guess so. Perhaps it will be slower to execute than it was in vanilla but could still work.
---
Is anyone in Oceania having trouble? I've tried a Arugal and Yojamba and get maybe 5 minutes before I either get disconnected or the game just breaks.
---
Gooooo habs
---
Dude you're just arguing semantics with me. 
---
Yeah, everyone who takes time to research their shit is going to know that 2H Rockbiter is the most consistent way to level, in the same vein that we know which gear is best in slot and which spec performs the best under any given circumstance.
---
But this sub is filled with people who do not do their research. And I'd bet my left testicle that very few of those have tried out using Windfury in combination with a dagger, because it's not the intuitive way to go about using Windfury. To those people, it would be surprising how well WF Dagger performs, which is not noticably worse than 2H Rockbiter for a vast majority of players. 
---
Never said it's a crazy new discovery either, you're literally putting words in my mouth.
---
Arms is great for trash DPS (90% of the instance and 90% of the ‚Äúchallenge‚Äù while leveling) if you‚Äôre just doing traditional pulls of 2-5 mobs at once.  Sweeping Strikes is disgusting against small groups of mobs.
---
But yeah, fury warriors can struggle a bit if they go dual wield as a fresh 60.
---
runecloth should be worth more, if not buy up everything you can.
---
I see many people buying 9000 runecloth to get exalted in other faction for exotic mount. 
---
Runecloth always levels out around 1g7-2g a stack eventually, so if its still 1g or a little more it's a good investment (just pack it on a lvl 1 storage alt)
---
700 iq and your still using lowly book? Pheehg!
---
Good little write up there. Just out of curiosity - why do you say priests get trashed in BGs?
---
Video settings -&gt; UI scale
---
I don't think dudes mentally unwell, looks like he was trying to be dark/edgy funny, but is bad at it. Report and forget.
---
Your username checks out.
---
My point was that I loved classic and these events changed that.
---
Heal them when it's needed and you have the spare mana for it. If you keep them above 30-40% that's enough as long as they don't take aggro, and if they do that's usually enough to keep them alive. 
---
From experience, most good locks have a system on it, and won't go to hard if they see the healer struggles with mana. If they do, give them a whisper and ask them to slow down a bit, and they probably will.
---
Unoriginal names bragging they came up with something cool.
---
It unfortunately makes it character-wide.
---
Yes you are..  dps dont pull . . Never ever :p let the tanks pull they need to learn how to use thier bows/x-bows.   ( i am playing mage since ever ;) )
---
Most people find a group and then go there.
---
However, your group can become more desirable, when you need one or two more, if you can offer a summon from the warlock, which needs 2 of you plus the warlock 
---
That being said, nothing wrong with waiting to get the full team and then heading in :)
---
It's been getting worse the last few years hence the protests. People from HK have always bern well aware, most Americans have not.
---
But the CCP is about as communist as North Korea is democratic so that's not really relevant.
---
Prepare for trouble!
---
I'm not in it for the thank yous or karma. 
---
And I get how douchey that sounds.
---
I'm genuinely interested in the situation in Hong Kong. 
---
With the upcoming American and Canadian elections I truly feel that we are at a pivotal point. 
---
Neutral non reactions are no longer acceptable. 
---
I ask what would it take for all of the people remaining in game to leave. Or to give up their sub for one month even. What would Blizz or China have to do to make people care enough to give up their self interest?
---
So not like this matters a lot but Im wondering whats better for a priest
---
Hypnotic Blade (Arcanist Doan) +  Orb of the Forgotten Seer (Thalnos) or Illusionary Rod (Arcanist Doan)

all 3 items drop in SM Grave/Lib

---
Keep the thread alive guys
---
Yes I'm sure it's not people who were told meme specs were good and all you had to do was put in a bit of effort and they would be competitive who are now rolling new classes because they found out they were lied to.
---
Always classicdb, beats wowhead by miles in almost every aspect
---
You can solo help her at 20, but you must drink/eat ASAP after each wave, so you could be full for the next. Save Divine Protection / LoH for the last 3rd wave. Buff Daphnie with Might - you can let her offtank 1 mob, but get the aggro of the other ones so they don't kill her.
---
Enjoy your Verigan's Fist - it really makes leveling to 30 a breeze.

I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm being the baby here. I would try to explain to him why it‚Äôs better for me to pull the bat if he wasn‚Äôt being passive aggressive and like ‚Äúif I didn‚Äôt pull the mob I‚Äôm just gonna stand here watch you die‚Äù.  Great communication done there.

So do you have proof that the difference is marginal at best? Is every spec and build "Marginal at best"?

my guild got both with their first mc id a few weeks ago
---
I mean I knew it was a long shot.. but to get both in 7 weeks is some feat.. I've ran MC 3 times and got both in those 3 runs which is crazy to think about..
---
I used it on my warlock. Always spent 1 tap away from full health.

Druid's don't benefit from shamans' windfury totem (windfury is a chance on hit weapon enchant and druid's can't trigger chance on hit effects when they're in their forms). Windfury is a huge boon to other melee DPS classes which means druid's have even more catching up to do. Paladins also have buffs that help melee DPS, but they are equally beneficial to druids/rogues/warriors.

nah it drops from angerforge

They aren't citizens. I mean, don't get me wrong, it's still real fucked up. But, if I had a choice to either be a Chinese citizen or an American citizen (and I am neither), I would choose American in a heartbeat.

Go try and talk about the card game hearthstone on /r/hearthstone I dare you, the top 20 posts are all about Blitzchung
---
did Ragefire Chasm the other day and managed to do it with no tank and 4 people. At first we had a level 10 Warrior who tried to tank and didn't do so well so next pull he decide to mass pull die and the leave group. 
---
I don't get some people

It‚Äôs all good. Technically Troll is the best race for a PvE focused warrior but it really doesn‚Äôt matter that much

---
People who have trouble sticking to a character are not the ones who picked based on "meta tiers", they're the ones who picked their class for other reasons that they decided matter for arbitrary reasons.
---
Sounds like you both acted kinda dickish?
---
Like, just because other tanks appreciate a thing, doesn't mean you should do it with tanks who *don't* appreciate it. Ideally, the tank would express his preference for pulling himself in a polite way, and you would let him pull and perhaps give him some tips if you know a better way. Instead, it sounds like you just kept pulling anyway?
---
Meanwhile, the tank chose to be a passive-aggressive dipshit about it - like, I get that it's annoying when dps do this, but... Yeah. 
---
Everyone always has an opinion on how dungeons should be done. As long as people aren't causing wipes, maybe just take a deep breath, talk about it, and if you can't reach an agreement then live and let live. And even when people *are* causing wipes, it's often because there's something they don't know, or they just made an honest mistake. Explaining what to do usually makes the rest of the run smoother.
---
Tanked it at 58/59. Its not bad. That dungeon in particular is a tad hard for druids because there are a lot of aoe packs near the start. A trick here is tell your healer to spam big heals on you, pull, Los, bark skin-&gt; hurricane to clear the adds before shifting to kill the elites. I also use a variety of tools here like Oil of Immolation, the Scale of the Mountain thorns effect, the tobacco trinket (engineer bombs if you have) etc etc. Anything to deal initial aoe to 8+mobs
---
After that druids threat gen, mobility, and overall beefyness seems to work, I'd reccomend bringing a couple of Greater Stoneshield Pots (tbh I'd get a lot of these anyways they are amazing) for Timmy and Balz as they hit like a truck and Balz may have you without heals for a bit
---
On the other hand /r/blizzard is being attacked for censorship and conspiracy while the mods are probably just trying to manage the situation somehow.
---
With all respect I think these points are moot.  Their focus is on growth and the eastern market generates more than enough. No matter how tilted the western market is in respect to 'new' IP is irrelevant. They're income will still be substantial

No Healing Light is 10 point talent in the Holy Tree.

You are referring to Holy Light which I know about Flash of Light is Better
---
Horde's are brutes with no taste for cuisine /s
---
I'd say standing there watching your group fight a mob you dident pull is being a baby about something.
---
Communication goes both way. OP probably thought the pull+silence was enough info the tank needed. Obviusly that type of mobs was new to the tank.
---
Imagine paying money for a game just to get banned???
---
Hmm are we talking about the same bats? I was referring to the patrol bats that move quite fast and if not pulled with a instant spell it‚Äôs quite easy to pull other mobs with them.
---
But you are being the baby. "You pull it, you tank it" is the actual norm, it was always the norm and really no tank cares about you thinking otherwise if you don't say anything *before* doing it.
---
Was just hellfire I believe. They were going to add it post naxx
---
Yes, who determines what a "basic human right" is? It's politics, everything is politics. Fuck the Chinese Government and I wish the best for Hong Kong trying to escape from it, but Blitzchung objectively shoehorned in politics in a place that it explicitly wasn't allowed

This is NOT a ‚Äúgreat change‚Äù, this never needed any change it was fine as it worked in vanilla

At 19 you'll get trashed by primarily hunters rogues &amp; warriors. Same for 29 but you can kill squishy clothies easily. 39 or 49 is your best twink zone for druids
---
Can I see your logs?
---
While levelling two gathering professions is a good enough idea for easy profit. Also don't vendor potentially sellable stuff (stacks of herbs, bags, certain items like any wands or those with good stat combinations of which you think classes could use it like agi leather or str mail/later plate) and use a AH char.
---
Just make a lv 1 tauren, give him a silly name, waddle to TB, park him between the AH and mailbox and send him all the stuff. Mailling items is just 30 copper, so it's usually worth it to AH stuff.
---
I‚Äôm lucky and don‚Äôt need much sleep.

My gf gets upset if I play during the day, so we go to bed together around 10pm, i wait till she is asleep and then get up around 11 and play until about 2, but I‚Äôm addicted so that turns into 4am a lot of the time
---
So the legs showed up when i Finally relog. Weird. Fixed now TY all

imagine joining a raid with trash items and expecting the raid to gear you up, they all farmed their pre bis shit and you show up in your garbage green gear and expect loot
---
Its like when that wood elf drops from the sky in morrowind

cant remember but got it from either Frostmadus or Stormx (u can look up their UI on twitch or youtube for a DL link)
---
Tank pulls unless he asks a hunter to do so. Either a warrior with a ranged weapon or a Druid who quickly breaks out of bear form to cast something. Mage pull? I don‚Äôt think so.
---
I wouldn‚Äôt bother AoE farming at that level man, you can get faster xp actually playing and looking for upgrades

God I fucking love ironforge. Too bad it's Alliance scum territory. See you when I come for Magni's head.

I sometimes wait for a boss ability, then use lifetap 5-6 times and bandage afterwards. So a healer would see me drop to 50% but I try to make sure that everyone is aware beforhand.

In Retail it doesn't matter.
---
In Classic your fastest weapon should always be in the Mainhand, since the Offhand poison proccs after your deadly poison (which should be on your Mainhand weapon) is stacked 5 Times.
---
If enough people stop playing, Blizzard would be forced to at minimum make a statement, and would reduce global and local (in china) support for what is happening.
---
So pretending that you playing vs not playing makes no difference is not entirely truthful.
---
At any rate, yes - 1 votte in an election isn't going to swing things, 1 player who stops isn't going to swing anything either. Does that mean there's 0 value in canceling your sub or voting?
---
Same but whenever i reset position it snaps back to that.
---
You need higher fishing level to fish in STV than in Elwynn, but once you're able to fish, you will skill up at same rate regardless of location.
---
Although if you fish in a lower area, you will skill up slightly faster because you will have less failed casts.
---
Sweeping Strike + Whrilwind is a an insane cleave DPS. Really good trash cleaner.

Day 36, they still haven't noticed I'm a spy.
---
You were both being babies and nobody wins at that. Instead you took that energy and made a rant about it on reddit.

A quick "is it ok if I pull the bats for you, tank?" would have solved this problem from the start.
---
I love people who will try to execute some AOE meta they seen on youtube with randoms.

Was declined a spot as dps for ZF since this dude really wanted the perfect compilation. By the time we are going out to summon a guy for run number 2 i still see him in /1 searching for that perfect member.

Is mage a real class though? They could be mostly replaced with a portal and food vendor.
---
Unfortunately no other way.
---
Make a macro that changes this, and put it on all your characters. Change to high scale on one char, change to default scale on others.
---
You can just use /cancelform
---
This is why i prefer dps role in dungeons because then you both got option to combat res the healer should they die in combat or innervate him aswell. And the only res every 30minutes situation is not an issue :)
---
Lol. I did the same thing in SFO when I got bumped from my flight. For a second I was embarrassed to be playing in front of everyone, then I remembered what I always tell my kids: don't be ashamed of anything that isn't wrong.

I just finished my feral tree, hit 40 equiped my wolfshead and put my first point into furor. Shit is a game changer.

i‚Äôm 50+ lbrs runs in and still haven‚Äôt gotten my pre-bis pants, gloves and robe. 30+ strat and no hat or neck. belt from arena farms. there is only so much time in a day and if bad rolls is going to mean no loot in raid then what options am i left with?
---
in original vanilla i ran over 250+ ubrs runs for the weapons and never got to roll in raid either. no progress.
---
i never even made it out of kharazan, running it every week for 8 months in tbc, because of poor gear and the other casters getting the roll for offspec.
---
i don‚Äôt know what kind of drop paradise you live in, but there are tons of us with all the effort and zero pre-bis drops because of the RNG and competition.
---
Who the hell enjoys UBRS enough to think about wanting to run it while not even subbed!?
---
Thank you, will have to try that!
---
Calm down midget
---
Mobs that are on a fast patrol around packs(gargoyles in strat, razorgore mobs) are much easier to pull with a fire blast or arcane shot. All the tank has to do is throw a taunt and build a little threat when the mob comes to the group. Sure you should talk about it before you do it, but the tank is being the baby. Fairly surprised that people are saying he isn‚Äôt üòÜ

---
This. in Vanilla wow i played a hunter and at the beginning of every dungeon i offered to take over pulling with the arsenal a hunter has to offer, traps, fd and whatnot. Many tanks gladly accepted this, because it was really smooth going.
---
Advice for next time: just offer it. If the tank declines, there are reasons. maybe bad experiences, own strategy that suits his/hers needs or just confidence.
---
I would be suprised if it was a full grown adult, this sounds like something coming from an 11 year old kid.
---

Made a 37 priest and had to roll a warrior because I was just so fed up by the bubble-wand routine. I'm having a lot of fun with the warrior (currently lvl 18) and even though I didn't want to make alts before lvl 60 I don't care I'm having fun and that's the important part!
---
The actual figure is 12,345. How do I know? I can feel it in my balls.
---
Not true, hunters are great a pulling, because feign death. Mages feign death ( when they actually die) while realistic is less helpful. 
---
I know you want to go faster, everyone does including your tank and youre fucking it up. 
---
Let the tank do what they want to do, roll a tank if you want to do things your way. 
---
And before you tell me some dumb shit like " i tanked kara in vanilla" lets just agree youre the super best and you should roll a tank and stop whining on the forums about how people treat you badly when youre acting shitty.
---
Minus all references to death, but buy our micro-transactions.
---
You‚Äôre being ridiculous though if you think this is a to die on. Bunch of pathetic people rallying with 3 people who brought politics into video games, which news flash, was against the policies set forth by Blizzard. You guys contribute to the suffering of many people and you indirectly encourage child labor and you support China with the electronics you use on a daily basis, but wait, gotta give up my entertainment lol.
---
I‚Äôve been dragged and quartered for saying classic wow is a superior game by people who play classic over retail. What‚Äôs crazy to me is how many people still hold out hope next retail expansion will magically fix the insane problems plaguing modern wow. Unless they bring back some old blood  it‚Äôs just not going to happen.
---
Gotta do it outside of the game, too.

Thanks, Mr. Bot.

Look, its the guy who selfie camera!

I definitely think the player should be punished for at least 2 weeks but permaban over text is really overboard.
---
Even in a heated gamer moment it's not OK to describe multiple rapes and murders to someone. That guys has some mental issues.

I wish there was an additional +/-5 level PvP toggle, so if you're 35 for example, you can toggle on for players between 30-40 but be off for anyone else.

I enjoy fair game fights where with a bit of luck/good prices you can beat someone a few levels higher but skulls with gear is pointless.

Also, if you look closely enough, you can see her eyes moving.

Totally faking it.

Does people use some mods or anything? These screenshots look much better than my wow classic and I'm running it on high/ultra
---
As a 56 lock, I very regularly find myself thinking (and sometimes saying), "hey man you dont have to heal me every single pull. I'm low hp because I'm about to eat and drink simultaneously, and if you heal me then I'm wasting food"
---
Spending to much time in the shire!
---
How?
---
There was a point in WotLK when chain heal became the most mana efficient spell for a resto shaman. Because of the way talents we're set up you would literally just spam heal Chain heal off the tank non stop and top healing charts in raid and never run out of mana in dungeons. Those were the day.
---
Was hoping to get 2 years lifespan from wow
---
Well there was a beta but streamers decide not to test anything. Only thinking of their stream and not in the slightest of the game.
---
Once I hit level 60, I plan to go a HOTW spec so I can find a group easier as tank. 
---
I still plan to roll on BIS heal gear, which is mainly cloth and also regular leather gear as well...is this ninja or will I get away with this due to lack of tanks.
---
That's not comparable.
---
To make an actual comparison, ever heard of someone getting the option of better pay but the uniform changes who took it but regretted it?
---
I don't know why you'd go to Reddit to ask a question like this. Around here, tanks and healers are all amazing perfect angels who can do no wrong (lol sitting there watching you 3 fight the mob) and all dps are total mongoloids who solely exist to piss of tanks.
---
These slow moving, geriatric "tanks" in this thread are probably the kind of people my friends cry about when I'm not on to tank for them. I'm glad you, as a dps, know what abilities the mob has and the limitations of my ability to pull as a tank.  
---
Seriously though, I didn't feel like speccing back into feral for 1 day before raid and I ended up doing 5 man tankless Jed runs and we were musing the whole time that it was more smooth than with a pug warrior.  It was actually kinda great.  I'm not sure why, but tanking attracts the most unskilled players this game has to offer.  I think it's because they like the perceived control of "owning" a group like your dipshit warrior there.
---
I'm not a pro but I've been healing dungeons with a feral talent tree. I've got some downranked skills on my bar and a healing set of gear. Seems to work quite well
---
Nah if you learned the tailor profession but are still sitting at 1 skill point youre a non-tailoring tailor.
---
It's the world of WARcraft, after all.
---
Have you heard of warlocks sir? They can summon other people to dungeon and everyone loves them.
---
Thank you for bringing this to my attention.
---
If Pantheon had Vanguards depth and Everquest Next's cartoonish style I'd be all over it.  I can't play stylised or semi-realistic games any more, they just age so terribly.
---
It's more like warlocks are using their health as a resource, and need to be responsible for managing that themselves. The healer should focus on the targets that take damage from the mobs that are being killed, not the ones that are damaging themselves (who also happen to have abilities that let them heal). If a lock life taps too much, then it's on them, not the healer.

Find him before he finds you, and then as you're beating the life out of him, whisper, :D

Lol i literally start acting like more of a dick to people i dont like specifically to get added to their ignore list. My ignore list might be finite but there is unlimited space on other people i cant stand lists for me
---
It's pretty cool that he did that.
---
But, Blizzard will more than likely not respond. In all honesty, give it a week or two and all of this will be forgotten in favour of the next big geopolitical controversy. It is the way of the world now.
---
No it's fine on twitch but on wow it tells me to disable it in that panel before login. I have all my add-ons on twitch app

---
I only like it and appreciate it when my mage tells me his is doing so same with summoners in scholomance, I usually run with the same 2 mages from my guild tho so they no longer need to communicate it. If I'm pugging bcs both my mages are unavailable I will ask the new mage to counterspell. But I don't just like it to happen randomly, bcs I still like to be the one that pulls.  I can shoot it, and you can counterspell at the same time.
---
The guy above me is using the old autism way of communication by overanalyzing things.
---
Mostly 2 rank downed touch and highest rank HoT for me. I try to add HoT as soon as touch finishes. Then wait hoping to regen mana. In emergency I may use 1 rank downed touch. Never highest rank touch or regrowth.
---
For DGs Druids are far better/more enjoyable tanks than any Warr could ever be.

I have tanked plenty of pugs and I still don't fill entitled to ruin the run for 3 good players just to get revenge on one bad apple.
---
&gt;Not just "you can't play that video game until you make a new blizz account using a fake IP".
---
This is an MMO, it's not as trivial as using a vpn (you can't "fake" an ip btw) and just making a new account, you literally lose weeks and or months of hard work on your characters.

Can't be leaf they would push these kind of pencil-thin-hourglass-waist beauty standards upon us!
---
I've been playing ally for so long I didn't even consider that he might be horde, haha!
---
How is 2h WF as fury on classic compared to how it was on pservers? Played 2h fury with BRE on horde side on Lightbringer and it was glorious, doing insane dps with relatively shitty gear. Is it as op on classic?
---
There are plenty of videos on YouTube describing classes in like 10min. I recommend looking for those!
---
Only healing touch is efficient, don't use other spells. Use max rank only until you get sp gear, or if you have to heal less you can use lower rank.
---
For me the problem is with races and appearance too. I made a bald dwarf priest and I just wish I made a good looking human priest because looking on that bald head for 40 lvls made me kinda hate the character lol.
---
Ask your group before the run starts, usually rolling in off spec stuff is only ok if the healer doesn't need it
---
Lol those tariffs are nothing in the grand scheme. Their ability to  issue and claim funds on loans to African nations that can't front repayments essentially creates  a system of indebted  servitude and geopolitical control  that's super efficient

That one guy standing on top of the bank spamming to sell a green item in trade... I assume any way. Naked bank alts running back and forth between the mail box and AH. Get those guys some fancy clothes, show how classic rich you really are...

Good luck finding a raid where no one makes mistakes.
---
Aren't instant attacks normalized to a set attack speed (¬ø1.8?) for this patch?
---
To be fair classic wow was made by a group of content creators who's bosses' boss made the decision about the hearthstone event. If you stop paying for wow you will hurt the developers and the lowest men on the totem pole more than you will the people at the top. They will lay off more game developers  first

Aslong as you have the minimum fishing lecel requirement you go equally fast everywhere.

There is a minimum to not have the "your fish got away" message

35 make sure you done shimmering flats Q, then head to desolace to do the SM pre-quest and perhaps a couple of other quests there, off to swamp of sorrow to do the 2-3 quests there.  At 36 head to badlands and do all quests you can there while waiting for a SM group doing a full run for your Q.  You should now be 37-38 in level and finishing off some more STV Q.  You now have a choice to keep running SM for XP and gear (I suggest a minimum of 2x library armory and cath).  You should also try to get a run in RFD if you can for more money and items.
---
In your time between groups try to clear off any lower zones like arathi, hillsbrad and badlands, and any non-elite quests in STV.  Lvl 38 is the point where you can fill a group and finish off every group quest in STV and probably get you to level 40.  This will open up tanaris and dungeon farming can progress to Uldaman.  Theramore has a few quests also if you are short on exp at any point.

Can someone link the hotw build?

If a hunter pulls A RANGED MOB and feign death... The mob IS STILL RANGED, and will attack from range.

The only effective way to pull a ranged mob, is to pull it and break line of sight. Making the hunter's feign death irrelevant.

Save yourself a lot of hassle and do it at 60
---
It's because you only see the upsides of a class when you look at those things. When you finally roll the class, you also experience the downsides. 
---
Solution: Consider the downsides of a class before rolling.
---
Yep! Sorry those
---
YTA. Yes the tank is a baby as well, but it is common knowledge that the tank typically leads through a dungeon. This means he is the one to decide when and what to pull. You pulling without ever asking if it was okay can fuck him up. Do you know his cool downs? Did you look at the healers mana and position?
---
If you want to pull for him go and ask him.
---
So you are saying the difference between classes are only their appearance?
---
Fuck now my spot is busted haha. Thankfully it's instanced :D
---
If you feel like a guild might employ some shady and inconsistent loot tactics, I would think about trying to find a guild elsewhere.  Classic is essentially still in its infancy, and new content isn't going to be released for a while.  I've been in a couple guilds like this before, and I'll tell you right now, it's going to get a lot worse before it gets any better.
---
I agree with you that marking a target can definitely help a run.  However, it is also the tanks responsibility to do a lot of things in the dungeon. 
---
As a healer - I often try to mark a target, as it makes my job quite a bit easier.  But DPS can also mark.  
---
If no one is marking, DPS should know target priority. Take down casters / big hitters first. DPS often think their entire role is just to make the number as big as possible.  But I'd much rather have a dps that is 20 dps lower, but is active in the group play and actually makes decisions.  If there are a bunch of the same mob, target the one at lowest HP each time you finish the previous one off.
---
Be careful the ~Chinese~ Blizzard don't hear you!
---
Never knew about the bridge skip to get to Angerforge, but I doubt it will save much time  - yes less mobs to fights since you just run and drop aggro but not being able to get back AND having the chance of group members just plumitting down into the lava seems a big trade off. :)  
---
But for Lava runs that is the only way to do it in a timely manner.
---
Oh no i cant play single player in online games.

At least right now you can fix the issue by just deleting the civilian, that won't be an option come phase 2.
---
No, post is correct like it is.
---
I will never refuse to do my job. Whether I'm tanking on my warrior, DPSing on my hunter, or healing on my shaman, my job is to see the end boss dead, not police or "teach" the party. Sometimes it means sacrificing the stupid DPS, others saving it (if I have the Mana and threat cushion)
---
Imagine accusing someone with barely 1+ karma of karma farming.
---
No doubt about that, punishment was too harsh.

 "After a successful parry, the defender's "swing timer" is reduced by 40% of your weapon speed "

Honestly even if it's a harmless kid i still think the police should be notified over this, worst case scenerio turns out it's just some nose picker window licker 11 year old and he gets the scare tactic of knowing that the police will come over if he says bad things like that, best case scenario an actual potential murderer/rapist gets arrested with evidence of premeditation.

How would a Wildheart Boomkin using a melee weapon with procs perform? Every aspect of Boomkin gets buffed; spell damage, melee damage, being as tanky as Dire Bear...
---
 They could get a good melee weapon with an enchantment for when they run out of mana and need to wait for regen. Isn't that one of the reasons Cat form falls behind? They din't scale because they can't get weapons?
---
A ram? Mistakes were made
---
Sounds like this advice is applicable to life in general.
---
You clearly didn‚Äôt mean that when you wrote it, but its cool.
---
How are you watching a movie in game? Is it an add on or an overlay?
---
They can't break it without changing how combat logs works entirely,which is guaranteed to be a massive pain. The addon detects targets which "cast" the stealth ability within the 200 yard range the combat log has.
---
They haven't been silent, they already apologized to China for the incident even happening. They have doubled down on where they stand.
---
I prefer Caster -&gt; Melee -&gt; Healer if your group is good at paying attention for interrupts.  Healers don't do much damage and a swift kick makes them simple to deal with. 
---
This changes if the group doesn't have good interrupts, or healer is immune to it.
---
*Boss fights you've never done before or know the tactics to.
---
I know, I just worry by the time I get into those zones will there be anyone left in them lol
---
Adam Silver literally has an interview where he stated "if that's the consequence (losing the Chinese market) then that's the consequence." 
---
He has put out multiple statements that have had the Chinese suspend all broadcasts of their preseason games, and potentially more. It is not fair to make uneducated claims such as this.
---
"oh but the poor innocent devs!!" Is such a common argument from the fatalistic apathy that is rampant in this community. 
---
There was a small walk out at Blizz the day after all of this dropped. A few brave employees stood up for the greater good. Don't fool yourself for a second if you think it wasn't fear that held the rest of them back. 
---
I don't care what you think of me or my integrity, bud, lol. I'm not pretending anything. Feel pissy about people wanting a better outcome for this debacle than just the zugzug of the same old shit.

Guess no one needed that bad üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

&gt;there is no ethical consumption in capitalism
---
god the length of time it's taken to see this phrase pop up.
---
How does the picture match with the context?
---
Should be doable at your level. Might be good to grab a ranged weapon from AH if you are running around with one from level 10.
---
Yep. Each time that window opens, you ask "Do I get an upgrade?"
---
Finally an item appears, and "You think you do, but you dont."
---
I was thinking about putting a humble pod together actually, to talk about mostly the news ‚Äòin-gane‚Äô and related topics.
---
There's a reason pvp mostly stuck to outside the towns in Vanilla, at least after they made changes during the patches post honor system. Far less town camping after that point.
---
I don't know for sure if this is legion style, or just 1.12 behavior though.
---
the making isnt really the hard part. it's those damn crystals you need for it
---
Any gear worth obtaining from 42-45ish?  I have purchased the wolf helm but am still wearing a lot of gear from WC/that level.
---
Now that was close, not sure it could be closer. Well done you lucky devil.

Sure, everyone is garbage except you.
---
Sorry, I used the word book since it's the best word to describe it to you filthy lowIQs. It's more of a common thought we telepathically send to each other. See it as a cloud solution, but for brilliant minds and ideas.

&gt;We focus on these poignant elements of design and aim to provide our players with environments conducive to building reputations, friendships and alliances‚Äîas well as rivalries and notoriety.

Sounds like they want to make an actual MMORPG, nice
---
This is PreparedWoW, he's a 40 person multiboxer.  Most of his toons were level 16-19 about 3 weeks ago, it's obvious he hasn't done much of anything to level them up.  If you want to venture into the mind of someone whom I'm pretty sure is clinically insane, you should check him out on Twitch.  The dude speaks as if he's reading the manifesto of a school shooter.
---
&gt; but not being able to get back
---
Well if we're talking about saving time, you shouldn't be going back. You should have someone reset the instance for you.
---
But also someone pointed out that YOU CAN go back, find the comment somewhere here.
---
&gt; AND having the chance of group members just plumitting down into the lava
---
There's no risk of falling into lava. It's a big platform. The only reason I'm hugging the wall is because that's how you climb up the wall. I can't see where im walking since it's all so dark.
---
That has always been the case because there are like 8 dungeons wish drop silk and maybe 3 that drops wool.
---
It doesn't I think.
---
One of them just came randomly when i had vacation this summer and ate breakfast on the balcony.
---
If you have trees around your house and live in europe/midwest US you should have squirrels in the area. Just leave some nuts out and take 2 coins and tap them together. The clicking sounds trick squirrels into thinking theres another squirrel peeling a nut. So they must come and check it out.
---
Blink works too for preventing fall deaths
---
both you and the tank sucks, thats it
---
Horde gets a trinket with 1% hit and 20AP that is BIS until.... God knows when. And they get it during leveling.
---
Alliance? Enjoy your Argent Dawn trinket bro
---
&gt;I see you've not played CS:GO.
---
How did you make that assumption? I've played CS probably before you were born and no, describing rapes and murders as a direct threat to someone has never been OK and is a reason for actual legal action in most countries in the civilised world. Please stop spewing bullshit.
---
So where are your screenshots from vanilla?
---
I heal locks that are below 75 and have aggro, or are at 10 and have loads of mana. Any other time I will leave them to it :)
---
No thanks, were already running into loit problems. My guilds got two now xD
---
OP is saying he didn't turn in cloth, that's the whole point here, so wtf are you even on about
---
Too sweet!
---
I truly have no idea what that means
---
Temples and churches exist in real life, but there's still zero evidence of there being any heaven or proof of any specific god.
---
It's censorship. Freedom of speech is a constitutional right that protects you from your government in a majority of cases (outside of hate speech, etc), it's scope doesn't reach private entities. They can choose to censor what they like, and public opinion decides whether or not it is acceptable rather than the rule of law.
---
It's more often than not better to not censor, but corporations do it all the time if they believe they can do it slyly or face little backlash due to the fact that they have the legal right to do it. Their platform, their rules and you willingly sign up to it when you agree t the user agreement. 
---
All you can do is vote with your wallet and hope that the backlash is sufficient that they change their public stance, but there's absolutely no legal precedent to protect what you say on private websites.
---
They'll resub again next week lol
---
I personally don't think I purchased any gear until ~lvl 58, but I did end up being semi up-to-date by questing/doing dungeons.
---
This is so stupid, you're going to let some dumb political crap ruin a perfectly good game for you? Pathetic.
---
The only common factor is rogues, it's almost always rogues.
---
You do realize a very very small percentage of people in the beta were streaming, right? Even if 100 people were streaming, there would need to be only 1,000 people in the beta for that to be 10% of all players.
---
Just because you only saw streamers on the beta, doesn't mean all of the players on the beta were streamers, lol.
---
This is a someone needs help moment.
---
Same I live in the central time zone but I play on smolderweb. I get home from work around 5-6 and get on and it‚Äôs only 3-4 server time. So even though it‚Äôs prime time for me, not my server :)
---
Where did I ever say that?
---
he got knees? HOW?
---
it's around 6 silver/ piece, so 1g20s a stack, minus AH cuts. I should probably just stockpile it, yeah.
---
I've taken two breaks from my warrior because of how shitty dungeons are for tanks. Currently level 56 and took my third break. 
---
Did a full BRD clear and before I can even generate threat I have hunters using AOE, people attacking different mobs, not paying attention to their surroundings, pulling extra things. It's super frustrating.
---
Winter has always been one of my favorite seasons and this comment makes me excited for it. Beautifully said.
---
My stance is that they took the punishment too far. Revoking prize money is directly affecting his income. A suspension alone would have had the same intended effect.
---
Any way which would be the most enjoyable one for you.
---
You do realize that people are canned on a monthly basis from big companies for expressing their opinion about such topics? This isn‚Äôt about all money, it‚Äôs about the contracts you sign for not being put in a position where other people can confuse the opinions of someone and the opinions of the company. That‚Äôs why those policies are there.

I'm new to healing as Druid. Currently lvl 36 and feral leveling spec. I've been keeping a set of spirit/int gear in the bank just on the off chance I get asked to heal a dungeon. I'm not sure I'm comfortable just jumping into SM and healing straight up. Should I be keeping my HoTs up and letting my mana regen or should I be using my longer big heals? Any advice?
---
So no chance of dropping while wall climbing in this case? Wasn't 100% sure from the video since, as you say, it is pretty dark to the left of that climbing area. 
---
I'd say a Mind Sooth run with a priest can be almost as quick, but not as quick as this for sure if everyone knows what to do and does not fail. Always great to discover / learn something new, even after 15 years.
---
Hey there i will soon change from gnomish to goblin, may i ask how is it actually done ?
---
Watch some druid PvP videos and pay attention to how they deal with each class.
---
I haven't had a problem with anyone except priests (and maybe warlock if they get that fear off)
---
KEK. I shouldn‚Äôt be laughing
---
Where are all these people? And why should anyone care if someone decides to reroll.
---
Angerforge runs include Argelmach a lot of the time too.
---
I usually offer it as a paladin healer. I just have to rub it in that just once the paladin is the better ranged with a 30y instant Exorcism.
---
Niece*
---
in vanilla you could pickpocket a mob once
---
Hey would you mind linking your build? I just put my last point in Hotw and would like to heal in raids (or even dungeons soon) so not sure where to go from here)
---
Why would XP be in BG‚Äôs? That was never a feature til much much later. People will twink just fine and for as long as they want (good).
---
You clearly haven't played very much then, or not in the right region. This is literally the type of stuff you read every couple of matches. They're going to kill your entire family, they're gonna track your IP, they know where you live from your Steam account, I've heard it all a thousand times by now.
---
The more interesting conversations are actually were they ask people about their personal life and then try to get them to kill themselves, with detailed instructions etc. At least that's creative.
---
I think Dreadmist is like 55-45 horde/alliance too.
---
If it were against the games design, then they‚Äôd terminate it via the TOS. Full stop. Anything else is injecting opinion into the matter. Video Games are meant for people to enjoy in whatever fashion they may enjoy. Just enjoy the game how you play it and worry less about how others play.
---
Yes. Start doing BRD, but stick to the first half.
---
Is it Violet from Thrill Kill?
---
&gt; Got any tips for beginning druid Tanks in general?
---
Armor and HP. I am the healing officer in our guild and i love healing our Bear tank more than the warriors. Sure they take "more" dmg overal but warriors are spiky AF.

Gamers:    Aughhhhhh I hate politics in gaming!!!!

Gamers:   Ohhh daddy give me more politics in gaming

Where is the rat?

I can be mad at more than one thing at the same time. It's not a zero sum game.
---
I don‚Äôt really like replying to people like you but I‚Äôll just assume you didn‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre talking about. 
---
This is not about iOS or silence. This is about instant spell vs slow moving arrow when pulling fast moving patrols. If you never ever pulled one extra mob shooting those bats with your bow, good for you.
---
it's hard to say when exactly they made those changes, but griefing towns was very easy comparatively into tbc/wotlk
---
i know this because that's all i spent my time doing
---
Alright thanks guys. That confirms that the quest is unrelated.
---
You want slow mainhand, because  skills, with sinister strike being most important in leveling and pve, deal weapon damage with additional damage, so slower weapons having higher weapon damage deal more damage with them.
---
People get really pissy when you ask questions that can be easily answered with a Google.  I mean, granted, I guess I do find it mildly annoying.  But the downvote backlash is kinda idiotic.
---
yes! shout out to the Double D! Excellent work guys
---
Tencent is who you all should blame, not Activision-Blizzard.   
---
This could happen with every company operating in China.  
---
You may whait for blizzard breaking boundries with Tencent but that's not going to happen. they  will  only hit the Chinees  player. Government won't give a fuck.
---
This is rad. I wish OCE had an RP server
---
I may be naive but yes. Not all streamers are WoW-only streamers, so keeping that one game out of their roster wouldn't hurt, but even WoW-only streamers would probably do fine. I don't know about you, but I don't watch streamers for the games, it's mainly for who they are.
---
Second thing, yes, I would quit streaming WoW, if you watch news about HK this shouldn't be a question.
---
Why stay? They weren't his boys.
---
Or you juste take a Priest and do mind soothe on the mobs. You can skip like 3/4 of the trash on the way.
---
Questing while killing every mob in the area will always be the best.
---
2nd best is to get off Reddit, pull your finger out and get on with it.
---
There is no 3rd best...

And the light whistle of the wind through the valley.
---
its a problem that can be reduced by leadership. A guild is not meant to be a loot source for solo players.
---
A guild is meant to be a group working together to improve as one unit.
---
A piece of Loot is not there to make one guy happy, its meant to make the whole guild stronger in the next run or other raids. 
---
guild leaders should empathize on the fact that the guild is improving and getting stronger not that they want loot for themselves. Like take records of the overall dps or time to take down bosses. Its always a great thing when the whole guild can celebrate, that they beat the last time or dps numbers
---
You'll get a helmet around 30
---
Lol I feel like Kaffee in a few good men rn
---
It's so weird, on my feral Druid I regularly out DPS people that are 3 levels higher than me, I've never been grouped with anyone my level who did more damage (mind you I'm only level 36, but still)
---
Mhmmm, already figured that out when OP replied. Thanks for the delayed information.
---
Dropped for us last week, rogue won it and equipped it.

I got sentry cloak, hodling tht shit

Lvl 30 is several days

It was meant to be sarcastic and start conversation, apparently it worked.
---
&gt;You clearly haven't played very much then, or not in the right region.
---
CLEARLY! Counting in CS + CS:GO it's about \~12 years. In central Europe, with all the cyka blyats and what not. Please stop assuming shit, you got absolutely no grasp on logic and come off as a moron. I'm done here.
---
There's a # before showtooltip. And if I don't make it clear replace the words in caps with your items.
---
You can heal dungeons with no holy talents honestly. It‚Äôs slower and will be more work but it‚Äôs doable. For raid healing, if you don‚Äôt have illumination, healing light, imp. Wisdom, and the 5% spell crit, you‚Äôre doing it wrong. Other great talents for a healing paladin are any and all blessing and auras talents. Lasting judgements is pretty nice too because you can judge light or wisdom without having to stay close to maintain it.
---
I plan dropping tailoring for a gathering proffesion and engi later on when the honor system hits once i craft it. Tbh i am kinda sad i didn't just sell the pattern, imo the baron pyjamas are better for full holy priests due to the spirit. But now that i learned it i might aswell craft it.
---
well, get an offhand which have glow effect
---
You  cant  tank as retri, you can as holy though, cant do it without concecration at least.

If I slash you with my daggers in the waist, does that mean I create two of you?

40-50 is the hardest grind imo. Questing and killing everything you see is the fastest way I've found.

It‚Äôs not an unpopular opinion at all man, it‚Äôs the lingering effects of meta culture and it‚Äôs toxicity over gaming.
---
People somewhere along the road forgot to play what they enjoy, if you truly enjoy something ‚Äî you‚Äôll find a way to make it work.
---
Instead most people now opt for the ‚Äú best ‚Äú in order to fulfill some niche instant gratification rather then work on developing themselves as a player.
---
Personal opinion: it‚Äôs always been more fun clawing your way up as the underdog to the top then to have sacrificed every bit of player agency for a few hits of easy feel good.
---
Keanu Reeves pulled multiple mobs. Keanu Cleaves

Wow, after you mods go around sucking China‚Äôs dick and deleting this topic everywhere, you finally realized that your blatant and obvious censorship was just making things worse, so you try to act like you‚Äôre doing us all a favor by making this topic?  FUCK YOU.

I personally witnessed this mod who made the topic, ‚ÄúSoupssoka‚Äù, going around and deleting comments about China.  This guy is just another pathetic tool, an this reeks of damage control

How to twink out my druid alt? Strength on weapon? maybe spirit? Agi enchants everywhere else?

Got my epic mount from it ;)

Nothing but shit and mudhuts
---
Priests will have stronger healing capabilities but also be much more vulnerable.
---
I played a NE priest in vanilla up to R11 and let me tell you if i didnt have Shadowmeld i would probably not have enjoyed pvp as much. I was constantly focused.
---
A priest healing in pvp is 100% about the team and he needs that team to help him out aswell being focused. 
---
I remember a high rank warrior would often target me in battlegrounds simply cuz he knew once harmstringed i couldnt get away from him. It was frustrating to say the least.
---
So in short, if you like being able to get out of a tight situation yourself, druid is the choice. 
---
&gt; Dwarves are the best.
---
Fearward is great but remember locks can chain fear.
---
Also Stoneform is great on paper too but last only 8 seconds and poisons can easily be re-applied.
---
And mind control, while fun on boats to send ppl into water etc. are not that useful in BGs expect maybe AB, and still then, good luck getting a 3 second cast spell off.
---
Just some feedback off the top of my head about priest in endgame pvp.
---
Again ppl shrugs off Shadowmeld but honestly its the best pvp skill my priest had in BGs cuz the options are so great (Drink up/eat in peace after combat, hide from being focused right away, defend a capture point with element of surprise, get your biggest heal off uninterrupted on your teammates)
---
Mankrik must be a Nice Guy
---
Is this a question?
---
All over this reddit, you'll find a bunch of threads talking about how they have trouble sticking to a character, asking for advice/if there are people with similar exp
---
Clearly!
---
This wouldn't be a good post if it were 10 different unique players saying kek.
---
I suppose it depends what your 'default' approach is. For me it would not be a surprise for someone to roll need on an offspec in a pug. For me it would be a surprise, a nice one, for someone to pass on offspec.
---
Particularly for tanks and somewhat for healers. You are not there as a 'mainspec tank'. You are there as THE tank so that the group can actually do anything. So when it comes to DPS loot rolls think of it like this:
---
 * You are not making a DPS player compete on loot rolls that would otherwise be 100% theirs. You are giving them the opportunity to roll on gear that they would otherwise never have seen.
---
The choice for DPS is not roll alone vs. roll against another player. It's roll on loot vs. spend another 30 minutes in /4 hunting for a group for the dungeon.
---
Lol go back to your pserver, shitbird.
---
&gt; So even with less members, we can still do it right?
---
Our first mc "clear" up to majordomo was 20 ish 60s and rest filler.

Besides the full BRD run with all bosses and trying to do almost every quest (some have further steps that also take place in BRD) the most common versions you will find in chat are:
---
\- Arena only (Warriors / Hunters want to do this for Savage Gladiator Chain epic mail chest) - very fast as the arena is close to the start
---
\- Arena - Angerforge or Arena - Angerforge - Golem Lord (The latter offering boots and trinket for casters / healers)
---
\- Lava run / Jump run (skipping almost everything to focus mainly on the last boss(es) - Emperor (Emp) and Princess - be aware that Princess Saves means the princess will not be killed to complete a quest that offers a blue reward - you also need to save the princess first before you can get loot in later runs by killing her, so doing that quest is advisable)
---
If you want to filter all the group requests that usually come through the chat very fast, get ClassicLFG that filters them from chat and presents them in an extra window with filter options for specific dungeons -  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/classiclfg)

I need to hit 60 so I can get in on that action
---
Other people, like me, don't believe in sacrificing something that brings daily enjoyment for a literally negligible.
---
We have sooo many things in our lives that we should cut out to actually boycott China, ruining things like this for us is not the place to start
---
As has been said over and over, they make a lot more money off the chinese market, so even if we all unsubbed it still wouldn't be enough to change their minds.
---
Yes, I am on the side of freedom. But it comes through politics, not our wallets. Capitalism cannot fix these issues, only our ideals can, and giving big companies less money is nowhere near as powerful as holding different ideals, voting and debating with those ideals. That's how we built our society. Democracy was not a lucrative choice, it was an ideal
---
I thought timelapses had a consistent speed, this feels more jump-cutty to me with the speed of the video going up and down constantly.
---
This is why I always mark as a tank, I am taking control of the plan for each fight, and I'm keeping the pace of pulls as engaging as possible but also safe. Mark at least a skull so if the DPS pulls / aggro, the target get's focused and dies quick, I can focus on gathering any other adds breaking CC first and building threat, after all a taunt can get resisted and just wastes time. It's easy enough for even a mage to off-tank mobs until Blackrock mountain with a semi-competent healer and some cc, just l2p basically.
---
I think it's more pushy players who think they know how to run dungeons, they don't understand mechanics of pulling, aggro, cc, or kiting. 
---
Get behind the tank, let them pull, it's not just their spec, it's their role in the group, and if you want to help manage the run, discuss that in chat, choose a mark for ur cc, do as you are asked, and be patient and nice about it, otherwise you're going on the list.
---
I ran BRD with two locks yesterday as well (priest)! Only healed them when I had spare mana or could dump two hots before drinking. 
---
Most players don't want to be a burden to others, locks are generally well aware of risks in lifetapping so don't worry about them if they're at like 30% health.
---
Make a Macro yelling don‚Äôt help me I‚Äôm doing my hunter quest. Seems like the simplest answer. Your asking other humans to think for themselves. Bad option
---
Great post.
---
This is clear case of how a loot council shouldn‚Äôt be run.  It sounded like round robbin with loot council for the higher ups which is fine but after reading everything the LC is corrupt.  LC imo is one of the best ways to distribute loot IF the LC isn‚Äôt bias or corrupt.  You can get loot on the people who perform and will perform with said loot and continue to progress while still distributing loot amongst everyone.  Yes, higher tier items are going to take most people much longer to get but that‚Äôs part of progression.  They‚Äôre going to gear up more important and consistent people first.  
---
My guild, for example, has a loot list on our discord with high value items that will be loot counciled then the rest of the loot goes to free roll main spec raiders.  If no raiders need the item then it goes to free roll main spec trial raiders.  It‚Äôs a fair and competitive system.  People do complain about the high value items but it is what it is... people will always complain about not getting a big ticket item, you can‚Äôt please everyone every week.
---
SMH these unobtainable beauty standards

Don't get yourself all in knots about it mate :D

D'uh. :D
---
or 'nissanmicra'. which is literally a player I encountered on an RP server... queues, man.
---
Nice, that's pretty dope. Brb leveling orc warrior!
---
Biggest issue is probably that there's insane competition for BRE on horde side. On ally it's a little less. Most people want it, but it's not game changing for PvE. I really want it for PvP, though.
---
imo DM is a perfect dungeon tutorial
---
19 is enough, try to stay focused, wait for tank to get aggro, not ninja pull some stuff, watch out of patsw behind you, especially after 1st boss
---
overall if you find exprienced group they will carry you, otherwise you prolly gona wipe here and there and learn some stuff
---
only dungeon from 55. unless you can do st/brd from 50

COULD HAVE

COULD OF DOESNT EXIST

I have to say, this was one of the main classes I was really looking hard at rolling in the long wait for release, as one of the classes I've always had a soft spot for- Warlock, Shaman, and Druid (I ended up rolling Shaman, love it) and I have a ton more problems with the Druid than I saw coming. I love the class fantasy to death, but it has a lot of issues I don't know how to deal with- from the perspective of a primarily pvp player.
---
It would be unfair and reductive but not unrealistic to call it the worst class in Vanilla. It requires more skill than I realistically think I can muster when juggling a bunch of other alts on the side, so my plan is to go healbot in battlegrounds which sounds like a ton of fun to me. But I've heard that Druid is the worst pvp healer in the game. Not that I really give a shit about minmax, but I'm curious why that is.
---
Not really what I was looking for though :/ I'm a nightelf so all helmets would have my ears poking out, so I've hidden helmets..
---
Alright, thanks :)
---
You can get inside DM from level 15 I think. Back in vanilla people woould pick @lvl 17 or even 16 if you were healer. Now most of people require lvl 19 or even 20 for it. Don't buy anything in the AH you'll be fine.
---
Should I disenchant or vendor items if i do not have enchanting?
---
Hey, i'm new to classic and just got a ranger bow (its a world drop i guess). Someone pm me and wanted to pay me 4g. It sounded like a scam.
---
How much is this thing worth? Wikki says something between 50-2000g.
---
Gotta admit that alliance starting zones looks way better than the horde.
---
According to what OP said, everything happened the exact same day.
---
Either their country's policemen are the most capable ever, or they really have nothing else to do. Looks fishy
---
Uhh, meaningful topic.
---
Not.
---
Hello Mr. /u/Pedeville, how has /r/the_donald been lately? I have to say it's been real sad not seeing their posts all over reddit since they got quarantined for being a shithole subreddit.
---
Im just going to say...
---
After actually reading into what exactly happened, and how Blizzard decided to handle it....
---
Almost has me reconsidering my WoW sub.
---
tailoring will shine in from Zulgurub till Naxx. dont drop it until that
---
That's not any different than alliance.
---
Thank you.
---
hit em up with a "no u".
---
Alliance have this same crap in STV too.
---
I have the one from the Loch Modan quest, lvl 15. Should be ok
---
n = 1.  I'm not convinced these stories of people unsubscribing are even real to be honest.  Great way to get some cheap pr.  Gonna just click disable replies on this one.  Stopped reading after your first line.
---
worsened models*
---
edited it for you :)
---
Everyone please report this, it will ruin any kind of town based PvP.
---
Check the items different classes use for raiding. For instance everyone uses fire resistance potions. Both big and small.
---
This is nothing without the capers &amp; tomatoes.
---
The amount of times I'm juuust out of taunt range as I chase a mob chasing a lock lol. It's why I like having a mage to slow everything so I can taunt later or more easily
---
You summed this up perfectly. I imagine most level headed adults feel the same way!
---
With free transfers some servers have changed quite a lot
---
That's what I usually do, and keep the window skip in case someone pulls or mobs resist.
---
you dont have to walk out and reset again. when you're teleported to the entrance it's already reset
---
the point about "thoughts and prayers" is that it does nothing to help the problem. Quitting is actually doing something albeit not a lot, but it is not equivalent.
---
I won‚Äôt call you full of shit.  I‚Äôll call you an edgy teenager.
---
How can you be level 56 after 2 breaks? By break do you mean going to bed for the evening or go to work for the day? I only just got 1 toon to level 30 :( Maybe i need to l2p
---
Uh, you got that backwards chief.
---
I totally agree, but I think they could tolerate one or two threads. I know that a shit ton of people are just virtue signaling, but I would like to read more information and get some facts without having to sift through the trash that is the megathread. Just my opinion.
---
F is for friends who do stuff together
---
Trinkets are mostly a situational thing, apart from the ones which give flat stats, so narrow your inquiry to what you're grinding and be more descriptive.
---
Yeah I kills mobs my lvl (40) slower than some people. But I also can heal myself for little to no downtime and insta pop into travel form and escape if shit goes sour. I just prefer versatility
---
Beating your wife and raping someone should get you fired in a normal workplace. In the nfl it doesn't matter, you can't compare it to a normal work situation at all.
---
At any time, when someone is going 1vs1 in WPvP, it's only because he got at least 10lvls highier than his opponent or when his opponent is trying to quest/kill a mob (and has half of his hp).
---
Is that it? I'm gonna grab one tonight
---
Absofreakinglutly. 100% agreed.
---
What chance? I'd argue it's easier to kill him kiting up to princess
---
Yep that's it
---
Do you think that real-world events could sometimes warrant effectively shutting down a source of entertainment for the sake of spreading awareness? If that's what people are discussing and upvoting in a community about classic wow, couldn't you say that it IS content related to the subreddit?
---
Just wanted to give an update.
---
Last night did a guild run to MC. With a few bis items I did do quite respectfully on the damage meters.
---
But...I did go through my mana far quicker than used to lol.
---
Try this guide, didn't do it myself, tho
---

---
Ask them to lifetap based on your mana, say that they'll stop getting topped up when youre at 50% or so.  I always tell my healers to tell me if I'm lifetapping too much. If they really won't stop then charge them for drinks/subject them to a healing strike.
---
There's plenty of things that weren't acceptable on private servers, that are (or will be) in classic. With such limited populations on ps, if you level a class you played the optimal spec or pvp spec. No fun allowed in end-game, just cookie-cutter stuff.
---
dps warrior pretty much destroys low lvl dungeons as soon as they have sweeping strikes + whirlwind
---
Yes you would get gear you don't need, unless you never click greed..
---
Huh? There‚Äôs plenty of healer loot from arena bosses.
---
Yea got mine some days ago.
---
Repost
---
For me it was run cath, go to feralas/tanaris, spam ZF, do hinterlands
---
Ok, so I have a few questions regarding Rogue. I'm about to hit 60 and I want to make some gold for the epic mount. I've seen some stealth runs in BRD with pickpocketing which seems fun. BUT, I wanna be somewhat viable to do 5-mans as well. With combat swords I'm almost always on top in terms of DPS. But is there a way to combine the two? I'm thinking of something like [this](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/rogue/-00501520200501502-500253102030101). Should be ok for 5-man and soloing?
---
Multiple weeks pf cleared raids.
---
Which addon shows you the HP bar and class above the tauren warrior's head at 42 seconds?
---
Is. Nothing too out of the ordinary there really.
---
This whole situation has honestly created a massive rift in our guild. We have people who have quit or are refusing to play until Blizz at least says something, anything. We also have a ton of people angry that so many have stopped playing after inviting them into Classic. This is a terrible situation all around and I really think its telling Blizz has said absolutely nothing up to this point. Shame on Blizzard honestly, this is a massive shitshow
---
Thicc tauren fem
---
one more reason to reroll gnome
---
were u very far away? Could be possible she cast second before the first hit.
---
By the time you get to tank strat i also think tanks should have some common sense
---
Yea, small 1-2 tap, rich 2-4
---
Soothe can resist, and some packs can spawn fire elementals which you can't run past if you have players below 60. You can always try and jump out the window if someone pulls.
---
Most warlocks like being at 70% health more than 100% since it means that healers don't waste mana overhealing, and that health is passively regenerating
---
Obviously not a pally, but I've tanked this guy just fine as Arms/Fury, so no defensive CD either, at level 58 with trash gear. This might be an issue if everyone in the group is under geared and the fight lasts forever, but if DPS are reasonably good at murdering the skeletons before they heal the boss and all ranged stay out of the aura, the healer should be able to power through the mortal strike on you.
---
One level at a time, I advise to start with lvl 41
---
Yes and no, the original was another episode, longer, better than this one. :)
---
Sorry, the link just seem to take me to a blank google page
---
I can speak for hunter and rogue.  Rogue is a blast to play, especially on a PvP server.  Having the ability to choose your engagements and sneak behind enemy lines is amazing.  Hunter is also a lot of fun, and easy once you get the hang of managing your pet.  In most dungeon groups I just auto-shot with my hunter and am usually on top of the damage meters.  Last night as a level 54 hunter I solo'd a quest that had a level 57 named mob with 2 level 55 escorts without dying.  Pulled one mob, burned it down, feign death and the other 2 reset.  Rinse and repeat - it was super satisfying for some reason.  A rogue could have done the same thing - sap one, burn one down, vanish.  Sap another, burn one down, then kill sap.  
---
Hunter leveling is easier.  Rogue is considered on the slower side of the leveling continuum due to no self heals.
---
lol.
---
Who is benefiting from PR? Anonymous internet individuals? Yeah, my business is really seeing an uptick in traffic and sales from all the karma I'm raking in. Fake internet points really translate into real world good feels for me and I love talking out my ass for fake approval. 
---
I'm so glad someone so intelligent was able to stop by and remind me how futile my values are.
---
Mighty fine explanation.
---
yes do so please
---
So has terrain exploiting to avoid guard aggro, but apparently that's punishable.  Never saw it punished 15 years ago.
---
If you don‚Äôt heal the lock, he will use drain life. If you do heal the lock, he will use shadow bolt. Shadow bolt does much more damage than drain life. If he‚Äôs casting it with your mana pool, it costs a lot less mana since healing spells typically heal much more in HP than they cost in MP.
---
So simple answer is, healing the tap converts your MP into DPS. It is the same as if you were casting lightning bolts - something you‚Äôd only do when there are no heals worth casting and your mana is full ish. Use the same logic for when you should heal the lock. And make sure the lock is eating and drinking out of combat (note he will tap down to 40% HP before sitting down, you don‚Äôt need to heal that).
---
Disenchanting is part of the enchanting profession so I'm not sure what you mean.
---
I mean, it‚Äôs pretty obvious that he doesn‚Äôt care to play either warlock nor paly if he‚Äôs saving up mount gold.
---
If you're a class that used in AoE dungeon farming (warr, prot pala, any healer, priest, mage, warlock) you can spam SM armory from 35-38 @ about 90 mins - 2 hours a level, then SM cath 38-42 @2 hours a level.
---
That'd put you @42 about ~12-15 hours from now. At that point it really doesn't matter how slow you get because you have 10 hours a level for the final 3 if you plan to do 40-45 like you said in another comment.
---
which ones were you listening to that stopped?
---
Horde typically names. In other news, water is wet.
---
Are you saying people who made mistakes don't deserve help? Why does AA exist?
---
Wait, so all you're skipping is 3 packs, or am I missing something?
---
Lax is the Los Angeles airport. 
---
Joke aside, I'm a jew in NYC and never seen it abbreviated lax. I've seen Gravlax spelled out or lox, but never lax. This is likely just an american vs the rest of the world thing. Even Yiddish uses lax. Lax makes more sense. Not sure where we got lox from.
---
Keep playing. I don't see any Chinese influence ruining Warcraft so why should I be denied my entertainment because of a political situation across the world that I have nothing to do with? 
---
If we keep going down this rabbit hole everything will be ruined and we won't be able to enjoy anything.
---
Vendor trash
---
This kind of nihilistic defeatism is exactly what we need if we're going to stir the public conscious to pay attention to important issues like this. Nothing gets people motivated to get out there and fix things like "doesnt change the fact its not our problem and we cant make a difference"
---
Eng is #1 profession in classic, this dude just trying to push people away from his farm route
---
It‚Äôs sad but eye-opening.  At the end of the day all the people virtue-signaling about the ocean or immigration or LBGTQ issues suddenly don‚Äôt care about human rights or morality when it personally inconveniences them in the slightest.
---
Sounds like it might be of interest to me. Tell me, can they command pets and hand out cookies that regenerate health to their friends? That's what I'm really looking for in a class.
---
You need enchanting to disenchant
---
I might have been the mage in your group :D
---
Now you get to spend even more time standing around doing nothing waiting on lockout to reset.  Cool.
---
Countdown to Classic just posted one the other day.
---
I see, so this is how the new apex map was made.
---
delete, cant even vendor
---
Given blizzards timetable they might fix it in a few years.
---
Its funny because deep prot is basicly worst tank of them all
---
thank you for this
---
Sorry my youtube Bugs on mobile. Here you go
---
https://youtu.be/FyKFF5eGUyM
---
Thank you for posting this. There were a few truly memorable moments in vanilla that still linger in my mind. And the first time I entered Dun Morogh is one of them. Approaching Ironforge from a distance was a breathtaking moment for me. I love that place and I always will.
---
Where do you live? Winter is awful, just rain and misery.
---
cameltotem is kinda funny, but I dislike everybody who  uses √≠ or √¨ etc, to much hassle inviting them in groups
---
Lowbie priest has to eat/drink after each fight I suppose. I thought it was funny.
---
&gt; If i was the tank i would go:
---
thank you for establishing that you don't play a tank but we knew that already.
---
And remember that our American media has totally taken China‚Äôs side in the trade war.  It‚Äôs starting to make a lot more sense why.
---
Need to use a macro that turns pet attack off before casting FD. Also, make need to ensure that there isn't a Serpent Sting on the target.
---
And that's all assuming OP was the only one to roll on those items. Lucky indeed!
---
It's alright. Definitely not in the 50-2000g bracket. ~6-10 at most.
---
low level priest constantly eating to regain health
---
np, thanks!
---
This is what I did. At that point I was well into playing fury/prot tank, but I essentially grinded BRD for like 6 levels (52-58), and mixed in UBRS from 57-60. There are so many quests throughout the dungeons in BR Mountain that I had no issue whatsoever leveling.
---
ESH
---
A quick message asking if he wanted you to (maybe explaining why) solves it. But why communicate and act social when we can just be salty. 
---
Hes also being a baby, bad pulls, ass pulls, extra pulls happen. Part of being a tank is doing your best to get control of the situation, especially if its 1 add, just taunt the thing
---
I'm a resto shaman.  There's literally nothing I ever wanted from arena for main spec.  There's a couple things I wouldn't mind for offspec, but I'm not gonna do arena runs for that.
---
He has to eat and drink to regain health after the pull. Gun shots because of deadmines....
---
Shadowpriests are the worsed never focus a target cause they need alone time on a mob to do 20dps more than the tank or so they say, resulting in insane threat on a dif mob.
---
*Laughs in demonic*
---
Good times...
---
I am assuming you have an alt that can DE. Check the DE price on auctioneer against the vendor price and determine on a case by case basis. There is no single answer that holds for every item
---
As a healer I'd like to point out that I think sweeping strikes is a warrior ability, not a rogue thing.
---
Voting is entirely different than getting an apology from a company that has no influence on Chinese policies though. 
---
China won‚Äôt be harmed by blacklisting Blizzard. 
---
It‚Äôs attacking the symptom, not the cause.
---
Eh boy, "je vais prendre un vrai dps". lol
---
I probably won‚Äôt, no.
---
I'm not sure why that happens, but that's also not 100%. Even according to addon description:
---
&gt; This addon scans the combat log for actions performed by enemy players.
---
Sometimes I can see an enemy player standing in plain sight, but the addon won't trigger until I over over them.
---
this right here would be reason enough for me to re-roll, keep it up guys and you might get a new server mate
---
&gt; This. in Vanilla wow 
---
how is it going in classic?
---
This isn't medieval france, g/l with that.
---
Bit late to the party but thanks again so much for doing this commission for me &lt;3 Glad to see most people seem to like it too :)
---
Just make a new char, lvl 20 isn't that hard to reach.
---
I like something like this: [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxT0sfMdxVxsoxo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxT0sfMdxVxsoxo)
---
(You can move a few points around ... the 2 points i have in improved shred are discretionary...maybe feline swiftness or maybe more threat or armor. sometimes people take a point out of HotW and put it in nature's grasp (balance) for pvp. etc. But it's something like that.)
---
Wildheart's spell damage bonus is kinda pitiful.
---
Also a weapon doesn't matter as much as you might think, if you came from a warrior or rogue background. Those classes have a ton of abilities that interact with your weapon. Just whacking stuff, even with stuff like Atiesh or Might of Menethil won't deal very much damage.
---
I think Moonkins were kinda intended to use their melee weapon and Omen of Clarity in place of a wand, but you'll find that casters very rarely, if ever, use their wand in a raiding environment.
---
If you wanna play moonkin, I'd say you're way better off getting more traditional caster loot. I've heard people theorize that [Blade of Eternal Darkness] (https://classic.wowhead.com/item=17780/blade-of-eternal-darkness) combined with spamming a low rank of Wrath might be a good way to sustain/regen mana, atleast until you can down a mana potion or rune to start firing off those big Starfires again. This method might be nice too, since solofarming Maraudon is a pretty solid way to make some gold, too.
---
Life tap typically reads "Steal X mana from your healer" so people tend to not heal a life tapping warlock
---
Just the same as it was before... Questing and Killing Mobs.
---
If you can take the pain of running the same dungeon over and over and over again on end. Then you could also consider dungeon farming. 
---
It has to be efficient to be fast than questing though so I usaully just advise questing and killing stuff
---
&gt; What an incredibly naive thing to say.
---
Is it though? Or is it just the convenient thing to refute?
---
I have always played pvp and I enjoy it, even being killed. What I‚Äôve never understood is camping quest givers or instance portals with a large group of over leveled buddies. There is a big difference in inconveniencing someone and making their playing time unplayable.
---
Don't be like hat one mage charging for water..
---
most likely somewhere where it snows in winter. warm winters are the worst. But a nice cold white winter where the snow stays in the ground? When you wake up in the morning look out of the window and it's all quiet and peaceful and under a layer of snow. That's the kind of winter you are looking at in OPs pic
---
It's the aesthetic that is important.   Diablo III has better graphics than Diablo II, but Diablo II looks infinitely better in my eyes because of the art direction itself.  
---
Everquest had that good aesthetic, even if the graphics were garbage.  Hoping Pantheon has the same. Pls no EQ2 plastic.
---
&gt; I'm sorry but this addon is way more damaging to the game than an LFG addon
---
Is it? I a VERY similar addon in retail classic called "Punkbusters" and it added another window to your social tab called Punks and would show you the name of all Alliance close along with co-ordinates that you saw them. You could add a player to your "punks" and you would get a big audio and visual notification when near a player on your Punklist.
---
No Rag, rets is the joke i think
---
He copy paste it to ban Chinese people.
---
If a chinese ISP detects that raw text in your "internet funnel", you'll get banned from internet from x time etc...
---
well maybe one ragert
---
It is not about you giving up your entertainment, it is about not supporting or giving money to a company that is traitorous to the very foundation of our being as Americans (and any other western country that values freedom, equality and democracy).
---
And yes, what Blizzard is doing - for profit or not - is just that: treason.
---
i was ~in the centre of the whole pit while she was top center. Interesting thought tho'. Didn't think about that yet.
---
What addon is this btw?
---
Cons
---
- Can't see
---
- Doesn't keep water out when upside down
---
- Can't breathe
---
- Had to cut horns off
---
Pros
---
- Funny af
---
I try to not use feint (even though I do use it) because I want to limit the amount of enegy used on non-dmg abilities!
---
But ultimately control &gt; dps which more folks need to embrace!
---
Missed an opportunity by not calling it 'The Daily Delight'. &lt;\_&lt;
---
its 7248g on my realm
---
in 2005 I used to farm SM and RFD on my rogue - go in, kill the easy bosses, disenchant their stuff into small radiant shards to sell (or just vendor it), loot any chests.
---
I have no idea if this was a good strategy or not. :)
---
 I have a lore related question, hope I can find answers here: I'm trying to figure out what eu pvp classic realm has a name that has the most to do with Death Knights because that's where I wanna roll a warrior on. I googled all of those realm names and I found 2 that had something to do with DKs according to Wiki and some other sites:
---
1.) Ashbringer. So Ashbringer is a weapon which shares its name with its original wielder Alexandros Mograine who was then betrayed and murdered by his son Renault and then was resurrected as a Death Knight, the story goes something like that.
---
2.) Gandling. Last boss in Scholomance but according to wiki "*He teaches students how to raise the dead in the* Lich King\*‚Äôs name."\* I don't know if this means raising Death Knights, please enlighten me about it.
---
But ultimately what I wanna know is which eu classic wow pvp realm name has the most to do with Death Knights. Hope someone can help me. Looking forward to the answers! Thank you!
---
You dont go fury til what? BWL?
---
Dw fury at least.
---
That is if you are Horde ofc - right?
---
As a priest I dont mind rolling a renew on them, but other than that I also just let them get on with it. If the fight is over and I'm about 90% of more mana, then I will stick a greater heal on them, but that would be it. If they life tap during fights I dont do anything about it. If I heal them and the tank dies as I'm out of mana then thats on me, so I leave them to it. if they pull too much aggro and die then thats on them.
---
That's true! You have individual rights and freedoms free from over reaching government bodies! It's pretty nice.
---
It's interesting, to me, that you say this though:
---
"...organizations I respect will probably continue to cater to China."
---
If these companies continue to bend over for Chinese interests, what is the turning point for your respect for them?
---
I'm genuinely curious, not trying to be a dick.
---
You can change this in the bartender addon options. Don't remember exactly what it's called, but it's something like "stance toggle" or "bar switch". You can find it if you open options and click on the specific bar you want to change.
---
As a healer, when I see a non tank pull, I wait to see if the tank engages.  If they don't, I let the person die.  If they do, I start healing.  In the future, I recommend holding back.  That's actually the route I prefer, so that person dies and hopefully learns their lesson without wiping the group.
---
Man, pretty much every airline. I don't know if that is possible for the airlines. But not a problem for most of the others since I don't buy designer clothes/shoes nor watch sports. Disney is the biggest one, and I'm surprised this website didn't mention how they tried to censor out finn from the force awakens.
---
Yes they patrol/fly really fast and cast healing spells, so you got to be careful with pulling them. If you hit them and then move around the corner (line-of-sight) they will act like 'melee-units' like all mage-mobs do when you pull them this way (same effect as silence).
---
I saw an addon on cdew stream today that showed last loot roll and who had won it. Anyone know the name?
---
Not yet, anyway...
---
Lots of people hate engineering because of this.  They chose engineering as a profession because so many "guides" detailed it as necessary to be competitive.
---
Depends on your class but a leveling guide + dungeons is probably good.
---
For your information:  
---
I play a warrior, currently wearing almost only mail and leather, no negative reputation in the community.
---
You were wrong.
---
Before abandoning, use Beast Lore on a best to check if it's tameable or not.
---
Keanu found some new armour. Keanu greaves

*Chairman
---
Not the baby imo.
---
I always play warrior so Im tanking all my runs. As long as someone pulls 1 mob (not more) to me I dont care.
---
However, if someone pulls a pack its annoying. Also annoying if the mob isnt pulled to me so I have to chase it.
---
Still wouldnt let the group die though.
---
have we become /r/classicwowcirclejerk? this is one of the most mundane things in the game.
---
Yeah, that‚Äôs from a horde perspective
---
I mean most people are gonna be doing specific so it‚Äôs just like advertising for ubrs or lbrs, you don‚Äôt say lfg black rock spire.
---
It‚Äôll be lfg dmw, dmn, or dme
---
Wheres the #nochanges? All Ur gear pieces match.....
---
I think what you are wanting to play is spellret :)
---
Bet this was in Kargath
---
Which *A* is true and *B* is far from what he said.
---
Check your ah for prices but the big one is usually transmute undeath to water. 24h cd and ~10g each time

Darkshore
---
Or it just causes people to log off. Camping zones is one thing, camping towns is another
---
I've recruited 56+ for my lava runs, and that seems to be just fine.
---
Undead have some pretty cool lore, and the best pvp racial
---
This is awesome. Great work. 
---
If only there were cool robes like that in-game :&lt;
---
I can see reasoning behind this, plus Vanish clears all threat as you mentioned. But glad you see my point anyway!
---
in vanilla I was playing a paladin and a druid jumped me in EPL...I fought him for like 10 minutes then asked my wife to fly out from ironforge to kill him for me. We were still fighting when she got there...
---
Imagine if the crowd starts chanting liberate Hong Kong.
---
If they're smart, they're only tapping when they're safe, so just leave them and heal them normally, nothing extra. They can drain life too if they're feeling nervous.
---
More like ‚Äúwhen your dungeon group pulls the next group before the healer is done drinking‚Äù
---
How is sticking your hand up when a taxi drives by in any way communication?

Ok then.
---
Druids are great healers
---
Honestly the current classic version is the worst of all versions that I played. Sad that some two man shows runned pservers better than a billion dollar company.
---
Thinking about all of this , it seems a lot of trouble to protect the Chinese gold farmer's business model.
---
Just the fact that I need a website to actually check if it is an upgrade or not, is enough for me to turn around.
---
It sucks.
---
Nah i just don't care enough to quit playing. And most people riding the 'outrage-train' will resub in a week anyway. The few that remain unsubbed don't make big enough of a difference.
---
/me laughs in German
---
This was also highlighted during the streamer beta but apparently blizzard think's this is good and left it in there.

Something like this will be more than enough. https://www.newegg.com/global/uk-en/abs-computer-technologies-rogue-se-ali329/p/N82E16883102794  hope the link works.

Shame on you picking on the handicapped.
---
&gt;  warriors are spiky AF.
---
they're doing it wrong
---
The amount of threads that are just tanks complaining is shocking. Stop being such primadonnas. Most PUGs have shitty players in, deal with it, everyone else has to.
---
I'm not sure where this idea came from, but every druid I've healed in a dungeon has taken massive damage.  They have the health to pull it off most of the time, but they're nowhere near as easy as a properly geared/specced warrior.  The problem isn't warrior tanks, but people pushing it with specs they don't have the gear to be tanking in.  Eventually, with enough gear, you can tank that way.  Not as a fresh 60 though.

Keanu has autism. Keanu REEEEES!
---
What if Mankrik was the one that beat her and he didn't expect you to ever find her
---
I'm not sure who was more exasperated in the end, the meter-centric DPS you tried to teach a lesson, the two other DPS or the healer trying to keep people alive.
---
I'd understand if you whispered the healer to stop healing him (which gets the job done) but I disapprove of letting the entire group wipe because of one idiot. That doesn't make you look much better than the DPS.
---
As a rogue, I only do that if I have every expectation that I can handle tanking it myself.  Or at least keep it chained stunned until everything else is dead.
---
Thanks! I didn‚Äôt realize the frustration of tanks because I group with people I know/have grouped before 90% of the time...
---
If I‚Äôm farming BiS I‚Äôll be making the group. If I don‚Äôt need the dungeon it‚Äôll be 5g each! You get a tank and the pleasure of my company ;)
---
Blast from the past. I remember doing this in vanilla. Thanks for the reminder!
---
If he told you to pull, it's all good. If you pull without asking or at least saying you are going to, you are the idiot.
---
So few DAOC players around these days. We were on Albion, and admittedly we didn't have amazing scenery.
---
Why would you need a stack of 5 every week for rag on farm?
---
I'm assuming he lives somewhere snowy...
---
Spirit tends to be king for priests assuming u are soloing since you get double after a killing blow. Stacking spirit everywhere + keeping up with wands makes priest a top 3 leveler
---
There it is, the boomer mentality. ‚ÄúI got mine so fuck you‚Äù
---
You're fine. I was tanking ragnaros last night. The main thing about druid tank is you need to farm MCPs from gnomer so the prep for raids is a little longer than other classes but not by much. Also most of your BiS comes from dungeons not raids in this phase so take the time to actually get it first. Get Warden Staff asap also before the price goes up.
---
Every guild should have a good druid tank- when stuff is on farm there will be no threat ceiling for dps since druids have the best single target threat ingame with MCP while remaining tanky. Main downside is they take 10-20% more damage than wars but the tradeoff is way higher threat gen and bring innervate/brez + decurse for single tank fights.
---
Slightly faster sure but not that much faster. Still thanks for sharing.
---
When somethings been out for 15 years it makes it easier.
---
Oh, so you manually scan the combat log while questing and then extract neatly organized information from it? I'm an android too.
---
Also where does it say a player's class and level in the combat log, if that player is friendly or opposite faction?
---
Oh im pretty sure most people are paying attention to important issue like hong kong, its been in the news and everywhere on reddit since they started protesting in march.  
---
And what have you done to help hong kong in any way?
---
Charge, rend, go Berserker, and I just sit on autos til:
---
W.w. &gt; bloodlust &gt; heroic strike/cleave dump rage 
---
The damage is super high, and in dungeons or raids you essentially sit in berserker the whole time. Gets more fun the higher hit % from gear.
---
Arms is a waste of time because nobody that actually raids wants M.S. as a debuff and the damage IS higher in fury, especially at end levels.
---
Go get a blood test and see for yourself. I‚Äôm just looking out for you.
---
Not true, there are casuals in both versions, and in all honestly a lot of your "better players" you mentioned stay in retail for the challenge that vanilla can't offer
---
&gt; And we are quickly learning which base they value more. 
---
I'd say it's more about which is the practical choice imo. Western governments are not going to act against China over this, full stop. Western businesses are not going to lock themselves out of the ever-growing Chinese market, because it would doom their company long-term, assuming China does not collapse. Some western customers will boycott yes, but it's not remotely close to the same ballpark. There's no choice here, business-wise, because the choices are on wildly different levels of consequence.
---
Dang I sometimes do something like this, reading on my second monitor or watching a movie, seeing a horde approach and I‚Äòm like I dare you to hit me.

Traitors and lapdogs, each and every one of them.

I wish it were darker. I love the night scenes too, but night isn‚Äôt a challenge. You can still see everything without a light source. I think it would be much cooler with a much darker night.

This is one of the main reasons why I loved WoW when I started in high school and the main reason why I love it again after coming back for Classic; I still can't find an MMORPG with the same atmosphere.
---
The ambient music as I'm grinding ice claw bears, the drums as I walk into Ironforge, the detail in a random tower that I stumble across in Elwynn Forest. The world is so meticulously crafted that I get lost in it.

I'm on a server where horde are the minority for some reason. Ganked by multiple ?? Alliance regularly in STV :(

Pass lead to the person who said to invite the tank.
---
I'm wondering which part of the company made the decision, was it Blizzard Taiwan?
---
Keep your points in BM and work down to aimed shot. Having a beefy pet while doing solo stuff is very nice.
---
Yeah for so early in the launch. I‚Äôm still trying to get a staff and using DM as a way to make people drop the price!
---
That may be true for you, but as a healer, I see very few locks that eat food in dungeons.  I guess I have a different mentality as well, because it kind of seems like the obvious choice.
---
It just reads the combat log. What can you can about that.
---
People loading in near you have their auras applied to them, and that's loggable
---
That‚Äôs awesome
---
Actually, I was playing an Elemental Shaman and wondering if I would even be allowed to roll on my own class set since I just assumed that most consider Restoration the 'main spec' of a Shaman.
---
Mobs usually target me if I burst out a lot of dmg at once.. Which means that my pet holds aggro only if I auto attack and maybe sting it or something like that
---
Tipsout is doing a duel tournament, he has a discord for it [Classic Dueler's League Discord](https://discord.gg/aPqhmm3)
---
There‚Äôs a 35 elite golem named Stitches that patrols the roads in duskwood. Drops an offhand with no stats except for 50 or 60 armor
---
This is always the case. Elites drop more cloth, more greys, more silver, better chances at greens/blues/purps
---
If you think money, influence and public opinion have no influence in politics then I can see how the rest makes sense to you.
---
In reality, yes the effect is small but likely exists. For a more extreme example do you also think the Vietnam protests had no influence at the time?
---
Imagine your a warlock just done killing that mob and you are mounting up to go to the next area, evil montage mage spots you mounting zooms over with a blink counterspell and you are now unable to use most of your toolkit to defend yourself for the first 8 seconds of the fight.  
---
basically mounting via a spell makes you slightly more vulnerable, but its very niche.
---
"The tanks and healers who put in most of the effort are really only there for DPS and PvP gear. Tanks and Healers usually just see getting tanking and healing upgrades as (cool, but.... I wanted X, Y or Z item instead)." 
---
read that again. where did I say they weren't?
---
if only people listened to their world history class..
---
If I have a shadow priest, my mana tends to be a lot better, and I'll let the lock know they can tap more.  In a typical group though I only get to them after drinking, and after ensuring the tanks health is ok.

---
Just to add onto your point about explaining to your group. Remember, its difficult to convey your tone in text, so think about how your communicating to the group. If you come across as aggressive that's going put people on the defensive and make things worse. Try explaining what you need and why, rather than demand they do something.

All the hobbits, minus Sam, should have been rogues.

I didnt test the latest rank obtained with 34 as I havent visited a trainer between 32 to almost 36 and just stopped using SoR anyway. But before 34 with verigans my max rank sor hit for \~15-16 without jotc, \~22-25 with jotc, maybe it was slightly higher than that, but I definitely never had it go near 30. I also dont have sanctity aura nor improved sotr.
---
And with my 1.6 speed tanking weapon my max rank sotr (before 34) hit for \~8-9 without jotc, which was still laughable and worse compared to the \~50-60 (and 100+ crits) I got from soc procs with around \~20% proc chance, and I always thought something about that seems very wrong.

If you're farming for a specific drop on a boss, I can see why you'd want do this and speed things up, but I'm personally a fan of clearing for the chance (albeit low) at some tasty BoEs

Oh yeah going way out of your way to obstruct someone is, I guess, somewhat of a dick move. But people are free to spent their time as they want.
---
We didn‚Äôt have marks the first times I did MC iirc, which made garr a nightmare. And peoples computer can handle it better which means fewer geddon bombs. Also general spec/gear knowledge after 15 years
---
Oh its beautiful..
---
Should have played a Holy Priest  
---
"MOM YOU DONT UNDERSTAND IM A HOLY PRIEST I FIGHT THE DEMONS JUST LIKE YOU DO AT THERAPY"
---
My experience so far is that mages have been a nightmare when tanking. Just slamming that Blizzard hotkey the second I pull a pack toward me, AoEing everything, even 2 mob pulls, etc.
---
well that escalated quickly
---
The backlash we're seeing is on a completely new scale. You would think that from the response Blizzard is getting, that they personally went to this guy's house, beat him, burned his house down, killed his family, and then drowned some puppies. I mean sure what they did was wrong, but it's nowhere near as bad as everyone is pretending it is. People need to calm down.
---
No travel form, no blink, no sprint. Sounds like an awful bank alt.
---
Yes it has helped a lot and also gives me that edge in PvP and when tanking.
---
I always feel sorry for the horde raids camping and precadting the entrance of BRD. How hard has been life to you? I am really sorry you didn't get the love you deserved and have to group with other 9 60s to farm lvl 52 for no honor to prove your worth. I seriously sympathize.
---
Oh yea, sorry, that waa the inferno one.
---
Imagine wanting to be your whole self both in real life and online
---
Seems to be realm dependant, everyone on my server agrees allies are the pack animals but then I hear about other realms where it‚Äôs the exact opposite.
---
You can literally do the same thing as this addon with a screen capture tools and some code to parse part of a picture, you don't even need to have the code in the game. There is no way to stop information parsing
---
&gt; People do it for the fun and challenge.
---
No one does it for the "challenge," they do it because it makes everything easier.  People aren't paying 5x extra for a hard mode.  You're just making shit up.
---
&gt; I guess you can't see so well anymore since they lost their shit and got modded on so many comments.
---
"He didn't actually say what I'm claiming he did, so I'll just say it got modded"
---
&gt; Repeatedly asked me if he casts fireball and 5 other people cast fireball who would do more damage. As if that was the entirety of wow.
---
Probably because he's pointing out that five people do more damage than one, which is why people have a problem with multiboxing. You can one-shot people with one spell, which isn't how the game was meant to be played.
---
Probably why all of your replies here have been downvoted to shit too, because you somehow don't understand this very simple concept.
---
From the looks of it you've lost your shit quite a bit too.
---
DD represent!!! I've seen you in LFG, glad to see you're making this!!!
---
If you ever need help with the paper, Sower would be willing to help.

There was also a Defias attack in BB last night. Very few survived. Just sounded like a fun side story.
---
I love how the two onlookers are in the Guild &lt;Confused&gt; lol.
---
;\_;
---
Also, they did it half assed.
---
someone willing to name a character fuccnut- does not get to play with me, sorry about that if you identify as a fuccnut
---
&gt;They most certainly expect it *during a football game*.
---
That expectation is precisely what gives these protests their power, and it is the exact reason that public events like football games or livestreamed video game tournaments are the ideal avenue for protest. For one thing, there is an audience there which is already paying attention. Further, depending on how the object of protest connects to the event where the protest is being carried out, that audience might be a better target for effective protest than the general population. And finally, because that audience is not expecting a political message to "pollute" their entertainment, they are going to be made more uncomfortable and feel more "put on the spot" by the protest.  
---
That discomfort is what protests need to actually change people's minds and behavior. Nobody thinks critically about their way of life when they are comfortable and constantly receive affirmation that what they're doing is okay. That's why protesters absolutely need to get in people's faces and make them uncomfortable, even if they don't like it because it makes them feel bad.
---
The fact that employers have an expectation that employees will keep their politics to themselves and have the power to punish employees that violate that expectation is really neither here nor there. When someone gets fired for speaking up, their first amendment rights aren't being violated, but that doesn't mean that the public has to look at the situation and agree that the firing was justified. In fact, speaking up in "unacceptable" settings and then accepting the consequences as they come has been a hallmark of some of the most effective modern leaders of protest such as Gandhi and MLK Jr.
---
It is not a druid. It is a Warrior and their mount.
---
I wouldn't mind doing him. He's hot!
---
The path that warrior takes annoys me.
---
Yea that's what I was afraid of with hard switching to MM.

1% yellow for humans all you can get for whites that are probably 50-60% of your total dmg in a slice and dice combat build.

You want to run deep holy for your spec with nothing in protecting and the rest of your points in the Ret tree to pick up seal of command and eye for an eye.
---
The goal is to yeet people with divine favor after dropping crusade on them and getting judgment back up, make sure you try and line up spell power buffs if you can like lightforge procs and you can easily 60%-0% anyone that‚Äôs not a tank.
---
Granted the gear above listed isn‚Äôt available right now, but it‚Äôs a template for what you should be looking for.
---
This build combination will give you decent sustain damage while providing you near PoM Pyro levels of burst every 2 minutes once you gear out.
---
In phase 1-2 it‚Äôll be a little slow, but you still deal tremendous amounts of damage passively and burst.

(Ref. 6/8 lightforge paladin using Obsidian Edge Blade for PvP)

Traitorous scum.

It comes with Dominos, which is the Actionbars addon im using.

That's a fair fight though.... the people questing near you. I lettem kill their mobs and then I engage. That's fair IMO.
---
Running around one shotting people 40 levels below you? Beyond lame.
---
yep, I won't kill druids on sight, but I'll kill those funny looking panther things that have the weird mob AI
---
What a bunch of immature , unrealistic kids.
---
Blizzard did things ABSOLUTELY right, you fellas are just making out assumptions, theories , conspiracies. They didn't support China in their statement, period. They punished a player for bringing politics where they don't belong too, on a stream with childs watching. The casters covered their face and pushed Blitzchung to do his stuff, they are even guiltier. Don't jfc make me laugh, China is just the other side of the Coin of the capitalist world. You bunch of USA hypocrites. Your country is much worse since centuries and you know it.
---
Cancelling your sub won't have any effect , you are a mere drop of water in the sea.

I can't figure out if I should go [Moonglow build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/51000533120013--505103105115) or [Swiftmend build](https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/druid/500005131--505203105315051) for healing... I'm in a raiding guild that has everything on farm and I have been using HOTW spec so far, but now I'm switching to pure healing in order to help my chances of getting a raid spot, since we are quite a lot of people who want to raid -\_-
---
Human /silly
---
wow bro you sure showed them! imagine intentionally sabotaging your group and wasting peoples time all because you have a stick up your ass and cant swallow your pride.
---
Horde do have some advantages that ally don't, for example they have a quest to get one of the best fishing rods and alliance can't get it. 
---
Its balenced but not in exactly the same way, I personally think it helps to show that both factions have different cultures which is something retail lost.
---
I don't know why you give a shit what happens on the other side of the world. Must be the american in you.
---
Dark souls taught me how to honorably duel and when the perfect time is to betray that trust and strike.
---
Eh, you start a war you guarantee a battle. I'll admit, at least the player you killed wasn't gray to you.
---
I mean they are saying it's anti-gay players that are reporting this. But I can see their name easily being taken the wrong way. "Gay Boys" is something that can easily be taken as a name ridiculing homosexuals.
---
Could not disagree more. People have no sense of what's going on. When I play dps instead of tanking I don't need marks. I attack the highest priority targets. If I'm on a target and it is dying slowly, I quickly realize I'm not on the same target as the other dps and switch so I don't pull aggro. Or you know, I just wait 2 seconds to see what the tank is hitting. Pretty basic stuff but most people can't seem to grasp basic anything.
---
Lmao, if that was me, I‚Äôd kill y‚Äôall and gtfo
---
define quick
---
Can it? I've never been 1on1ed by a horde. They always gank in group or 10levels above you.
---
Raising the dead typically just means as mindless scourge.
---
Death Knights are typically very powerful individuals who have been raised by high ranking scourge (such as liches) to be either elite guards or commanders of the general scourge forces.
---
Other relevant scourge names might be Amnemar. He's the lich ambassador sent to Razorfen Downs to 'convert' the Quillboar.
---
Patchwerk is, lorewise, one of the strongest abominations in the game.
---
NA is much better off with Death Knight named servers, with Blameux being named directly after a fairly prevalent Death Knight.
---
No it doesn't at all, I was going with OPs wording
---
Name connected to DKs? I don't know... How about DARION EFFIN' MOGRAINE?!
---
Never trust an UD rogue. if he was going to be nice, he wouldn't be an UD rogue
---
It does work like that (literally always has too)
---
&gt; What new information have we learned that made us, well, better gamers?
---
I think the main difference is that the non-gamers have other social media today. It's not that we got that much better, the difference is that the majority of our MC friends from back then are on facebook today.
---
Level 18.  
---
Rule of thumb - be in 3 level from last boss.  
---
Van Clef is level 21, so 18+ is ok.
---
Did they really not think that ‚ÄúGAY BOYS‚Äù wouldn‚Äôt be banned? 
---
Most of the people that reported probably thought it was just a bad taste joke.
---
Humans doesn't matter. You already have 305 weapon skill from being combat.
---
Probably because five people do more damage than one, which is why people have a problem with multiboxing. You can one-shot people with one spell, which isn't how the game was meant to be played.
---
Probably why all of your replies here have been downvoted too, because you somehow don't understand this very simple concept.
---
Thank you! ‚ù§Ô∏è

IF
---
either way which location you set as your HS, IF or Menethil, you're gonna pay gryphons to take you somewhere, so just put it somewhere convenient where you travel most often to (i.e. bank, AH, vendor, class trainer, profession trainer...)
---
Ashbringer is really loosely related to DKs, as undead Mograine never uses Ashbringer, as it was corrupted and taken by the Horsemen of Naxxramas where you can loot it.
---
Gandling is a necromancer, but he is very much alive himself. Raising the dead is a Cult of the Damned thing overall, and, eventhough the DK are especially proficient in necromancy, all living necromancers are also able to do so.
---
So, either you can go on Mograine, which is the name of a death knight (and a scarlet commander aswell), or one of the 2 you mentioned.
---
Not as ridiculous as someone not valuing freedom and democracy enough to not play a 15 year old mediocre MMO.
---
You truly are pathetic, my friend.
---
I switched MM at 60. BM was too good for questing to drop but now that I'm almost exclusively running dungeons, Trueshot Aura is a must-have
---
I agree. And I feel bad about that. 
---
The more these people try to justify, accuse, and raise the bar... It's so gross to me. There's a lot of games out there. I can't see holding on to a fifteen year old game that is still polygon hell in retail for the sake of... Anything. And I realise that is absolutely part of the problem, my perspective is too different. Even trying to ask questions to better understand the other side I can't elicit straight answers or related answers. 
---
I'm running out of juice for this. There's a thread going on elsewhere about ways protesters in HK can be helped by people not in the country and that is far more worth it to me.
---
Ah nice I'll check it out
---
I agree, but the loot thrown at you is worthless low gear good for selling or scrapping only
---
We go online to slay Internet dragons.  We go online to be pink haired female gnomes even when we‚Äôre 6 feet tall brown haired men.  The entire world is a fantasy world.  Why does your sexuality need to be explicitly thrown out on display there?  I‚Äôve never cared to ask if the warrior leading my raid was gay or not all that matters is that he can hold aggro.
---
In their own game? I do not think the can sue themselves, but then might.
---
I'd disagree that's what the game is about but you do you bud. 
---
(while we're playing this game tho - Tauren master race)
---
Use swing timer to start casting slam. I was able to do slam between auto attacks. Never played private servers I just didn't have much abilities before lvl 40 so I figured myself that it's the best rotation in boss fight for dps warrior.
---
It's only toxic if you spend all day on here looking at people complaining about it being toxic. It's actually quite nice üòÅ
---
Mages are just Mr. Freeze from Batman
---
It doesn't take weeks of trying to get it to know the name, just actually caring what they are called. 
---
And even +10s are throwaway loot outside of alts at this point honestly.
---
That works on boss fights the best, where you're far more likely to draw aggro due to your crits and insane burst damage.
---
On random mobs, feint is not going to work as well because the majority of tanks that I have seen are TERRIBLE at holding threat on multiple enemies, that's partially due to vanilla mechanics and AoE threat not being a thing for Warriors, but also due to people just not playing properly, like spamming demo shout instead of conserving rage to thunderclap and SA spam.
---
34 warrior here.
---
How do I tank? I "tanked" a little in DM.... But now in SM It seems like I've completely forgot how to do it.
---
What's the standard rotation?
---
&gt; Western markets are too small to actually have an impact.   
---
   
---
(Asia is only 13% of Blizzard's market. The Americas alone account for over half of their earnings.)[https://i.redd.it/2rc3ds53qhr31.gif]
---
Yeah but there's also a ton of ESL players who wouldn't recognize the word pint unless they're familiar with American or British television or similar.
---
Its to stop people from trying to impersonate the company or say a GM to scam people.
---
I tend to leave other druids alone, but more often than not, NE druids start shit with me.  Then it‚Äôs a cat and cat game for a hour as we going around looking for the stealthed druid.

Don't think he is, Alliance wont move out of Stormwind unless they are a group of ATLEAST 3
---
Pre-40, I hamstrung and rended every target I fought. Definitely worth the chance to proc overpower.
---
Holy shit! What the fuck
---
Oh wow misread that one thought it was 2% hit üòê I‚Äôm not having issues with 5% then
---
Blizzard would have never made a proper statement. They want to have it both way. They want players to think the only reason they did this is because they don't want politics on the stream, and also want that the chinese think they are anti hong kong. If they made a statement their true intent would show.
---
You want a chineese gold seller running around selling gold with nicname blizzard? Probably not.
---
Woahh there. First of all I don't really consider reddit social media. Its more like a forum. I consider social media tweeting directly to people. Its a bit like calling someones personal phone for their attention so they can help you. Talking on reddit anonymously is in no way even close to being similar to that.
---
I think you need to step out of your mindset and think about what you're wanting. You're playing a video game, and a person in the video game you're playing breaks the rules. The game you're playing (and paying for) has individuals who are on payroll to help you with such problems. You're wanting to bypass that system because you're impatient and directly message people on twitter, and you want to rally support behind your cause to basically 'force' a real human being to help you, ahead of all of the other thousands of people who have similar problems but are using the actual services provided for it.
---
HOW the FUCK can you not see this as a bad practice?
---
There is  auction house addons that you can do bid and buyout sniper on. It constantly searches the AH and as soon as something comes up which has a higher average sell price it shows up there and you buyout with a click or two. Doesn't necessarily have to be a not

I‚Äôm on mobile so getting into the nitty gritty of the parse is pretty tedious. How much do you prioritize threat/DPS pieces? Are you MCPing for these fights? What kind of consumes and buffs are you rocking?

in IF i've always used the one next to the auction house.

And all was silent.

That make sense, thanks.

Sounds like you where grouping with one of those guys who like to blame others for mistakes they've done themselves.

Just ignore them, you have a list in-game for this sole purpose.

I think you just nailed the point where capitalism and politics collide. Or at least, one of them.

And it‚Äôs an interesting and complex crucible. Capitalism and democracy have been highly celebrated by, among others, the US very loudly. But this situation squares both boldly against each other and without writing an essay, I‚Äôm guessing US businesses don‚Äôt give a shit about country over shareholders.
---
And let‚Äôs remember - the Chinese playerbase for wow is enormous. And tencent owns 5% of activision blizzard. Their business interests, to me, seem pretty clear. 
---
Pretty fucked up if you ask me.
---
Gnomes can't be priests. He's just wearing g the +1int robe
---
You started it. What's YOUR point?
---
It is only newsworthy because they are trying to cash in on the current outrage at blizzard.
---
I'd probably go Moonglow, purely to make soloplay easier. I think they're both just specialized in different kinds of healing.
---
Nice to see that 15 years later, the demographic hasn't' changed a bit.
---
That's the thing with measurable vs non measurable factors, if you go for numbers they will never be enough unless you are literally no1, but if you take joy in completely arbitrary/personal stuff then you can quite frankly do whatever you want.
---
It's in Golakka hot springs. I forget which one exactly, and I'm only level 45 so not quite high enough to explore yet. But I think it's the deepest water in classic WoW. You can't swim to the bottom unless you're undead or have water breathing.
---
What portal in IF?
---
Anyway, the innkeeper is close to bank and AH.
---
im friendly to alliance since i wanna be a part of their world, them hating me for no reason though fits perfectly to my undead background. thats why im a horde, to settle in and fend off alliance scum
---
Hey settle down okay?
---
You are right, thanks.
---
You sound like a terrible healer. Why would you let a party member die and slow the group down because you have some odd rule?
---
Gnomes can't be priests. He's just wearing the +1int robe
---
But - if a mob damages you, then you are killed in pvp, you still take durability damage correct? I only ask because I have had infinite joy in doing this to people lately.
---
Understanding hit tables, itemization, being able to find anything in the game‚Äôs database within seconds, macros and keybinds. Hardware and addon upgrades help too.
---
+10s are just as fast as getting you geared. If you're lucky with your war forges and titan forges that is. Which in intself makes the retail loot even more insignificant at this point.
---
"There is no low (they) won't stoop to,"
---
Such as submitting articles and photos of their victories in a timely manner.  The lowest stoop of all!
---
lolwut what kinda name is that haha
---
I can only speak for myself.
---
Game design is not fair in Vanilla WoW.  
---
Druids were eventually made to be equal to Prot Warriors and Paladins in later expansions, but in Classic / Vanilla WoW the most they can aspire to is Offtank in raids.  Plate &amp; Shield classes simply have far more damage mitigation tools and game mechanics working in their favor.
---
Can anyone help with kromzar??
---
"I'm so good, look at me kill 2 half dead/oom players in combat with NPCs" - cheeky gank
---
yet not on revered?
---
I‚Äôm curious about this as well.
---
check youtube. the best alliance pvper!
---
The only restriction for alliance is only dwarves and gnomes can ride mechanostriders, everything else works.
---
It means if you pick such a name you're not very mature. Hence any language including that of the name is too mature for you.
---
Et voila.
---
And you have totems and shocks to weave in there too. Pally is auto attack with SoC and judge/refresh of you have mana
---
I names  character free Hongkong. I Will miss you all
---
it will all depend on your server, i would say anywhere from 50-200g would be an ok price, right now, higher in the future i think,  just not an item i would ever buy.
---
It's definitely not a good look for them in the wake of the Hong Kong controversy. But it's still a disappointing thing to see
---
Str and agi on weapon come out at the same time, and agi is generally better for both cat and bear.
---
But yeah, agi enchants basically.
---
They aren‚Äôt harder to gear when it comes to raid drops though.  More often than not, you‚Äôll be the only one trying to get non-set piece leather epics.  Accessories and trinkets are another story, but it‚Äôs generally easier to get though P1 raiding BIS gearing.
---
There‚Äôs a prison run and a prison xp farm people might get confused about.
---
There‚Äôs a mother/son duo that play in the clan I‚Äôm in. The clan is called the banished
---
&gt;I‚Äôve been dragged and quartered for saying classic wow is a superior game by people who play classic over retail.
---
While it is up to ones preference, I would tend to agree that claiming it is superior is a bit... harsh, maybe?  
---
I mean, I like Classic (not playing anymore due to this shit show though) more than retail, but not because classic is simply "superior" but more that it aligns more with what I personally want from an MMO. And even then, Classic lacks a lot of what I want (more sandbox element, proper player-driven economy etc etc).
---
In RP servers the same goes for titles of any sort: so you can‚Äôt be *KingX* as it would be disruptive to anybody actually trying to rp
---
Uh-huh. Quit being a massive wimp and grow a pair of balls to go fight someone who you don't one-shot.
---
Oh, sorry your grieving lower level players has been hampered, and don't give you or people like you credit.  You were never about pvp or a fair fight, people like you killed lowbies and towns until a challenge appeared, and you would all flee.  Thugs at best, sociopaths most likely.
---
Is anybody else playing fire mage during leveling?
---
/me laughs in Finnish too.
---
Even they aren't really. How long will they keep being outraged if the next expansion looks good ? If Diablo 4 is near ? If Warcraft 3 Reforged goes out ? 
---
Please, if they were really able to make what is good a higher priority than what they want, they would all be vegan, anticapitalist, and wouldn't ever buy something made in China or any other similar sh\*thole.
---
Hypocrisy makes me sick, far more than people outright admitting that they lack the will to really care.
---
This is a video game, where absolutely 0 consequences exists and every decision you take is risk free, if you still decide to go by the books in such a safe environment then....

There are a few Daily Delights in existence but there is only one Daily Deviate.
---
Une des raisons pour laquelle j'ai d√©cid√© de jouer sur un server anglais...
---
I mean they are only 430 honestly, it's throwaway loot when you've been 440 or higher for the last 2 months
---
There is an issue with titanforging, but that doesnt mean loot is insignificant,  the same can be said of classic loot due to bad stat weights and not being properly optimized
---
the mob have to get the killing blow.
---
What I meant by harder to gear was ‚Äòless intuitive to gear‚Äô.
---
&gt; it's not my problem   
---
Western companies are starting to self censor, even in the west, so they can continue operating in China. Doesn't that strike you as frightening? As something that might soon come to affect you?
---
Actually this copy pasta is for disabling scammers's internet. So, it's beneficial. Pointless to paste in chat channel tho.
---
Hi druid friends, how do you deal with warlocks ? Even if I can engage, I always finish being feared and dotted for ever :(  
---
Do you have some tips for me ? :)
---
It does, doesn't it? Why play if you're not actually going to do anything worth while or push yourself. Or at the very least make it so you're not hindering the rest of the group? 
---
The Priest I was with yesterday was kind enough to allow me to play a little more offensively with coldsnap than I would otherwise on the last pull of Cathedral (entire boss room+boss+ a few from outside). He knew I'd get aggro from the boss, which can't be slowed like the other adds, so kept an eye (and a shield) on me, &amp; I was able to use snap for an extra nova/CoC for more burst alongside the usual AE spam whilst kiting &amp; pre flamestrike into the first Mage's nova before blocking/blinking &amp; bandaging to let him have a break.
---
WHAT literally has the best questing as soon as you hit feralas 
---
This was the fastest levels for me
---
Thx) For nameplates I am using standard ElvUi - simple and has some good options.
---
Careful, people protecting blizz might come at you claiming it was Netease, not Blizzard!
---
(Technically true, but Netease is their chinese partner and thus their representative. If they don't support what netease said, then fucking sue them for defamation?)
---
Torch farm is now prison farming
---
Exactly as the comments state...  In this day in age your intent means nothing... If someone can find offensive they will, and you will have to deal with the consequences.  
---
In this case changing your guild name.  If a bunch of homophobes made the same guild name people would lose their minds.  You can't have your cake and eat it too.
---
I doubt its in the game, we would have seen some patterns drop already
---
You've convinced yourself that you're "valuing freedom and democracy" by basing your decision to subscribe to a game you would otherwise enjoy, on some passing politically-charged headline that you would never have even known or cared about had it not entered your news feed. Never mind that it will all blow over within a month, that everyone will move on and forget about it. 
---
And *I'm* the pathetic one?
---
You aren't worth discussing this with.
---
Probably billions for them at this point. And the potential billions to come from the rapidly growing mobile gaming market
---
It depends on what content you are aiming for. Druids are perfectly viable to tank any 5man dungeon, probably better than warriors.
---
It will be harder to find raid spots and you can't expect to become the MT as you will take more damage than a warrior and lack some critical tools for progression like Shield Wall. So even if you become a tank, you'd be expected to deal damage or heal on many fights.
---
Its not right to try to rally support to bombard a person with a brigade of random people in order to get yourself help above hundreds if not thousands of other people who are also paying customers of the service you aren't satisfied with. I really don't give a flying fuck how you rationale it, you're wrong, he's wrong, everyone with this mindset is wrong.
---
You don't deserve to have that kind of power. Nobody does. Nobody should, if you abuse it, you're an asshole.
---
Least of all, you/he/it aren't even seeking to gain anything, you/he/they/it just want revenge. Punishment. 
---
Grow up.
---
Well, if you are going to farm it you have 12 minutes to complete each run to avoid maximum instance lockouts. A regular run dont take that long for 60s anyway.
---
Knew a guy back in the days called Benzedrine
---
All hail to people who at least have the honesty to admit that they don't *really* care. 
---
Everyone can say that we want the world to be a better place, but most of us are too busy keeping their lives on tracks to give a damn. And you know what ? It's fine, it's human, but just admit it.
---
I think the fact its not probably optimized makes it more awesome and unique and those over powered items are so rare and significant. But not actually overpowered as anyone can essentially get them.
---
How does a "statement" and the reinstatement/payment of a random hearthstone player hold a candle to the atrocities China is responsible for. If you're going to write this wo is me comment, I hope you would actually stick to your principles and not reinstall WoW until Blizzard actively supports the HK movement. A statement does nothing.
---
winter squid, summer bass afaik
---
Cancelled my subscription, won‚Äôt be back or buying any other Blizzard product until they figure their shit out.
---
Nobody said straight people are being discriminated against.  This is a Classic subreddit not a soap box for you to make up attacks against you to justify your message.  Pointing out the rules are applied equally to all whether it be on religious or sexual identity grounds is the exact OPPOSITE of discrimination.
---
Yep and if all 5 members in the group have saved her she doesnt even spawn. You get some other mob named "Dark Iron Priestess" or some shit. loot is still the same though. we were confused why it was a different mob and the only thing we could come up with was we all had done the quest.
---
Welcome aboard pal :P
---
Or flat out broken content. Garr adds don't even explode if you keep them alive and just kill Garr.
---
Sadly my realm is so horde overpopulated, I haven't had many 1v1 situations. It's usually 1v3 or more, which in return results in alliance always running in packs, so when you actually meet only 1 horde, it's a 3v1.
---
World pvp isn't meant to be fair, but my god is it fun when it is!
---
It's not a classic thing,  it's a humanity thing.  I don't understand why people think that people being a-holes is unique to one game or another.
---
Oh I dont claim it was a challenge. And I dont mind if people disagree. I changed over time and now will become the very reason people are justifying killing me. I no longer /cheer and /pat I dismount and kill like the people who did it for 40 levels. I was shown how people wanna be treated.
---
yeah, it was a "thing" back in Vanilla too. never understood it, but it is part of the PVP server experience I guess!
---
It's easy to cancel a video game sub for a month and call yourself a hero.. it's lot harder to throw that thousand dollar iPhone in the trash and actually make a real sacrifice.  Ya'll are just exposing yourselves as a bunch of children .
---
it is, but I cannot find it when scrolling through new
---
Yep, find a good guild/group of "friends" and avoid the hate train.  Its on the internet, everyone is a superhero/genius out there.  They will judge accordingly, best to filter out the crap.....  Looking for a good guild myself lol.
---
I‚Äôve encountered close to 0 toxicity. It‚Äôs in the 1% in my experience so far.
---
Shadow dmg,Spirit, sta, int
---
Yeah man, my internet points are dwindling
---
Real question. How do you keep yourself from gaining more skill and dinging 20?
---
Well wish you didn't say anything because now I'll make sure to interact with the hunter soloing without a pet lol.
---
Karma for all the hunter loot you guys got over last decade.
---
Ha! That‚Äôs because you can‚Äôt see the colours ;)
---
^ this
---
‚ÄúCowards‚Äù, as we horde like to say.
---
How dare you insult a warrior with the mightiest weapon of all?
---
\-------------------------------------------------------------------------Boycott Blizzard---------------------------------------------------------------------------
---
It's interesting that you think this was my tipping point. Bold assumption. Also that you think this is the only thing I'm doing to support freedom in Hong Kong...
---
This is a hot button issue for me because I have followed news in China since I was a teen. My area sees a lot of HK immigration, I have friends and peers for whom this is a priority emergency. So maybe that's why you think I'm over here seething. It's not that I'm angry about people who don't feel the way I feel, it's that this not a subjective issue. 
---
And he is gatekeeping. The whole you can't A if you don't B is classic gatekeeping strategy. 
---
Believe what you want, you probably live in a free country. I'm a hateful snob and this is the first stand I've ever taken on anything, I probably don't even care about those kids in Hong Kong I'm just trolling for lulz. I'm a huge hypocrite and probably Google mean things about Greta Thunberg all day on my iPhone while drinking Nestle water from disposable plastic bottles from my throne of new plastic that I specially ordered off of Wish for $3+$7 shipping... I'm the worst kind of armchair warrior, you pegged me to the wall with your intelligent repartee. You got me, Scoob.
---
WoW is hardly my bubble. I don't live and breathe a video game. But it sucks that I won't play with the initial wave anymore. I'll miss it, and miss out. 
---
But I really don't care. I give a shit about people suffering. But, I'm the fucking villain, right? Astonishing lol
---
Strange.
---
portal, food vendor and some frost oil
---
Sorry, I should have mentioned it in the previous post and Reddit wouldn't let me respond right away.
---
Yes, I'm Alliance and yes, I recommend a party of AT LEAST 3 to go any where on a PvP server as Horde players are garbage and cannot win unless they outnumber you or are a far higher level than you :) sometimes they even gank you while you're afk in inn because as I mentioned they'll do anything to avoid a fair fight.
---
Truely beautiful !  
---
but... For me, it is the wooden area, I love the pre-cata Ashenvale, darkwood, Feralas, etc...
---
Do you doubt that Diablo immortal will be very profitable?
---
Wasn't precise enough, this is indeed what I meant.
---
My favorite was walking into storm wind got the first time. 
---
With all the statues on each side and the music playing. My god i wish I could okay wow again for the first time. 
---
Also west fall was incredible. Being in a pvp zone for the first time.
---
One skull is enough
---
Yes... but the fact it's rare doesnt mean it's not overpowered... simple fact
---
Reading agility in title, I struggle to take that question serious
---
Having employees who is basically there for their passion and loyalty (as is normal with video games) and then doing this? That is going to be a hard sell for a lot, as the pay at video games aren't that good anyway.
---
RollTracker Classic
---
Dunno if is the one that cdew uses, but it works for me.
---
It's fucking objective, dude. Darkshore has the highest potential xp/hour from questing out of any zone. Please look at any top tier guide. 
---
Westfall, on the other hand, has risk factors for questing at level 12-14 that are too high, and will result in either wasted time between pulls, or death. 
---
I really don't have to explain myself again when I did it in the first post. The person who tried to counter point is just flat out wrong.
---
https://imgur.com/a/sC9m1yV
---
&gt; You can't discriminate against an overwhelming majority, or as they perceive themselves, "normal"
---
Um, yes you can. Definition of discrimination: make an unjust or prejudicial distinction in the treatment of different categories of people, especially on the grounds of race, sex, or age.

---
Ah yeah, the guards won't help you if you're alliance.
---
Even level 10 doesn't do this draw distance
---
Agi isnt really important
---
Obviously the big thing with MM is your pet struggles a bit more holding aggro I'm assuming. Is it easy to deal with if you have the knowledge to avoid taking aggro? Does MM have common Mana issues with having to use aimed shot/multi shot to keep the damage going?
---
Seems like it NEEDS a flair, even though it is listed nowhere, I will now delete this post as it was automatically reinstated when I put up a flair... weird shit man
---
I think there was something in Legion that put rolls in their own window until you cleared it similar to /range X dont remember if it was an addon or a weak aura. Would be cool to have something like /rolltracker 100 and have it open a box that displays all rolls done 1-100, then use /rolltracker clear to dump the data to set up for the next item. Quick someone with more addon knowledge make this and become the pug god we need.
---
I guess you could just use the gambling addon and that will track who rolls the highest and lowest and you can ignore the lowest?
---
It does work. Just differently... If you play around with sit you'll get used to it
---
Yep, and "doff" means the opposite, to take something off.
---
I know most rare items are not. Some are. Either way I like them.
---
intellect - spirit  - stam
---
you get crit from intel so that is #1 priority.  spirit and stam is debatable but i think the over consensus is spirit over stam unless you are tanking something
---
for sure. I explored everywhere I would ever go before hitting 19. this involved a lot of running to my corpse in STV/redridge/hillsbrad. now at level 19 I have 868 experience, and as long as I never kill npcs or mobs, I will stay level 19 forever. with about 20k worth of emergency soak exp before im in danger of a ding.
---
I got more than enough homophobic comments in my inbox already
---
Turning off inbox replies and going back to questing. People can be horrible in here on their own
---
Can someone explain to me how fishing works?
---
I'm trying to get my fishing to 300. I'm currently at 146, I've bought the book that takes you to 225.
---
I'm also leveling my cooking which is stuck currently at 150/150 , I've been to lazy to travel to get the 225 cooking book.
---
I know you can get +fishing rods and lures. I'm currently running the +5 rod and using Bright Baubles when I can giving me a +80 to fishing.
---
The guide I'm using says I should be catching Bristle Whisker Catfish until I have 175 fishing. Then catch Mithril Head Trout until 225.
---
I guess my questions is... Is the higher your fishing Skill is the more often you catch fish? Or Hoe quickly you catch fish, or how often you level up the skill by catching fish? Do you get more skill points for catching higher end fish?
---
Because with my skill+lure+pole I'm sitting at fishing skill at 227, can I go ahead and try to catch the Mithril Head Trout? Because right now it seems like I only get a level up in fishing every 6-7 catches when I go for the Bristle Whisker Catfish.
---
Do Ctrl+F "message the moderators" to see the clickable link to ask the mods.
---
Oh finally someone who see how the world really works. Yeah our civilisations are based on the suffering of a lot of other people. Either accept it or fight it, but don't bath in the benefit while pretending to care, that's all.
---
So...do you res them or let them run back to their corpse? Either way you are wasting a colossal amount of time.
---
It's hard to quantify something like "fun", but that would be high on the list. Also important would be low downtime and overall survivability. 
---
My first character in vanilla was a druid, and it was actually pretty nice. Your kit is fabulous for leveling, it's just a slow start before you get bear &amp; cat forms. But think about it -- ranged spells, heals, stealth, beartank, seal form, travel form, free second hearthstone in Kalimdor...
---
He could just be taking a dump. I usually go around this time of the morning
---
Yeah, playing on a server where there is no guarantee your account that you have invested hundreds of hours will be there the next day, admin/mods actively sell gear for money and some mechanics/values are based on best guesses sure trumps this steaming turd!   /s
---
Go back to your pserver and save one less person being in login queue.
---
I happen to know every post gets temp deleted if they arent flaired. IDK why, but it is automated.
---
Yeah that makes sense, it's an automated thing with no flair it's removed and brought back when you tag it with a flare.
---
I also use my wand and don't know if it's important to upgrade it. First time playing, so anything I ask is serious.
---
I‚Äôm not arguing that druids are better, when everyone is fully geared and all things are equal, warriors are definitely better tanks. All I‚Äôm saying is that druids CAN tank almost all raid content, and it‚Äôs not as sub optimal as most people think.
---
That being said, warriors scale off gear far more than Druid tanks do, so I‚Äôd argue in the beginning of the raiding phase druids might be slightly better, if everyone is still in preraid BiS.
---
This already ruined a few TM vs SS battles where I participated. Very annoying stuff...
---
Thanks for the answer. I have heard of this method but im not sure if it is against the tos or might be considered an exploit?
---
Ok, I was wondering if it might be. Thank you
---
except soc is a 30 sec buff that can be dispelled that gives 1 extra hit at 70% damage while windfury is a 5 min buff that costs LESS MANA and gives 2 full dmg hits at greater attack power.
---
But yeah otherwise it's totally the same.
---
I'll make sure to purge you with my holy hammer. I try and be nice and not attack horde when they're at a disadvantage. But normally that comes back to bite me in the butt.
---
I'm on a PvP server.
---
These are the kind of grandpa tanks who would never stand a chance in mythic+
---
this whole post and comments gave me cancer
---
(spellpower&gt;shadowpower&gt;firepower&gt;int&gt;stam&gt;spirit btw no agi/str at all)
---
A green quest yields the same amount of rewards the entire time it is green. Waiting to turn in Westfall quests and then start chains at 16 is objectively better.
---
Increases ranged AP and therefore wand damage, doesn't it ?
---
You most certainly get decurses cleanses and heals, although in a lower priority.
---
As for the bosses in specific:
---
Luciforn never survives long enough for your pet to die, and with everyone using resto pot as they should be, dispell aren't even that big a problem.
---
Shazzrah: This boss your pet will definitely die on. But better it dying than sitting afk casting furious howl that won't even have the range to hit melee(15 yd on howl, 30 on AE). Most experienced hunters actually go full AE resistance over fire due to this boss, with enough gear and world buffs, your pet can actually have a good chance of surviving.
---
Baron geddon?! How is your pet dying on this fight? Are you not sending him back as the blastwave or whatever its called begins?
---
But you said because everyone can get them they aren't overpowered... you're going in circles
---
It's quite simple, "/tm 8" marks your target with a skull and "/tm 7" marks the target with a cross
---
you expect to do dmg as a ret?
---
Goddamn yes! This!
---
I tap 'til about 30%/70% HP/MP or so, then eat and drink.
---
I've even had tank/dps druids, ret palas heal me up. I appreciate it, but unnecessary if it causes you to require drink anyway as I'm not gunna interrupt my drink and tap again.
---
If you aren't being true to your words by boycotting any company that tries to appease chinese markets, you are the real pathetic one.
---
As a healer I prefer shields on my tanks but that seems rare, at least while lvling up in SM.
---
What frames are you using? And what skin? Thanks!
---
Rune rubbing ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
Playing classic has highlighted how ass backwards most people's opinions seem to become once they're over 40. Maybe faux news has some kind of psychic drone that only old white people are susceptible to lol.
---
And that one pull, that one boss fight, once a day. You proc and crit every hit, pull agro and die.
---
I don't think that's true. Guards in Booty Bay and Ratachet should help if you get attacked regardless of faction. 
---
There are certain spots in Booty Bay on the rooftops you can stand and exploit the game so the guards won't attack. I suspect this might be what's happening to OP.
---
Or in the water...
---
is the angerforge one really faster tho...? u skip that one pack/corner before the bridge tunnel thing, jump in right after and still have to clear the hallway that follows, and a few fire guards after still
---
Lol. 3 different answers but at least they all agree agility isn‚Äôt important at all.
---
Reddit kinda messed that up I‚Äôll edit and fix it
---
and THIS is the place to set the HS.
---
- Quick way to AH
---
- IF itself has a very good position to get to the Blackrock or to menethil fast.
---
set SW as your HS location when you are raiding Zul'Gurub often.
---
Yeah, you can tell they half assed so much stuff in classic.
---
Vuhdo, with a modified Bit'o'Grid preset
---
True... I normally pass by a horde killing a mob and continue doing my thing. Then 5sec later they come attack me while I'm killing.
---
Is that worth the effort ?
---
Trashhhh takes a spot in bag and has a long ass cool down just to be an ally
---
I am not there yet but I think I will once I crafted my bis chest. My 2nd prof is herb now, I might switch to alchemy or just go full gold making and get skinning.
---
I was in a group the other day for Stocks and I didn't want to tank because of my lack of familiarity with the dungeon. I ended up taking over because we couldn't find a tank, and one of the dps gave me some helpful tips along the way which really helped out. Luckily it's a stupidly simple dungeon to run, but remembering things like the boss fears so you need to clear the side rooms first is paramount information.
---
Great, thanks! :)
---
So you don't think with a warrior and priest with both engineering can do it?
---
No, my phone is not a Google or Apple phone. 
---
But I'm not judging anyone for their phone either. 
---
I can afford to protest whatever I want to, priorities work that way. 
---
You're trying to ascribe something to me to make out like I'm lying or putting forth some unattainable candy land of bullshit...ooooh, but you have stuff! And things!! You're just as bad as the rest of us so leave me alone to zug it to Blizzard!
---
Lol, okay.
---
Yeah if you have a threat meter or have enough knowledge of when your going agg the pet will lose threat. This does help you learn kiting skills so not so bad. It‚Äôs not slower by any means it can just be a different play style.
---
What ever happened to just talking to people? I'm in the same boat as you. I don't want to ruin the fun. I'm gonna use my mockling blow cd, then I'm gonna whisper the guy and ask if he wouldn't mind slowing down just a little bit.
---
So far this has worked pretty much every time.

Spent a whole afternoon trying to get up from mulgore, don't recommend. Try more desolace feels like the best option

I just switched to fire at level 45.

It makes only being able to see 20 yards in front of you more realistic when its night, lol
---
I have 9 bars left to 60 and think I may just wanna grind them. Where is a good place for a elemental shaman? My thinking is some place in the plaguelands..
---
A combination of these, imo, do quests in the areas of this level range, stack up some dungeon quests, go do that: uldaman, zul'farrak, maraudon.
---
Zones might be: stv, duswtallow, feralas, tanaris, start ungoro, start felwood.
---
Questing helps you not feel the pain of grinding mobs so much.
---
Have fun!

Mostly in this thread, but a few DM's as well so far

Kind of shocked people think that being toxic [is worth defending too](https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dge4vo/gay_world_of_warcraft_guild_forced_to_change_name/f3b0b7y/)

Don't get me wrong, I've been using SoC all along despite of what I've read and heard online. In my short testing earlier SoC was hitting for ~110-130 damage while R5 SoR was hitting for 31-32, which when you calculate the damage in a vacuum (120 and 31.5 average damage, respectively) it's 120*7 = 840 dmg/min for SoC and 31.5*(60/3.2) = 590.6 dmg/min for SoR. Obviously you'd also have to account for crits and misses for SoC to get an exact number.
---
So even though consensus from online sources/guides is (as far as I can find) that SoR is better at faster speeds, in my own experience here SoC would be significantly better than SoR. I think part of the issue is that theorycrafters try to take overkill damage into account for levelling, which impacts SoC much more than it does SoR.
---
Then there's also the fact that SoC is 70% weapon damage at all ranks while SoR gains damage per rank, so if you get a weapon upgrade then SoC benefits from it while SoR doesn't.
---
I think the tl;dr at the end of the day is that even **if** there are breakpoints where SoR is technically better, you can use SoC at any given weapon speed without worry.
---
Quests drop the same experience, even if they're green. Mobs are different though.
---
Well, China doesnt have much potential for the kind of mobile games ATVI releases anyway. King with all their candy crush, Activision with Call of Duty Mobile and Blizzard with Diablo immortal are all performing pretty badly in china.
---
Lock here. I only require heals in I‚Äôm actually under fire. Drain Life does significant DPS while also healing. I actually get annoyed when healers do more than HoT me :) Like they don‚Äôt know or don‚Äôt respect how self sufficient I am!
---
it's classic classic..
---
I‚Äôm not home so I can‚Äôt check atm, but can you select Raid Warning separately from Raid Chat?
---
System Messages + Raid Warnings would be a perfect loot window
---
That's cute. Just last night, I jumped off the hill near the yeti cave in hillsbrad. I watched a lvl 55 human rogue get slaughtered by an undead ?? and his probably guild mate (a lvl 22 rogue), so I hid behind a tree in terror. All I had to do was run across the field and take the path back to Southshore and I would be safe. I waited for them to clear out and I saw some more horde chase a 30 something hunter up the hill. I took the opportunity to run for it. My little human warrior legs could only travel at 100% mms, so it felt like I was ceawling across the field. I was already in defensive stance with my shield equipped because I was prepared to be anal raped.
---
Lo and behold, I looked but towards the cave and saw the lowbie rogue chasing after me, knowing his asshole guildie was following in stealth. A shaman, priest, and something else appeared almost out of nowhere. I wasn't able to get shield wall off before they opened, but once I wasn't cc'd, I spammed the shit out of my keybind. I felt like a turtle being attacked by hawks. Didn't even make it to the flight master...
---
In general, Horde are just scummy. I'll fight if provoked, but I always greet horde with a wave. I have no intention of killing lowbies, but it never seems to satisfy their desire to die apparently.
---
This is so strong, the fear can last 15 sec I think being full dotted
---
Dont heal them. If they die they will get the hint.
---
Mainly reddit i'm finding, the trolls have found their opening and are starting to flood this site.
---
I loved watching them take jabs since launch but the community would shut them down so fast they would just delete their comment. So yea i guess if they are getting attention now then yea some players are becoming toxic.
---
In game its got to be certain realms i suppose, on Grobb it's far from toxic and another server i'm dabbling on is extremely peaceful.
---
I'm going to just play the chit out of classic and not bother with forums as much anymore, i'm having an absolute blast, i can't remember the last time i've been so into an mmorpg and having this much fun. I'm so not interested in reading toxic bs.
---
I see it‚Äôs leaving a big impact lol
---
we had a guy join our small guild early on named Insanerapist.. Wonder what happened to him.
---
Friendlist positive ppl, go with them. If a tank asks me to heal an instance I'm in, if I have the time.
---
Use demo for sure. Thunderclap doesn't generate much threat though. Might be worth it on really big packs, but you're probably not generating enough threat to keep them all on you anyway if you're AOEing.
---
Oh god... I want to die.
---
ight that‚Äôs.... u got the FBI‚Äôs phone #?
---
Take it at your own pace, friend! You're not missing out. As long as you enjoy it, you're exactly where you should be :)
---
I believe the ability to control when one is crit through /sit was prevented and this was a design choice.
---
Nice. I have a twink guild started, it‚Äôs hilarious every time I do my recruit spam, I have people triggered and they always say ‚ÄúLOL pvp guild when bgs arent even out! Noob!‚Äù 
---
Total idiots..
---
Level arms and you retain 25 rage when changing stances. 
---
I tank a lot and it's a game changer.
---
Whaaaassst. 
---
Well seeing horde for the first time while queuing up to deadlines was cool
---
It's just the reality check when this game stops being a nostalgic fantasy and actually becomes something people play. People were always like this.
---
&gt; basic human rights are violated every day all over the world. Why are we not outraged about that actively?   
---
What's your point here? Should every post about Hong Kong be ended with "P.S. I am also outraged by everything else wrong in the world"? We're discussing this on a forum for a Blizzard game. Blizzard isn't, too my knowledge, invading Syria or executing homosexuals. They are, however, censoring support of Hong Kong. So that's what we're talking about.   
---
&gt; Why is Blizzard different from other companies doing the same thing?   
---
They're not. People are also pretty pissed about the NBA doing the same thing. And about Apple removing an app that lets people from Hong Kong avoid riot police.
---
Hunters doing the silithus demon can duel a friendly lock and get curse of recklessness on them (making the encounter extremely easy).
---
Maybe they swam up from gromgol.
---
Only heal a lock if you can spare the mana. They wont complain. Or shouldn't.
---
I thought the same.  Turns out I was right.  I played for a month, but ultimately, I've already been there/done that ~15 years ago and I don't really want to pay to do it again.  Plus, I got bored.  Now with Blizzard siding with China, I'm glad I cancelled my sub.
---
Im not gonna disagree that the mod gives an advantage, thats what all addons do.  If one player has weakauras, an addon that switches trinkets, or any other variations of things, and the other player does not, then this isn‚Äôt any different. Spy does nothing that can‚Äôt already be done, instead like basically every other addon it just simplifies things. 
---
I doubt I‚Äôll change your mind on anything. It all comes down to personal opinions-you may believe that an addon the tracks hour Cooldowns and makes it easier for you to know when an ability is up for use doesnt give you an advantage over someone who manually tracks their Cooldowns but conceptually its no different.
---
Unequip items?
---
point about people having different opinions, yes that point has been proven.
---
Elitist bitch
---
Spell-Dmg aka Damage and Healing or Shadow-Dmg increases your DMG per Spell / per DoT
---
Int increases your mana pool and caster crit chance
---
Stamina increases your Health points.
---
Spirit increases your out of combat mana regeneration, which starts, when you are not casting for at least 5 seconds (wand usage doesn't count)
---
Agility does indeed increase wand damage, Spell-Dmg does not, Shadow-Dmg does, if the wand is shadow dmg. Don't need on neck, back, rings or trinkets with agility, since it doesn't boost your main source of dmg, which is spells
---
Look primarily for spell-Dmg and int. It's good to find a balance between stamina and int, since your health pool determines how long you live. Take the spirit, if the int / spell-dmg is worth it, but don't target spirit as a main stat on an item
---
Had same exprience but tbh mage pulling aggro aint so bad
---
He waits for you to group up mobs then blizzards, they are slowed so there is no danger at this point, once the slow starts wearing off he can frost nova to root the pack and you can start regaining aggro
---
Not playing a tank so Im not sure if its accurate but from healer perspective its fine
---
I remember this. I solo healed a couple of bosses in 10 man Heroic IceCrown as a Resto Shammy
---
I bet you‚Äôre unemployed
---
Loots with kidney shot??
---
Exactly, and I've had the guards in Gadgetzan help me before when someone tried ganking me by the flight master.
---
But once in Booty Bay and now Gadgetzan I have been minding my own business in the inn when I get a big ol' frostbolt in the back and the guards couldn't care less. Just curious, thought maybe that the other player is Revered and since I'm only Friendly they let it slide or something?
---
It is a lot easier to quit paying for entertainment (NBA, ESPN, Blizzard etc) than it is to cut out electronics, something we all have come to depend on for our daily lives.

I won't throw my already purchased iPhone in the trash, they already got my money, so all that is doing is hurting me.

Ahh yeah it's not terrible outside of guild if you don't need anything.
---
Theoretically they can, can they not? Can everyone get mythic aszhara items, why yes ofc they can, but will they? No about 95-99% of the playerbase won't due to a combination of it being hard to get and bad drop rng. Same with any overpowered item in classic. Everyone can get one but its unlikely but aslong as more than 1 person has it, its all fair because they can battle eachother out.
---
Okay, I wanna know how weapon skillups work. I thought that you could only raise your weapon skill to (Level x 5) of the enemy you're hitting, but apparently that's not true?

Horde players are lame.   Population advantage and racial advantage... there is never a time when you can say you won fair and square.

Which just makes it easier for everyone to ignore your opinion because,

I hate to break it to you but you don't matter.
---
Find heroic strike to be a waste from a threat generation perspective. It's a rage dump for a small increase in dps. The heroic strike also doesn't generate rage like a normal auto attack does.
---
Even without mcp I do way more threat than warriors and have to throttle, cat or mt. Farming some up for this week to shock the raid when I beat hunter DPS as a bear
---
But that isn't what makes it overpowered...
---
I don't believe there's an error it's just not equiping my heal gear.
---
 im not sure what the button name is to assign it. 
---
Online I keep finding different answers ie multiactionbarbottomleft7 , bottomleft7, and used the same name as /fstack displayed . So I figured it didn't work that way. Can I call on the heal equipment macro by using /click Z on my keyboard or something. Thanks for answering .
---
They can. I've seen this 2manned by warrior/resto shaman, so I don't think priest would be that much harder.
---
HUH????
---
Yes, your glancing blows matter, but it doesn't matter in terms of hit.
---
\^ This. 
---
I see fury warriors spamming world chat all day looking for tanks for hours on end instead of just tanking themselves. 
---
They sometimes even have the balls to reserve tank loot.
---
Also leveling as druid (40 now) - until what point do you think I can heal in dungeons with feral skill &amp; medium healing gear (basically keeping the best items i receive on 2nd or by quests focussing on heal &gt;  int &gt;  mp5 &gt; Spirit)?
---
So then you don‚Äôt use any addons. Got it.
---
As a rogue you have 305+ weapon skill by default, the yellow hit cap(abilities) is 6% versus bosses with 305+ weaponskill, note that more than 305 weapon skill doesn't reduce the hitcap further except at the extreme case of +15. So with 5% from talents you only need 1% hit on gear for all your sinister strikes to land.
---
However you still have a 24 % miss chance on your autoattacks and getting further hit is quite still quite useful, your auto attacks make up about 60% of your physical dps,
---
Had a tank last night that was so obsessed with being ‚Äúthe boss‚Äù that it drove everyone in the group crazy. Dps trolled him a little because he was obnoxious but I don‚Äôt think the tank understood that, he literally just thought that everyone was an idiot and he was a genius. Kind of getting that vibe reading this post
---
To add to this, you can theoretically skill it to 300 just in stormwind or orgrimmar. Higher skill just means less skill ups per fish caught. At 225 you start to need like 5 fish for a skill up.
---
I believe the Shanker does indeed take a debuff slot, unfortunately. Dagger itemization is not great at the moment.
---
I've read of a moonkin dagger and Moonfire spam build for ns procs I think, can't remember where.
---
It seems to be between 3-7 minutes before they restock the loot in their pockets, I spent a decent amount of time trying to optimise ‚Äúpassive‚Äù gold gain while leveling my alt and if I just alt tab and pickpocket the entire tavern in BRD every 7 minutes it‚Äôs a very easy 10-15g an hour. 
---
Now it wasn‚Äôt like this in vanilla wow however in vanilla wow I also could slice n dice for a short 0.5-1 second window after a mob died for any remaining combo points I had left on the mob.
---
Thank you for explaining, that is useful advice. I'll try to keep an eye on items that balance my overall stats that way. I haven't yet tried to increase my shadow damage or spell damage but I guess I should
---
The Area 51 thing was stupid.  The HK thing is a very real issue and now Blizzard is involved with it.  It's not going to be forgotten in a month.

how good is it? how are you doing against more than one mob?

I‚Äôve been fully pre raid bis for 2 weeks now, it‚Äôs not that hard. Sure, you might have a warrior that‚Äôs missing savage gladiator chain, but you should have all the rest. 
---
1-2 pieces missing is fine, I‚Äôm talking about the ones that come to raid with 50% greens
---
20 can be reached is two nights of good play (one if you nasty), its not too late now but it will be a lame choice at 40/60
---
People still having issues with queue times?  I haven‚Äôt had a queue in like 2 weeks.
---
Thunderclap just hits 4 enemies. It's a waste kinda.
---
As a resto shaman main. I would really recommend you look for gear with mp5 on it until you start getting into mc. It will help you in your endeavours. Also either find a mage for your party or find one in a major city. Have them craft you 100 water and as soon as combat is over start drinking until the tank pulls the next pat and begin healing. Dont worry about wasting the water and not getting it's full value. Just keep trucking along.
---
 So I'm lvl 60 in a pretty serious raiding guild, pre-bis healing gear and I've managed to pick up a few tank pieces from quests/random dungeons and here's the talents I'm using:  [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuMgkxEMzIzz](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxuMgkxEMzIzz) \- The reason I've got 2/2 in Unyielding Faith instead of Improved LoH is because the 10% fear resist is really helpful for some boss fights like Onyxia for example (even though You can stand up on the ledge to avoid damage it's still nice to just resist it completely).
---
I've also tried plopping in as many blessings as possible in order to be as flexible as possible, but I definetly feel like you should go for Blessing of Sanctuary over Holy Shock, I personally generally dislike Holy Shock overall for healing, it can be fun for Divine Favor + Holy Shock bursting people but if You want to be serious about tanking Sanctuary will definetly help out with damage reduction and aggro. 
---
Generally I would recommend gearing up your healing stuff first and just asking if you can need on stuff that would be an upgrade for tanking if the current tank doesn't need the item. (Scholomance is a great dungeon for this since the Deathbone set is crazy good for prot paladins, you should also do the Scholo questline to get Miriah's Song which is a great sword for tanking, You start it by talking to the girl outside the instance and going through her conversation, here's the queststart  [https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5382](https://classicdb.ch/?quest=5382)). Tanking dungeons as a paladin is definetly very viable so you shouldn't be afraid going for it just because it's not very meta!
---
What's the priest farm? Lashers?

During vanilla, you couldn't choose between 15 different instructional videos to teach you how to play your class or itemize your gear.  BiS lists hadn't been hashed out, worked over and reworked.  We've got a much better understanding of how to play the game over all.  All of these things make the game "easier."  We still wiped (yesterday) in BRD to accidental chain pulls, and it was still fun.

Even if head offices (Blizzard IRvine) had nothing to do with it, they are still responsible for what their partner in China says in their name.

&gt;This isn't something that would even effect Hong Kong at all. We have no control over what happens in Hong Kong, and effectively shutting down a forum to "spread awareness" isn't really doing anything.
---
Not completely true.
---
By spreading awareness, you are, spreading awareness of an issue. There are still people who do not know what is going on in Hong Kong, and getting more people aware of what is going on, might help them push their politicians into actually doing something.

I just think you're ignorant of the fact that AndroidOS is Google.  I mean maybe you are one of the couple thousand people that use some fringe operating system and I'm wrong.  Either way, you're using Reddit and they [help China with censorship.](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/11/reddit-300-million/)  
---
I don't like what Blizzard did but I see why they did it.  Any company that does business with China is forced to do business the way China wants them to, or lose that revenue stream.  So to treat one business different than you would treat the others is unfair to Blizzard.
---
I think if I talk about a new player I'd factor in things like:
---
* Easy to recover from mistakes, for example pulling more mobs than you should have, and being able to run away and not die ( e.g. Paladin with Invulnerability , Mage with Blink )
---
* Relatively easy fighting by using only a couple of skills to take minimum damage and deal maximum damage ( e.g. Mage, Hunter )
---
* Easy understanding of the class is possible without reading a huge guide about builds, "how to level" or "how to play"
---
* Later dungeon roll should be easy to understand and not require a lot of respeccing because of min/maxing or a huge deal of information of "how to play in dungeon X"
---
* Class should be enjoyable without looking at your health all the time and fear of dying, e.g. have extra protection from damage ( e.g. Mage with Frost Armor or Paladin with Invulnerability ) - goes hand in hand with point 1 to a certain extend
---
Those would be my criteria anyway. This way they can learn during leveling or earlier dungeon runs what the class means for them and *can* do mistakes without dying immediately. I wouldn't want to measure in numbers though but rather purely from an "easy to learn" approach.
---
If I had to explain to a new player how to efficiently kill a mob by having to write multiple paragraphs about how, I need to switch stances initially, use X skills then switch it up again and use Y skills it would become super confusing for them if they are completely new to the game. So if there is a lot of complexity I would stay away from recommending that to a new player ( this was just an example akin to a warrior and is probably not reflecting actual gameplay decisions for killing a single mob but just as a point if it were ).

Lol you act like Blizzard murdered someone. They just banned some kid who broke the rules by arrogantly using Blizzard's gaming tournament as a political platform, thereby putting them in an extremely awkward position. I think he should have been able to keep his prize money since he won, but the ban is absolutely justified. 
---
There's a time and place for everything, and that was not the right time to make a political statement.

You can keybind the marks in the settings menu as well.  I use the Num pad for all of the marks
---
Can I heal the hunter? I haven't seen anyone doing this yet but I was aware of the quest.
---
Blizz's rule is that if enough other players find it offensive, then it is considered offensive and must be changed. This goes both directions on stances and ideologies. It is a essentially a free-for-all complaintfest. But if you force some people to change their name due to reports, you have to also do so for all people/ complaints.

&gt; it's lot harder to throw that thousand dollar iPhone in the trash

But you've also already paid for the iPhone. Continuing to use it is not supporting Apple in any meaningful way. Apple does not get any benefit from an article indicating that people are refusing to upgrade and continue to use Apple's 8 year old phone.
---
I think this right here, back in 2005 my guild made us all wear FR gear which obviously mean our dps and healing was worse. Things didn‚Äôt die as fast as they could so healers had even longer fights for their already suboptimal gear

I mained shaman before I rerolled to mage. I've spend an hour finding the perfect look for my shaman while I made my mage in 1 minute to reserve the name. When I sudently decided to play my mage I didn't really looked at him and just started playing. Once level 25 I realised "Hey.. this isn't the look I had in mind for my mage?" But after a few more days I started to like the random look I gave myself within that minute. Now I'm happy I picked a look I normally would not go for.

Whats the easiest way to see if everyone in my raid has the priest stamina/spirit buff?
---
I am using grid as my raid frames addon, but the issue is there are two buffs. I know healbot has this function, but I just dont like the looks of that addon. I set up so everyone has a white name and if they have either of the stamina buffs their name turns from white to teal. 
---
But how do I set it up for both spirit and stamina? I could like use an extra icon or indicator for spirit but that would just be ugly. I see there is a "buffs" group of statuses used for groups of buffs but I cant figure it out how it works. 
---
If anyone set up grid to show who to buff easily please help.
---
When I first started playing a couple months ago I just went exploring. I found the tram under Stormwind and I ended up doing a lot of my early leveling in Dun Morough instead of Elwynn (I‚Äôm a human). I‚Äôm level 46 now and that‚Äôs still my favorite zone.
---
Of course it works better with slower weapons. If it adds 70% of weapon damage times 7 in a minute, then 7 big chunks is better than 7 tiny chunks of damage. The more you're 'missing' your proc, the less output you get out of the Seal.
---
Advertising buying and selling twink items in Trade is no different, lots of hate DMs of people telling me my stuff is worthless til p3 so sell it to them for silver now. If not I'm an idiot etc. Stay strong, we will wreck, they will be envious they weren't smart enough to buy when it was cheap!

---
Treason? Listen I don‚Äôt at all agree with what blizzard did here. But citizens united decided that corporations were able to express free speech the same way that individuals are. That applied to money but I don‚Äôt see how the law would see this differently now. Aside from that, what makes a company with global reach and market ‚ÄúAmerican‚Äù anymore. Why does their allegiance still lie here at all?
---
I was healing a SM Cathedral run last night and I felt so bad for our tank. He would mark before every pull and every pull, our DPS would just shoot whoever they wanted. So after he typed ‚Äúskull first please‚Äù four times they finally started following his lead - but at first they were just like ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry dude we haven‚Äôt died we‚Äôre fine‚Äù 
---
Respect your tanks!!
---
Hunters have a high skill ceiling, but also an insanely high floor. They can easily take on 3 mobs doing nothing other than pet attack and auto attack; so a new player can pretty much breeze through leveling.
---
Sure, raiding and PvP are much harder, but hunters are still insanely easy to get to 60 with even if you have no idea what's going on.
---
Can't even confirm it's her and yet we tell him she's dead.
---
People take everything too seriously. Just take the most hyper competitive person at anything in life, and you will see an unhealthy obsession.
---
&gt;Let's just say those average out to a roll between three.
---
That estimation makes no sense here. E.g. lets say that 10% of the rolls is with 5 players (major underestimate). That alone would amount to 4 rolls a day with three ones.
---
Were they standing in the corner of the room? I believe that's a glitch/exploit. I saw a guy doing it the other day. There are several spots you can do it and blizzard has said this will result in a ban if you do it.
---
Other way around lol
---
I am on Herod, so if you play there add me!
---
Do you write titles for BuzzFeed?
---
Didnt know if staff would be better
---
Hope you're leveling your fishing now, so you're ready when the STV fishing tournament starts.
---
Thanks, I'm currently at 1/29/5 so this works pretty well for me rn.
---
You can play whatever but arms is legitimately better for tanking while leveling with reserved rage from stance dancing. And if you don‚Äôt think stance dancing is important then you can look up some guides for warrior to see why it is. If you don‚Äôt care about efficiency and just wanna play your game more power to you, but if you are confused as to why people don‚Äôt understand your spec it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs bad pre 60
---
China revenue is approx 5.2%
---
My response is, u can always tell a noob healer when they complain about healing locks. Not to say OP is a noob, but he is in a way if you are asking.
---
Just heal the damn locks and stfu. A lock with 100% health is bad, and a deal lock os bad. Best to be something in between üëç
---
If you download details addon you can see your pets damage, for me at lvl 45 my pet averages around 45% of my overall damage and that's just basic attacks, not bite or claw. With those it's about 60%.
---
Wow ty for reminding me to set up a campfire in STV on my dwarf 60 priest!! &lt;3
---
You do /who and then type the name without the accents and then add them from there lol
---
And seems odd that someone decided to rush off to a media outlet over a fucking WoW guild name.
---
Lol you think this is smart tanking? Did you even consider what you pass up in order to get situational utility like this? You want steady high threat, not a bunch of tools to use because you fail at holding aggro in the first place.
---
Hahaha. I'm glad I'm not the only one!
---
Seems anyone not heterosexual has this need to promote themselves these days. We get it.
---
Guessing this is not high level gear.  Given that, whichever one looks better; you'll be replacing it anyway.
---
actually my fishing is already 150, my engineering too. First Aid 225.
---
SoC is not totally random, it's normalised towards 7 procs a minute. The lower your speed the closer you'll get to getting near 50% chance of proccing per hit.
---
There's no questline for Expert Cooking, but there is a quest to complete for Artisan Cooking (https://www.wowhead.com/quest=6610/clamlette-surprise).  You'll need to be 225 skill and level 35.  I recommend farming or buying all the items on the AH before heading to Tanaris to do it.
---
When I did this a few weeks ago it was just opposite faction griefing. Had to get guild to guard the mob and even there we have horde doing kamikaze runs to tag it.
---
Purists ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø 
---
Can‚Äôt say anything bad about classic dude, or else you‚Äôre the problem and the game isn‚Äôt for you. The game could suck in comparison to modern time, but the hardcore purists want it that way, end of the day, if you have a complaint about classic, it‚Äôs either you or it‚Äôs just not meant for you.
---
spellpower and stamina. then int. stamina is your mana pool as well. spirit is shit.
---
And people think night elves are the flippers
---
Swiftmend is a mana drain with the current gear. It's actually going to gimp you if you're trigger-happy.
---
Idk about Moonglow, but I'd stick to HotW for a few phases
---
Also, some talents give +weapon skill as well.
---
because the human race plays it mostly
---
Locks can. Staysafe has done it on stream and it involved running around the tiny ledge that circles around the bridge Incendius is on. Obviously you have to be super careful not to fall
---
I dont play lock so sadly I'm not sure what specific lock things he did besides dotting
---
That's good to hear, because I have a priest friend whom I don't feel to bad to bother with this but.
---
Up to cap? The guild will get around 1-3 per ID, sometimes zero.

---
It does not take 1 minute of autoing if you actively get upgrades for your 2h like a warrior would. If a warrior used shitty weapons for dps it'd take them a full minute too.
---
Anyone working at Blizzard has enough talent to instantly walk out and go to another studio and find a job right away.
---
They are not hurting as much as you think they are, if they would lose their jobs.
---
And honestly, you shouldn't let a company hold their employees as hostage agaisnt you, while treating other people they work with like trash.
---
I think if they ever did an Xpac that wasn't BC and went the route of Classic + they have zones such as this they could finish. There are also a few other zones that are on the map but you cant click on or go to. They would make excellent content for WoW Classic + expansion.
---
Cant wait for my new PC
---
I agree. Social media is a negativity multiplier. Examples of negativity get highlighted and blown out of proportion. Viewing the world (or the World of Warcraft) through the warped lens of social media will make it look worse than it actually is.
---
Sure but for people who can only play late in the evening / at night it wouldn't be really fair though
---
Aye
---
Both combat rogues and arms warriors have "sweeping strikes" (blade flurry for rogue).
---
instance grind. carried my mage cleave if ur not a mage.
---
Agreed! 
---
For the record I think what Blizz have done here is totally shitty, but China has a hand in SOOO many of the products or services we use every day, so unless you going to go totally off grid as a protest its kinda impotent.
---
Also deleting your account when you have already paid for the products is hilarious.
---
Huge companies aren't stupid, they have run the numbers on this shit, there is an acceptable loss from negative PR that they are willing to accept in order to keep access to the Chinese market open.
---
yea it's in sync with your servers 24 hour clock. maybe you wouldn't have noticed if you always play at the same time
---

If you take a look at any of of the videos back from vanilla you will see the biggest noobs wearing random ass gearing not knowing what the hell they were doing. And they somehow managed to clear the raids. Explain that?
---
Pro tip don‚Äôt kite the ungoro one. She leashes and you can just kill the pet. Then she is extremely easy to melee down. I never used a healing pot or bandage.

It only really saves time if you're 2-3 manning it.  If you're running a 5 man, you should be making it in under 12 minutes a run.  The window jump also becomes more of a pain because there's a higher chance someone messes it up.

---
What pisses me off about this is that Blizzard is taking all the heat without a peep about Activision. This would not have happened if Blizzard was truly at the helm. They do not have a CEO. They are under the direction of Activision. They have bastardized the company, the games, the direction, and the values of Blizzard for profit.
---
Wait whaaaaaaaaaaa, what trinket is that??
---
The sole reason I‚Äôm not ret right now
---
I had a fully twinked 19 rogue and Paladin back in the day... I might do a hunter or warrior this time around.
---
But then again I'm also considering the 39 or 49 brackets.  Doing something other than WSG would be fun.
---
Our guild name got changed to &lt;Guild LCMK&gt; for basically no reason
---
GM was like "yea i have no idea why someone changed the name,  nothing wrong with it" so we got it back
---
Ain't you taking it way to serieus right now?
---
On the horde side, the cooking trainer in Org has dialog that says you need the cookbook from Desolace to advance your skill. Most people probably learned from wowhead or thotbot, but the dialog is there in the game too.
---
Hah, you think that's bad? I've seen the horrors of my friends trying to find a raid group. He's paged CONSTANTLY all day every day for 5 man groups and ubrs, but soon as he wants to do MC/Ony? Crickets.
---
Someone just figured it out one day and told people.  It's so different than what we are used to now!  Its magical
---
Wow you really have no global sense. Those are real people like you and me that are suffering in Hong Kong. The video game company you pay is supporting and allowing that. And you have the audacity to say your life is less enjoyable because you cant playing a fucking video game? Get a fucking grip dude.
---
I really hope you are a troll because nobody should be this stupid. If you are, you got me good but this is not the time or place for trolling.

**Focus**: (PVE)
---
**Contact Info**: [https://discord.gg/upGxkcT](https://discord.gg/upGxkcT)
---
**Raid/Times)**: Fridays and Saturdays, 3 hour(\~9:30pm-12am est)

ABOUT US
---
We're a hard-casual PVP Horde guild looking for people who have lives outside of WoW but still like to log in and get it done on the weekends.¬† Our guild leadership ran guilds during Vanilla-MoP.¬† Now we'd like to kick back and enjoy Classic with fellow chill adults who have a job, family, and life outside of WoW--but who still understand what it takes to prepare for raid night.¬† This guild was made for **YOU**.
---
BYOB's priority will be raiding but we also plan to make an impact on PvP with guild pre-mades.
---
GOALS
---
Raiding is our main priority. We'd like to be you to be 60 and raid ready around the end October. We're looking at early Nov to raid as a guild.
---
Let's enjoy the grind and help each other prepare for raiding.
---
LOOT
---
A combination roll(MS&gt;OS) and Loot Council. Things are going to be as fair as possible, example...some weapons, rings, trinkets on loot council. Members will know where these items go before we even step inside the raid. MT/OT will have priority, but other than that all set pieces free roll.
---
EXPECTATIONS
---
Be punctual (on time).
---
Be excellent to each other.
---
Play your class to the best of your ability.
---
**We look forward to raiding with you.**
---
Thanks,
---
I was thinking, since I'm a hunter, I could farm gold and buy the stuff faster than I can farm the materials, at least when I'm higher level.
---
When I level the alt, it could serve as the gatherer, but that will take another 2-3 months.
---
I mean watch some Stormx videos, they are pretty good. He even 2v1s people at full HP's. ;)
---
A troll hunter watched me die to Gammorita who was only on like 100 health the other day. I erased, drank and waited patiently for him to finish fighting his mob and get some mana back before I killed him. Not to be honourable or anything, I just wanted him to know I didn't need the mob advantage.
---
I'm not who you responded to but I'm also someone the cancelled sub over this and yes I try to avoid Nestle whenever I know it's one of their side companies
---
I read a comment two weeks ago here: as healer it's your job to keep the group alive - not at 100% HP.
---
It‚Äôs not so much that the player was punished, but how they were punished. Issuing a fine, or even a suspension would be one thing, but they straight up nuked the player from orbit, fired the people interviewing him, and then apologized to the Chinese government for it. 
---
That is insane, and incidentally an obvious political statement in its own right.
---
They're capitalist
---
Reminds me of Tooga just trying to get away from his nag of a wife.
---
Nope this was just from saying hello
---
Alright, I've been wonder this since vanilla and could never find a straight answer.
---
Does agility increase the crit rate of wands?
---
I mainly need this when doing Rend runs for checking the Jed IDs. Stuff can go horribly wrong when everyone leave the group to look for Jed in a separate one. And you misscalc by 3 minutes, and boom, you're locked out and kulled by gankers outside
---
How so? Almost every macro you see with text in the two primary hotbars use either shift or shift and alt modifiers.
---
I don't think that's how it works in classic. You get 10 % discount for honored and 10 % discount for one of the PvP ranks (I think maybe rank 10), and the discounts stack.
---
Still 5 per hour.
---
Somewhere in the mid to late 30's I believe your drain life will overtake your wand in DPS. Thus once you get to that point, a drain tanking spec will likely be faster than standard dot and wand.
---
That guy is just a parade-shitter.
---
It's horde vs alliance banter, it ain't that serious.
---
If you did it with no explanation to the group as to why, then yes I am afraid YTA.
---
&gt;But I really don't care. I give a shit about people suffering. But, I'm the fucking villain, right?
---
Cancelling your WoW sub will do literally nothing to address what is going on in China. It's to make yourself feel good, and it's okay to admit that.
---
Up vote the fuck out of this thread for blizzard to see.
---
Do they consider this an exploit? I don't want to get in any trouble
---
Pfff an insane one. I'm at work but you can find it on wowhead BIS pre raid for hunters.
---
I am sorry sir, but he was horde scum after all. ;)
---
Listen. These people who aren't answering are clowns. You tell the special named char to whisper party leader or make so and so who got the whisper oarty leader.
---
Just start typing /invite &lt;shift click name of char who whispered you&gt;
---
I'm 100% for letting druids and paladins work to collect gear sets and give them a try on bosses that the guild already has on farm mode. No reason not to. 
---
It's because people giving me a chance that I became a Tankadin back in BC.
---
Thanks! :D
---
This is how shit was, it's actually a lot better.  The average player is a lot better than the average player from vanilla.  Yes there is the revamped loot/talents from 1.13 vs true release, but the average player is better than the average vanilla player.  People might not be as good as others, but the average player in vanilla was quite dumb because information on how shit worked wasn't around as much.
---
1 health bar and twice the dmg tbf
---
I leveled the same way got anger management from arms and went deep prot. 3/3 Improved Revenge is still my favorite pickup in prot. Just to be able to stun a mob for a bit either in a dungeon or while leveling just feels good.
---
Because it's just annoying, and unnecessary. I've never had a problem getting a name without special characters on any game
---
The healer should have no issue whatsoever with split aggro in leveling dungeons if it's another warrior pulling aggro, just make sure to not overpull..
---
Cant believe people actually think everyone was nice in vanilla and there wasnt toxicity
---
A family that plays wow together stays together
---
Is seen about 10 human female mages on my server, with all different variations of things like frostitute ect, it's not just horde
---
100% This
---
IDK why no one believes it when we tell them.
---
Doesn't feel any different to me, either. Same old mix of fun, shenanigans, and the occasional asshole.
---
Yeah, until something decides to resist mind soothe -.-
---
The reason I say this is because in retail you get this solo mindset because you dont need to interact nicely with players, it literally doesn't matter at all, chances are you'll never see them again or ever group with them. It changes the way you play and how you interact with others.
---
Do you guys know that the word Twink means a fully geared and minmaxed level capped for a certain pvp bracket character ?
---
Do you also know twink is slang for young gay man?
---
Now you know.
---
SoC has a hard cap of 7ppm. You want the slowest 2hander you can get. If you have a 3.8s attack speed 2hander, you'll do roughly 16 attacks a minute. If you don't get one on your first 9 attacks, the next 7 attacks you do you'll proc SoC. This is the reason pallys want a slow weapon. A fast weapon has no benefit.
---
Yesterday I couldn't find a SM group as a healer, so I decided to switch gear and do a few runs as tank (paladin). One group in gen chat had been looking for a tank for armory since before my last run, so I whispered and joined up. The rest of the group is two warriors and two druids. Like, y'all don't need a tank. You need to find four other groups that need a tank. The warriors basically tanked our entire run anyway, often pulling the next group before the healer was ready.
---
The most important factor for any player in any game is playing something that motivates them beyond hitting max level. If you are motivated by pickpocketing, by exploring, by taming and training different kinds of pets, by starting a cult, or just becoming the best fisher - it's essential that you have more motivation than simply leveling or you will get bored.
---
Nonono, many other helmets are not upside down for tauren. why this one?
---
I have to say that I'd rather have BC. But I'm biased... i really enjoyed my dranaei shaman
---
Do you need some FR gear already to be able to do this?
---
I'm far from an expert, but would guess that you want to remove 2 points from lightning reflexes and put them into improved sinister strike.
---
Wtf man. Sulfuras is so boring compared to this stuff. Where are all my sulfuras boys at?
---
When I saw the thumbnail I immediately thought that this was a Skyrim screenshot
---
Depends entirely on what kind of reaction the Western audience has. This has to keep traction for 2 weeks. If it does, Blizzcon will be an absolute shit show and probably reach a critical mass.
---
The translation being "if you can't follow your principles and sense of decency *all* the time, why bother doing it at all?"... right?
---
There's some genius level mental gymnastics in this thread. Point those fingers wherever, say 'what about xyz, that's just as bad', justify it however you want. Making good choices in favour of what you think is right and your moral principles is never stupid just because you aren't consistent with it over the rest of your life. 
---
Cancel your account, don't cancel your account, I don't care. Just don't shit on people for doing what they think is right because you don't want to.
---
Yeah that's what I did, just wanted to show the community as a reminder it's just a game
---
As a resto I mostly use rank 4 healing touch. It is the lowest rank heal that has the full effect from +healing gear which makes it the most efficient
---
Not true. My server has seen twink items blow up at the same rate as all the stuff related to Dire Maul release.
---
I see 10-19 items like green gloves in the AH for over 100g. Cloaks are well over 20g. Boots are already at 30-60g. 
---
It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll pick these up for a couple silver. On first few days of release, maybe.
---
[https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fury-warrior-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow#phases-phase-3](https://classic.wowhead.com/guides/fury-warrior-dps-gear-bis-classic-wow#phases-phase-3) 
---
The next upgrade is in Phase 3 when BG's are implemented.  PvP shoulders are apparently an upgrade to truestrike.  They require rank 10 which will be a time investment for sure.
---
Can this be done with other bullets?
---
Yes. Same as other healers, downranking spells is a valuable way for druids to save mana once they have a lot of +healing or +spell power gear. It's not a thing for feral druids, of course.
---
14 years ago players didn't know which stats and gear were best for their character, now there are several lists of gear suggestions per class, phase, etc.
---
14 years ago players didn't know how to play their characters, now there are tons of guides, videos, streams, discord servers, and so on where players share suggestions, strategies, etc.
---
14 years ago players didn't know the various bosses' raid mechanics, now there are addons that alert you to things during the fight, videos explaining the entire encounter in depth before you even see the boss in-game, etc.
---
That said, I've still be surprised by the efficiency of random MC pugs I've joined so far. Every random assortment of 40 players has managed to one-shot Garr which I feel is at least somewhat impressive.
---
As the other guy said, don't worry about +raw damage stats before the 40s. Straight intellect or intellect/stamina (of the eagle I believe) pieces are perfect for leveling before then and even until 60. Especially as a warlock. As long as you have mana to cast your spells (intellect) and enough health to not get instantly oofed (stamina) you're perfectly fine for leveling. 
---
Stat balancing is only necessary at 60 for warlock. You're a leveling machine. Source: am a warlock.
---
Is thunderclap good? I thought it was terrible?
---
I try to Demo shout the mobs, wait for melee dps to reach mob, battle shout. Then tab sunder. Taunt / Mocking strike if I lose aggro.
---
However often even if I mark a mob with skull multiple people attack different mobs and then run away leaving me chasing mobs all over the room trying to regain aggro.
---
It seems to me that you wrote this thinking it was contradicting me, when it absolutely goes my way: it's easy to learn ONE partition. It's a hundred times harder to learn each piano key and to be able to improvise on the spot a melody, or to join people singing or playing.
---
PvE is learning a partition by heart. PvP is learning each key and how/when to use it.
---
They also censored their own forums and handed down bans to people with unsupportive comments, locked down their Reddit, removed the VOD from Twitch, and fired the casters who were interviewing him because they didn't stop him... It wasn't just one kid mouthing off
---
It wasn't the time or place for a political statement, but Blizzard politicised this far more than one Hearthstone player ever could.
---
They put themselves in an awkward position by showing everyone just how afraid they are of China...
---
People suck...I just try and imagine the type of person that wastes hours of their life waiting on herbs to respawn...oh wait..n/m.
---
Hijacking to ask For clarification if it also increases range power and therefore wand dmg?
---
Yeah, there was definitely a "main assist" rather than marks.
---
I believe you're referring to Battle Shout, which benefits more based on how many of your party you buff.  Demo shout is great for getting initial threat on a pack of mobs that doesn't have a target though.
---
OP:  In addition to your above mentioned rotation, make sure to pull the group you're fighting to a safe place in case you have runners or patrols.
---
Yeah, you're probably right
---
This isnt really political commentary though, its a human rights one.  The outrage is because blizzard has stated their profits are more important than human lives.  They didnt say the words, but their actions leave no alternative explanation.
---
I healed up to sunken temple with a full feral spec wearing healing gear. Once I started doing brd, I had to respec though
---
What mages are running over to attack a warlock? Even with the counter spell they will probably end up dead anyways.
---
As rare as it is, I think it's about 50 times more common than the mount.
---
I haven't played at mid-high lvls yet, so I could be very wrong here, but I was under the impression that a druid who knows what they're doing is top tier pvper. 
---
This is mostly from remembering that by far the most oppressive PvPer on my server in vanilla (Shadowmoon-US) was a Nelf Druid. Pretty sure every single hordie on the server was killed at minimum of 3 times in their lifetime by her.
---
Does it have a staff and say 'SHADOWCASTER' or the like as it's name? It's probably a caster.
---
Disciple? Priest? Medic? ETc.. the mobs are named like these.
---
This sounds good! Could be worth a try in my late 40s. Thank you
---
Scroll down for silence middle mouse button shadow form and scroll up for physic screams, scroll down is a really good reaction keybind
---
Tbh that group leader was stupid for several reasons especially because he didnt invited a high lvl dps who can off tank easily, and because arms is top tier aoe dps without down time unlike casters and their mana problem.
---
You should play on a PvE server if you feel that way.
---
The triple flame guard pulls in BRD. Those guys hit hard as fuck and my armor doesn‚Äôt mitigate shit. If DPS don‚Äôt focus it‚Äôs easy to die on that pull because the longer the fight, the more likely I am to get hit by a bad crit or two.
---
I had a mage 2 levels below me try and gank me, I'm leveling a priest, I killed him and he came back and didn't try to fight me again and I left him alone.  Only circumstance of a somewhat equal fight that I've had in my 40 levels so far.
---
Think his question means he wants to level op tailoring while making a buck out of it
---
Sounds like you need to be vaccinated.
---
Because people cant be 2005/2006 noobs in 2019? This has been farmed and theorycrafted for 10 years on pservers.
---
The problem is that Blizzard appolagized to China, which means they value more then freedom of expression. We are no longer in days where companies issue different products for different countries, so Blizzard is not going to make a seperate game for Chinese market which costs them money on development and a lot more money on streaming services like tournaments which have a worldwide audience. 
---
Instead they will censor the original game in hope of not offending China and you as an America or European player will suffer from Chinese censorship.
---
We as consumers should stand against such behaviour because if we let things like this slide more and more  companies are going to censor their products and we might come to a point where we can't choose between a censored and equivalent uncensored game from another publisher, or some other type of media
---
With Phase 2 it will drop from emperor with 20% not with 4% at Anger :&gt;
---
You cant hear pic........
---
I'd say bonebiter, it's better and you probably wanna do SM anyways.
---
Although with help from a friend WW axe is probably easiest to do.
---
Thats one clean raid frame setup, which addon are you using for this?
---
Wrong. My guild cleared the entirety of MC with 26-28 people shortly after BWL was released after only killing Razorgore. It was out of necessity because a dozen+ disgruntled people left the guild (ninja'd a few items on the way out) and took the free transfers off the server to start their own guild. The opening is what allowed me to join them, so not only did we clear it that week with a small raid team but a few people (like me) had never even defeated Rag prior.
---
Sure. Thats the idea. I wanna a duel. You did too. Thats great
---
Noted, my bad
---
For the longest time everyone has said that the only thing that can destroy blizzard is itself. I guess that‚Äôs actually coming true.
---
Whirlwind, cause as far as i know you also get your third stance as quest reward
---
"is this some kind of out of context April fools joke?" 
---
"uhhh ummm no?"
---
The whole shadow weave set is a huge upgrade for a while. Tailor can buy plans from vendor
---
moonglow looks pretty fun, how does it compare to hotw in pvp? I‚Äôm currently HOTW as a lvl 44 druid
---
This path is commonly used to attune players to molten core. When aggro drops you can jump to the lava and swim to the MC entrance. I used this a lot as a raid leader to escort new players in just before a raid.
---

There‚Äôs a mech chicken right to the left and you get it from said gnome

Not exactly sure what was going on or what I'm missing, I might just be dumb.. ;-;
---
Notice how I said to address the situation in China, not to financially hurt Blizzard a little bit. China don't give a single fuck about your economic protest of an American company, you're not doing anything to address people suffering by boycotting Blizzard lol
---
Arnt mount 80 gold at level 40 and 1000 gold at level 60? What are you talking about?
---
Ah man, I hope whoever publishes that newspaper is making some serious gold off of it. That's awesome. I gotta make an alt on that server. Never done an RP server in WoW, but this has made me want to.
---
Boo hoo hoo
---
Moonglow, Natures Grace and Imp Thorns are the main reason for going down the balance tree as a healer:) the rest of the points could be swapped around some for pvp, you could probably Google moonglow pvp
---
there is always some asshole trying to cheat and get an advantage, just play one account at a time and stop cheating
---
So with enough gear you wouldn't even use the top rank spells?
---
Wow holy shit ...
---
There's no priority for a lvl 24 blue dungeon item wtf rofl
---
Even if you are of the other faction ? Either way it seems silly to make a quest that can be so easily fucked up by other players and then ban them for it.
---
I've seen posts from people who bought six month subs who have refunded the remaining game time. I believe you have to submit a ticket. 
---
I'm not certain that there's recourse through bnet, so I'm not sure how that would look to move forward. 
---
It's all hearsay to me, I hope you can get a good internet pocket to clear it up, or enjoy your vacation and fix it when you get home since you wouldn't be playing during this time anyway? Sucks about the money/principle, but hopefully you're in good company and having a nice time :)
---
Shouldn't there be a point about the target's level in this? The main benefit to HS is that it cannot glance, which occurs on a significant number of your auto attacks and occurs at a rate based off of your weapon skill and the targets defense.    
---
I get it might not be impactful enough to matter, it just seems odd that there isn't a point where HS glance ignoring aspect doesn't push it above SA.
---
Perl Unitframes, KiwiPlates and BasicMinimap
---
Funny you say that. Hordes always wave when alone or run away when i get close but whenever they are more than 2 they always gank immediately and spam go back to retail and /laugh or /spit. Horde are the real sissie
---
Cant speak for rogue but hunters are one of the easiest classes to lvl up especially if your going beastmaster...druids are nice but kinda struggle with there dmg till lvl 20 as feral spec
---
Nah they‚Äôre independent of each other
---
I've been tanking dungeons and healing MC and Ony for few weeks with 20/31 holy prot build. Other paladins in my guild have the imp wisdom buff so i was able to skip it. The 5% spell crit is a mostly a loss for mana sustain but you can compensate for that with consumables.
---
That's fucking insane. Better carry on with my Jed / Rend runs. I thought 50 runs for MH / OH set was an investement. Gotta keep on going ...
---
Sooner or later our industries will have to choose to make business with nations that violates the human rights or not.

---
hit &gt; crit &gt; spellpower/shadow &gt; int &gt; stamina    
---
spirit is legit only for leveling.    
---
Why?    
---
Hit cause we have literally none of it    
---
crit cause most of our dps on bosses comes from critting with shadow bolt    
---
spellpower for raw damage increase, shadowbolt scales insanely well.   
---
int for mana nad crit, the more mana you have the longer you can cast without tapping and wasting gcds    
---
stamina so you actually live through stuff and have a resource to tap from when you're low on mana (also healers often overheal you so thats a waste of resources)
---
With how long it has taken you, you might consider just farming gold and buying a reserve run -- there's usually a few groups selling it on my server during peak hours
---
Weakauras and and cooldown trackers also absolutely give an advantage to players who have them over those who don't. Personally, I would prefer if there just weren't addons at all; everyone plays the exact same game and advantages aren't given by how elaborate you have modified your ui. However, I'm not naive enough to think that would ever happen. 
---
There is a line there somewhere as to what is giving too much of an advantage but it is so fuzzy that nothing can really be done about it. Keeping track of a cooldown which would by default be an icon on my ui with a swipe animation is a bit different than having a combat log window open so you can constantly monitor it for other player activity simply because of the amount of mental processing it would take to monitor it. Be default there wouldn't be some ding noise alerting me to there presence telling me that have to start paying attention, I would have to be paying attention continuously from the start.
---
These are my opinions and I understand that they are likely not shared by other players and I've accepted that the game will never be as 'pure' as I would like it to be. I'm not trying to champion a change to the system. Hell, this is a 100% "if you can't beat em, join em situation" as I myself use gear swap addons, weakauras, and I'll probably get Spy too. Not because I want to, not because I think they are fair, but because I feel that I MUST use them to keep up with all the other people who do. Ultimately that is what I really don't like, feeling forced to use these just to be on the same level as other players.
---
maybe you play on US servers, a country where people tend to be assholes by mentality in any case
---
So pretty early on then!
---
Of course I won't.
---
Again, it's all about understanding obvious concepts based on their equally obvious context.
---
Maybe it was a server thing, but back in Vanilla, Deadmines was VC and Dire Maul (in general) was DM.
---
Again, based on context (ie.: a level ~20 or anyone in Westfall) DM can certainly stand for Deadmines, but VC *always* stands for Deadmines and no one ever called SFK "AA", afaik...
---
Or the 1% like me that do honorable wpvp knowing it is the highest level of playing wow
---
Currently leveling a warlock but trying to decide between warrior and druid alt so I can do some tanking to help people/get quicker groups.  I LOVED druid during TBC/Wrath but basically ignored PVP altogether back then and am now planning to pvp a lot more.  I hear druid has a high skill cap so really good players can do some really cool stuff, but how about the other side of the coin?  As an inexperienced and more casual player just playing this as an alt, how would you rate the druid vs the warrior in terms of new player pvp friendliness?
---
I don't know how you feel about this but try the pre-owned shops.
---
CEX, Cash con, Cash Gen etc and keep an eye out. There have been some new laptops / machines that have come out in the tech world so upgraders are selling decent machines in the current climate.
---
I have only ever bought a brand new system once in my life and that was because I needed a machine for Uni work, the pre-owned market has always served me well.
---
Your girl is taking that hip to waist ratio thing way to seriously.
---
This is not even close to accurate.
---
Not much help, but same thing seems to be happing to a few melee in our raid team. Would love to see if anyone knows why
---
I tried solo strealting to IF to kill some scubs and it was impossible to survive after initial kill. I was flooded with guards
---
My above statement is true between basically every single pull when we have a mage, every few pulls or more without, depending on how long each pull lasts and how many mobs etc etc
---
as a fellow rogue get the devilsaur set, it will let you not worry about hands and legs for all of phase 1
---
yes you want to pick up NS gloves or Aged Core leather and bloodfang pants at some point but they end up being way down on the importance list. allowing you to focus more on other things depending on your guilds loot system
---
I‚Äôll try that tonight though it does work sometimes
---
I still do this with flametongue on a 48 ele shaman
---
Paladin has a neat couple of spells for healing locks.  
---
Sadly I haven't played Shaman enough to know what your toolkit properly entails. you have a totem that does some minor healing right?
---
But he arrived in seal form. That‚Äôs the cheeky part.
---
How is this not getting more attention? It's been bugged like this since launch and it is not getting fixed. Kind of lost my interest in playing classic, I have a level 60 pala and since reckoning is not working I'm only effective at being a healbot. 
---
It only works when you turn off your auto attack. If you are hitting something and get crit it just resets your swing, so if you get crit at the end of your swing it doesn't do shit. Having to spam a macro for it to function is not how it is supposed to work.
---
Take my upvote, dad
---
My typical strategy is to put the void walker on a mob, then attack another mob(drain tank it), then kill the mob the void was attacking. I rarely out agro the void on the second mob. Most of the time I use the second mob to top up HP/MP.
---
Damn that addon is pretty nice. I will try it out for sure. At least trying it solo it just seems amazing.
---
I will try it out in an ubrs or something today.
---
"I saw one dude being an ass so I'm gonna assume most of them are and that this is some kind of crysis caused by retail behavior"    
---
Read this out loud and try to take yourself seriously for a second.
---
Yeah its tedious but worth it, at least for the mage/priest chest. If you go herb you don't have to worry about another tedious profession to level, 1-300 in a single day is pretty easy to do
---
Every single time I've bought wifi it starts out great and then turns to shit once everyone gets bored and decides to buy it.

They give you a good understanding, a foundation to base decisions on as also are you pvp or pve and what is your focus going to be Affliction, Demonology, or Destruction which all change depending on pve or pvp as well.
---
Classic = Choices, it's why Classic f'ing rocks! Everything is debatable and personal preference, but you need to have a basic understanding some sort of foundation to build from.
---
That guard at 0:14 had no chill for your shenanigans.

Did it allow for more taps, or less?

---
Neat but id add a description as to what youre linking instead of just a link.
---
Unless you just Google the easy strat I would argue figuring out 4 specific mechanics to beat 4 hard encounters represents a certain degree of class mastery. It doesn't make you a pro hunter but at the least it shows you a few cool tricks of your class.
---
It's not.
---
Sure you do, just look at Asmongold.
---
Are you a part of the Discord?
---
I was thinking just make a guild tabard that looks the [part](http://tabard.gnomeregan.info/tabard.php?icon=emblem_128&amp;border=border_05&amp;iconcolor=dfa55a&amp;bgcolor=006391&amp;bordercolor=f9cc30&amp;faction=Horde).
---
I‚Äôm aware, but if you lose 2 it‚Äôs a long run back.
---
Like I said before, many Addons spoil aspects of the game.
---
94 bolts of mageweave. **185** 15 Crimson Silk Vests **200** 5 Crimson Silk Pantaloons **205**
---
You‚Äôll need 470 Mageweave Cloth, 80 Bolts of Silk Cloth, 30 Fine Thread, 40 Red Dye and 30 Silken Thread.
---
but its also not important at all in a raid setting so theres that.
---
I always tell my healers to let me know if they would prefer me to use my swordnboard over my 2H. I feel it would be discourteous to just dump extra responsibility on the healer  without their permission.
---
That said, I've run across two types of healers. The first prefers me to use my swordnboard because they are inexperienced at healing or aren't very geared, and they want to avoid drinking after each pull. Two, good healers, who ask me to use my 2H, because it makes the run faster and makes healing actually take some thought.
---
For people without jobs/friends/families
---
Nah man we're not hating you without any reason, we just think that abominations like you should stay in the ground where they belong, I just love how undead think they have a right to exist.
---
Just get a good laptop ?
---
Or any laptop since Classic runs on a potato
---
Your level 19 rogue has more health than my level 42 priest..
---
The company literally has manifestos on their front door containing " think globally" and "every voice matters".  And you also talk about gaming world,  where games about literal politics happen.   Overwatch,  a force to enforce politics.   How dumb are you?
---
"There's always another Rogue"
---
And that‚Äôs all we need!
---
Mage represent.
---
Damn, I was going to do this to get the tiawanese off whitemane
---
How do you play a mage in a low level dungeon group? 
---
I have a 23 mage, going frost spec. My dps is always way behind everyone else and I have to drink all the time. My main DPS is just frostbolt/wand with occasional fire blasts weaved in. My AoE is really lack luster and costs too much mana so that doesn't seem viable.
---
Yeah and I started an alt priest with alchemy so I'm thinking I can feed him herbs to lvl it up. Just also may be interested in engineering lol. I'm so undecided! Just want to pick up something I can use while I'm still out questing anyways.
---
Deja classic stats. Although I hate that feature and turn it off, lol.
---
if you are raiding the first real upgrades that is plate comes from AQ
---
as a fury warrior you are basically a rogue in terms of itemization because so much plate is focused on tanking
---
if you are not raiding/PVPing True strike are BIS for all of vanilla
---
Time for a slick new laptop?
---
Having a blast being a full tank spec Feral at 60, still need that damn Pristine Hide and Slaghides of the Monkey/Defense though..
---
Also by the way for the Ferals that have managed to get a OT raid spot and want to have a full Feral build instead of HotW: 
---
YOU CAN quite easily heal all 5-mans (+UBRS with another healer) with having zero healing talents aside from the 20% Int. Just run with people you know, won't be enough to keep a braindead PUG that does everything wrong alive but otherwise it's surprisingly smooth (just remember to have AD biscuits with you for now because you'll be drinking to fill your enormous mana pool all the time).
---
This is a clearly for the "ma! fine! I only need 5 more minutes!"
---
Just to write it down if anyone every has the same problem. My fix was to delete /rename the WTF and Cache folder. Aftwards HealComm directly worked like a charm. I think some other UI addon I have tested before blocked something
---
&gt;You are weak. Do you really value playing a video game that much? Have some sense of morals
---
Go fuck yourself? You know NOTHING about me, where I come from or what my morals are. 
---
&gt; Think about how the people suffering in Hong Kong feel. Think about how you would feel if you lived in HongKong 
---
I sympathize with them, I really do. That being said, me turning off my Blizzard account is going to do NOTHING to stop what happens in China. Zero. Zilch.
---
&gt;  I'll play out my sub but if blizzard doesn't try to fix this I'm deleting my account and never coming back 
---
"I'll play out my sub" - So your moral backbone only stretches as long as you're not losing out on anything you paid for? If you were REALLY passionate about it, you wouldn't play out your sub. 
---
"if blizzard doesn't try to fix this" - How? How does Blizzard fix anything? Even if they give the guy his money back AND reinstate him as a Grandmaster AND hire back the two commentators AND issue a really sad "We're sorry!" letter, it still doesn't do anything to ease the people in Hong Kong's suffering. Remember? The ones you care so much about?
---
Tell you what, sport. Why don't you donate the $15 USD that you'd be paying in subscription fees to support the Hong Kong protestors. Do it every month until they enjoy the same civil liberties that we do.
---
Can you do that? WILL you do that? or does your moral code only allow for empty gestures that float along with the latest "we're so mad" trend?
---
The answer is PvP, horde about 60+% pve, it's alliance.
---
As a general rule.
---
Thanks man, you're right. I would rather listen to people like yourself who are killing it.
---
Yes, it is. Even more so when you consider how well WW Axe synergizes with axe and 2h weapon specializations from the Arms tree.
---
Don't mistake me not being interested in running around cleaning up after you for not being able to do it. My approach is a result of doing exactly that.. DPS refusing to wait the literal seconds.. *seconds*.. needed to just make everything work and me having to recover on every single pull. Then they use the reasoning of "it's fine we didn't die" to keep doing it. 
---
If I'm doing something challenging and that's needed? Fine. Fun even! Doing it because you're a shit DPS who doesn't know how to do your job is *not* fun, so learn how to play.
---
Holy shit I‚Äôm famous! Hi Gunek, it‚Äôs Kek :D

---
Yep just bury that head as far in the sand as you can and keep paying for that subscription.
---
No it is not. You have no proof or comparisons to make. You just want it to be this way.
---
Bear in mind its running on the new engine though which has better view distance, shaders, shadows, water etc. Still looking absolutely fantastic though.
---
For HoJ I cant remember what those groups were charging, usually there is a small fee per run and the runners get all non-reserve loot to vendor for their time, and then you pay the total fee when the item drops. If I had to guess its probably 100-150g for it but I may be way off
---
*laughs in Bloodsail Buccaneers.*
---
To be fair, the only realistic way to get invited to MC as a paladin is if you're the GM. He knew what he was doing.
---
Dead on..im not a dick un general although i can be...but i help peeps, if i aoe down groups and im in a quest zone ill invite the odd dude who needs them.    
---
I got that Dont gove a fck attitude, you shit on me? Dont care.   
---
You steal my mobs, dont care, ill roll a joint while you get the next 2 or 3 pulls.
---
Can i bandage the hunter?
---
LMAO! This is great. Thanks for the laughs :')
---
As a life long druid, for some reason this comment really made me chuckle.
---
Agreed on this point. As a bear tank, I always try to get that free agro from warlock tapping. That said, two locks would drain my mana faster than it regens. As long as they are above 60% hp they're fine unless it's a fight where they're definitely going to take damage.
---
As a rogue when is the optimal point in the energy tick to open?
---
lol, ya. I'm just cracking jokes. I've levelled warriors before and I'm doing alright :)
---
I mean, if you stopped wasting all your rage making these threads you'd have enough to not lose aggro. Just a thought
---
Map show land. Player no see land.
---
It has nothing to do with faction.
---
The who like to gank roll in groups and prefer to set up situations where they can't lose, horde or alliance its the same.
---
Yes maybe, but the goal here is not the be "the perfect DPS", and I find 2H weapons incredibly boring when you don't have abilities to play with :)
---
I also prefer wearing a shield for damage reduction.
---
What is great with Rockbiter is that you don't have to get strength on your gear.
---
With my 1H (50 DPS) + Rockbiter : 110 DPS
---
With my 2H (60 DPS) + Rockbiter : 118 DPS
---
I honestly have no hate toward blizzard. I have played a small amount of WoW. I just wanted to share this since it was in the osrs r/
---
I did nothing but tank BRD from 54-57. Started off just doing everything up to 7D (so angerforge, golem, incedius, arena, bar room boses) and once I got to 56 or had a stronger group we would finish the whole thing off with Emp. The whole instance is super easy compared to private servers the torch room is a joke. There's legit about 8 upgrades in BRD to snag for feral tank too btw. At 57 I then did nothing but LBRS (3 boss or full). At 58 as long as you have decent gear you should be able to get a spot in almost any dungeon as a tank since were so in demand.
---
hunter here! guess i'm spraying and praying when i shoot at &gt;40 yards =p
---
I have seen really good twinks destroy far higher level players with ease so they can actually dominate assuming they are geared well.
---
I would also like to know
---
maybe u are speaking about dance trinket? if yes - yes, it works this way :( instead of normal dancing
---
Imaginary Places by Busdriver.
---
Don't be disappointed if you can't get it consistently. It still works but it is much more difficult than it was in retail vanilla.
---
Not for AH either and just picking up the weapons that drop DE the rest. Why? Because weapons sell to vendor for insanely more than armor.
---
This is my plan going to test it tonight.
---
Yeah dang guys my escape artist just isn‚Äôt good enough with my more interact, having fear ward isn‚Äôt strong enough nor is having stone form on top of that. *crying and sobbing* and the undead he came up to me and used his absolutely useless fear resist because I can‚Äôt fear him anyways. And then he ate my corpse. Then when I Rezed a tauren he stunned me for 1 whole second. Then an orc he took more dmg because that‚Äôs what his ability essentially does. Then a troll he regend health a bit faster. *sniffles* 
---
https://youtu.be/onPL3dBYKmw
---
LOS agro, so just running by something is one of the lowest agro generators out there.  Some mobs like murlocs share agro with nearby enemies of the same type.  So basically he gathered up a bunch of murlocs, ran them by where you were fighting and they jumped you.
---
Nice.
---
what is ur average ghost/h?
---
killtrack addon -  [https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/killtrack](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/killtrack) 
---
there is a classic option in the files section
---
... how do those addons tell if the player is from the opposite faction? Do they do that? I don't know where that info would be in the combat log at all.
---
Warlocks are going to be rough, especially one with a felhunter out to eat up your hots. I'd say, even if you start in cat, you have to swap to bear, to bash, or feral charge the fear (or engineering bomb if you have it). Maybe even throw rank 1 thorns up after your hots. Iirc, the felhunter has like a 6 sec cd on eating a buff, and you'd rather have him eat that. Even in bear, he can just death coil you into fear, too... So... Yeah it's a tough matchup.
---
You actuallu have to kite him through mobs this way, compared to sitting on the ledge afk
---
oh yeah sorry i forgot people want to roflstomp trough current content at a rate of 1 raid clear per 5min.
---
We have Google for these things.  Other players and world chat are not your personal Google.

IMO take skinning, it's a fantastic way to fill up bags and make extra money. Herbalism is good too, but lots of wasted time running around.
---
United States based companies should back United States based principles and not kowtow to a foreign nation.  Full stop.
---
Gone through all of them and it unfortunately hasn't changed anything.
---
Different people have different schedules, so you can't expect friends to slow down and wait for you. If they want to do it voluntarily, great. If they can give you a hand occasionally when you need it, that's good, but don't put expectations on other people. The game starts at 60, and once you're both max level, you can do whatever together. Leveling is more an independent/personal journey.
---
People were like this in vanilla too, nothing to do with retail.
---
I personally think this addon should be banned. Not a fan
---
Dude, dpsing wuth some shaman tank is honestly not fun at all. You can barely hit the mob without ripping off. No point using consumes or workd buffs. The raid takes 4√∑ hours.How long is your guild going to deal with slogging thru the content?  All so you can feel special.
---
&gt;Anyone who says warlocks shouldn't expect life tap heals in dungeons should drink some spoiled milk honestly.
---
Its funny because most good warlocks say that.
---
&gt; Any warlock that heals himself with drain life in an instance is doing bottom dps. 
---
You seem to think drain life is the only thing a warlock can do to manage health. Maybe thats your problem.
---
I never said it did. I just said that on my realm the opposite happens (in STV).
---
If you are playing your PUG BRD runs like you were doing Mythic Plus 15, I am sure the ultimate optimal method for maintaining top trash dps is to rely on your healer to constantly top you off. Since most people are not, and since the best rule of PUG play is to maintain a playstyle that isn't dependent on other people playing exactly like you want them to, not depending on heals is probably a pretty good thing if you want to make friends. 
---
I am not saying I drain life all the time, I am saying that if I am low on life from tapping between fast pulls but high on mana, opening with DoTs and a drain life is an easy way to keep ressources high while maintaining a decent clear speed and not having to drink. As for your claim that good groups will kill mobs by the second drain proc, not sure in what universe you are killing full trash pulls within the 3 seconds but it certainly isn't in by PUGs.
---
Yes, you can.
---
I went for alliance for classic wow because i wanted a change. I miss that view :)
---
Sort of mandatory tbh.
---
Already not enough herbs in the world on servers with their populations and the diminished layers.

Expect Lotus to sky rocket in phase 2 if the spawn timer is not made dynamic.

Just a thought experiment. How would you feel if every time you walked past a bench, you had to sit on it for a few seconds?

what is the best alch money maker now from transmuting?
---
arcanite
---
and what else?
---
undeath to water
---
"What should I be killing first?".  
---
- "Do you see the guy with the brown hair and the staff, right next to the guy with the sword? That one!".  
---
Yeah that's so much better than just  marking a target...  
---
At least put a skull on the primary. The tank is the one who pulls and the one dictating the kill order. That's his job. If the tank doesn't know the dungeon well enough someone else can assist.  
---
Your approach just makes the run more difficult, longer and just begs to end in an argument or worse.
---
I'm thinking I may take mining for now and hold the mats then grab engineering once I get my robe of the archmage crafted.
---
There's a console command that unlocks the zoom distance to whatever value you give it. Don't have it on hand but Google it
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Oh Gawd you so funny bro. 
---
FFS, what a childish and immature brigading clique follower you are.
---
When in doubt, always attack the person posting facts that go against the propaganda clique by trying to portray the person as mad.
---
Thing is, I really couldn't give a shit, I'm not going to blindly follow moronic sponsored state propaganda without first trying to see the other side of the story.
---
Nothing of what I've said is untrue, none of it.
---
What quest is it? And where?
---
That wasn't directed at you so much as everyone who sees it.
---
Its still only skipping three packs that take like 30 seconds to kill.
---
I agree that they didn't have a choice although I think they went overboard with the punishment and that costs them severely. I don't think that's wrong though. Maybe a miss judgement but their reasoning for doing it is completley just.
---
If someone gets into combat with a bunch of mobs and runs away, those mobs will leash and reset. However, if someone else is in combat with them (like you) they will swap to that person instead.
---
Alternatively if the mage is grouping up the mobs and bringing them to you, then casting frost nova the mobs will be rooted in place and attack whatever is near them (i.e. you).
---
Oh man I can hear the music now! Can't wait to roll my first dwarf as an alt!
---
I had skinning and got rid of it lol. Skinning didn't seem like it was worth the time as a mage.
---
Most people don't care about politics or foreign drama and just want to play video games. While I can dislike what Blizzard did, I'm not going to gimp myself because of it. Especially knowing it won't make a difference because China money &gt; all.
---
Sadly it won't drop that low as it's still BIS and it's BOE and it drops off the least commonly farmed level range of mobs but it'll sit comfortable at 200-300
---
Hunters I get as I understand they're pretty much OP at 19. My main is a Hunter though so I'd rather try something else, but why Rogues and War?
---
By my understanding Rogues aren't great vs. classes with a lot of armor and bear form gives you armor and can't you just kite warriors in caster form as they only have Charge and no Intercept?
---
You can make a separate loot channel to separate it out from your guild/ raid/ party/ local spam. Make everyone do /join APESloot for example. Only people in the chat channel will eligible for loot and you shouldnt miss rolls and it should speed up the loot distribution a bit.
---
What's a good starting point for Dreadsteed quest runs in DM to use someones summoning mats?
---
You can also just get a friend(s) and do DM N runs sped up to insanely fast speeds with Mind Soothe pathing.
---
Have a mage in my guild names Gandolfthegay, I always chuckle when he logs on
---
Also try the independent IT shops.   
---
I have a local guy who's business involves going to companies that are upgrading and he pays a small amount for the equipment on the basis that he moves them.   
---
These companies will upgrade every other year, schools and other organizations will do it too so have a chat to your local guy, let him know your budget and see what can be done.
---
haha I was just going to say the same thing.
---
You generated more threat by fighting than he did by running next to them, which is why they jumped you as they got closer, your threat became larger than his and you took the aggro.
---
Warlock main in vanilla.  Holy paladin in classic now.  If a warlock wont drink when I'm drinking I will say they need to drink when I drink or they get kicked or I leave.  Otherwise lifetap away as far as I'm concerned.  If tank is taking too much damn to spare a heal on lock or I getting low on mana though they wont be getting heals for lifetaps.
---
I've actually had to kick a warlock for not drinking, barely life tapping, and wanding a lot.  Told him to lifetap if he needs and that he needs to drink/eat when I drink or I kick him.  Refused to drink, even though we had a mage in the group give him food/water.  I've only had to kick two warlock so far in classic though.
---
So, I mostly agree with you. If somebody in the group offers an alternate way of doing something, I'm always down for trying. I may be leading the group as a tank, but that doesn't mean I know the best way to do everything.
---
That being said, if no communication is made, then yes, "you pull it, you tank it" is the norm. I will let people tank something, and advise the healer not to heal them. I still keep an eye on the situation to protect the healer and other dps, but if you are going to pull without communicating it to me, you deserve your fate.
---
And if you disagree with this, fine, that's your right. Just as it is our right as tanks to then not tank for you. And you'll find most tanks agree with me on this point.
---
It may kill you as well
---
It is, but man what a sacrifice for PVP.
---
See, that‚Äôs what I was thinking... MH Dal‚Äôrend‚Äôs is on reserve for every UBRS run and it‚Äôs a 3% drop. If the gap isn‚Äôt that huge then I‚Äôd rather go for something else. I was debating Heartseeker for main hand but with arcanite bars at 60-80g on my server, that puts it well out of my budget. Is the best bet just for me to farm barman‚Äôs shanker? I‚Äôm worries that someone would get upset if I used it in a raid and the proc took up a debuff slot though.
---
With a full group... Sure. I didn't take a full group to attune players, I took that player.
---
I mean. 2v1 is usually a dream for me on my server. Because the alliance only come out and pvp when they have 3-50 people behind them. And then tell me I‚Äôm bad at the game when I camp them. It‚Äôs really weird.
---
example, ubrs, what should you kill first 
---
casterdragons/assassins&gt;big dragons&gt;orcs
---
in rend room you should focus whelps&gt;rest 
---
how fucking hard is this shit exactly?
---
I really can't wait to level my hunter, EuroGyroHero.
---
Just a small sidenote, in old wow shadowmeld does not drop combat as far as I can remember, only usable out of combat ;)
---
Someone must really love PVP to sacrifice so much for that build.
---
That's a huge Orc
---
That's a good question. I think it's more out of habit than anything else; it's one thing to go cold turkey from the game, but my curiosity still has me look up the subreddit for it and classic from time to time just to see what's going on.
---
Is it wrong to keep occasional tabs on a game even when you don't play it..?
---
Leatrix Plus (addon) has an option to extend view distance even more.
---
Pick pocket can be good money, as it‚Äôs just one click before you kill and loot, giving you a little bit extra to your actual take away.  Pocket loot tables have cash, grey trash, healing potions and boxes.  Boxes have poison reagents gems and the tiny chance at epic weapons.  Boxes are also required to increase your race holt rep with a repeatable lockbox turn in quest
---
Pickpocket will not make you rich, but is an easy way to make you more money faster
---
Off the top of my head and if I recall correctly.
---
\#showtooltip
---
/cast [target=mouseover,harm]Polymorph;[target=mouseover,help]Remove Curse;[harm]Polymorph;[help]Remove Curse;[target=player]Remove Curse
---
Bonus Remove Curse on yourself if not targeting anyone, if only for the sake of not having a "?" tooltip.
---
Perfect! TYSM!
---
Depends on spawns. Guarantee you it's more than anywhere else  if you're a class that can easily &amp; quickly do bosses it's a nice supplement.   I'd say I averaged 25-30 per hour. Got epic mount from it
---
I don't know what you mean by partition. But no non-trivial piano piece is easy to learn, each builds upon a foundation of hundreds or thousands of hours of practice. In theory you could learn it by figuring out what you have to do step by step, but really it's a common body of mechanical dexterity that you've previously trained in yourself that you rely on to play a piece - at which point that piece is easy.
---
The point I was really making is that it takes a lot of time training muscle memory and learning to focus attention to be able to perform a piano piece. I gave an oversimplified description of how to learn a piano piece, to suggest that it's possible you were oversimplifying boss fights.
---
To expand, yes you can learn what a boss will do and learn to act accordingly, but maybe it's not easy to act accordingly. Perhaps you have to avoid specific areas on the map while not clumping up too many players into the same area. This is something you can learn but maybe it takes a number of attempts until everyone's able to do this. Once you can do this, it's easy. But it might not be easy to someone who's never encountered the boss before.
---
I've not played since wotlk so I've no idea what kind of things blizz are asking people to do in retail - it's entirely possible that as you say they're not in any way difficult for even a beginner, but it's also possible that having learnt to do whatever is required, you no longer find it hard to do what is required.
---
It shows you know how to watch YouTube videos lol
---
Yeah instead of fighting the real problem lets instead spend all our focus fighting some company trying to avoid a political nightmare(and ironically causing one by doing so), instead of you know helping hong kong citizens or fighting the chinese government.
---
Ayyyy a fellow Incendius player. Was questing last night on my alt when this exact convo happened
---
You can turn in the bullets and exchange them for arrows.
---
This is when Natural Selection takes into effect.
---
2 Warlocks. That there is your issue, I try to avoid having another Warlock in a 5-man if possible. Its doable but not ideal. You will both be competing for heals with the tank which will cause the party to drink more often slowing things down. 
---
I often have a healer who doesn't want to heal me or tells me to drink. Usually some simple communication clears that up, if you heal me we kill things faster and have less downtime between pulls. Warlocks are very mana inefficient but lifetap scales with +spell power so they are able to recover more mana the more power they have. This usually means that they do not have a high intellect or stamina rating so a HoT is usually enough to put them in good position to keep going while giving you time to regenerate mana or focus on the Tank.
---
Another thing is Warlocks do not like being at full health. Demon Armor regenerates a small HP/5 so to avoid having that go to waste I will always LT a little. Keep the Lock at ~90% or less and don't top them off to save mana. Also avoid over healing if possible and scale down your spells.
---
Can anyone give me any tips at handling multiple mobs as an enhancement shaman? Currently level 48.
---
If it wasn't such a pain to reroll... this sounds like a great server!
---
yeah I love IF too - I was thinking that as more folks raid that IF will switch to being back in action.  But I have been asking a few friends (on other servers) and they are saying their IF's are also 'not what they used to be'  time will tell!
---
but then i have to share.
---
Yeah it's a zero sum game 4shore, worse things have happened, so no one is allowed to be mad at blizzard or they're BAD lmao
---
I would say the number of servers that are still layered is a better counterpoint to your argument than any anecdotal evidence anyone could provide. 
---
Sure, the population isn't as crazy as it originally was, both because some people have stopped playing and because some people are now playing less daily than they were the first 2-3 weeks, but all the evidence I've seen points to the game still going strong. And either way, it was obviously a slam dunk for Blizzard - subscription revenues tripled literally overnight for a game that they made 15 years ago. It doesn't get better than that - if companies could simply re-sell their old products for massive profits like Blizzard is currently doing, then they could reduce their personnel by 50% and make just as much money, which would be a ludicrous business model.
---
On my server it seems to be SW too, instead of IF
---
Oh shut up.
---
Jesus Christ I actually felt like vomiting after reading that choking virtue signalling space cadet crap, get a life ffs.
---
Whats up with those shoulders? I've never twinked, but are there really no better ones for rogues at lvl 19? :)
---
If you aren't running into mana issues, then i say throw the CoA on 'em. If you are constantly running low on mana then you might want to remove it from the rotation.
---
Eh I only ever played NE once so. Good to know
---
Get em bowing down to China nice and earlier, congratz!
---
1/100^3
---
It will not be hard for blizzard to find employees. at. All. Dont take what I'm saying the wrong way, blizzard is def the asshole in this story, but if you think this will affect hiring for them you are out of touch. Blizzard is a top tier choice for many many many graduates and they will never struggle when it comes to getting skilled people.
---
I'm going to miss this world PVP when BGs come out. As I recall, people who loved to PvP pretty well stopped world PVP after the BGs came out in vanilla.
---
What server and will this happen again, please say yes!
---
Thank you!
---
I honestly do not understand why some warrs lvl as prot. There is literally no incentive, no added value, less damage and it takes 5 times longer to lvl and quest!
---
You can tank ANY instances pre-raid as arms or fury. The only reason I see people going for that is personnal preferences, which is fine.
---
Wow now that‚Äôs a great name
---
He said from his Android...
---
thank you!
---
No, not until a certain level.
---
I think at 200 engineering you can either choose to be a Goblin or Gnomish engineer. (at gadgetzan).
---
both have different benefits and different stuff you can make.
---
Goblin is usually chosen by the PVPers and Gnomish by the PVEers.
---
Check wowhead if you want to go into detail.
---
Didn't know there was any circumstance in which you can drop aggro in an instance, til.
---
I find it depends on the level spread of your server, higher level people gravitate towards IF for the faster travel times to Ony, MC, BRD, BRS, etc.
---
I leveled 1-60 with skinning and mining, I got my epic mount 3 days after I dinged 60. You're choice.
---
I sympathize with you. The entire reason I became a tank back in BC was because I, as a dps, was tired of slow tanks that had little to no idea what they were doing. I felt I could do it better. So I did.
---
Not all tanks are bad, and it seems you had a bad string of them. Don't condemn all tanks for that, but by all means, go out there and show them what you can do as a Feral. Groups will love you for it.

---
Bloodvine set will be bis for mages later and you need 300 tailoring for it. Unless you want to level tailoring again I‚Äôd keep it for now.
---
I didn't assume the issue was you.
---
&gt; The only reason I can see is that I make mistakes after not playing the game for so long
---
...but you just made it clear that it was.
---
&gt; I clearly tell groups this is first time running or third time or what ever so they are aware
---
What difference do you think that makes, really? Just because you tell people you're a noob, you get a free pass to suck? Sorry, but that's not how it works.
---
Making mistakes is normal if you're new to the game, just like getting negative reactions from other players is normal.
---
What isn't normal is that you take negative reactions you get and deserve so personal.
---
Pretty much
---
Fellow rogue here.  Picking pockets can be great money.  It adds up when you pull a few silver off of every mob, not including anything you can get from the junkboxes they carry.
---
Ask again in r/wallstreetbets
---
For the most part. But definitely whichever faction that ends up with more players usually ends up more aggressive playing solo. More helpful strangers around makes them emboldened.
---
Hmm interesting, cheers for the info ill research it
---
Harder enemies take a lot more time and is more risky. The small amount of extra exp is not worth it.

I don't think your example will work quite like it is either. While it may work for equip/remove, the use line will fail because trinkets with a Use: ability have a cooldown after equipping them.

Never knew this was a Radiohead song
---
Thank you for that. I've done some BRD but only the interrogator, the hound master and arena. I seem to get chunked hard on trash so I think I need some upgrades from somewhere lower first maybe
---
This is bad advice and bad practice. You are actively weakening your groups strengths based on some strange ideals. More heals on the Warlock = more damage. More damage = faster kills. Faster kills = less healing on tank. Less healing on tank = more mana for you. More mana for you = less time between pulls. I don't need to go on
---
Looks like a sad metal penis.
---
Worth noting, this is only an increase in speed if the apex mob in the formation of guards nearest to the ramp in the room with the lock has a level 52 mob on the apex.  Otherwise a level 60 can actually walk between the two packs with out aggro int anything and hit the lock.
---
Also if you have a priest or rogue it‚Äôs faster too.

What's dead may never die or wake. Works out
---
No one does it for the "challenge," they do it because it makes everything easier and allows you to level much faster.  People aren't paying extra for a hard mode.
---
Probably because five people *objectively* do more damage than one, which is why people have a problem with multiboxing. You can one-shot enemies with one spell, which isn't how the game was meant to be played.
---
Multiple people have pointed this out to you by now.
---
Similar happened to me. Engaged a warri as feral. Recognized after him being at half HP that he's afk. Disengaged. Warri charges after me &amp; a shaman joins killing me. Worst thing: GF sitting next to me and I literally explained to her that this is good attitude not killing AFK people.
---
Yeah because instead of fucking mages, they fuck their mouth.

There is so much wrong with your comment, Im not even sure where to begin.  Ill just say this, the present climate in China and the ongoing issue in Hong Kong are not issues with two sides.  There is right and there is wrong.  This is not Republican vs Democrats where you can hold perhaps differing but valid opinions.  China is actively committing human rights violations and the entire civilized world condemns it.  This would be like companies firing employees for speaking out about those involved in the Rwandan genocides.  I would point out blizzards action began against someone who wasnt even their employee.  Blizzard is within their legal rights to take whatever position they want, but you are completely out of line to believe this is normal or expected behavior for a company.

Dps pulling isn't the issue here. A good tank will let dps pull if the situation warrants it (like the aforementioned bats).
---
The issue is that the dps didn't communicate his intentions and get confirmation from the tank prior to doing so. To be fair, the tank was a bit of a baby about it, and I would have simply had a discussion with the dps after the pull, and I'm betting both of us would've come out ahead from that.

Well, I know for a fact that you can transform the bullets into arrows from a repeatable quest in your capital city, so that's not really an issue.

Yeah, the endgame weapons for hunters will be Rhok'delar (for now) and then, pretty much crossbows!

I'll probably wait for the DM release and see how thorium prices change, if they get to an acceptable level (like, &lt;1g for one stack of bullets), I might wait on going engineering.

Please, keep up with the dad gamer posts, they are great.
---
How does Saruman even work here. Poor dude's stuck on the wrong side
---
No doubt it was on the market for 25g but do you have sales data on it? Tbh it's a pretty lackluster weapon and I would expect its actual sale price to be close to 5g. It's super easy to fuck yourself if you try flipping blues without a decent set of sales data.
---
You use max rank spells with clearcasts
---
Hunter pulls are still useful for situations where a mob is patting very quickly, as a hunter can shoot instantly, while a warrior requires some wind up time to shoot. Granted, this is a very limited situation, but it does exist.

I love you all.
---
I love you both
---
From my understanding, int increases crit chance and sp increases spell dmg for my mage. What‚Äôs the number when it‚Äôs worth it sacrificing int over sp for my gears in terms of damage alone? For example, does 10 sp deal more dmg overtime than 15 int?
---
its still better money after sharing
---
One thing I was looking forward to in classic, was doing 5-mans the "proper" way again.
---
You know, pick a target to CC, pick a target to focus first, do LOS-pulls and all that.
---
Instead everybody's just AOE-charge-zerking through everything ... and a lot of the time it's working.
---
But let's face it.
---
1) 1.12 talents adds like 15% more power to every class  
---
2) People are running considerably more streamlined builds than back then
---
So any given player is probably \~30% stronger than they used to be, allowing us to just zerg things.
---
I think it's a bloody shame, but hoping that maybe it stops being so zergy at 60? (dirty casual this time around).
---
Prot does have its perks for early tanking (assuming you take 11 arms, of course). Cheaper sunder + defiance definitely helps when rage starved. Last stand is cool. Conc blow has its moments.
---
I've met 3 warrior tanks who were tanking the "proper" way so far, and added them all to friends list. Definitely prefer healing those groups over the AOE/cleave groups.
---
Not yet, mostly confusion, but after enough time I'm sure I'll tick off someone!
---
no it works fine. syntax might not be 100% in that post, i cant check as im at work but mine works fine. sometimes you may have to dbl loot the mobs. 
---
you may have to put a /stopcasting inbetween the pickpocket and the action
---
I guess you'd be one of those players who wouldn't have open arms? God forbid that someone asks you a question. 
---
Pretty much everything is online nowadays in some form anyway, that doesn't mean that people who choose to have a more interactive and social approach to the sharing of knowledge should be put down.

Achievement Unlocked: Drink the Kool-Aid!

Not shameng expert or nothing but you could try jousting with earthbind totem.
---
We Horde did this in Yojamba outside SFK. Had about 20 sleepbrahs until we got bombed by Allies leaving the dungeon
---
Check your free character transfers options, Deviate may be in there.
---
we are in phase 1  and if you did your homework you would know that in phase one we get tier 1 loot (Molten Core)  but Onyxia and Ragnaros (MC End Boss)  drop  2 pieces of tier 2, the headpiece and legs. 
---
New homework assignment:   look up the drop rate of the  Thunderfury Bindings.
---
If you're a skinner, Devilsaurs.  However, I'm pretty sure every server has a handful of dedicated teams to farming them so it's probably not worth your effort.
---
I think Humanoids are generally the best type of mob to grind for gold since they drop cash, cloth, and items.  Coupling that with the opportunity to find things like thorium veins and herbs in the wild (not sure what your professions are, but giving a general answer), the Yetis or Furbolgs in Winterpsring might be a decent farming spot.
---
Could also try Silithus if Winterspring has too much traffic.  If you get bored of humanoids and are feeling lucky, you could farm the elementals for their elemental drops.
---
Q U A L I T Y C O N T E N T

undeath to water is best but the recipe is very expensive.
---
Yarp.
---
Now would this shit happen in retail from the community? I don't fucking think so. This was hilarious.
---
RC Loot Council
---
Well this is great information but also really a an odd mechanic. Thank you.
---
Ah ok, thanks.
---
I used to heal pay back in the day and healing locks was so annoying, after picking priest now I love locks and they love me. Renew is fantastic for a tap happy lock
---
I have tanked all dungeons until now (lev 38) and I did not experience that I had to out-level the content.  On the contrary, last dungeon I tanked was RFD, where the bosses are 40-41, and did not experience any issues.
---
Do people farm the recipe for elixir of shadow power like they farm the runecloth bag recipe?
---
Totally agreed. I was basing it off of them being level 27. I just meant that tossing on some +damage while leveling can help speed things along when everything is pretty routine, and some +stamina / Eagle gear can help if you're soloing orange quests or elites or some such.
---
Needing tons of macros is correct. I have so many I‚Äôve used all my class specific slots and many general slots. Don‚Äôt let that turn you off. It feels great once you get everything working the way you want.
---
Jeez,  not only was that overly dramatic,  most of it was just plain wrong.   Undead don't have fear resistance,  they have fear IMMUNITY for 5 seconds and a fear break.   Gnomes 5% int only applies to their base intellect... which is super meh.  Tauren stun lasts for 2 seconds,  not one. Trolls have berserking,  the best pve racial in the game.
---
I realised that when i saw the paladin in a dress. Saw him last night
---
This is really funny
---
&gt; It straight up tells you when a rogue is near you in stealth.
---
So does the built-in combat log.
---
Spy doesn't lower the volume of the stealth warning, but it also doesn't do anything that the game doesn't already do.
---
It doesn't give you their name or level unless it can see it from the combat log.  Level is an *approximation* based on the ability detected.  Have you ever even used the addon? 99% of rogues show up as level 1 because stealth doesn't have ranks.
---
Good call, misread that part, sorry. They're neutral at least, which is better than the last person i guess.
---
The point doesn't change much, multiple people minding their own business and one person out there talking shit.
---
What's worse, them, or the people making complaint posts about them?
---
That character looks like Dirk from Dragon‚Äôs Lair.
---
Your UI is the first I'm jealous off. So much free space. Care to share addons for this?
---
If you have the pet summoned, the book will have the "Already known" text on it in red. It only works for the pet you have summoned then, though.
---
For sure. Most people would prefer you cat so as to add DPS instead of adding another healer, but I'm sure you could work it out and having an extra healer for half a raid won't hurt you much.
---
90% of world PvP is getting the drop on someone. If they get the drop on you, run away. Use stealth for selective engagement. Wait until they are already on multiple mobs, or they are tapping to bandage, then hit them hard.
---
What flavor Kool-Aid did you serve, Jim? :)
---
Whatever you feel comfortable with. As late as you can while being fairly sure you don't miss the tick, 75% is fine,
---
&gt; But pretty much everything it does can be seen in the combat log anyway
---
Not pretty much, 100%.  Spy is a combat log parser, it doesn't use any hidden APIs or anything.
---
Pros:
---
\- Classic
---
\- Warcraft 3 remastered
---
Cons:
---
\- BFA is hot garbage
---
\- Heart of the Storm put on life support (ironically, the de-emphasis on esports has made the game fun again for casual players) 
---
\- Diablo Immortal announcement
---
\- Continued focus on esports for Overwatch; casual players hate the constant balance changes, game is boring as hell to watch.
---
\- Hearthstone as legalized gambling, and now its caused all sorts of political drama for Blizzard. Well done!
---
\- Starcraft is on ice for the next 5 years
---
\- almost all the old guard have retired or left the company. radio silence from current leadership on dozens of issues. 
---
Blizzcon worked when the adoration of the fans was so great that Blizzard felt it was necessary to reward their followers. Over time it shifted to its own mini-E3, intended to be the hype machine for the next release cycle. As the company became more corporate, they've walked a dangerous line trying to monetize good will and public opinion. Now that its turned on them (rightly so), I suspect Blizzcon will be retired in the next few years... company doesn't get what they want out of it anymore.
---
I was thinking about a HoTW build when I get to 60, how much tanking skills do you really miss out that are important ?
---
My problem is that I get stuff from another profession and have to roll a new character with that profession. I now have 7 toons with all the crafting professions covered and 2 of every gathering profession. I'm a little relieved there aren't any more professions.

I stand in solidarity with you and your husband, and everyone else who remembers tyranny, recognizes it, and says no.
---
&gt;zero evidence

That's why it's called "believe"
---
Nah I get it. It‚Äôs a hot topic and people support the protesters and think employees should be able to say what they want because the sides are so crystal clear, and it‚Äôs human rights issue. and Blizzard is in bed with China blah blah. 
---
So yeah, when you win a tournament or give an interview, it‚Äôs time to start shit with an entire country...as you currently work for the company hosting the event and giving you money and employing you lol.
---
Always funny how any Alliance post against Horde usually devolves into rampant racist attitudes from the Alliance.
---
Yea fuck most mages tbh. I was in stormwind yesterday and asked a mage for a portal to darnassus. He said 1 gold, I told him all I had was 50 silver because I was only level 15 and he just said sorry bud.  Luckily another mage did it for me for 50 silver no problem, but I just dont understand people like that. It takes literally however many seconds it takes to cast and I was going to pay more than the material cost. It's not like he was in the middle of something.  Havent had a mage demand money for food/water yet though thankfully.
---
Just be transparent and communicate with them.  
---
Tell them you'll throw them a few heals when their mana is absolutely zero but if you notice them hovering at 50% and tapping from that point up, let them handle it themselves.  
---
I'm a resto shaman also and the only time I'll big heal a lifetapping Warlock is if I notice they have absolutely no mana AND if I already had plans to sit and drink. Ill just dump what mana I have to get them up and drink just as I had planned.
---
Fighting censorship in video games was already tried once. Not gonna waste my time trying again.
---
What's his twitch?
---
China is the largest foreign holder of US debt. Perhaps I should stop paying my taxes so that it has a direct impact on their finances?
---
If it's a single person that he's bothered with, then what's the point of the post and why is the title "PEOPLE (...)"
---
Thays 460 turn-ins of stack of 20. So if you're lucky enough to buy them all at 1- a stack you'd pay 460g, but on most servers stacks go for 1.2 to 1.6g a stack so looking more at 552g-736g just for the rep.
---
Essentially yes kinda. The heaven we would probably think of is called The Light. But more than likely when ordinary souls pass on they get recycled into Azeroth.
---
Are you attuned for Molten Core or Onyxia? If not, you could focus on those so you could join some raids.
---
Molten Core is 1 BRD run, but Onyxia attunement is pretty much a multi-day effort for both factions.
---
Also, if you aren't really feeling motivated... could take a small break.  Don't burn out! :)
---
NIMBY attitude at its finest.
---
Maybe some don't want that on their screen?  Maybe some play with children or adolescents in the room at the same time they are playing a video game?
---
I always thought it was weird seeing a bunch of level &lt;60 warriors looking for tanks in chat.
---
"In games such as World of Warcraft: Classic, players can live out their most deeply held fantasies.
---
"Such as, partaking in social activities, and having a good night's rest..."
---
Cool man, cheers for the help!!
---
I think those are the only non-white shoulders you can wear before lvl 21. They look like ass but 3 stam is 3 stam!
---
How is your dps in this spec? For solo pve.
---
Oh tru haha
---
Before or after he started a global war? I would probably be busy fighting somewhere over seas, that's such a dumb question I am not sure what kind if answer you are looking for.
---
Collect the rest of pre-raid BiS -&gt; farm to stock up on raid consumables -&gt; Finish leveling profs -&gt; farm for future crafteds/enchants/mount
---
Not even in the same desert as you guys. 
---
Everyone forgets about this stuff sooner or later. 
---
I'm off on a beach giving 0 shits about what everyone says is or isnt important.
---
Completing quests at max level is a great way to make money.  The XP gain is converted to gold.  You also could focus on your attunements and keys.
---
Yeah, because reddit usernames are totally the same. You know how I ended up with this name?
---
I tried a whole bunch of other things that were already taken, tried "givemeadamnname" which was already taken, tried it again with some numbers, and eventually ended up with this one.
---
I'm sorry, I don't care if other people enjoy the funny names on regular servers, but I personally don't want to run around Azeroth with people named Yoloswag420 or something similar. It's kind of a false equivalency to point to my reddit username in this case anyway.
---
The XP from quests converts to gold at 60, so it's one of the most profitable ways to spend your time. 
---
Other than that,  get your attunements/keys; max at your professions and collect recipes; get your rep up with different factions based on what you want; and then go back to STV and gank lowbies.
---
You can cross the bridge without killing anything (usually kill the fire elemental patroling) if you have a priest in the group using mind soothe.
---
So use your brain, and think about who else could be eligible to roll besides a non 60 rogue
---
People upvote and post what they like, if what people like is shit then you just don't fit in with the sub.
---
There are dozens of us!
---
14 years ago our pre-frontal cortex wasn't developed, so the people who knew how to actually kill a boss had to explain it to 39 other people who poorly interpreted cause and effect. Most people, including me was in their mid to late teens. It's like walking into a raging frat party as a 40 year old and trying to get everyone to go outside and check the oil in their car. Would it benefit everyone if their car ran smoothly? Sure. Do they really give a fuck? Nah.
---
Class and level are approximated based on the ability detected.  That's why most rogues show up as level 1, because stealth doesn't have ranks.. Guess what, it doesn't even show class since multiple classes have stealth. You will literally get ?? [Name] *unknown* as the popup for stealth detects.
---
You're saying knowing a name is OP? Really?
---
I'm like 99% certain you shouldn't use Heroic Strike, use Sunder Armor instead.
---
oh ya i used to do this. Always freaked poeple out

there is a "I'm stuck" function that you can suicide with

I got to level 20 on a female UD Rogue before noping, that flip visually hurts my eyes like nothing else.  It was neat the first 4 levels but yeah
---
bragging - "verb
---
The definition of bragging is boasting or talking about how great things are for you."
---
can you point out where they are bragging ?
---
Agility and spirit. The rest are worthless
---
The gathermate can also sync with your guild and party.
---
Let me rephrase that: A GOOD Druid will ... so I‚Äôm so forth. 
---
You‚Äôve been playing with the wrong Druids tho, just saying.
---
The maze can have it's exit in the middle, going to an upper or lower level.
---
Punkbusters did.
---
If you know how to make runs smooth, good for everyone.
---
but when a tank asks 10-15 seconds every 2 mobs to get aggro, the truth is you might not be that good at tanking.
---
^ this... thank god 95% of Hunters dont even know how to feign trap
---
10/10 Alliance disguise
---
I just wanna know why nobody will make me a portal to stonard.
---
The reducing of layers and queue times is better evidence of my argument than any anecdotal evidence, actually.
---
Of course it was a slam dunk, I never said it wasn't a great move and a succes. All I said is how now is apparently the time it's losing its initial shine and people are quitting. And that isn't even unexpected, I was just stating I'm seeing it happen.
---
True, that's fine with me. But where's the sub for high effort posts &amp; informational discussions?
---
Day 2. Keep it up :)
---
A tank that cannot hold single target aggro post level 25 is a bad tank. 
---
Yes, DPS can make it difficult and tedious for the tank, but if the tank is simply incapable of pulling and holding aggro on a single target, he is a bad tank. (Or significantly underleveled for the dungeon or relative to the dps.)
---
It's actually pretty good even in bc. Your biggest dps increase will always be hit rating.
---
If you want those profession only for gold. You don‚Äôt need them as soon as DM hits. Check YouTube guides for hunter DM farm
---
&gt; It does not show you enemies that are stealthed.
---
It does if you already have a detect stealth ability like hunters do, otherwise that's correct.
---
I'm planning on doing some Angerforge stealth runs with a couple rogue guildmates for HoJ. I think we can kill him with 3 of us. I tried to solo but no chance haha.
---
Let's talk about that ORC pvp racial.
---
I've had mostly pleasant experiences. Did have a healer leave abruptly for "terrorists at the front door" last night. But we all laughed and found a new one.
---
What about "It feels shit to tank due to ungrateful, terrible DPS spellcleaves"?
---
You must be fun at parties.  Everyone talking about stuff you aren't interested in.
---
Few people use it, and almost nobody did before people cried about it and made up all kinds of actually unfair functionality that doesn't even exist.
---
Yea man, I look at it this way...for Locks Life=Mana=DPS so if I can help I do, but I cant drop a bunch of mana on them just incase shit hits the fan.
---
Honesty wouldn't mind if they tweaked the story a little bit in order to make a fantastic WoW Classic + expansion. Im sure the could come up with SOMETHING. Even if they left Silvermoon out and added in the other zones im sure it would still be a lot. I find it weird that the zones on the map you cant go to or click on are in some RANDOM places. Like really random.
---
Oh, I meant thanks to Blizz bum-rushing content, people will have no way of running out of content (which in this case is way too fast of updates)
---
Oh lordy... Another one. 
---
You must be the tallest person in the whole wide internet to reach all these goal posts and still manage raise the bar. 
---
Keep reaching for the stars bb.
---
This. OP provides no alternatives or discussion about what is considered quality. What do they define as quality?
---
ITT: People who want to play video games and are offended by people with a stronger backbone
---
Pretty sure that's days /played. Someone hit 60 in like 5 actual days in Classic.
---
My mom is a far better gold maker than I am...
---
Doots? That √§ √¢ √£ √• √° or √†?
---
I wouldn‚Äôt mind it if the helmet was actually facing the right way instead of up haha
---
Yeah just make 2 or 3 macros with something like ‚Äú/e attempts to pickpocket you...‚Äù followed by either ‚Äú/e failed!‚Äù and ‚Äúsuccessfully pickpocketed x monies‚Äù.
---
Tanking is the most fun role in the game imo.
---
Just stand back each time they do it and let them die. When they bitch say "If you wanted to tank maybe you should have rolled a warrior instead of a mage" or something like that.
---
good thing your opinion doesnt matter!
---
This is true to real life too.  Humans are social predators, hunting in groups feels natural.
---
I'm an altoholic but I stuck with my main this time because of how time consuming leveling is and my fomo to raid with my guild. My main is now 60, close to full preraid bis, attuned to MC/Ony, 300 tailoring/herb and close to epic mount. I've come to a point where I can safely log in and start leveling an alt now any time and it feels like a relief (don't get me wrong, I love playing my main too).
---
Eh, this seems like an intentional design decision. I wonder if they will roll it back but they were making spawn rates adjust to amount of people in the area initially on purpose (just like layering).
---
Real wPvP won't happen until they remove those quality of life changes that were supposed to be just phase 1.
---
Needs some Radiohead Just playing in the background!
---
All you people using these zone scanners can die in a fire.
---
Never said they weren't.
---
Omg too soon!!!
---
And today, i still have to read people telling on classic servers about how retail community is 1000x better LOL
---
OMEGALUL. That's why we joined too. Palehorn &lt;Here We Go Again&gt;. See ya around buddy and love the Horde shield.
---
None of that's gonna get changed regardless. I'm talkin about stuff like making infernal that's  half a gold cost, be worthless/not fun. And Ritual of Doom that costs 1g, plus repairs, be worthless and no fun added.
---
what? where?
---
my guild running with 11 healers and 3 of us a smiting most of the time. Our tank afraid of going dual wield on onyxia even if the only thing that could go wrong, is aggro.
---
Can I get some of those dps-oriented tank instead of the deep prot tin can?
---
So much the same! Thought about logging in just to go to trade chat and spam Justice for Blitzchung!
---
Don't you know that in 2019, even just the act of being good at something is bragging, and opens you up to attack? Everything is bragging!
---
I do it when fighting multiple people and don't feel bad about it. Usually only when. I'm worried about being killed myself if I don't start dealing with another target.
---
&gt; actual funny, well done meme that gets deleted by a mod an hour later bECauSe LoW eFfOrT
---
this3000
---
That would be awesome. Best worst spy in history !ü§£
---
Yeah nerf mages!
---
Nah, just a bad picture haha.
---
Its not entirely necessary since all the current gear is overtuned for MC/Ony making it pretty easy. If you're in a casual guild who doesn't mind that you're MS then you can just raid that way, it wont be the reason they don't kill bosses. However, expect to be shit on by every other warrior on the meters.
---
no
---
Lol right? It‚Äôs like they didn‚Äôt even check to make sure this one looked even remotely passable haha.
---
Sad to read that you reported him for that. Go on pve server, I guess.
---
Editing is on point. Love it!
---
I've got no issue if that actually occurred but I honestly doubt it with how greedy this raid group seems. I also dont think the OP would be making this post if the mage was constantly helping gear people up in various level 60 instances.
---
Does Leader of the Pack also increase spell crit chance of party members?  It says 'ranged' but I'm not sure if that's limited to ranged physical DPS or not.
---
Dude no one gives a fuck. It's not like they're using racial or homophobic slurs so  who is it really hurting?
---
It's still worse heal per mana than direct heals. That's the point.
---
Scatter trap shares a DR (sorry), so your trap is ~5 seconds at best. You won't be able to get to 41 yards before it breaks and your victim will hit you with frostshock.
---
No you are definately NOT the king of world pvp, druids and rogues are by far.
---
I couldn't tell you, since neither did they. They just seem to be shit posting on what others post.
---
I'm open to hearing their suggestions.
---
The Bible describes men in the days before the end times nearly identically to how you just have.
---
Sorry I‚Äôm a derp, but combat dagger spec is specced for weapon proficiency, so I am at 310 with aged core gloves equipped,
---
Oh haha. Sorry, but not us.
---
Flightmaster respawn times seem about right for 1.12, it was stealthchanged somewhere in late vanilla. The rest is very much broken though.
---
I would hope they release it with a 7-14 day window pre-nerf. Give the bleeding edge folks a chance to get destroyed a few times.  Even if they say, "Ok nerds, you have 2 weeks, go nuts, good luck"
---
Nice, ty.
---
Sure there are a few combos like this, If you get chest that is a vest model and then a skirt for pants, baby. you got an undead midrif stew going!
---
Spirit is better for leveling than sta/int.
---
Not true. A good tank will usually spend time getting the REST of the targets to stick while letting the dps nuke down skull. This is because trying to grab skull from a balls out group is just impossible. I usually let them hit a dps, and then make a call whether I think the mob will die fast enough to not do any serious damage or not. If I think it nessecary I throw a taunt on it and continue getting the rest of the pull to stick to me.
---
[reminds me of this Radiohead video, well done](https://youtu.be/oIFLtNYI3Ls)
---
Guardians Favor is even more important if you are primarily healing. When someone grabs aggro you can throw a quick BoP on them. Or if someone gets knocked into whelps fighting Ony you can buy them time to run out to a tank. Freedom isn't as important for PvE but it still has a lot of uses.
---
Too bad mages are the reason strat/brd/scholo runs don't take 3 hours
---
&gt;mc weapons.
---
That's the single hardest thing to get out of MC outside maybe physical dps rings.
---
Idc I will enjoy classic rn. We are in p1 and have plenty of content left before I will think about this
---
I thought about continuing to play out my sub, but I realized that by continuing to populate the servers, I'm both a) proving Blizzard's assumption that I'm too devoted to their game to stick to my guns and quit, and b) providing an active gameplay experience for all the people giving money to Blizzard to pretend to be a hero instead of quitting to support real ones.
---
A ghost town of a server would make a much bigger impact than one populated by players who kind of quit but not really and hey nice shield, want to group up?
---
So yeah, it's been surprisingly tough, but I'm not playing any of their games anymore.
---
And also "look at me ganking this person and winning". 
---
I feel like people try to flex how good they are at the game by a single clip of a wpvp encounter while leveling.
---
Congrats but we dont need to see a gigantic paragraph with what happened.
---
See you next week
---
Is there a mount from timbermaw rep? I didn't know that was a thing.
---
Yeah I‚Äôve had way more ?? dudes murder me than actual pvp. I give em the /shrug.
---
You need to scroll down in the state configuration after pressing enable. There should be more options. Have you tried that?
---
Eh, I bet it's a chore to do it for just guards.
---
They intentionally added layering and variable respawns to deal with launch population. Layering is supposed to go away in phase 2 but not sure about the variable respawns
---
Just because it uses data already there doesn't make it okay to use.
---
Fuck the chinese. Ban them from all western markets until they stop being faggots.
---
If you get into a spot where mobs can't path they go into evade mode. After like 30 seconds or so of being in that state the mobs will go back to full health and reset. It's a mechanic designed to prevent people from killing mobs where they can't be attacked, but in instances it lets you drop aggro. Other instances have spots like this as well.
---
It's kind of a grey area as far as exploits go. On the one hand the mechanics are working as intended (you're not killing mobs where they can't reach), on the other hand it lets you bypass mob packs.
---
This had me at giggles.
---
As horde on Grobb - where the hell did you get that info? 
---
There is no Alliance favor and the horde isn‚Äôt neutered.
---
&gt;I‚Äôve tried Grobbulus, but everyone keeps saying that it favors the Alliance and that the Horde don‚Äôt fight back
---
*Everyone* says that?
---
I've been on the Grobb subreddit and discord for quite some time, and that's news to me.
---
Most of the people you hear complaining about faction balance are obviously going to complain that their side has it worse. People just like to complain.
---
I've really wanted to spend an entire day in one spot and make a timelapse of orgrimmar Skeram but I feel like by the time I finished someone else would have done it and I'd feel like I wasted my time lol
---
&gt; Do you hear yourself?
---
read this and ask yourself
---
If you've got a buddy to play with go for it. I'm leveling holy with a warlock, and we get through ridiculous stuff, everything synergises so well.   
---
Did not expect the spec to be that fun, but I'm really having a blast with the crazy efficient heals.   
---
If you're solo tho it will be noticeably slower than ret.
---
I would want to know as well but with as long as its been in the game I just RP it as us climbing up onto the roof so its ok.
---
It‚Äôs painful. I was having such a blast in classic and also in retail. But this is just too much. I canceled my subscription and even though I still have ~ 4 months left of a 6 month sub, I uninstalled the games and won‚Äôt be signing in.
---
It sucks so much, I was really looking forward to this year‚Äôs Blizzcon, and to Warcraft III remastered, plus playing WoW together with my fianc√©e was one of our favorite pastimes. But unless Blizzard does a fairly major U-turn, I won‚Äôt be supporting them any more.
---
Wow what a brand new never before thought of or discussed idea
---
Cuddle Puddle!
---
Toxic is just a metaphor  
---
it is  also a easily understood term that applies well in this situation
---
Your input to this is very "useful"... thanks
---
But since everyone wants changes, if you can't beat em join em. I'll gladly take a character boost, so I can buy my level 60 characters, that's a minor change, like doomguard and infernal, cause anyone can go work for a quarter of the day and make the money to buy it.
---
You could repost this in September of next year likely.  Thanks
---
I see a lot of posts like this, but 99% of people I meet seem to be decent. I don't know if I'm lucky or if there's something OP's of these posts are doing wrong when grouping.
---
War/priest is like 50 times stronger than just war or just priest.
---
Still supporting Blizzard? You should kill yourselves in real life.
---
Great, so we have to put up with them in the dungeon. That doesn't mean the community of people that aren't playing with tanks (this sub) has to fucking fawn over them like infants.
---
You could sit in org/sw and fish all the way to 300 if you wanted
---
It's awesome they brought back classic. They left the classic mentality in 2004, though. Between the SJW support team and now this though it's obvious Blizzard has changed for the worse...
---
At least P99 Green is coming out oct 25th. I can suffer through a little bit more to get x3 lvls on the warlock to then be disappointed with Inferno not working like it used to and quit for good. Because SJW's think warlocks being able to cause havoc isn't okay. If only for a few minutes with a 1 hr cooldown -- STILL NOT OKAY.
---
Yesterday I saw it at 8s at Gehennas (has always been 6-7s before). Maybe it is increasing?
---
Imagine being this bitter about it...
---
Where are they saying it's original? They're obviously just laughing at a dumb joke so who cares?
---
I loved this way to much xD
---
Yep, was looking for this comment. If Jagex can do it, Blizzard can. We already have plenty of opportunity, just look on the world map and see how much space is inaccessible or unused.
---
Suggestion number 1: Make better posts
---
&gt;I don't think we can just attribute it to knowledge of strats because those were available to everyone as well towards the end of vanila's life (late 2006ish).
---
Why is it so hard to read posts?
---
I remember when this was common knowledge, id forgotten all about it!
---
Just starting to dip my toes into BRD. I haven't ran this instance since 2015. I am very excited.
---
Dudes playing a game where the main focal point is murdering people and he's worried about innaproriate names lmao millennial parents are funny
---
Classic communism
---
I mean...until layering goes away this isn't even the worst nerf to wPvP.
---
Do you prefer a NA server? If so you could try Herod or Faerlina? I can't remember which ones has the streamers but i sure you can look it up.
---
Not for priest :D
---
Is fire mage viable for pvp? And for endgame content? I know one raid that most of the monsters are immune to fire, but is that one essencial to mages for their build?
---
Onyxia was slain weeks ago, fool. And the horde wishes to spread lies as if they were the ones to lay low the beast. This article is false propaganda meant to bolster the morale of the scum that plagued our world.
---
I've never cared less about something in my having career...
---
Does anybody know if the Disgusting Oozeling aura still stacks?
---
Normal :)
---
I think that works better because sometimes it doesn't loot fast enough.
---
Didn't that happen less than a week ago? It's hardly on the level of the slices of pie OP and co enjoy moaning about
---
No. I think if you are MAINSPEC tank and Truestrikes drop you shouldn't be taking them from the MAINSPEC damage dealers. 
---
But strawmanning is cool, relevant flair.
---
HoTs cast before combat do not generate threat for the caster.
---
I doubt they'll keep this limitation if they get around to adding paid transfers in classic, but who knows. It's kinda ridiculous to worry about dying 3 extra times on your way to 60.
---
Unfortunately I see three name changes incoming.
---
Not here for approval nor do I care what anything things. Hell down vote me. The goal is that some others (even if it's not a lot) will get the idea and do the same. If not. Then it's whatever.
---
 I'm not saying the population hasn't declined but just because some people quit doesnt mean there isnt new blood coming in.  All of the PVP Servers in the US were still "Full/High" Population last Friday, so I think there still is a pretty strong following.  It's more of a matter of how that holds up in 3 months from now.
---
Eh, maybe it's not intentional but things still spawn at inconsistent rates between early morning and peak for sure.
---
I was looking at the Arcane tree and it seems pretty decent for PvP if you're smart. It's just a bummer that Wands and Arcane Missiles are your only DPS.
---
Fire crits are nasty though ;)
---
What about the endless "i made a friend today, horder sheman so help me, much thankyu"
---
Almost the same here. except not a hunter and not an engineer in WoW. And no energy drinks, or chocolate, and prefer rye whiskey. Damnit i guess all engineers are not the same. Back to my ASME calcs.
---
So I'm going to dissect this, and this is the last time I am going to be responding because this is now over two days old.
---
It was never blatantly asked for Hunters not to roll for Strikers Mark if you recall. It wasn't until the rolls were done that I heard "yeah that's definitely not a Hunters bow" in comms and I did a double-take to see what the item was. Honestly? I didn't roll because I didn't even realize the stats. I saw bow and passed. So that's how I recall nobody being told that they can't roll on this. Could they have? I mean sure lol. If they can utilize it and it's better, it's just good for Hunters. And you are very wrong about that ring. If you recall, almost every Priest rolled on it but a Mage won so of course there was no recollection of that or hubbub. People are picking and choosing the information they want to remember.
---
We had a handful of 60s in the raid, but we are the ones that coordinated it for days and hosted it. It took us three days and a Google form response to put it together. Since when does a PuG enforce loot council rules? You agree to the rules by showing up to the raid or you don't. I don't think it was confusing, the raid leader was being super fair to everyone. We appreciate the help, but especially when you have tanks in the group, we only thought it was fair that you guys were comfortable and could coordinate your pulls, your groups how you wanted them, etc. It's a joint effort whether it's a PuG or a guild run.
---
And yes, Rogues CAN use TF. It IS good for them. Over a tank? Not nearly as good, I would never argue it's not better on a tank. But it IS good for us! That proc can be applied no matter who is wielding it. But it was a pure PuG. You guys brought several people, two other guilds brought a handful, we had a handful, we had several individuals that came to help not associated with a guild and we chose to free roll MS &gt; OS. What makes my MS less relevant over your tank? I can use it. It's an upgrade and I can't even construct the damn sword for six months MINIMUM *if* I see the other binding. My roll was not the first to go out, it was middle of the pack. I have the screenshot.
---
I am not a co-GM. I USED to be, but I still manage the Discord. I have too much going on IRL to be co-GM
---
 I am an officer because I am a long-standing member of our group. Almost ten years we have played together. 
---
I enjoy how you deem giving the Tranq shot to the Hunter as ninja loot. You do realize he wasn't in our guild until yesterday, right? He played well and we recruited him. You were in Discord and know damn well that the ML didn't realize that he couldn't use it. In fact, the dude tried trading it. Again, I reiterate: he wasn't even in our guild, we didn't know him before this run. And again, as you know, the RL was giving these tanks consumables. He clearly stated in voice comms that if you guys needed anything to just please let him know. Whatever you guys needed, you could have just asked. We made that very clear the two days you guys were there. 
---
I still fail to see how it was a ninja loot. I will be 60 way before the sword can be utilized, just like anyone else in the group. RL said Rogues and Warrs could roll. Some RLs only let Warrs, some only let Warr tanks, some RLs allow for Pally, Rogue, Warr and Hunter roll. That's what our RL chose. I rolled in the middle of the pack and got a 98. I passed on Nightslayer BoE that dropped afterward. It would not have felt right for me to take it, and so I didn't. One of your very kind members told both me and RL that each item should be cleared ahead of time of what classes can roll on it so it's super clear next time. And so that's what we will do to make it crystal clear. Unfortunately in reg vanilla, theorycrafting and min/maxing wasn't really a thing. I don't see why people can only roll on stuff ONLY if it's BiS. If it's an upgrade for people and it makes sense and follows the RL's rules, then go for it I say. 
---
And yes, it will be a meme of the server, of course. Being a non-60 getting bindings. I wasn't going in there looking for anything other than maybe a Nightslayer piece and some experience. We didn't play on p servers, and strats are smarter now. Regardless, we really enjoyed playing with your group. Very down to Earth and good players. We would still love to play with you guys, speaking from many of us, but I don't know if that is possible after all of this unfortunately. But we will see. Most people in your group seem to understand it was just a lucky roll and it's a game and life goes on. Great people regardless, and I wish you all the luck in your future WoW endeavors.
---
Are you on a NA server?
---
When you do something or pick sides you open yourself up. That‚Äôs exactly what happened. And no you‚Äôre stretching it quite a bit. Like I said companies want to remain neutral. They don‚Äôt want people starting shit with entire countries and fan bases that actually, don‚Äôt all agree with the protesters. Lol
---
 yeah.... I miss that s&amp;d. #nochanges
---
Oh, really? Because the shit talk coming from DPSes says otherwise.
---
Just remove it?
---
You‚Äôre the one acting offended here tho fucking lmao@ how in self aware you are
---
They are bragging about their shitty names
---
Minus references to Death, being gay, organ harvesting, eugenics, muslims in concentration camps, political dissidents getting locked away, booksellers being kidnapped in the middle of the night, the great leap forward, winnie the pooh, Tienanmen square, and the fact that the censorship itself exists; among others.
---
If I'm on my way somewhere I'll almost always stop and fight.
---
If I'm questing somewhere just grinding mobs I usually just throw up a /wave and try to play nice. Because I don't want to start a huge war where both factions start calling for reinforcements and now I'm stuck PvP'ing for 2 hours instead of actually gaining any xp from questing.
---
I think it‚Äôs a passing interest for the vast majority. Can be sure when 9.0 drops, Classic will again be a ghost town until the next phase.
---
Do whatever makes you enjoy the game. If you reroll to horde (btw do it on other server, and you can still keep your rogue) would you start with another class, or you want another rogue? Even if your not playing together now, but later is there any chance you will spend more time together? What are your goals later? You have to ask these kind of questions from yourself. If you don't have big ties, just cut them, and do whatever you would enjoy, it's better now than later.

Welcome to downvote oblivion on this sub.

Wish I could have joined with my warlock... using Life Tap.
---
My favorite is   
---
/e has stolen 32 copper from your bag  
---
If you do this in stealth near a mailbox as a level 1 rogue the rage you get is incredible. Sometimes when someone messages me angry and I explain it's just an emote they refuse to accept my explanation so then I like to play along and be like   
---
"Yea dude, fine I stole your 32 copper but you need to chill out man its just copper it doesn't even matter."  
---
You ever want to see someone explode in rage try that line out. You will have to /ignore that person though...and you might then have to convince dozens of other people who message you that you didn't steal anything and explain what happened...it's a lot of effort but worth it for the luls
---
Correct. How is that relevant to what I said?
---
You‚Äôll want Ferocious Howl on a wolf.
---
No you can just teach your pet the highest rank, you don‚Äôt need to learn every rank.
---
There will be people! But be warned a lot of pvp is against those much higher in level
---
Huh! That's very interesting - I really hope that it's to make up for increased Lightning Breath damage or something like that. Thank you very much for posting this - I'm at the very least curious enough to pursue this and see how the caster fares.
---
It's pretty interesting if that's the case - and for some people casters might end up preferable!
---
The adds explode when you kill them.
---
I thought rend was worth it (even at higher levels) if you got the full duration?
---
I respecced to ele from enh around 45 and definitely don't regret it. Solo grinding is roughly equivalent, maybe even slightly slower due to water drinking but everything else is much more fun imo.
---
Group questing is easier because of threat management and being a caster. You can pull aggro when you want almost instantly with earthshock but don't have to worry about a windfury proc or rockbiter grabbing aggro from a warrior buddy/hunter pet. If you double with a mage/warlock/priest you can reliable kill stuff before it touches you.
---
Dungeons are a goddamn blast, so the bis grind through blackrock/strat/scholo is a pleasure. Generally, as the group is running to the next pack (if your moving quickly), drop mana spring halfway as that where your casters will be, then drop windfury closer for melee, after those two globals tank should have enough threat so you can drop fire nova without it being killed. after that global fire up a chain lightning, then magma totem for a long fight or straight to lightning bolt for something short. Just stay near the tank because you will aggro mobs if you get a series of crits.
---
Reliable top the meters (or close) in 2-4 mob fights. 
---
Only issue is keeping mana up. I've been buying cheap mana pots to make up the difference. Doesn't seem like much but spending 50s cheap AF greater mana potions really makes a difference if the group is trying to haul ass.
---
im the only one who is confused about the skill level order?
---
Going against the grain here but for the average group, there's no way anyone is outdpsing me as an Arms Warrior with SS+WW combo. Yes it'll piss the tank off, but the burst is insane every 30 seconds.
---
The concept is correct but the chart seems off.
---
Most of what I see is a long ass post about how "The game means so much to me, but...." INSERT 12 PARAGRAPHS OF TEARS about literally anything
---
WoW is a fun game and all... But man people can't just play it it seems
---
Leather as in Mask of the Unforgiven? Not an ideal helm, but Lionheart is expensive so it certainly serves.
---
Leather as in Aged Core Leather Gloves? BiS for non-orc/human warriors as long as they are using a dagger. 
---
You have no idea what you're talking about.
---
Oh wow, you think Warriors want to spec Prot?  Prot is boring, they do it because its necessary for threat and mitigation.  Id love to ARMs Onyxia or MC but see that would be dumb unless you are so geared that strat just doesn‚Äôt matter which is never the case.
---
She resets every 5 days, there is no specific day of the week. On EU she just reset today morning (like 8 hours ago), not sure if it's the same on US. You can always check your lockouts in raid menu.
---
Or they can take it to the right subreddit and keep it off here
---
If the tank doesn't need gear from the dungeon for tanking and they're not allowed to roll on damage gear for offspec why would they go at all?
---
Yeah it was a stupid meme haha
---
I'm lvl 46 myself. You'd be surprised how quickly you get used it, it took my half a ZF run to get used to my ALT modifiers. Makes things very simple! You should give it a go, I couldn't go back to icons everywhere.. so messy :)
---
I don‚Äôt downvote. I‚Äôll just say I think it‚Äôs phony.
---
I haven't met someone who was disapointed after they picked a meta class but then again I have seen people reroll like every other day and barely get past 20 before rerolling again. 
---
I am just lucky that Holy paladins are my favourite class/spec and is always wanted/needed for raids.
---
Yes just don't re-cast it until the duration is nearly over in order to maximize its rage efficiency.
---
But yeah, definitely. It's a sizable DPS boost to everything you do.
---
Alt codes.  Dunno the one for √§ on computer, but there‚Äôs charts online.
---
Wolves can't charge, that's a boar-only skill. You'll want to train Growl, Bite, Dash and Furious Howl although Howl is probably only worth using in groups.
---
Ranks don't need to be learned in order, but you're so low level there's not much you could skip yet. Ability source list if you don't have it: https://www.wow-petopia.com/classic/abilities.php
---
Inc butthurt grobb horde
---
&gt; companies want to remain neutral
---
sure but blizzards actions were not "neutral". either way its apparent there's no common ground here.
---
Yeah I cut my teeth in BC and I really want it to get there and stop. But my brother really enjoyed DK. I just don't want it to go that far. Perfectly fine with BC lol.
---
Contemplated joining another friends server thats horde just for my Shaman but haven't bit the bullet yet
---
I'm too low for Ferocious Howl I think, but yeah that's definitely one I want. 
---
But I was under the impression I could teach pets multiple abilities based on how many Training Points I had avaialble? So he could know both Ferocious Howl and Charge, for example? Is that not the case?
---
This is why I have such trouble getting through a queue. Fuckers are sleeping while I just want to play.
---
Pretty nice [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker] you got there.
---
Be a shame if something were to *happen* to it.
---
This is my story with hordies..
---
Do people just want their subreddits to contain like five posts a day? What is the fucking deal with this.  If you‚Äôre bored of a post swipe your thumb half an inch and move on.
---
I love this shit so much
---
Does anyone know if there's an add on that will read quest text out loud for low vision users?  Using a screen reader also reads chat logs and that gets overwhelming fast, but not being able to read the quest text makes the game lack immersion and my low vision friend would like to try.  Thanks!  :)
---
The customers might like the idea of expansions, but they don't work for Blizzard.
---
I personally couldn't care less about some redditor's opinion. 
---
One day we'll get an official announcement. And it's not going to be made on Reddit.
---
there is a faster loot addon that also helps
---
typical boomer, complains and complains
---
I'm a bear tank, i like throwing a healing touches on a warlock between pulls, saves everyone time and it gives me a reason to use my mana
---
&gt; apparently people were too busy streaming to test.
---
STRIMMERS BAD UPDOOT PLS
---
&gt;i could just team up and waste my time killing alliance scum but that doesnt give me any income
---
Yet here you are, wasting time crying about it. You're all talk. Oh and
---
&gt; 60 and geared 
---
won't stop us from ganking you. We will be just as geared as you and we will still have the numbers advantage. Be as stubborn about it as you want, it won't help you. You either group up or you die.
---
Thank you so much for this information it was incredibly informative.
---
Chill out man. Also my point was that efficiency MUST include down time which includes drinking and corpse runs. Both of which you intentionally exclude in order to paint a biased picture.
---
Every damn post on this sub is like Chinese to me. This game is actually nuts.
---
It‚Äôs all part of the plan. They needed to do something to cut down the player base before the removal of layering in phase 2.
---
Based on this response I‚Äôd bet you quit a couple of weeks into TBC and haven‚Äôt touched WoW since.
---
Nobody is saying ‚Äúpservers are classic,‚Äù but if you don‚Äôt understand tanks need hit and crit on their gear for threat generation and that everything this guy said about fury prot is accurate then you just don‚Äôt understand anything about the game.
---
It‚Äôs not 2004 anymore.
---
&gt;Horde gets a trinket with 1% hit and 20AP that is BIS until.... God knows when
---
Until HoJ and Blackhands Breath...so like 8 levels.
---
Im a Horde on Grobb and the server is right about at 50-50 and Horde do fight back. PLENTY of WPVP going on daily...idk where you pulled that info from lol
---
If its announced before the run, its fine. Dont want, dont join, as simple as that. You do not waste time farming someone else an item because you want something else from the dungeon - if you want an item that's reserved, and you join a group with that person, then you're doing something wrong.
---
As long as its advertised in advance and openly, meaning all group members are aware of it when they join, its perfectly fine.
---
Ya'll forgot to strip
---
Truestrikes are pretty fantastic threat shoulders. If you're having difficulty getting your hit gear to drop then they certainly serve.
---
I wouldn't roll on them against a guildie rogue/fury warrior unless I wasn't hit capped and we had a raid soon, but I'd be rolling on them in a pug if I wasn't hit capped.
---
It's called experience.
---
Haha... great editing too
---
My thought is that if I need what's being reserved I don't join, if I don't need it then I will join.
---
3% on hoj not counting the fact that some holy pally might roll need on it for the 2 hours he plays ret pvp a year. I think they should have increased the drop. warriors have to live in brd. I like a lot of the classic content but a few quality of life things would have been nice.
---
have you actually levelled on a pvp server?
---
Would Gandalf be a Mage or a Priest in the WoW universe? He's a wizard who uses light magic, right?
---
dude when im 60 ill have a priest by my side all the time try killing me. 
---
im grinding rn and not wasting my time tf you saying lol you still a bitch
---
I'm hoping that they will release the expansions and give us the option to stay on our server or move on to the next expansion, that way there will always be classic, BC and LK only servers... after that I don't care lol.
---
I‚Äôve been a DPS warrior. They can be honest with themselves when they apply to tank for groups, they‚Äôre doing it for the potential for DPS drops. Nothing wrong with it, been a fact of WoW since forever. 
---
I skipped all the BS and re-rolled mage/rogue. Nobody has any surprise on what I‚Äôm doing in a group.
---
At best demoshout will hold against healing aggro. It won‚Äôt do anything during a mages aoe. For that situation I use revenge for chance to stun from talents, concussive blow to stun the runner closest to the mage and taunt. Of course sunder armour and shield slam and interrupts are used as well but when a mage is going hard in strat dead I am not going to hold aggro unless I either start the fight at 100 rage and have bloodlust CD or I‚Äôm going to mitigate the damage using stuns and taunt.
---
You know what I meant. Wrong class for them. Okay so they listened to since YouTuber who told them what's viable and what's not. Then they implemented that. Ok, so they got fooled by a YouTuber. They learned their lesson. Are you saying they don't deserve a second chance ?
---
They didn't keep the Tuesday reset?
---
It's not a big difference, haven't had any need to try it out yet because tank shortage is much worse than the healer shortage on my server. So can't say how big the difference feels personally. But I assume you would have slightly worse aggro (no 10% increased damage from Natural Weapons) and the lack of Omen of Clarity will make 5-man Rage + Cat solo-play a bit worse.
---
I would definitely max Feral Instict and leave Thick Hide at 3/5 instead to trade a relatively minor Armor gain to more threat.
---
Updates are crucial for an MMO's survival.
---
OSRS is living proof. Look up playcounts from release back in 2013 to now in 2019. They grew because the game evolved while still keeping the OldSchool vibe.
---
Your elitist nostalgia alone will not keep this game afloat.
---
When I get on my knees at the goldshire inn I don‚Äôt want to see someone named dildobaggins
---
This response is a exactly the mentality of the type of warlock OP is complaining about. You are wrong, the healer is not obliged to heal you if you tap. The warlocks that stand 'ready' for the next pull on 50% health or less and not bother to eat while the healer is sat drinking and then expect the healer to heal them are the worse.
---
You would not stay in any group I was lead of, a swift kick and a L2P are in order.
---
It's just a matter of time before I get reported
---
sounds like a positive effect if that guy is out of that guild lol he gets to move on easier.
---
Using feint would make you top 99% tho
---
If his main spec is combat swords then it follows the rules. PvP and PvE aren't specs, they're different types of content lmao.
---
Goal is to keep everyone alive, not at high health.  As long as they don't pull aggro, they can manage themselves for the most part.  They should also never lifetap to full mana and no HP at the end of a pull, that's retarded, especially if you have to drink anyway they should also go half/half and eat/drink.
---
They don't have that data, so they would just have to guess at what the bugs and tuning actually was. I seriously doubt they would try that.
---
DM door to avoid farming the key?
---
Can‚Äôt use Aimed Shot with a 2.5 speed bow without clipping auto-shots. 
---
In addition, it‚Äôs the best stat boost for melee until AQ/Naxx, and you won‚Äôt get enough to arm all your melee compared to MC clears. 
---
There‚Äôs no discussion. Hunters get Rhok or pvp or wait for BWL.
---
Horde 1v1?
---
Between the multiple mentions of this in the original post (I should have known this sub wouldn't actually read my post and just instinctively have a full blown autism attack) and multiple clarifications throughout the comments and two hypermad warriors strawmming everywhere: I've been very clear that there's no issue taking damage gear.
---
I have issue with tanks who are tanks for main spec who take tanking downgrades that are damage gear so that they can hit harder.
---
Good mmo?you cant even play it yet
---
With no tone, physical cues, or knowledge of your temperament, Yes, words are the only way to extract meaning.
---
so hunters should roll need. got it.
---
As a hunter, I'd steer clear of that bow.
---
Its attack speed is very bad! It doesn't work well in our rotation.
---
We want weapons with 2.8+ attack speed, at least, so we can do 3 autoshots during the aimed shot cooldown (which is 6 seconds).
---
Ideally you'd have a 3.45 attack speed weapon, which goes doen to 3s with a 15% quiver, so the closes thing is the Chromaggus xbow that we'll get when BWL is released.
---
but 2.5 si way too fast and it interferes with your aimed shot cooldown!
---
Honestly, WC logs isn't really meant to be used to look at rankings based on allstar points. WClogs is better used as a tool for the raid group to get better information on player performance. 
---
Allstar points are pretty dumb since they don't really show how it's calculated.
---
I am middle-aged and work at a large company - (4) people I work with have also all quit.  I suspect younger folks will be back... older folks maybe not.
---
In my experience they usually are safe on their own until you can spare some mana or time to heal. The only instance i would actually heal would be if they get aggro or when they move in a group to cast Hellfire cause it is probably certain they will get some sort of aggro.
---
While leveling, just worry about what your pet can learn.
---
Nah, healing is fun, because you are the star, not the tank :) its totally cool because in the end all this +spellpower items are optional and just make your job easier and less stressful.
---
&gt;Or is there two responses, just being near, and actually killing?
---
Pretty sure it's both; they simply spawn *more* guards if they're attacked.
---
Well, we are waiting.
---
If you claim that the data presented is biased and that there are better sources to sample, the onus is on you to provide refuting evidence.  Otherwise, you are screaming that I'm wrong with nothing to back it up.
---
But hey, keep believing your viewpoint is validated by....the circlejerk in your head.

More to your point, a poll on the official retail forums would be biased towards your viewpoint, simply because those who didn't want classic but want TBC would be more likely to respond positively to that poll.  Just as a poll on the official classic forums would be be negative towards a poll about TBC.
---
Despite my desire to see Classic stay permanent and be able to raid level 60 Naxx 4 years from now for the fun of it, the easiest solution for Blizzard is to release the next expansions as well.  It's substantially simpler to re-release them instead of making new content.  They've admitted the hard work of building the Classic engine is over, so importing the next expansions will be easy.  That said, I hope they do poll the community and don't go for the fast buck.  Time will tell.
---
Fishing.
---
that's an awful argument because you need sinew from onyxia as well which is also a 50/50 drop.
---
You're consigning hunters to use blues until they get both parts when striker's is a much higher dps increase for a hunter than it is for any melee.
---
Got it.
---
There‚Äôs not enough tanks so as a dps I understand that once they‚Äôre geared they have no incentive to tank for me except if they can roll on certain items.
---
Bringing attention to a problem IS contributing.
---
Sadly this isn't UO lol.
---
why is it a stupid question?
---
Yes gotta keep those debuffs up
---
It's a company, that has a stakes in China..... They have to do what's best for the company and stay as politically neutral as possible.
---
But you probably don't understand how things in business work. You probably read 2 articles and had a huge emotional response about something you know nothing about. Your an idiot, and I hope to God more people aren't like you, or the world is going to be fucked.
---
No this is wrong.  When you stack "as much hit as you can" you trade off agility/strength/AP/critcal strike for more hit.  Having more white hits and crits land doesn't mean you're doing more DPS if you sacrifice your AP and crit %.  It's okay to miss some of you attacks hit harder.
---
Imp shred is trash in this build. The downside of HotW/NS is cat becomes pretty bad without Omen of Clarity, Natural Weapons, and LotP. 
---
These points are better spent in maxing Feral Instinct and more Thick Hide.  Imp Bash is fine for dungeons and PvP though.
---
I was in the same boat of confusion as you. I read that pets gain points through leveling and assumed that meant leveling up gave you the points...but as others have said, it's a fixed amount based on level and loyalty.
---
But also have others have said, you will need to tame a high level pet to learn its higher level spells.
---
I like my wolf but I want the top rank of furious howl so I'll be stabling my current wolf, taming a new one, using it until I get the "you learned furious howl" message, abandoning it, and teaching the new ski to my old wolf.
---
You mean like aoe? Or just being able to kill two mobs and survive? Can frost shock kite one and just let the other one run full speed while you beat it's ass.
---
Imagine if DPS used a threat meter instead of a DPS meter.
---
Instead of just waiting for Mobs to beat their ass.
---
To be fair, that 1-shot macro is an arcane mage, not a fire mage.
---
And alliance hunters, since that's the only trinket they get that gives AP. Literally their Preraid BiS.
---
I‚Äôve yet to see the situation even mentioned. Definitely can‚Äôt see a difference in population either.
---
I reported that name.
---
On my server its so much more horde than Alliance. And the ganking is pretty bad. The horde usally have 10-20 people outside Ubrs, sholo and strat, and stops anyone from entering and have like 4 priest mindcontrolling people into the lava. They do this every day for hours and hours. I got ganked so much by horde in groups in stv i get ptsd everytime i fly to booty bay.
---
Druids are miles better than prot paladins. They are great in 5 mans, can MT 90% of raids, and are optimal OTs due to the way they generate rage when not being hit plus you want them on any threat sensitive fight
---
I couldn't agree more.
---
"Oooh I've worked really hard to save 90g at level 40 to get my mount"
---
HARD, you worked HARD to get 90g. No, no you didn't.
---
50/50 drop, so youll replace it in like what? 10 days? Whereas melee DPS will be using this until at least phase 3?
---
It certainly is necessary for top tier PvP and PvE, that is not in question.  However, if you're not pushing serious progression raids/speed runs or participating in rank 11+ PvP grind, it is not necessary.
---
I probably won't play the expansions even though I loved TBC.
---
is it an EU server? Tell me it's an EU server.
---
You don't judge builds by their talent points in classic. PVE mage is also arcane in that sense, not frost.
---
What matters is your gear and abilities you use.
---
It's not the only thing, sure, but let's take a look the other options:
---
* Healthstones: 2min cd and barely health/mana efficient (1120 mana for 1200 health yay)
---
* Drink/eat every other pack: works but slows the group down a lot, other caster classes have much bigger mana pools
---
* Bandage on CD:  gets pretty expensive, I don't think any other class would be willing to burn through stacks of runecloth per dungeon either.
---
I mean we can manage without heals but we really need to rely on either drain or food/drinks, and by extension make the dungeon much slower for everyone. Shadow Bolt does over 2.5x as much DPS as Drain Life at base damage values and that gap only widens with +SP and crit. Minmaxing is one thing, but that kind of a damage increase feels like a no brainer to me. Mobs die faster and the tank needs less heals.
---
Yuppppp judgement-eu
---
The tournament was chinese and china based.
---
37 Disc priest here.  Only comments about my spec are on reddit.  In game, everyone loves the priest that gives out spirit and can handle a group while being the lowest level there.
---
"Is he legit dead?"
---
"its like sleep, but better"
---
Am rogue but... the way I see it. If you going to Afk in middle of jungle or whatever I am going to make you pay for it.
---
Powershifting, using abilities/items out of form, MCP, mouseover macros to name a few.
---
My real answer is that I haven't noticed any change whatsoever btw. Nobody in game has even mentioned it either. A very small percentage care, and I bet an even smaller percentage actually follow through with it.
---
I guess he meant legion, or rather bfa, engine. There are a lot of hardware/technical changes from the retail client and serverside that made it to classic. Most notably of course is the graphics. You cant even set your game to Exclusive Fullscreen anymore.  
---
But also some gameplay changes like friendly nameplates being blocked from altering through addons in dungeons and raids, after they changed that during legion due to one encounter being abused by it.
---
Congrats dude! Happy birthday :)
---
RemindMe! 10 hours
---
Yea I can also add that 1 hit = around 15sp and 1 crit = 10-12sp or something like that.
---
Also, company ahead quarters dont superceded the laws of another country
---
Nope, needs to specifically say spell crit to work.
---
For golem, you have your group just run straight down the mid to the boss' room. Turn around and then pull the immediate pack that is on your right, hugging the wall. This is the only trash pack you need to clear and the whole inclusion of Golem Lord only adds on about a min to a min and a half (considering time for drinking after Anger).
---
If people really want to support HK they should post videos of themselves deleting all their gear and characters, uninstalling WoW, then show the confirmation screen of unsubbing.
---
Few quick points:
---
1) No, Thunderclap is not good for threat. It's a mitigation tool. Useful once you already have threat and want to lower incoming damage a bit.
---
2) Demo shout is useful to initially get mobs on you, but beyond that it won't generate enough threat to keep mobs on you. Tab Revenge&gt;Sunder is how you keep aoe threat.
---
3) For snap threat on the pull, charge in, bloodrage, berserker stance, and hit them with a whirlwind. Then swap to defensive stance and start tab revenge/sunder. That should keep the mobs on you long enough to get a round of revenge/sunders out.
---
4) If dps attack a target that's not skull before skull is dead, don't chase it. Let them tank it. If they won't follow kill priority, they can handle the mess they make. Just keep an eye on the mob incase they feign/vanish/etc and the healer gets threat. In that case, berserker stance, intercept, taunt.
---
What this reflects is a problem with Blizzard's reporting process.  They're allowing an automated system, likely without any human input, to run the show...
---
No one can aoe farm like a mage. Druids can do things like Moonfire/Insect swarm 3-4 mobs, pop barkskin and hurricane them down and switch to bear + swipe for that last 5%. Can do this for elementals in Felwood or the lashers once DM comes out.
---
&gt; I think it‚Äôs a passing interest for the vast majority. Either due to nostalgia or because they never experienced embryonic WoW.
---
&gt; We can be sure when 9.0 drops, Classic will be a ghost town until the next phase. It‚Äôs 15 years old and handles like a 15 year old game.
---
I dont know man, I think the reason Classic is popular now and why it was popular back then is because it's enjoyable game play.  All the way 1-60, you feel your character slowly powering up and able to fight harder and harder bosses.  I understand the game is a bit janky compared to most new games but that's part of the appeal to it IMO.  
---
People still play Diablo 2 22 years later and that game is outdated as fuck but people play it because it's just enjoyable gameplay.  To say with absolute impunity that the Classic community will fade I think is unfair.
---
So does Ice Block.
---
&gt; I don't know for sure if this is legion style, or just 1.12 behavior though.
---
The guard spam was added in vanilla during the same patch dishonorable kills were implemented. Not sure if it's evolved any further post-BC, but I distinctly remember this patch significantly reducing world pvp.
---
A suspension is tampering with his income lol. 
---
He knew the rules and broke them.
---
It looks like you never left combat despite vanishing possibly due to spell batching so your threat never got removed.
---
this place has almost 400k subs.  it's past the point of return and will forever be a shithole of fanart/low effort boomer shit
---
Your pet will teleport to you off a lot of those ledges but it's too inconsistent to risk usually

Fucking primadonnas.

Nobody really gives a shit that you're a tank, I'll rather wait another 20 minute to get that a tank that's not a whiny bitch.
---
The icons change depending on the modifier you have pressed
---
Where do posts with nonsense pie charts fall in?
---
from what I read that striker's mark is only about a 5% dps upgrade over blue pre raid crossbows due to the attack speed. that's a pretty minor upgrade but still an upgrade.
---
whereas the bow is just bis for melee dps.
---
I think towards mid to late progression the bow always goes to melee dps, no questions asked. Early guild progression, I could see an argument for hunters to get it. But that feels more like a matter of guild culture.
---
If you want quality posts, you can look elsewhere on the internet.

I‚Äôm proud I came up with this one.

Man, who is boycotting these bitches at Blizzard? This is crazy. I understand how the execs at this company are shitting their pants when China threatens to boycott, but if there is no price to pay for caving, then we are all doomed. The best thing that could happen is if Blizzard quarterly results get wrecked and all the other CEO's fear backlash more than the Chinese.
---
The difference between optimal and memespec can be less than 5% in some cases.  Especially for leveling.  It really comes down to how you play and how close you can get to the 'ideal' playstyle and rotation.
---
Also happens to mine sometimes, but lately isn't happening.
---
Dont forget about bullshit china talk. Keep that shit in r/politics
---
Hey what's the laptop you're using? Been looking at possible mobile options to play when I'm traveling as well but my current laptop is trash.
---
Melee dps uses this for the entirety of vanilla u til they get the crossbow from kel‚Äôthuzad, case closed.
---
It's a microcosm of r/gaming.
---
Made a female night elf warrior named Vulvarine. People reported me and blizzard made me change it.
---
Ive noticed a drastic change in Alliance pop on Skeram. It seems like it's getting worse and worse, probably 85/15 now. Very hard to get groups if you're a DPS that isn't a mage or fury war. Not sure if it's people just falling off, or the faction imbalance is making people quit/reroll.
---
7% I‚Äôm guessing mask of the unforgiven, ony neck, UBRS bracers, devilsaur set and what‚Äôs the last bit? Rune of the guard captain? Is your raid prioritizing threat pieces like band of accuria to you?
---
I need to start e‚Äôko farming. And I pop brute force but the extra stamina is probably wasted at this point. Have you considered switching to the 10 str food from AD? How many MCPs do you use per MC clear? I was 3rd tank the last 4 clears but I‚Äôm being promoted to 2nd tank so my threat generation is more relevant now and I‚Äôm trying to make sure it improves.
---
Skin on the side for materials, but note that leveling up / questing in your 40s will give you more gold than randomly farming.
---
Play the economy, but don't go too crazy
---
Striker's mark is complete trash for hunters.
---
Split the pack.  Keep strafing while only attacking one of them, until the others tether and reset.  Then you only fight one mob.
---
This is such a unique interaction thanks to classic.
---
I remember doing things like this all the way till wrath with the mammoth mount parades and what not. It all died once layering was made into a thing and I saw once someone trying to do a mammoth parade in legion but I phased out for some reason and I was left sad.
---
I love classic, it's everything I missed and wanted in an MMORPG.
---
The MMO part.
---
Yeah Druids are actually very good tanks in Classic.  People actually started wising up to this near the end of the Vanilla era, but now people know it from the start.
---
Fuck Blizzard
---
But this actually fine.  Pull the next pack if I am at &gt;50% mana.  I will drink while you get aggro and won't pull the next pack off you when I pop blizzard.
---
I took 2 weeks of pto. My guild and I played pservers. We love vanilla wow. I also moved to a new city so I don‚Äôt know anyone outside of work. Maybe it‚Äôs been only a month of raiding. Feels longer though.
---
I'm convinced a majority of the people who cancelled or uninstalled were people who were done or about to be done anyway or like those people that have a gym membership but don't go and are too lazy to cancel and being part of the crowd and getting screenshot for karma was enough of a push for them to pull the trigger.
---
Don't get me wrong, I think some were legit, but I just don't think it was as many as it seems and like u/ponzLL said, I think a lot will be back soonish.
---
They can aoe farm for sure, but it's definitely not on the same level as mages.
---
I thought hunter would be really easy but there's so much management to it. Good thing I love managing it

these arent given enough credit lol it was normal to have a bunch of peopel dcing and lagging mid raid.  I struggled to heal bc my fps was like 0 on some fights + I DC'ed all the time and it was just tolerated bc a lot of people were on toasters and dial up

Years ago a ingame buddy said some really scary stuff, enough that I was scared he'd hurt himself so I reported him and the devs called the police and they showed up at his house.

How long do you play that night though? 3 deaths is like 10 minutes lost. If you play for a couple hours that's less than 10%.

Hasn't been mentioned or even brought up in my guild OR general chat on my server.

It's a day and age where its popular to follow the crowd though... so I have a feeling most of the people "outraged" dont actually have any clue what is actually happening and will be back once they get bored following the crowd...

Kara gear is mostly shit for casters, you can craft tons of pieces, get badge gear, and do heroics for others. You sound like someone who makes a lot of excuses.

I got stuck in this, yall just kept killing my poor level 23 priest =(
---
Yup, way to focus on the point.
---
This reminds me of the Radiohead Just video
---
Hm, let's give it a shot!
---
1) Everybody realized they were overreacting to a perfectly acceptable, legal, measure. Blizzard was not the platform for that kind of thing, and will not allow itself to be seized for it.
---
2) Or more likely, people are pack animals that will jump on any bandwagon that lets them feel morally superior for a bit, especially when it comes at the cost of a Reddit post or up vote. Eat the rich guys!
---
3) The third reason I could think of is that the people that said they would leave actually left!
---
Is that the one starring Dixoncider?
---
I haven't noticed any change.  My guild did impose a "If you're thinking about quitting because of the China thing, let us know so we don't give you any raid gear.  Also, give away your shit to the guild before you do.
---
I knew I wasn‚Äôt crazy about being able to use tensing combo points as the job fell! I miss this SnD too
---
I came to these comments to say the same thing.
---
I'll be honest. I actually don't give a fuck about Hongkong or China or any of that shit. Doesn't effect me or my family so that's just how I feel. Like, if this was about something that would be directly effecting me, the people I know, and the country I live in I'd be all on board. But I've never been to Asia, and I don't really care to ever go. I'm not apolitical or anything, but this is just one thing I don't really have strong feelings about one way or the other. This is their fight, not ours.
---
Re-roll on PvE lmao. Sad
---
So maybe, just maybe, they should've done some actual testing?
---
Nope, no noticeable change.
---
Doesn't that get added to his drop table in a later phase?
---
Yep. This was the event that pretty much killed my love for Blizzard. WoW was a great game, but it died a long time ago. Even Classic hasn't changed the fact that Blizzard's culture has changed completely, and who they have has changed completely. It's not the company I had fallen in love with with WC3 and Diablo 2 and WoW is just not worth what they want for it, especially once they start using that money to support things I consider abhorrent.
---
Came to say the same
---
Dude that's so true I played until wotlk before playing classic I just checked out starting a blood elf on retail to get that bc nostalgia, I was soooo confused hahaha
---
Party leader can do what they want, ESP if they are tanks and/or healers. You don't have to join or add the the toxicity in LFG/Trade as long as they aren't spamming for 1+ hour.
---
Pugging is what it is, you can either form your own pug or run with your friend / guildies who I'm sure have their way way of dealing with loot that's not always standard with pugs 'rules' either.
---
I would never take it just because it would reduce my chances of getting Rhok.

---
Archage was a really fun mmo except for the pay2win shit and they are launching Archage Unchained without any of that crap this month.
---
Right, so what I said still stands. I said the guard spawn rate without actually hitting them was "Manageable." When we attacked them it became ridiculous and we had to retreat.  
---
We did the same in Splintertree Post. We did not take out any civilians and everything was very "Ok" until we did, then it was TERRIBLE. lol.
---
You want to know which quests are annoying af on a crowded server? Literally any quest in a contested zone as Alliance.
---

---

---
What is the ranking for tanks based on? Threat? Damage avoided?
---
Even rogues aoe now, so my philosophy is that I'm gonna lose threat on probably one mob no matter what, so putting a skull on that is a great way to hold threat on everything else. ;)
---
Also if you're new to a dungeon, kindly request an experienced party member to skull whatever packs you need to pull. Think of it as painting the targets with a laser, and you're the missile
---
Man this just isn‚Äôt true at all. Is your guild just going to stop doing raids? No.
---
It‚Äôs the random shitter trials that are most likely to stop coming after getting a few pieces, not the people that have been with the guild the longest.
---
Why rogues if you don't mind me asking?
---
Feint is kind of bad, it's roughly equivalent to one Sinister Strike crit's worth of threat. Which, if a tank can't match that over the 10-15 seconds it might take for a mob to kill you, that's pretty poor.
---
Besides, unless you're in a raid, you can take hits from a mob with no issues, Tanks just get super salty if you don't let them get 5 sunders on every mob before you start attacking.
---
Let‚Äôs talk about the fact that reddit is now actively trying to silence the voice of democracy on the behalf of blizzard. Hong Kong HS player @blitzchungHS said "Liberate Hong Kong, revolution of our age!"
---
Or that the decent tanks are being hounded 24/7 by guildies to tank dungeons, so coming across one while pugging is less likely?
---
This is getting out of hand!
---
It's interesting that i almsot never hear rogues talking about, or using, Feint. I'v been using it so much lately and it does actually work quite well. I'll ALWAYS work a feint into my open burst on bosses and stuff, its a lifesaver that most people just completely overlook.
---
Don't know of any resources but here's my experienced advice:
---
Pay attention
---
Listen to the raid leader and your class leader
---
 Use lower rank heals to conserve mana and so you aren't overhealing 
---
Bring mana potions.
---
Make sure you have plenty of snacks and water but don't get your keyboard greasy.
---
Honestly, it is pretty easy and unless you're really really bad you should be fine
---
the whole HK thing is being contained to one thread, so wave goodbye to this one.

Did you know what it meant at the time?
---
HoJ doesn't replace this on hunters. Also, ease of acquisition.
---
Sure. And yet something no one has to deal with on PVE servers. It is just an example to show that your die 3 times isn‚Äôt a small understatement it‚Äôs so low it dismissed the idea that pvp happens. It‚Äôs a constant at least on a high pop server and lets be honest who actually wants to play on an empty server.
---
I was going to post a screen shot of my brother and I with our first lvl 40 mounts...... but I don‚Äôt think I will now!
---
Pathetic unless you're the tank making the group.
---
Ooohhh yeah, soon as I get my epic mount I'm going pom pyro. I'll blow the cd on a lvl 1, idgaf
---
Imagine trying to prop up your low self esteem by shutting on people having a good time.
---
I laughed so hard at this I shot powerade out of my nose.
---
In a well run guild this is true, but nothing about the scenario described indicates a well run guild.
---
My main concern with the 2h tanking is that more of the times it's not the "tank" that takes damage, everyone takes damage so you're healing everyone instead of just one and therefore have to drink every other pull which slows things down. With swordnboard a renew is usually enough :)
---

so if it's against ingame gold, you can't.

---
To be honest that's why rogues sucks especially for pre bis. I stopped playing mine after I got 70% pre bis then rolled a warrior. As soon as I got 60 and pre bis on my warrior a guild offered me a spot as a rogue. Go figure.
---
Damn it feels good to be a rogue. Its going to be super easy to get in those early dm runs.
---
&gt;Horde players are lame.   Population advantage and racial advantage... there is never a time when you can say you won fair and square.

&gt;I think you might need to take a break from the game.   Step outside and get some fresh air.

What server are you on ? Cause that sounds alot better than what I'm used to getting when I'm running aroudn the world in Earthshaker. It doesn't help that my priest's name is GrumpyShaman. I've had alot of people get angry about that too XD

When DM wasnt coming out in 4 days sure. But now you roll against a melee youre just an asshole.

In today's time it is impossible to fight against all injustices at once. At least they are trying to make a difference, which is much more than you are doing by complaining and demonizing people who want to protest but have to pick and chose which battles to fight.
---
More like horde players form a war posse to protect lower level hordlings from being ganked while trying to quest. It has a mind of its own.  If it has a red name tag, it is getting aggro'ed.  It wouldn't have to be this way if it wasn't for alliance players aggression.

This. They‚Äôre the people that say ‚Äúpraying for everyone in HK!!!!  Unacceptable!!!!‚Äù But actually don‚Äôt do anything about it. Acting like China has never mistreated anyone till recently
---
It‚Äôs funny you went with warrior, because I was thinking of going warrior as well. Not nearly as strong as frost mage or as sustainable as priest, but at least I can swing a big weapon, I guess. Lol.
---
Yes, unfortunately this method no longer works. The dead zone for by the bank is no longer there. :(
---
Uhh....
---
As soon as they get SS/WW and WW axe/Ravager/Bonebiter, arms wars should be top dps unless you're pulling 6+ mobs for mage/lock AoE.
---
Yes, I'd love to watch a livecam of the top of Org bank. It's somehow relaxing.
---
nope, but gold gain is significant.  Try it for a few quests and see what you come up with.  It's definitely worth hammering out all the easy quests you can find.
---
I had one goal 15 years ago to get level 60 on my first character by discovering Stormwind City. I failed this task by getting 8 experience from discovering Goldshire.

Everything has been running well for me, follow lutris installer script, make sure the linked to dependencies are installed. Yesterday they updated [battle.net](https://battle.net) and it kept erroring and crashing out, if you have wow classic installed already and don't care about [battle.net](https://battle.net) just point the executable to wow.exe. If you need [battle.net](https://battle.net) running the current work around is to open the Wow Classic Wine Config from the right bar in lutris, go to the libraries tab, then on the drop down box for "new Override for library" scroll down to "api-ms-win-crt-private-|1-1-0" then click add, and do the same for ucrtbase. You should now be able to launch [battle.net](https://battle.net) as normal.  
---
Took me 3 or so hours to troubleshoot this when I got home last night, so I hope this gets some visibility.  
---
Good Luck fellow Linux-nauts!
---
At least back in vanilla it was possible to jump the gate and get into Hyjal which was actually a fully complete zone without any NPCs or mobs. The devs even seemed to expect people getting in because at the very end of the zone you'll find two "Under Construction" signs. Also interesting is that the zone had an instance portal in it, implying there was a dungeon or raid planned as well.
---
Those people do not get party invites from me.
---
Same thought behind why hunters don't have prio on CHT over dagger rogues. Yeah, it's bis for hunters for like 2 phases but it's bis for dagger rogues until AQ. Every time some vendors/DEs an epic it signifies a waste of a raid resource.
---
That vampire boss on 25 man was 2 buttons. Earth shield the tank and cast chain heal. Don't even fuck with riptide. Win at healing meters except maybe if there's only 1 druid.
---
Read the room man. This is just insulting in the face of all those hong kong protesters. Take this shit to r/sino where it belongs. #freeHK
---
&gt; this sounds made up
---
I will let you guys know if it pans out. If it does I will explain the why and the how. I want my mount at 40 mostly tired of running everywhere.
---
they werent playing patch 1.12. we are.
---
I feel the same and also I feel like I'm missing out on 60 stuff plus the roll out of new content is making me anxious I'll miss out even more
---
I had one goal 15 years ago.  It was to get level 60 on my first character by discovering Stormwind City. I failed this task by getting 8 experience from discovering Goldshire.

Before I say anything I would like to clarify that I think blizzard went way over the top on their punishment.
---
Wouldn‚Äôt any company keep politics out of there live broadcasts? (Assuming it‚Äôs sole purpose is not to spread news)
---
A hearthstone tournament probably isn‚Äôt the right place to talk about controversial issues.
---
The player in question could have shown his support for Hong Kong outside of blizzards event.
---
What have you done to help Flint, MI? Or starving limbless blind orphans in New Delhi. GTFO of here with your holier than thou bullshit. You canceled a game sub and act like you've liberated an entire country. Do something worth a single iota of a fuck before you pass judgement on others.
---
Tanks are seen as the leader of a group and I guess it's just cause they lead the way forward cause if something gets aggroed its the tank that gets it right away.
---
when you have sinned, it's time to become Holy
---
Those two touch fuzzies
---
This is terrible advice, you can heal as retribution from 20 and up with absolute ease, and seal of command offers a significant boost to your DPS and in turn your speed completing quests.
---
Yeah, that what I was saying.  I prefer to run with my guildies, cause I know they suck, so I am not disappointed. :P
---
Due to their comments on the Burning Legion, the high elves have been removed from the game and their sunwell confiscated.
---
WSG started at 11-20 originally, they later in vanilla moved this down to 10-19.  
---
You are probably thinking of AB which starts at 20-29.
---
MY PARTICULAR FACTION DOES THIS MORE THAN YOUR PARTICULAR FACTION
---
plus after 10 full days logged out in an inn you hit the rested xp cap.  and outside of an inn the rested xp gain is extremely fractional.
---
Seems you missed the point of OPs post entirely. Work on comprehension before you get snide.
---
No idea what that is hehe
---
Oh, well, I didn't know that! Guess I'll just remove Feint from my rogue's hotbars and keybind. Shit, if I had known this earlier I wouldn't have bothered training it!
---
A mage can open the lock as well by just blinking over the pack. So basically 4/9 classes can skip that pack under all circumstances.
---
Honestly considering the hassle of resetting on OP's route (or the alternative zigzag walk back) it's still easier and quite possibly faster to just go the usual route and dodge most groups leading up to the gate. All you have to kill on most runs is the 2 patrolling fire elements, the 2 dwarfs a bit after the stairs, and 1 dwarf at the gate (the left pack won't aggro if you stick to the right close enough).
---
The thing is that going prot is bad both in grps and solo, most dmg mitigation comes from being a few lvls higher than the mobs you're fighting, not talents+shield. And using 2 -h causes more threat and dmg, if you think it's fun, go ahead, but it is far worse than using a 2-h for almost all aspects.

I spent probably a week farming for [The Chief's Enforcer](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=9477/the-chiefs-enforcer), so I could potentially have a bit of hard CC on my shaman in PvP. It was so worth it.
---
I meant something you could consistently farm.  Things like Frostsaber, Warbear, etc.  There's a lot of niche leathers, but most of them are niche for a reason.
---
It's really balanced server privilege, Grobbulus is very near 50/50
---
Good catch. Didn‚Äôt see the cooldown
---
&gt;Feral and Boomkin are fun for PvE and PvP they absolutely can contribute - but you will have to work 2x as hard, and farm 2x the amount of consumables to be about 90% of where you'd be as a true DPS/Tank class.
---
I have to mostly agree and somewhat disagree here.
---
DPS...yes, 100%.  Boomkin is just straight garbage and Feral DPS has to put in ENORMOUS effort to be viable, and you'll still never top the meters.
---
Feral Tanking...is viable.  While there is still a stigma and admittedly, they're not the most well rounded tank (lacking key CDs that warriors have).  However, for single target threat generation, they cannot be beat until Phase 5/6 by amazingly well geared warriors.  Yes, farming MCP can be a pain, but their blue gear scales better into raiding than warrior gear often does.
---
I'm not advocating them as the MT, but they should be one of the two OTs in raids and they should MT a few fights where they're just better than warriors. 
---
The great news is that on fights where they aren't needed as OT, they can dps (full feral build) or heal (0/30/21 build).  No prot specced warrior will match their dps and that warrior sure as heck isn't healing anyone.
---
How did you get the font?
---
Classic has some "interesting" itemisation, let's just put it that way.
---
Go run back to r/conspiracy where you will be safe in your echo chamber of stupidity.
---
I think you're lookin too deep into it but if that's what you enjoy have at it. I guess it depends how many healers your raid brings but in my experience you're just going to be spamming heals and each individually placed one won't matter as much
---
ayyy this is pyrewood village EU right? :D i recognise some of the gnames
---
I don't even have time for one char. How do you even get multiple professions? If you need to level the alts as well??
---
Laughs in Druid who just casted faerie fire on you.
---
Just giving him an option bro. CHILLLLLLLLLLL
---
You should stop using reddit as well since Reddit took money from Tencent. While you‚Äôre at it, leave the US as well since China owns the biggest portion of US treasury bonds
---
If you have feral gear, pounce and then use all your dots before going bear form.
---
I‚Äôve tanked every dungeon through ZF so far.  I have three healers on my friends list now that all said I was better than any warrior tank they‚Äôve played with so far.  As soon as I log on, I‚Äôm hit with at least 1 whisper asking me to tank a dungeon.
---
My goal is to tank/dps in every raid.  I feel like it‚Äôs a little harder to master than warrior.  Mainly in the fact that you bring a ton of utility and can pull off some crazy speed runs.  Gearing also is a little harder as you tend to focus on one, maybe 2 pieces of gear from a dungeon.  Though I‚Äôm looking at Mara and beyond and I see a ton of great replacement gear.  Those quest pants from Gnomer have held up for like 20 levels now lol.
---
Classic+ could be fucking awesome. 
---
It could also be fucking awful, and ruin the game forever. They‚Äôre not gonna remove content after spending development time on it, even if everyone hates it.
---
Guess it depends on how much you trust Blizzard.
---
Yes! You should make a post about it!
---
I mean if you're one of the people deleting your battle.net account why wouldn't you give all your stuff away?

The adults will try and figure this out go play games and watch sports
---
Is twink gear already selling. I have a few pieces I was saving and assumed it was too early.
---
Personally on a warrior tank, level 38 with enough gold for a mount, after grinding cooking/fishing/first aid past 250, and grinding out for guildie professions to get to 250+, I'm throwing in the towel. Rerolling as a shammy dps so I can heal while I level, I'll redo all my professions.
---
I have a priest healer too. I can do dungeons all day, I can relax &amp; smoke a bowl &amp; watch a movie in the background. It's a totally relaxed experience. As a tank it is the single most challenging thing I've ever done in any game, requires me to bring my A game at every single pull, micro-manage literally everything at all times, it requires full attention. I have more macros than abilities, even the basic ones blow my guildies minds.. but they're required, not advanced for tanks. I feel like I'm ripping away at my keyboard at 1.5quadrillion WPM just to make a pull happen. It's simply not worth it.
---
I personally main a hunter because I enjoy playing one and they are really good levelers, gold makers and not too over played when compared to warriors and mages. If my dps falls off in Naxx I can always make a warlock later.
---
You top the damage meters in your raid? That should not be possible no matter how good your RNG is ... I have bad news about your raid...
---
Yeah casters often need scatter trap. But i catch melee in trap with just FD&gt; trap all the time.
---
And druids are the king of fleeing.
---
Well it was an example of a name that one might find in WoW.  There are many, many more like it, and it would be nice if I didn't have to deal with them all.  There's really no place for them in the game.  This isn't PUBG, or some other realistic Mature rated game where I could give a shit if people are named that, because kids shouldn't be involved with those games.  It's the same thing in a game like Rocket League, which is just a fun game on its own, but everyone insists on having awful names with racy profile pics, and it just creates an issue for younger kids playing that wouldn't be there otherwise.
---
That's literally what every new feature entails. How the fuck do you think the classic client was developed?
---
as someone who tried doing this in vanilla, dont do this. its very suboptimal and only really works when you outgear the content /pvp opponent so much that almost any keymashing approach would also win.
---
The caps are different though, there's no insane hit penalty for hitting higher level players, but it still increases as level gap grows.
---
If I'm grinding out rep for Timbermaw Hold, should I wait to do the quests until I hit revered to max my rep gain?
---
I have been corrected I looked into it further and have in-fact  found it does. Now I am just trying to figure out when I only have enemy player checked why it shows enemy mob actions. I can‚Äôt keep up with the log as much as I like due to this. I feel it will better develop me as a player to see what another person used and how I should react in the future.
---
I think if they res the item and everyone agrees and you roll need it‚Äôs not borderline ninja, it is a ninja.  Blizzard will take your side and remove the item from them if there are written words agreed too in chat. It‚Äôs been done.
---
Haha that is my concern also: having a main res. I am considering paladin or Druid because I like both tanking and healing. Druids seems more fun though, since I get the feeling that paladins are very straight forward.
---
Don't u love playing this on modern computers? When I was a kid I couldn't see this far with the family computer lol
---
I wouldn't call it OP. Helpful, yes. But it's only 25% chance to resist, i believe. 
---
OP would be always immune to stuns.
---
Playing on flamelash eu proves that to be complete bull my guy. Do you really think the lvl ?? Horde hunter that watched my paladin emote towards a hordelock who started dotting me while fighting panthers was saving anyone from a gank by killing me?
---
Your level 32 ... your streaming until 40 ? I just don‚Äôt see it...
---
Came here to mention this as he/she has a following also.
---
It just makes everything so much easier because you have to cast everything in bunches. I have a macro that lets me swap forms while I‚Äôm shapeshifted, one that un-shapeshifts me and casts my HoT, and one that shifts and goes into prowl automatically. A few more for QoL as well.
---
You can always be a hero WSG flag runner.
---
What happens if they get reported enough? Do they have to change their name or will they get a random one?
---
Lol ab before your mount was just terrible
---
Thank you so much for all this work! Your profiles are just perfect :-D Thank you thank you thank you thank you!
---
For 'normal' items , even if they are preraid BiS I think this is absurd to reserve it.    That's what GUILDS are for!   you run lvl 55-60 dungeons with your guild so that your members can gear up. 
---
It's fine for S.P.E.C.I.A.L  items, like Ironfoe . These have such low droprates that a dedicated farmer should reserve it.  the people who join him accept that and know they can get all the other loot as the Ironfoe farmer won;t be interested in that
---
&gt;Sadly
---
Ah, of course!  You‚Äôre right.  I just saw the robes and assumed he was a priest.  Forgot gnomes can‚Äôt be priests in classic.
---
I am lvling to 60 as ret on my alt but picking up 11 points in holy first for consecrate. most of our paladins leveled Holy the whole way with no issue. Holy shock makes holy not so bad.
---
I'm lvl 46 and my buddy is 42 and feralas is not so plentiful of quests for him tbh.
---
I don‚Äôt think it is. But sure. Everyone is allowed to cry about their ‚Äúmy life is so hard, I picked a pvp serve and have to deal with pvp things‚Äù. It‚Äôs just funny. How I‚Äôll talk about only ever being in 3v1 fights and that‚Äôs smart by the alliance. But then if the horde do it. Those fucking bastard pussies can‚Äôt do pvp and their racials are all better than mine. Well you can reroll bud. 
---
Or like you said can go outside and get some fresh air. Because you‚Äôll only get ganked by someone if you‚Äôre in Highschool in the USA

Far sight on 1. What else is there? I forget, must not have been important. I only played shaman for 8 years.
---
/s
---
the best part, for real.
---
Nope.  Did only 3 resets and was locked on my 4th attempt.  I didn't do any dungeons the entire day before that.
---
As a healer, I've been fairly disappointed with mages lately.   I'll have to ask for an INT buff, I have to ask for another when it drops off, I have to ask for water -- and I usually don't get enough to last for a whole run, so I have to ask for some more.
---
Mages, if you want to be a rock star, keep int active on everybody with a mana bar, and give your healers 3 stacks of good water at the start of a dungeon.
---
-- Guy who played Mage for over a decade, and is now playing Holy Priest
---
&gt; 3) For snap threat on the pull, charge in, bloodrage, berserker stance, and hit them with a whirlwind. Then swap to defensive stance and start tab revenge/sunder. That should keep the mobs on you long enough to get a round of revenge/sunders out.
---
What do you do before level 30? I've only tanked RFC and WC so far, and everytime WC has been a nightmare.
---
That was very early on IIRC. We should have 10-19, 20-29 etc brackets (except AV with 51-60).
---
"got out of hand"
---
Anytime!  Best of luck.
---
Pick up the holy water from the crates and slam them on the skeletons
---
As an addon to what digital said, the tournament rules also stated that those involved will not use the platform to make political statements...the punishment might of been a bit harsh especially on the casters who didn't say anything, but really the guy knew the rules and chose to break them anyway because he felt it was that important to say.   
---
Regardless of Blizzard's decision the fact that consequences tied to what the man spent years dedicating his life too makes his statement even more powerful imo.
---
You can start it early before the Auto goes off. Go test it, if you have an auto shot timer start the aimed shot when it's half in the red.
---
its only "fun" if youve never played any actual dps spec on any other character. hinestly even a smite happy holy priest does more damage.
---
YTA
---
Why do you need to intentionally wipe to punish them? If you survive the pull, then it was fine. If you don't survive the pull, they get punished anyway.
---
If you don't like their playstyle even when it isn't wiping you, just talk to them about it and politely bow out if you can't come to an understanding. Don't wipe them and waste time just to make a point.
---
Pirate an mmo? Lmao. And don't say play on a private server because we both know private servers aren't accurate. Truth is, if you want to play vanilla wow as it was in 2006 classic is as close as your ever gonna get.
---
The barrens is a huge zone (around twice the size of a normal zone), it has a wide level range, and 3 out of the 4 Horde races are sent there to quest.
---
Add to that quests like the zhevras or stuff that sends you across the zone and you get the Barrens chat
---
Yep. Let the dumb die and protect the healer. Hopefully the lesson is learned and they don't repeat.
---
&gt;. I believe the current mentality of the average WOW player is much more toxic than it used to be. More players would be outraged and just quite these days.
---
That's not a toxic mentality though.
---
When should you disenchant greens and blues vs. vendoring them? My warlock (lvl 37) is an enchanter and so far I‚Äôve been DEing every green and blue. I‚Äôve noticed that I haven‚Äôt really been using the shards, mainly only dust. I have a green and blue in my inventory which will each vendor for 1g, and I currently only have 5g, so vendoring is enticing but continuing to lvl enchanting is still important...
---
It's only natural.
---
Nope, you are nitpicking and biased, I win, bye bye.
---
Most stuff in the first ~3 raids (MC, Ony, BWL) is immune or highly resistant to fire.
---
Been using TSM post scan and working well.
---
I have a great group of around 7 I play with. I'm the MT. Everytime we did strath or UBRS all body pulls or LOS pulls my rogue would always preemptively attack stuff before it got to me or the warrior would charge. 
---
After I said multipule times to stop they kept doing it...I just let them tank a couple of things. They stopped after that :).
---
Can you still get a free server transfer? My friends and I accidentally joined a west coast server and now are coming to the realization we will probably never be able to raid. Also, in the event that we can, anybody got any intel on the east coast servers?
---
For PvE they lack damage until a certain amount of gear.
---
PvP they simply lack utility and survial.
---
Ah ok thanks. I know nothing will come close to Mage for farming really but was curious. I also forgot Sunfire wasnt a thing in Vanilla haha.
---
Gimme that sweet mineral nectar.
---
That's what I'm saying. I remember getting my Barman Shanker and it was the best shit ever! Not even knowing about half of the epic daggers that were better, lol. Thing still Ambushed like a truck tho
---
Yeah. As a warrior, I hate grouping with warriors. They are the worst, and rarely have regard for aggro.
---
Rogue just starts to get good at 46. Weapons from SM Quest, weapon from Maraudon quest. Then you have a bunch of stuff from ZF and Maraudon that would benefit you. ST is decent for exp, too. WPL quests start soon and undead are mostly easy kills. That grind from 35-45 was the hardest.
---
How common? There's usually at least one player in party that hasn't heard of it before. It's pretty easy to pick up, though with the gate still open it's also easy to fall to the bridge below by accident since the floor isn't real.
---
Boohoo... your helping, good job. Yay you.
---
Youre applying misaligned context to a quote so it fits your view thats actually kind of funny
---
What about pvp ?
---
its on definition. braging isnt about other people. if he would have said "i have a great name" then it could be called braging
---
If they are upfront about it, it's completely fine. If it's an item you're after, do not join, otherwise join up and enjoy the fast group formation. Seems like a win/win.
---
If there are too many groups doing this, for items that are too in demand for the slots they need filled, they will have trouble filling the group and will have to remove the reserve.
---
It's a really good way to balance out groups for ideal item distribution so that you have for example players wanting different items X, Y, and Z all in a group. Instead of 3 players wanting item X, X, X in one group and 3 wanting Y in another and 3 wanting Z in a third group.
---
crusader does not. i think the counterweight does? but mostly people go for the +25 agility (or whatever it is)
---
Dang, dont know why it doesnt change my view distance. Thanks!
---
It‚Äôs used because it is objectively the best way to help the raid succeed. Your problem is with bad guilds, not a bad system.
---
What's comical is that Blizzard is getting all this backlash for punishing a player who broke the rules,  but most of the world is ignoring all of the other larger corporations that cater to china every single day.
---
It's not very viable, as you said it can get expensive and also take into consideration that if you're in a guild that does DKP you're hindering yourself as you're getting 2 sets of gear.  If it's loot council, they should see it as healers will get priority to healing gear and shadow/dmg gear priority goes to better dps aka mages/locks unless you're the GM/officer and funneling gear to yourself.
---
Fair enough and i'm definitely looking through rose tinted goggles.
---
That said, gear can make up a lot of that 15% if you're just taking random mages
---
Down with Blizzard!
---
First two raids have a lot of fire resistance.  And Frost in general is better for pvp because of the slows. That being said, if you like playing fire spec go for it.  You can still toss a frost bolt or nova in pvp. You‚Äôll just be a little gimped dmg wise for MC and BWL
---
It takes some time to find groups for non-end game instances even on high-pop server until BRD. I would say that most lower level instances take about 10-30 minutes to find a full group on Mograine (more if it's RFD or BFD for alliance as those aren't that popular).
---
From BRD forward you basically find them instantly at this point.
---
Double crusader is better on swords since you can proc both for 2 separate crusader buffs
---
The short list:
---
\-Items for Quests with GREAT rewards;
---
\-Items needed for Class quest;
---
\-Items for Quests with no rewards but most people get because its part of a major quest hub;
---
\-recipes suggested in prof leveling guides;
---
\-raw mats used in most profession leveling guides;
---
\-Vanity items;
---
\-BiS Twink items;
---
They hit really hard in pvp, but they lack the survivability of a frost mage
---
It is what it is, really. I'd rather it not be a thing, but the impact it has on me is very minor; if I want a chance what is reserved, I'll be the tank for a different group and the person reserving an item is free to make him and his group wait another 40 minutes for a different tank. It's more troublesome for DPS who already have a hard time finding groups without "reserved" groups sucking members from the already small supply of tanks/healers.
---
It's hilarious when people reserve practically the only reason to join the group; the number of "LFM Jed/Rend run | Briar + swords reserved" or "arena + golem farm, savage chest + HoJ reserved" is absurd ... but I probably see loads of them because nobody joins those groups!
---
I think the **true** problem is when people whisper to join **your** group and say "I'll come if you reserve XYZ for me". Like hell nah, you're a Rogue, I ain't reserving jack for you there are hundreds of you LFG.
---
I'm all for Keanu Reeves replacing Chuck Norris in Barrens chat
---
Just make sure your raid knows that.  Nothing like grouping with a R10+ player and dropping him to R1 during the course of a raid on a town.
---
Is that why an American team who literally out a cardboard with the same text as the Asian player who got banned said didn't get a penalty at all?
---
I hope to God more people aren't like you, or the it will be a sad place to be when every single corporation kowtow to China.
---
But then again, you don't seem to know anything else about the situation than a player got banned and got his prize money revoked.
---
I was looking for a PvE realm to join, and initially considered Nethergarde because of smaller pop, but these posts encouraged me to make one on Pyrewood.
---
If you ever run into a dwarf hunter named Baglo, say hi.
---
I think the most you could do is walk around a city or a starting zone.
---
Have you gave it a shot, and can accept you are wrong. As a nice sign of maturity. I felt the same way, and I just deleted all of my characters on PVP servers to roll horde. I'm still loving it
---
depends on damage, if damage is high and we are blowing through packs then aoe mage is god tier because it just makes it smoother but if our damage is low then often the mage will just make it extremely chaotic and messy and often hurting the healers mana especially
---
If you're trying to have a political debate anywhere you're going to have a bad time. The only time a political debate is enjoyable is when no one from the other side shows up
---
Personally I would use devilsaur then. 305 skill gets you 3% hit (2% from skill and removes the 1% negation mechanic), also increases glancing blow damage by ~20%. 
---
The next 3 points (where it caps for glancing blow damage reduction) increase it by ~15%, but only add .3% hit. The hit is negligible since you still need to do a full percentage to get to cap. The 2 points over 308, do nothing for glancing blows and net you another .2% hit, again negligible since you‚Äôll still need to get a full percentage for hit cap.
---
Another option is respeccing and putting 1 point into weapon expertise (iirc is 3 skill) then you wear the gloves and are at the weapon skill soft cap. Max damage from glancing blows and 3% hit increase from 305 skill. Meaning you only need 6% from talents and gear to hit cap (which if you take 5/5 precision means 1% from gear to never miss a yellow attack (does not include poisons as those go off spell hit in vanilla and TBC).
---
My % reduction may be off a bit, will have to double check the math but it‚Äôs around those numbers for glancing blow damage reduction.
---
Nobody could've really tested it in beta too, so now we get to deal with it on live.
---
Rouges are overpowdered.
---
Simply put: If you need to drink, they should need to eat/drink too.
---
Don:t put yourself in a situation where you are drinking and they are at full health/Mana.
---
Those require action from the player.
---
Why not make your own group?
---
If you're a DPS warrior, you're told to tank dungeons to get your raid set.  So this means when I'm tanking I will 100% roll on DPS BiS pieces, that's why I'm tanking dungeons - so I can actually get into groups.
---
I wouldn't worry about this. The jist of it is that certain fights in the current raids are very resistant to fire damage so you will be asked to use frost spec for these fights. Later on though fire mages are very strong and perfectly viable. So far as PvP goes it's a half n half, I personally rather like both frost and fire for PvP; the difference comes down to survivability vs firepower, frost favouring the former and fire the latter.
---
What items do I need from Zul'Farak?
---
It‚Äôs definitely a melee bow in the long run but honestly it‚Äôs a bigger DPS increase for a Hunter than it is for a Melee at this point so I feel hunters should be allowed to roll on it.
---
Very easy to flee and re-open on a target when it suits you. Not needing to take a bad fight is smarter, than just forcing a fight and dying badly.
---
As people hit 60, price will spike, then simmer, and finally settle. Be aware tho that it only takes a few individuals to flood or suffocate the market
---
Thanks, I saw arcane/fire pvp builds and I was kinda tempted but not enough gold to spend, how do they perform ?
---
Keep playing.
---
My apologies, Commissar.
---
It was Flavor-Aid.
---
&gt; No one should even need healing because no one is getting hit.
---
True
---
&gt; and a frost nova
---
Does a 3rd/4th frost nova really make a difference? Genuinely curious as I don't have experience.
---
I report the dumb names so unclever people will be forced to actually come up with something. It is fast and easy, particularly when they're spamming /lfg with drivel.
---
Just give them one heal per pull, they can eat while you drink and you all can progress more efficiently and safely
---
Thanks, i will probably do that when my alt is high level enough :)
---
An hour! Not every run. If you do arena -&gt; angerforge -&gt; argelmach -&gt; tavern in 10minutes, because HoJ is among the later preBiS items one should acquire as weapons have a greater effect on ones performance, the runs really can become lightning fast and very efficient.
---
I don't think warlocks can mitigate crushing blows so anything bigger than a 5 man is probably a no go.
---
Your journey is complete hero.....
---
HAHA JK IT'S ONLY BEGUN
---
If you have an alt that sounds like a fantastic way to take out people competing with your main for ranks.
---
15 years in the making.
---
I would have wanted to share that too.

Lmfaoooo guys suicides "Death...its like sleep...but eternal". That's some dark humor if I ever saw it.

Global collapse within 20 yrs absolutely. Not full on extinction, but our crops are the first things that are going to take serious hits, to the point that panic and hunger will be widespread. We rely on stability to sustain 7.5+ billion people, especially when it comes to our food supply. Billions are going to die within 20 yrs, I'd venture to guess 75%+ of the worlds population. 
---
Live in a city? Dead. Live within 500 miles of a city? Probably dead, at minimum in harsh competition with many others for scarce resources. Live in a region where the growing season doesn't allow you to provide for yourself? Probably dead. Live in a place with no access to clean water w/o the help of utilities? Dead. Live near a nuclear facility? You're in for a very bad time.
---
Great points. Thank you for your insight. With the gaming time I have I might stick it out shadow for now and just see how that goes but might end up going holy for a solid spot on a raid then I can build an alt
---
The junkboxes also contain Blinding Powder which saves you a little money from having to spend time farming Fadeleaf or buying it.
---
What about arcane/fire pvp build ?
---
It's a rare world drop but Undeath &gt; Water is 2g &gt; 14g and only going to go up once DM releases.
---
I am on this server as well running for President of the Horde go by name of Tonymeatball, I‚Äôd like to purchase an ad in this paper
---
Right. You also watch for overpower procs from sunder and always use them if you get them
---
Many people will try to sell them for hundreds of gold, and many will be unsuccesful. People aren‚Äôt gonna drop 200-300g on this right now, not when they still don‚Äôt have their epic mounts. Even as a cosmetic item, it‚Äôs pretty mediocre. 5 min duration vs 30 min cooldown, and it takes up a trinket slot. 
---
I saw some guy trying to sell it for 300g initially, and I kept track of him relisting it over and over until he finally dropped it to 75g, at which point I bought it. More recently I‚Äôve seen them as low as 40g.
---
If you wanna make bank on this, stick it in your bank and sell it a couple weeks or months from now.
---
Just stock up on savory deviate delights.
---
it does unless you HS is on CD. then it kills you
---
There is no way on Earth poisons are doing 33% of your DPS unless your weapons desperately need upgrading.
---
It doesn't bro. We wear cloth and therefore have very little armor. Meaning, we get dummied by dungeon elites.
---
Yes, it was the case back then.
---
Sure, why not. Might not be as optimal but if you're not able to find enough mages this seems fine to me.
---
&gt;until what point do you think I can heal in dungeons with feral skill &amp; medium healing gear (basically keeping the best items i receive on 2nd or by quests focussing on heal &gt;  int &gt;  mp5 &gt; Spirit)?
---
Until 50+ for sure and if you level HotW/NS (0/30/21)...you can both tank and heal into raid content.
---
in 31 brd runs, ive been less than 5 where a player didnt know about ignoring the lock
---
No, the people of China are allowing that by not overthrowing their government. The only person who can stop China is China. The USA can not do anything unless they want to go to war. Which would be suicide as nukes exist. Him playing wow and not playing wow will not change Hong Kong's situation.
---
I for one would never join a group with a ''Warlock tank''. Any class can tank dungeons, to some degree, but I doubt people will accept it. Figure even bear tanks are looked down upon by many, when in fact they're on par if not better than wars pre-raid.
---
Aragorn is def a pally, or at least has max first aid
---
Do your dots just wear off when they hit 1%?
---
I love these moments. In live a few years ago i was leveling a hunter w a friend and they told me of the pink moa so we went out and farm it and when I finally got it we paraded it around orgrimmar and proselytizing the Joy's of the chicken god. Everyone who joined in, my friend made a pink shirt for them to wear and it morphed into a guild, chicken god disciples.  Stupid shit is mad fun in this game.
---
I suggest not buying chinese products to them, if they actually want to make a diff to this cause..... lol
---
Even if reserving items wasn't a thing, you'd still spend an hour LFG as a solo DPS player. Don't use "reserved item" groups as a scapegoat for the reason you're struggling to LFG.
---
The pull ahead with tier 2 but we catch up with AQ40 gear so it‚Äôs not something we can‚Äôt overcome.  I really can‚Äôt wait to get into MC and Ony and start pimping out.
---
At this point I just feel like they're different games. It's not wrong to like one over the other, and it's not wrong to enjoy playing both. But there's a wide valley between what each game is.
---
But... why? what satisfaction can you derive from killing a player trying to grind exp, in a very vulnerable position?
---
A good wl will try to tap so his HP stays around 60-90% all the time but i've seen locks that legit dont tap until they have like 10% mana and then tap back to back 5 times until they are low hp and full mana.
---
already got my epic mount lol
---
Town defenses were upgraded at some point in Vanilla, so it might not be right for the time when big Hillsbrad battles actually happened, but possibly accurate for 1.12.
---
Still sucks though, misses the whole point of recreating pre-BG pvp.
---
I don't mean this in a bad way, but nothing you say or do on the internet is going to effect china at all.
---
Just to note, I dunno how it is for locks and priests, but for mages Robe of the Archmage is bis until phase 4. Not preraid bis. Bis.
---
Supporting one side of a hotly debated and split topic is very different from standing up against widespread abuse of human rights that most decent human beings oppose. That is why people are saying his punishment is unjust. Blizzard, and most of their fans, likely all agree with what he said he wasn't "pushing" anything onto them. Blizzard only did what they did because of daddy China's money.
---
I think the best possible course of action is to A) Join a guild that farms stuff like this B) Get some stealth farm runs going C) Have a few beers during said stealth runs D) Pray
---
The trinket is fantastic and totally worth the effort.
---
Slapping it in front of everyone's faces every day is a political statement, just one thing I hate about the community. Just so flamboyant about it and it gets annoying.
---
You would pp everything in the pull before using the opener.  Bonus points for waiting on the tank to get aggro, lol.
---
My classic experience yesterday: Questing in NW ashenvale in the furgbolg cavern, there I am getting kills for kill counts and small chests for troll charms. Suddenly a rogue runs up to me where I am fighting a mob who is defending a troll charm and instantly loots it. So I call him on it saying "wtf dude" to which he replies "missclick". Immidietly after he tags about 5-6 mobs, runs up to me again and vanishes, causing the group to focus me. I narrowly survive with help of my shield and healing potions, he continues ninjaing charms and I give up and proceed to the Escort quest point. When im done clearing the quest area the rogues walks up the cage and waits for the bear to appear. I'm ticked off by this point but I accept the tag challenge as I have a insta-accept addon. The guy wins the quest tag... This guy is the worst Rogue i've encountered this far and I decided to grief his escort and killed the bear twice by tagging mobs into it when he was well outside the cave. Not a typical reaction I get but this guy had it coming!
---
Definitely possible, go for it!
---
Rogue pre bis is easy to get other than baron cape and swords. Just use Krol blade/mirahs song which is barely a downgrade.
---
In my few runs @ SM I had mages &amp; locks always aoe pulling. End result was an OOM healer, DPS dying, healer then dying, and then me dying. Group blames me for not holding, and ragequits. Still have only beaten lib, and just barely and with wipes.
---
Different experiences I guess
---
It's a considerable downgrade from just bringing another mage.
---
What's the benefit of farming Princess?
---
1% chance to resist against green mobs, so obviously it will resist multiple times per dungeon run as is tradition.
---
Imagine caring about this lmao.
---
Leave now
---
I imagine they should turn on ML but fuck if I know if they actually do. Have heard of a few reported cases of people rolling on reserved gear they agreed to before the dungeon, and Blizzard taking the gear from their bags and giving it to the appropriate player who reserved said gear. This only happens though when it‚Äôs explicitly stated and Blizz has a record of the agreement like party chat or group chat whatever.
---
come to DD so i can kill you
---
I've "tanked" SM GY and Lib as affliction while level appropriate. It's slow and painful for the whole party, but it can be done. I also two manned GY at lvl 33 with a priest buddy (lvl 31). I say find some open minded and skilled players to try this with. Probably won't work at 40+ tbh.
---
Doesn't matter if Blizzard says it wasn't politically motivated. It's 100% political at this point. I still don't see how this is related to WoW Classic, there's never been any other posts on this subreddit that are about Blizzard as a company besides the recent event.
---
Are we presented with a situation in which OP is not receiving his item for winning a bid? No. Not at all. 
---
OP‚Äôs point is that he is entitled an opportunity to WIN and thus entitled TO the item. This is likely his response to having a great deal that got cancelled within the last hour or so because the seller didn‚Äôt want it to sell for such a low bid. If that‚Äôs not entitlement then I don‚Äôt know what is
---
I was doing quests in Feralas. Literally 3 Quests with Rested Bar got me from 45-46 because the drop rate was so shitty I essentially just grinded out my level with Rested XP giving me 600 a pop.
---
3 minutes
---
I'm pretty sure that is exactly what he wants and people quitting because they're getting farmed is "toxic".
---
haha bis for pvp good one
---
IF and SW are both poppin on DD
---
The more you slow down the lower levels the less the other side's war effort grows.
---
&gt; Mobs will literally kill your totems when they are in frostnova
---
That's not an issue if you're careful with placement, it has the same range as arcane explosion.
---
Arcane Explosion:
---
265 dmg * 10 mobs * 12 = 31800 damage... there's the answer as to why no shamans lol
---
My anecdotal experience threw it off because mages cant just spam ArcExpl in regular comps.

If anyone wants to see a player driven cult or cult of personality in action, just go into the US RP-PvP server Grobbulus.

Congrats! I did the same but in Orgrimmar üëå
---
Don't the WSG turnins give more rep at the Ashenvale portal than at your battlemasters too? He'd need totake a spin round there too.
---
Yeah, basically your best idea is to have all 3 trinkets...SHotM is always slot 1, Tyranny is default slot 2 and then Chosen is swapped in if you're tanking 3+ mobs (bc you're pretty much guaranteed to have it up the majority of the time.
---
Sure there is. You have to teach them that it's not acceptable to roll alliance scum. Fucking colonizers.
---
I bet some of the lower level dungeons like WC or SFK could be completed with a voidwalker tank.
---
Just need a healer and 4 dps who understand how threat works.
---
I'm a healer myself and have considered letting a voidwalker tank, but I haven't run into a demo lock yet. Every lock I've asked so far is either in destro or affliction.
---
We're finding Classic raids to be pretty easy beyond a minimum threshold so we've stopped caring as much about maximizing DPS. As long as our group composition is good enough to finish, then mission accomplished. No sense spending an extra hour looking for "l33t" players when we can start an hour early with PUGs and finish at the same time.
---
Druids in 55-59 dungeons take less/equal damage than warriors in most cases.
---
DPS that steals healers mana slows dungeons down. Having the entire group on the same resource level keeps a good pase. Spending the healers mana as your resource will slow down the pase of the group to the lowest resource member.
---
This group had 2 warlocks. That sounds like a Nightmare
---
That‚Äôs big brain moves
---
&gt;I know that there is an addon that keeps switching between the Find herbs and Find nodes functions on the minimap
---
Uh.. what. This is on the GCD.

Why did you think anybody cares that you dont think anyone cares?

The pinnacle of cowardice. I always laugh my ass out when I see pallys shit their pants and bubble hearth.

Are you by any chance american? I mean paying for wow also pays for various freedom wars around the world (taxes). Iraq and other stuff

Max zoom settings within the add on Leatrix and then camera view straight above
---
You can peobably tank deadmines with it... at 60.
---
That's literally what I'm talking about.  This is also why we didn't treat them like garbo when it came to raid time in vanilla. We had more than 2 and we were willing to pay for some of them to respec if desired for teh night.

Spell power/shadow damage &gt; intellect&gt; stamina &gt;spirit

ah yes, blue rage.

Hey! The King's back! Was my favourite film

3 is ideal 4 is safe.
---
I play an Ele Shaman.... Our chain lighting hits hard AF same thing with FN, costs a lot of mana not to mention has CD's of 5 seconds. where a mage/ Lock is a Constant AOE machine we are only every few seconds of damage then off heal. If we are in some sort of Cleave dungeon we are melee cleave for our WF only TBH.  but i avoid cleave groups because they are toxic TBH lol 
---
We are more of a bursty class than anything else. For example i ran BRD and i was blowing mages/lock and a DPS war out of the water on DPS on boss fights. But ran Room very very Quickly. my bolts hit for 500 at lvl 55 and my crits (with ele mastery every 3 min) are hitting almost 2k  but near the end they catch up because im oom and forced to bonk people with my 1h mace only doing 113 per bonk.
---
Shamans are a utility class.. used for the Totems, Off healing, and bursts.

---
YTA, this could be more tactfully and successfully resolved with adult communication. Being petty and passive aggressive just pits your team against you.
---
15 + the loss of rage compared to a normal auto attack. HS doesn't generate rage. 
---
Like I said, generating max threat isn't everything but heroic strike is objectively not the way to generate max threat unless you're rage capped.
---
&gt; Engineering will give you an edge.
---
&gt; ::Lips on mic:: Wrong
---
Can you make up your mind?
---
&gt;  I'll rather wait another 20 minute
---
You'll be lucky if it's only 20 minutes with that attitude.
---
If you wanted to call the shots you picked the wrong role. I tank plenty, and when I dps I let the tank do it their way. Their job is much harder then selecting the proper target and dotting it up.
---
Also Redridge would probably be the first contested zone you go to
---
Jus wait til the Foreman hears about this
---
You can have another more geared hunter do the fights for you btw
---
Ah, didn't notice. Thanks!     /s
---
&gt; TL;DR: For engineering to be the end all, be all profession, you need everyone on your side to be following instructions from a highly skilled general. If
---
No, in order for engineering to be the end all profession it needs to provide something the other professions don't, and it does.
---
If there is a mage in the group with the lock,  the locks should tap to half health and half mana then eat and drink at the same time
---
Ok, downloaded TSM. So what do I actually do? Like, how do I use it to make getting all this stuff on the AH more convenient.
---
Was he using FAP?
---
Yes it is completely impossible that people from both sides are aggressive.  It is only Alli who attacks.  No horde would ever do such a thing.
---
10-4. TIL
---
Don't cut yourself with that edge
---
STFU damn

Learn to read? I clearly said it might not work in raids.

Again, that‚Äôs not a political statement. There‚Äôs no politicians or political agendas involved. If I say ‚ÄúI prefer McDonalds over Burger King‚Äù that‚Äôs not a political statement.
---
Hey if we're shamelessly plugging our ability to make FAPs for money, lemme jump on that bandwagon.
---
Exactly. People want a big PVP battle because that's what normally happened if you were trying to invade Southshore or other enemy towns. Instead they're flooded by guards and nobody on the other faction bothers to come because there's no point.
---
What do you think *competitive* means?
---
Nah man, it's definitely the one with the giant two handed axe that is casting shadowbolt back there.
---
Tsm
---
Who cares, you won't die, just let them tank. Being a tank in cleave groups taught me one thing, the tank is just here to initially group the mobs somewhere nice anyway.
---
 Fun time unlocked
---
For all of you saying this weapon is not for hunters.... What do you use in its place? /u/FacetiousInvective says something form BWL, which isn't out yet, so that's obviously not an option. 
---
Looking at wowhead, Striker's is the highest DPS bow available until Rhok. It beats the next bow in the list by 12dps and beats the highest DPS bow other than Rhok by 8 dps.  Sadly, that 'other' bow is a zone drop, so farming it is unrealistic. If it were a boss drop you could reliably expect to find it eventually, but zone drops are much harder.
---
I personally (being a true huntard) would want this bow if I saw it. Convince me otherwise =)
---
Re-veiled and revealed have opposite meanings. -.-
---
That's just talking about using a faster attack speed bow when low on Mana to interact with aspect of the viper (ithink? Been awhile.) for mana regen.
---
Black and Blue dragon skins sell decently IIRC. Especially the black.
---
Its not a high dps increase at all. Its questionable whether its even better than your prebis.
---
Leaf and sinew are basically guaranteed. 2 items with 50 % drop rate. Hunters get a guaranteed weapon from MC, and tier gear just for them. Melee have a few weapons, a ring, bracers, and that bow from MC. That's it. BiS Melee gear should not be taken as a temporary upgrade for hunters. Absolutely ridiculous. Striker's Mark will last melee until AQ or Naxx.   
---
This is your hunter loot whore mindset kicking in. Don't take a Striker's Mark.
---
would you rather spend your mana on 1 druid or 1 warr and the rest of the party 
---
druids threat is insane in comparison to most warriors
---
Banning people isnt being politically neutral. If they wanted to be politically neutral they wouldn't make a statement but would silence their players
---
IIRC, turn-ins also give XP.  It's been awhile and I'm not entirely certain, but you can always explore in case I'm wrong.
---
You should stop watching tv, movies and purchasing anything from a shop that's not local because ALL of those companies are doing the exact same thing but worse than Blizzard. I look forward to your future post saying that you only eat locally sourced food and only wear locally sourced clothes. Also throw away ALL of your electronics.
---
Sounds like Rend
---
Low armor but still a lot of hp and mitigation with soul link. Get gud
---
You only want 1-2 prot warriors for phase 1 for a raid of up to 40.  If your friend wants to tank in raids, my advise would be to join a guild as a dps Warrior who is willing to throw on a shield to tank fights like domo and sulferon. Or form your own raid group and he can MT
---
It seems like there's so many who don't see the bigger picture here.
---
Standing up against big corporations kowtow to the Chinese government who disregard fundamental human rights is never a bad thing. And yet so many look down upon people trying to show support. Because this is support. Blizzard only speak the language "money". So speaking with your wallet is the only way to show that you don't agree with Blizzard's extreme decision to do anything to stay friends with a country like China.
---
I have no idea how people don't understand this.
---
Ohhh not again
---
So I'm looking to casual raid but mostly wpvp and big. So just to clarify, your recommended spec covers both???
---
To be fair, just because it wasnt causing wipes doesnt necessarily mean it wasnt hell for the healer.  
---
Also, i forget how *exactly* buffs overriding works (not sure if codex rank 1 will override normal fort at max rank), but they may have actually been losing the party some stam.  More likely its a bug with how other priests' fort shows up on your UI, though.  I definitely got annoyed with that before i knew about it.  Hell, im still annoyed with it, but at least its not aimed at the other players now.

Probably nowhere else tho. The max lvl hunters arent ganking in Stv cuz "HONOR DEMANDS THE ADVERSARY DIE" on most servers its done cuz you either enjoy besting someone in a fair 1v1 or you want to see someone with a red name die
---
Locking threads is lazy moderating. Also there is no reason political comments shouldn't be allowed.
---
Everyone needing instead of everyone greeding just removes the temptation for those people who would wait till last and roll need against 4 greeds.
---
That was very cool of him to do.
---
I'm not impressed by people who don't utilize their class to the fullest. Where's rain of fire? Where's banish elemental? Where's enslave demon? Do you open up your spellbook and click when you need to do an eye pull? And where's your pet bar commands? Do you take the lazy route and let the AI fully control your pet? That's going to bite you in the ass if you ever do a dungeon.
---
I was showed how to so it with a group of randoms, but that was after we did a normal run and it was clear we were all competent
---
I looked it up after picking it. At the time it had two sources. It was the name of a planet in a series of science fiction stories from the 1950s/1960s ...
---
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List\_of\_Foundation\_universe\_planets#Mnemon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Foundation_universe_planets#Mnemon) 
---
It was also what the Greeks called Artaxerxes II of Persia, meaning 'pertaining to truth.' 
---
Now apparently the name is also from a role playing game called Exalted. Pretty sure I've used it from before then, however.
---
I started solo'ing Deadmines at level 30 as Prot.  
---
I am currently solo'ing Razorfen Downs at 40.

DM has yielded 4-6 gold after selling greys, and another 10g for BoE greens/blues. 
---
RFD has yielded 4-8 gold after selling greys, and another 10-20g for BoE greens/blues.
---
The yield rate is **after** subtracting the repair bill with the amount of water I use(d).  DM takes about 20 minutes, RFD takes 30-40.  Runs can vary based on how many times you need to drink and what route you want to take (boss run vs. full clear).
---
I know there are better farming methods, but I can clear at my own pace and can't be ganked.
---
Yep! Most anything worth watching will be available. It just isn't going to be streamed the moment it happens.

I need for my twink

According to wowhead(which I just thought to check) trolls turn into dwarves(ie. Alliance master race). Makes more sense
---
TSM... Man it will be much easier for you to watch the tutorials versus us explain it. I've not used it in classic, but in retail, TSM is a very powerful tool full of a ton of options. Don't try to absorb all of it, learn one part at the time.
---
Lock it bigg tits

Ha ha .  Fuck Blizzard.
---
Don‚Äôt say the B word. It‚Äôs the word that must not be spoken. It‚Äôs like a tough breakup. You just have to forget they even existed

So you want to be ninjaed?
---
The key here is players that understand  threat. In a group of 4 other guildies that I know are good players I might consider it. Add one bvb dumbfuck and your dungeon run instantly becomes miserable and fails.

before it was mathematically impossible it wasn‚Äôt even out yet :)
---
Lock it and take my prize money?
---
Laughs inside a bubble.
---
It needs a few sub addon and then you have to write or find a string on the internet that will scan the ah and list the items on global ah price or something, I didnt used it for about a year so I cant help much, but you can find good guides on youtube for it.
---
According to questie: at level 43, on my mage, Tanaris seems to have a shit load of quests.
---
Something something üá®üá≥
---
It's emote text, inserts the Target's name, and gets a random coin amount. I'm not sure what the GetCoinText function outputs but I assume it probably takes a number then formats it as #g#s#c, or however it represents the currency values.
---
There's two groups of professions, those that make you money now, and those that are gold/resource sinks that might make you money later. If this is your first time playing, I recommend the former to help you get mount money by 40.
---
Skinning, mining, and herbalism all require no other resource than clicking things in the world to skill up, and you can either auction what you find to other players (less common) or vendor materials for quick gold (more common).
---
Alchemy is fairly neutral if you pair it with herbalism, you can make your own health potions to survive crappy engagements - this will happen commonly as a warrior leveling. You can also make flasks to buff yourself, or fun things like swiftness potions to make you run faster for a short time.
---
Leatherworking and tailoring are gold sinks that don't really provide you, a warrior, with much. Enchanting is a massive gold sink to level and actively makes you poorer by turning gold from vendoring greens/blues into less valuable enchanting materials.
---
Now - blacksmithing and engineering, when paired with mining, can make you some useful things. Blacksmithing will let you make the occasional weapon or armor, and engineering makes tons of fun stuff like stun grenades. It's not cheap to level these, and having mining only offsets some of the cost.
---
TL;DR: Grab mining/another gathering profession, drop it for something else later.
---
Yes it is available with DM North.
---
I don't need to learn all of it, I just want to know how to most easily shortcut putting items up for sale.
---
Ah gotcha. But why is whirlwind so heavily recommended? Are you meant to be fighting multiple enemies?
---
It's even better when you realise the etymology of the word 'twink'- it's from the gay community and describes a hot young attractive man.
---
It's a Gay-bomb, baby!
---
It is definitely a bug. I was in MC and people we asking why I was using rank 1 prayer of fort when I definitely was using rank 2.
---
unmoderated subreddits are a main reason why subreddits fall apart after they get big, it's a fact
---
No body cares about an insincere post on the internet man. Nobody.
---
Install auctioneer. It'll tell you whether the disenchanted mats are worth more than the vendor/auction price for an item.
---
Then why did you call it a normal lava run? He clearly isn't showing the lava run.
---
Slam resets your swing timer on every private server. You could not weave an auto in while you channel slam, that is a thing from TBC or onward.  You are misremembering how slam worked on private server.
---
Rip my m9-1
---
I doubt you have ever played a MOBA
---
Source? Or do you mean the main event of axing Blizzchung and the casters?
---
Looking for a class that's not super time investment and isn't super high on actions per minute.
---
I tell my healers to ignore me. I can bandage if I really need a heal, but I have all the tools I need to keep myself alive. I can drain life to heal myself back up and I'm perfectly capable of sitting to eat/drink between pulls same as you. So if I pull aggro, let me die. Otherwise, let me worry about my own health and mana. I'll be fine.
---
Auctionator is simpler and still very good. I have both installed but I use Auctionator almost exclusively because it's so damn user friendly
---
When I hit 40 and got my mount, I did first some of the green zones I hadn't gotten to in my 30s like Duskwallow / STV / Desolace / Swamp of Sorrows (even though this one has more quests later too).  By the end of those zones I was about 43/44.  I did Badlands / Feralas / Tanaris / Hinterlands and Uldaman / Mara / ZF (twice) that got me to 50.  I just finished burning steppes and im about to start Felwood now at 52.
---
I get that and agree. But you can‚Äôt tell me with a straight face this site isn‚Äôt full of control freak mods who love to stifle any conversation.
---
Not for damage, You wait for Procs for ENH and your most damaging shock is basically a taunt because it pulls so much threat... Enh are viable i guess. but in later lvls you want a Ele shaman much more damage much faster.
---
It's from Classic.
---
Yup, if you have 3-4 mages that know what they're doing they should take little to no damage with that many novas
---
Fair enough, but you missed it, he did get upset and the little attempt at a  jab there in his first comment is clear evidence. Also, you can repeat that ‚Äúuses information game already gives you‚Äù argument until the cows come home and it won‚Äôt sway me one bit. As someone who has worked in software development , I understand how it works. I have even written in lua, what is used for WoW Addons if I remember correctly.
---
This is premium Alliance content.
---
*yawns*
---
Lock it like a competitor was locked out of their prize money?
---
Hah. I use them but very rarely so they‚Äôre on one of the extra bars you can put on. Same with food. To date I‚Äôve never used Banish &amp; Enslave. No need to use them. I‚Äôm unsure what an eye pull is? My pet bar is where it usually is, I believe it is Ctrl + # to use the abilities. AI only ever takes over if I don‚Äôt need to micro them.
---
Some people will tell you to double up on gathering professions to make money. Others will tell you go mining/blacksmithing so you can make yourself gear as you level.  Then some more people might tell you to go mining/engineering as it has the best pvp stuff.
---
I would say you should go mining/blacksmithing if you want a traditional "I'm new to the game so I'm not going to min/max" experience.  With that being said if you aren't used to managing your money in the game and working with the auction house it can be somewhat difficult to keep you profession in line with your current level.
---
The bonus you get from leveling with professions is marginal and a lot of people redo their professions at 60 anyway.  So i guess what I'm saying is do what you want and don't rack your brain over it.
---
Don't roll horde next time.
---
The mid 40ish range is rough for Alliance. If you've done all those zones, you might need to grind or dungeon a bit. Mara has some good quests, and ZF as well if you haven't done so. You can try searing gorge but you might be a bit low
---
I‚Äôm refuting your claim that the majority of reddit wants classic. There is no evidence to support that which is exactly why I said that the classicwow subreddit and the classic forums on battlenet are not accurate representations of the WoW community as a whole. I‚Äôm not making ridiculous claims, both forums are biased as the community on those forums represent the vanilla niche and will always have bias towards the base game. The burden of proof doesn‚Äôt fall on me.
---
Honestly I don‚Äôt care for the vanilla stereotypes of hybrids being ‚Äúuseless‚Äù in dps. 
---
If you want the BEST dps for range or melee, you‚Äôll have to play a pure class, its just how the game was originally designed since hybrids were given 10-15% less damage off the top because they could do multiple things. ‚ÄúIf they can dps better than pure classes, then everyone would play the class that can do everything‚Äù - that was their logic for hybrids originally. 
---
I don‚Äôt agree with you about world pvp for shamans/warriors because you can complement their weaknesses with professions - specifically warrior + Alch/Eng would be crazy good at end game in the right hands. Yes youll have issues with materials but thats an option that does exist.
---
This. Mounts are terrible in Arathi Basin. Makes it too easy to recover from mistakes and homogenizes strategy by eliminating the utility of classes with speed boosts.
---
But you won‚Äôt be doing anything else, like getting rid of your iPhone and boycotting your ISP?
---
Get a grip man. Nobody on this reddit cares about your virtue signaling.
---
Check out badlands and searing gorge. I never had to grind but I also did a good amount of dungeons and their respective quests while leveling. Have you done all the ZF quests? They lead into sunken temple and lbrs quests later on that give good xp and rewards.
---
Hi, 29 Warlock here. I did most of the limited quests in Ashenvale and most of Stonetalon. Never touched Hillsbrad. I‚Äôve got one quest left in the Barrens to blow up the planes at the dwarf castle, two quests directing me to the great lift, and a couple 1k needles quests. At 29 should I just head to 1k or am I still too low? Do I need to go to Hillsbrad for a level or two? Also other than 1k needles where else would you suggest?
---
About to be 15 on my warrior and I went cruelty first. Not sure where my next 5 talent points should go, either: Booming Voice or Unbridled Wrath.
---
I'm on a PvP server leveling by myself. I plan to quest with 2h weapons (cause they badass) and tank using shield or possibly 2h weapon as well.
---
Advice please? I heard booming is good because it brings people out of stealth, but I'm not sure of its value compared to Unbridled Wrath.
---
Does talent reset cost decay to 5g or 10g?
---
It kinda pisses me off when a BiS BoE drops and everyone fights over it bc it's worth 40g but it's literally your item. "Everyone can use AH" yeah well everyone can use the vendor too what's your point
---
Coward
---
heres the thing, yes they shouldnt of changed it for the sake of keeping things as they were...but also who cares?
---
if the only way you can get pvp is to take a full raid into a low lvl zone and kill the quest npc's and flight master then nothing you say matters. thats not 'real' pvp, thats ganking low lvls. sure its legal and blizzard denotes it as a valid option.
---
but at the end of the day, the people who do that generally speaking are bad players. and your opinions on matters of pvp just dont matter at that point.
---
people rolled on pvp servers so they could fight members of the enemy faction, but most people realize ganking low levels is a meaningless act. and when the actual honor system comes out, people will find out what a dishonorable kill means for there ranking.
---
They don't want to be reminded of what they're supporting. They'd rather censor the topic and live in la-la land.
---
Were alliance :)
---
This is exactly what I'm talking about though; World First guilds are a very, very small portion of the player base. Yes, they go Alliance for their racials, but they're not a good data point when considering the Horde/Alliance ratio on a given server.
---
When it comes to Horde's undoubtedly superior PvP racials, I still have a hard time believing that many people care. Choosing your character is a lot more complicated; what class do I want to play, where are my friends at, and how easy will it be to get to 60 anyway? 
---
I think if we look at the (old) census data from August and September it lends to the theory that faction balance is a lot more psychological. Most servers started with a healthy balance and declined over time, which doesn't make sense if the primary motivator is racial abilities.
---
Imagine taking pride in something you have no control over.
---
but considering how strong it is it's probably the most efficient use of your time in terms of long term gearing of your character outside of raiding.
---
I see what you mean. I used to want to have a twink back in the day. Made a "half twink" once. But now I don't really see the fun in killing people without a chance.
---
With that said I don't blame them for doing it. It's WoW PVP. Until later expansions gear mattered a lot. So in a way it is just playing the game. Getting better gear and seeing your character get more powerful has always been a big part of the game for most people. It is not much different in PVP.
---
Why just blizzard ? Other companies have done the same in the support of China and silencing products/brands/media. Just seems like a classic case of ‚ÄúI only do what suits me best‚Äù
---
Any good resources for ‚Äúmust hit quests at x level.‚Äù I rarely can swing a dungeon Due to time restraints, so items like zhovar axe for my war or harlequin robe for my caster are really helpful.
---
it works just about as good as a shaman tank, you can get the aggro but you do so bad at mitigating damage most people will not want to play with you as a tank.
---
Also remember their names cause enclosed server community means something again. Rep means something.
---
I use ctrl mousewheel :)
---
F\*\*K WOW, F\*\*K Blizzard, China is Asshole
---
You clearly have no idea how Onyxia works
---
So what many people dont realize is vanish isnt a magic button that removes threat from the boss. It simply resets your own personal threat but that %% of threat that you just had needs to be transferred to someone else. Meaning what happened here very possibly could have been that when you vanished and immediately attacked, you caused a threat reset and then a major threat spike. Bosses in classic are more susceptible to spikes of threat. Moral of the story, careful using vanish on CD to get off another ambush. Use a feint before hand and make sure the tank has a large threat lead.
---
I'm the opposite. Grinded my single character to 60 and already in some raid gear and still haven't decided on my alt class yet. I'm thinking hunter.
---
Makes sense. Locks don't have many vooldowns, and by pressing the modifier button it says how long there us till it is usable again.
---
Couldn't agree more. But then again I haven't really had any high spirit gear since I crafted the shadoweave set so maybe that's why it seems so negligible.
---
Where do I sign up?
---
How does auctioneer get its prices? (yes from scanning the AH...). I've been using it for about a week now and so far every price has been wrong and i had to look up the item manually to see its current price.
---
How do you not realize that chine enforces that censorship? Did you think that someone at blizzard thought: "Let's show the world that we silence the protesters and side with the dictator!"
---
The best action they could take, which they definitely tried, is silence. Prented like nothing happend and don't get involved in politics
---
China is very active with their censorship. They saw what happened and asked blizzard to punish the player, to which blizzard complied 110%.
---
Hence why both china and blizzard is at fault here.
---
Do it with something weird, like:
---
/e stands close behind you and breathes heavily down your neck.
---
Lock it like the Uyghurs are locked in cells for no reason?
---
As a lock all I really expect in groups is a HoT. After a boss fight I barely have to drink with just one renew. I'm not sure what these locks are doing to make the healers constantly complain about them, but if it's that bad don't heal them. They did dmg to themselves.
---
&gt; It is cliche and lame but in classic anything is really viable in classic. 
---
Except oomkin. ;)
---
But yeah...so much misinformation about druids out there, it's crazy.  DPS, tank, heal...all viable options for druids.
---
There's an addon that will estimate your probable disenchanting components from a given item, you'd have to compare that info with market/Auctioneer data or whatever mats you may be looking for to see if it's worth it.
---
You should roll a rogue named rouge.  Guaranteed invite on the first try
---
Noted, this was done on Stalagg at about 1030pm est. Most likely during raid times
---
They go grey at 75. The initial rogue lockpicking quest sends you to a spot with five renewing pickable boxes that give skillups to at least 75. There just isn‚Äôt much reason for a rogue to buy these rather than sitting at Aether‚Äôs Mill for 15 min.
---
It does more damage.
---
Just ask one of the 100 other horde in the immediate area.  The reason alliance groups up is because the horde have an overwhelming majority but are very unorganized,  it‚Äôs the only way we can survive.  It‚Äôs kinda like that movie 300.
---
I use 1-4 with ctrl/shift/alt (removing appropriate keybinds)
---
I have q/e bound to hotbar 1/2.
---
So do shamans have more than 4\*4\*2=32 spells+consumables?
---
can't speak to auctioneer - I think it displays current and average over time - but auctionator literally looks at the current AH prices - basically pages through all the AH pages in quick succession and commits the prices to its database.  You can set how long it remembers history for (I think the default is 5 days, but I've upped mine to 20).  It will only update its database as a result of a scan, so just because you search for something using the regular blizzard AH interface doesn't mean that the auctionator price would update -- you actually have to tell it to scan.
---
If a DPS pulling now and then speeds up the run without endangering the party then its fine, like pulling single mobs or a couple non elites. They save time for the tank to have to go and get them and if they know how to kite and avoid damage they dont overburden the healer.
---
One that looks like an exploit, two, you could have just opened the fucking gate for angerforge.
---
Why would they be expected to know that stuff if they stated they dont actually play and are just enjoying the sub? You may have done your homework but your attitude is gonna get you downvotes. 
---
If you really wanna compare it to school this guy asked what unit youre studying and you belittled him for not doing the homework despite not even being in the class.
---
But you got to choose your new name, right?
---
Been trying to talk about this on this sub for literally months, whenever I comment about it I get downvoted for being a ‚Äúprivate server fanboy‚Äù and ‚Äúthe lag is how laggy it was in actual Vanilla so you gotta just deal with it‚Äù responses.
---
Most of the users here never played in such succinct detail that other players have from back in the day so they won‚Äôt notice small changes, like Hunter‚Äôs Mark being removed from Vanish and rogues can be taken out of vanish if their enemies melee swing registers before they cast vanish due to the changes they made with spell batching.
---
This is just the Classic we‚Äôre gonna get boys.
---
You were donwvoted because they can't handle the truth
---
Don't forget the gear rework. Spell power was super scarce and stat allotment was chaotic.
---
Have you considered reliving the legend?
---
&gt;FN totem more times than not once placed gets destroy because it takes 4 seconds to go off
---
I think if you we're planning to spell cleave you'd get the talent that drops the delay to 2s and place just in range during frost nova to avoid it getting destroyed.
---
when you aimed shot your auto fires as soon as the aimed shot is done. You don't play a hunter.
---
FUCK BLIZZARD
---
As is tradition.
---
We have a megathread for the controversy constantly getting messages like FREE HONG KONG on every thread is not something we want nor does it promote actual discussion. Trust me if we didn't do anything this sub would have been overrun and you all would have complained.
---
yea a lot of people really don't understand how bad most peoples computers were back then
---
My first Rag kill was done at like 800*600 on low settings. My GFX card died on my main comp during domo
---
 the entire fight was just an orange blur as a melee using a shitty celeron and integrated graphics
---
Sounds like ya got a virus.  
---
Does it happen if you restart your computer? Also, does it happen if battle.net is closed?
---
Yeah, and when an epic twink BoE worth 1k drops what's your philosophy on that? You should still get it?
---
I think those guides were more geared towards retail leveling where you had heirloom gear. Ret pally damage is heavily dependent on gear.
---
I just don't really consider a 1 in 4 chance OP. It's failing 75% of the time. 
---
If he resisted 4 times in a row, that just means he is lucky as an individual, not that the racial is an issue. He should probably buy a lottery ticket.
---
For a first time player, I would resist the temptation to take blacksmithing.  Blacksmithing in my opinion is the worst profession in the game.  The gear you will be able to craft - by the time you can gather your own materials and craft it, is inferior to stuff you'll get just by questing - or buying it for a few silver off AH.  
---
Engineering is good, you need mining with it.  However, engineering can be difficult to use effectively if you're not familiar with the games mechanics, or if the game is new to you.  I don't recommend engineering for your first character.  
---
Alchemy/herbalism is great for making your own consumables, and can be very profitable late game when you sell your herbs and potions on AH.  Elixir of the mongoose sells every time, 8-10g a stack.
---
It self righted it seems
---
God, has it really been 2 years already? I remember back when he was still uploading like it was maybe a few months ago. 
---
Well before his time, but what he did with the time he had, however limited, was something that I imagine he was quite proud of.
---
I know I would be.
---
Use the auctioneer add-on. Scan the auction house and then it will tell you if you if it is more profitable to sell the item or de and sell the mats. Generally I de a lot of the armor I get since I needed the dust for skill-ups. Weapons tend to vendor for decent money so I usually wouldn‚Äôt de them.
---
How is Golem one trash pack away?
---
can you explain why?
---
Mages shouldn't be using blizzard for a full rotation after 52. It should look like this:
---
Blizzard &gt; Frost nova &gt; COC &gt; AEx5
---
Arcane explosion does a lot more damage per second than blizzard even though you lose out on a 70% slow if the targets are under 50% hp finishing them off faster is easier than trying to burn them and keep them all in the same location.
---
The average private server had 10k pop, these Blizzard servers are much much lower than that.
---
Do it, Commissar.  Show us where your loyalty lies.
---
Probably from begging.
---
If you've got that much gold, why are you begging?
---
Hmm looks like you thought you did, but you didn't.
---
Well yeah, just play it or don‚Äôt.
---
I don‚Äôt want some ‚Äúmoral highground‚Äù martyr just saying OH I QUIT BECAUSE MY VALUES. I am tired of these people acting like they are saving the world however won‚Äôt actually donate to the HK cause.
---
They will sit back and ‚Äúcancel their sub‚Äù for 2-3 months and then hop back on saying ‚Äúeh‚Äù. If anyone of my friends who ‚Äúquit‚Äù you can be damn sure I will hold it to their moral ‚Äùhighground‚Äù. 
---
The dude wore a gasmask and made an incredibly political statement at their event he was invited to. Why wouldn‚Äôt you ban him?
---
Will i take the spec quest again or do i need the book in tanaris ? Is that book require 150g or not ?
---
The UK doesn't have freedom of speech, are they slaughtering minorities??  
---
That is gap logic.  Blizzard punished him because he broke the rules.  Again, HE BROKE THE RULES.  
---
I'm sure consequences are very hard for you to understand, but this is an example of that.  Did he think. Nothing would happen to him?  Did he expect to just break the rules and be fine?  If he did, hes dumb.
---
Haha, maybe the universe is sending me a sign.
---
You don‚Äôt make sense.
---
Weapons would be nice, but they're rare. Alright Dagger(Gahz'rilla Fang), decent mace(The Hand of Antu'sul), Masons Fraternity Ring from a quest, and Sandstalker Ankleguards from the rare.
---
\#JustLikeClassicLaterPatches  
---
If you think it is a bug put it in the official forums.  I recall having 1 guard spawn per raid member when we did AQ and nax gear city raids.  Which was not like when we were under 60 and did city raids or when WPVP was out in patch 1.4.  My memory says it is like later phases of vanilla, but I do not own the original 1.12 data and client.  You need Blizzard Devs to test it on their internal build and either say they are working on it or, more likely, add it to their list of "Not A Bug."
---
Nah, if a tank has all the gear he needs then unless he is with guildies he should be allowed to roll on DPS gear. You want him to tank UBRS for fun?
---
I think that something like that would be really cool to be a part of from either side.
---
That's.... strange. Run a virus scan and also open and look through Task Scheduler on your computer to see if you can find it in there. If you can then it should be easy to disable.
---
theres barely any horde questing STV since horde is way more advanced in levels on my server. grouping up to pvp is also just a timewaste and grouping up while grinding is a waste aswell.
---
I believe it decays by 5g increments each month.
---
on my server the horde would kill u in 2 seconds.
---
Dude. Let people enjoy things
---
Super cool - congrats!
---
I love it! Although mine has seen better days the entire sleeve has fallen off
---
What I do is put the abilities that have cooldowns on the right. They are there only to tell me if they are up or not.
---
Free Hong Kong üá≠üá∞
---
Still gonna play classic. Not gonna deny myself one of the few games that I still enjoy these days to get some feel good internet points. I fully support hong Kong and everything they are fighting for. But, the people saying "supporting blizzard is the same as supporting the chinese government" are insane. Especially all of the people probably typing that at others from their iPhone while wearing Nike's. 
---
What they did was shitty, but from a business standpoint? It was, on paper, the right call to cut the stream and take some form of action. They took it wayyyyy to far though and for that there is no excuse. But if everyone is honest with the situation, blizz has been very clear that they dont want their platform being used to promote anything that could be even remotely controversial or disparaging. See the overwatch league as an example. 
---
Like I said I dont agree with the punishment and the firing of the casters. But im not gonna stop playing classic (or really overwatch either), because I'm not on the bandwagon of thinking my 15 dollars a month to blizz is literally oppressing hong Kong.
---
My general rule of thumb is to vendor it if it sells for more than 1g.  If the item vendors for less than 1g, it gets disenchanted.
---
Not sure which of these would be considered Pre-BiS, but this may be a concise source of info that will help you answer that question for yourself:  [https://www.wowhead.com/news=295568/dire-maul-classic-wow-dungeon-loot-tables](https://www.wowhead.com/news=295568/dire-maul-classic-wow-dungeon-loot-tables)

Phase 2 - Level 60 character boost!
---
Have you read the title of the post?
---
Its picking and choosing. He is virtue signaling because he can post to the internet and people will give attention if he mentions Blizzard or the NBA. But he will still put on his clothes made in China, use his phone made in China, brush his teeth with this toothbrush made in China. 
---
Its empty support because the only thing he cares about is getting a pat on the back from other virtue signalers.
---
I thought DM east was the herb one?
---
[Battle.net](https://Battle.net) is closed. Haven't tried restarting, but it would be weird if that would solve it. 
---
Seems like a strange virus, but maybe blizzard is getting desperate :P
---
I think what you're missing is creeping up on AFK people and /dance ing
---
What is this? Stalin's russia?
---
I don't think so.  I think its actually the reverse that as you get more +Healing, the % based increase to the Flash of light is way more than the %based increase for Holy light. 
---
Down ranking does play a bit into it. but I believe at about 600 + heal that rank 3 FoL is your most efficient heal. However SoL does mess with the numbers a bit.
---
You could. Again I won‚Äôt spec into anything spellcleave related I think those types of group are toxic and not fun at all lol even if it is more exp but if you want to more power to you.
---
I think the question is far does it decay before it stops decaying.
---
Sounds like you're just too ignorant to realize video games are an art and art is inherently political.   
---
But continue on being a tool
---
You need to constantly update your data by scanning the AH.  If you don't do that, the prices in the tooltip will not reflect the accurate price.
---
You use Rhok Delar. The Leaf to get is literally a 50% drop rate in MC. Any hunter who wants any other bow is just ignorant or an idiot. After like 1 month of MC, every hunter has their BiS bow.
---
You hit him
---
&gt; stand on the side of freedom 
---
Can we stop making companies political and giving them rewards/punishments for doing so?
---
Blizzard made the correct choice from a capitalistic perspective.  This is like being angry at your kid for swearing at other cars on the road when you make your car blush with your road rage.
---
Yeah. Still wasn't happy about it though haha.
---
How does it do it though? It picks up players that are just on flight paths overhead, do they even show up in the combat log.
---
Anyway, nice to see I get down voted lol
---
I use the addon, but that doesn't mean I don't think it's so powerful in wpvp
---
I think knowing the populations promotes a better balance. People flock to the balanced servers and less people have to suffer on the highly skewed servers.
---
I mean, you can say that, but that doesn‚Äôt make it correct.
---
What is the likelihood of someone reporting my name deliberately to get a GM to force me to change my name even if it's not offensive in order to change my character's name?
---
Where is your proof though? Like it's word against word at this point.
---
Yes, if you are on a higher population realm you can get free realm transfers to low pop realms. They have not confirmed any other function of the store, though the classic panel at the last BlizzCon did say they were looking at race changes, name changes, and possibly faction changes. Stay tuned.
---
Apparently teabagging has become a big rage since classic too ...

Bullshit. Founding fathers died for people to speak up against torture, murder, corruption, and tyrants.

Silence is giving more and more companies a free pass to enable murderers to profit and expand their empires.

For some reason I keep thinking 1k is like 32+, probably because I'm thinking Shimmering Flats.

I bought 4 PSB at 23g ea on my server when it announced. They still sitting at 23g...hopefully they go up
---
10 g
---
I did 3 ZF runs and 1 Mara run while questing in the zones mentioned. Level 49 and planning to finish up tanaris and then head to fewood azafata. Definitely recommend the instances and searing gorge
---
You're undervaluing the mage dps a bit. CoC will be used on CD, and with novas those cones will be critting most the time for massive damage. And you really only need 1 person blizzarding, arcane explosion will hit way harder overall.
---
Server ratio won't matter for BGs; they will be cross-server.
---
Every horde player ever is in a group or a higher level than you in classic on my server. They kill you 90% of the time
---
Maybe I am mixing up comments or you are. I replied to at least two different people and had some back and forth with one person, and that was definitely not their first comment.  Either way, it doesn‚Äôt matter too much to me, because even though I do participate in some light world PvP, I am more of a BG sort of person when it comes to PvP. 
---
I hope it gets banned. I hope DBM gets banned. These things will likely never happen. Still happy enough with the game to play it anyway.
---
Agreed, but evidently the minutiae are too distracting.
---
Sounds like you need to find a guild and stop pugging. You are flaming more than anyone in your own sub. Make some friends and stop crying about pugs.
---
With ah open type /tsm scan. Takes a few mins to scan ah for prices. Do this frequently to build history. Can use desktop app instead but that‚Äôs another post. 
---
Then in the ah tab run a post scan and select post and should get the majority of items from the default list. 
---
Q:
---
Can you tweak your posing criteria
---
A:
---
Yes check out the TSM forms for advanced guides. But this will get the basics for you right out of the box.
---
bis items aren't all equal. Melee getting a bis stat stick is nowhere near as important as them getting an actual weapon.
---
XP wise it's halfway... But in /PLAYED is it halfway? Cause yeah your xp needed goes up but so does your xp per hour
---
Except it doesn't, I've tested it many, many times already.
---
Omg Jiz wtf how inhumane!
---
Genocide against the quillboars fuck yes this will br a good teaching moment for my children.
---
Oh it‚Äôs very efficient and I‚Äôll mark targets for my rogues specifically for that purpose. Otherwise that‚Äôs an extra caster blasting my ass until the focus target dies. Unless your tank gives a good reason not to, always focus the most dangerous caster first. It‚Äôs usually a healing caster or a DPS caster, both of which complicate pulls.
---
Apparently they did and this guy just didn‚Äôt bother looking at loot rules, the complained after.
---
This is absolutely not the case, I don't remember twinks until well after BGs were released. I remember it completely ruined BGs during leveling which was a huge shame.
---
Another goal from the bucket list completed
---
It drives me mad when a mage thinks it's perfectly fine to pull with a fireball while the healer is still drinking. Then when they get attacked, do they run towards me? Of course not, the go in the opposite direction, and I don't have feral charge yet so I can't catch the mob.
---
&gt;Racial advantage
---
Dwarf priests are super good in PvP. Instant heal, fear ward(great considering how many shadow priests and warlocks horde has), stoneskin. All together they make by far the most OP Disc priests in PvP.
---
Mage and warlock gnomes have the biggest int - which is kind of cool. Escape artist also makes them way better kiters,
---
People like that in the real world keep quite and stay miserable inside, all day and night.
---
Yes, my guild had 1 character (a mage) with a douse.  We parked a warlock alt on the Duke's island, and then after every rune, the mage would get summoned out there, get a new douse, port to IF, and fly back, while the rest of us continued on towards the next boss.  He was always back before we made it to the new big fight
---
Yeah, that part sucked, but luckily the tank was patient and waited for me to mana regen since I basically had to drink after every pull. üòÇ
---
They should rename to &lt;NO HOMO&gt; and see what happens.   First you don't want us to be gay, then you don't want us to be not gay!
---
Fortunately got this on my first SM GY run but very soon after got some 7/8str &amp; 7/8 agi gloves from a q which I replaced them with. I really wouldn't worry about ebon vise! You'll replace them very soon
---
I think Blizzard disabled the api that allowed threat meters to function properly. Otherwise 2 identical mobs can not be split into their own threat bubble.
---
Ele shaman is not a burden in dungeons, they do fine dps, Even more than some other specs in a dungeon.
---
Similar situation, but I was playing Civ6. 
---
"One more turn"
---
As a warlock don't heal us, our game is to trade our health for Mana.  We have a variety of ways to balance this and heal our selves.
---
Only heal if they ask for it, or it's a mob that's killing them(not themselves with hellfire/life tap)
---
Let‚Äôs go Blues!
---
It also says what his punishment will be, which is why I dont believe that Blizzard China are the ones who punished him.
---
Its also pretty easy to cut out a single video game compared to cutting out major goods/tech services that are used daily.
---
Yes I tested this exact scenario, maybe your timers are aware of the interaction (with what's essentially spell queuing) and are taking it into account, but when I checked it the combat log showed exacty what you would expect, you finish an auto after .5s then a 3s cast time on aimed shot despite the animations showing something different.
---
This made me chuckle ahha
---
Can you get in to the door part from here? I wanna see what it's like to be in the door when it moves

---
It wasn't a story the first time or the second time. I don't think posting it again will make it any more important.
---
I don‚Äôt even like MMO‚Äôs. The gameplay is always like WoW clones. Take away the social aspects and the digital scenery, and you end up with really poor game design. Click button, deal damage. Wait a second and do it again. And you have 20 buttons that each deal roughly the same amount of damage in slightly different ways but very little complexity. It would be miserably boring as a single player game so the only reason to play is the social aspect. 
---
I was enjoying classic because of the experience but I got enough of it.
---
Lolololllkl world pvp slowed in wotlk cata ended it with strong guards
---
But he is showing the lock skip, not the lava run.
---
Not worth if 2h leveling, booming voice saves rage by not needing to shout as often
---
A half-dungeon sample is not exactly a very scientific study lol
---
I believe the level 52 priest was complaining because he had improved fort, but didnt have prayer of fort and therefore couldnt override the shadow priests buff.
---
As for the difficulty on the healer, totally agree but that wasnt the case.  We essentially chain pulled the trash and most of it was dying fast enough that it didnt matter if someone pulled aggro.  The priest didnt drop below ~60% mana the entire time pulling trash.  Bosses we made sure we were more careful of taking aggro and allowing the warrior to build aggro.  That's why I didnt understand the complaining - we did the run in 23 minutes without a single death.
---
First Hong Kong, now this? When will it be enough Blizzard? When?!
---
He should probably check his electronics. Bet most of them have a China stamp on it too.
---
Thowing a phone in the trash is stupid. It does not hurt Apple to throw away a phone you already bought. It hurts apple to not make app purchases, upgrade to a pixel or Samsung. It hurts blizzard to cancel all your subscriptions. It hurts the NBA to not watch games, not buy tickets or merchandise. It hurts the NBA for reporters to point out to the coaches and players that their silence supports police brutality.
---
Oooh nice.
---
Disgusting Paladin, anyone?
---
You only fight mobs two levels below you when you play a warrior leveling.  If the case ever occurs when you are fighting equal or higher level mobs you need a duo partner or to change zones and quests downwards.
---
I‚Äôd say Mark of Tyranny is always equipped and the rest is variable. Higher armor + 1% dodge beats the resistances, in my opinion.
---
Booty Bay is the cross faction AH.  It has a HEFTY AH cut that is much higher than regular AH, and it's not as highly trafficked as your faction AH.  I do not recommend using it.
---
I think you should have easier time to find groups around 43-45 when you can enter Uldaman and Zul Farak
---
There are lots of free classic blizzlike private servers! I‚Äôve played on some before and they‚Äôre great! And free!
---
Hunter is missing from that list.
---
That bag drop yet bro? Let me get a link!
---
Titan panel, ok cool. I tried disabling all, moving, reloging, and it stayed, then they reenabled all, but then it reset my next login
---
Nope
---
Switching twice every week is sustainable if you farm a lot. Some guilds also plan raids to let people respec less frequently, i.e. one raid at the end of the week followed by another raid at the start of next week, so you only need 1 respec a week.
---
There isn't much shadow gear in MC now and you wouldn't even get to roll/bid on it over DPS classes if you're primarily a healer.
---
Nope, and no potions or first aid either.  Being shapeshifted prevents you from using almost any items.
---
You can probably go to strangle thorn and fish the spawns.  There is a chance for you to get iron bound chests which contain bolts of cloth.  The bolts of cloth sell for pretty good money.
---
Just curious, what talents did you choose? 
---
One interesting thing about Twinking is that there are are several different builds, which equate to different playstyles.
---
Sorry "I heard" ... maybe I got a wrong information.
---
Yes, eternium lockboxes require higher skill.
---
Almost every noob guild has loot drama over brutality blade and its hilarious.  Any experienced player knows its a trap item. You get brut blade and you might top meters for a bit
---
 But any rogue w perds beats you. And you are unlikely to be given another upgrade until all melee have weapons. Brut blade is like, the worst purple melee weapon  to get aside from vendor garbage like thunderstrike.
---
It's 30%, everyone has a base 5%. Nearly 1/3 stun resist is bonkers.
---
But what is the problem? I remember over 10 years ago that completing your STV quests was a batch of honor. You'd have to call your guildies to help you else you'd be farmed over and over again. That's the whole point of PvP servers. Also why we have PvE and RP.
---
You're a grown adult and you're entitled to your opinion. I respectfully disagree.
---
God you are so sent off about a simple observation.  "Outrage culture"
---
I'm on flamelash eu too man. The 65/35 to horde is real
---
It's actually not that hard if you have 4 alts. Then you just log in to them for like an hour every week to burn through their rested exp.
---
Imagine your whole identity revolving around what dingle dangles you like.
---
maybe on aoe fights where the melee is asleep?
---
Nah love. They probably have better things to do with their time than spend a moment of it with you.
---
My point is that you got in an argument against a dude acting like you were high and might. Cuz you "will" be stronger than them" or "you'll always have a preist with you".  You sounded like a kid trying to look cool by attempting to one up a situation.
---
Other guys point was blunt and simple. Bring friends if you dont wana get camped by groups. That way it will make for a better fight for them and you
---
I wonder how this is even possible. Even without any sleep and spamming dungeons...just how.
---
if you can, use the fish to level cooking, then probably just vendor most of them, or gift them to a needy hunter with a pet that likes fish.  You can absolutely make decent money fishing during some level bands assuming you have high fishing skill, but in general it's not the fish themselves that will make you the money; it's other stuff you can catch while fishing that you can AH that will make you money.  You can probably search my comment history for more information, or just Google 'classic wow making money with fishing' and follow some links for more detailed info.
---
Because in some fucked up pulls it's too much so the heals is only expected to keep the tank alive, not the dps.
---
Yea... banning pros and taking their winnings is one thing, but lying to us about the map of Azeroth!??!?! 
---
UNACCEPTABLE. Unsubbed
---
YES - there are doors in dungeons that you can lock pick if needed.  Don't be the rogue that didn't level his/her lockpicking.
---
Any points you put in for early dungeons is fine, you could go shadow and still heal leveling dungeons no problem until 60.
---
Is the Bad Mojo Mask worth it for a mage?  I have the SM hat currently (Whitemane Chapeau).  My only concern is the shadow dmg, but it has +24 int.
---
/equipslot 16 mainhand

/equipslot 17 offhand
---
I is included in We.  He is bragging in that sentence.  The others aren't.
---
Press the blue button, takes like 10sec tops.
---
I mean, in short, no, there isn't any current solution for you unless your realm allows free transfers due to high volume.
---
Pray that Blizzard introduces paid transfers in the near future.

so after getting my 5 dungeon lockouts 30 mins ago, everytime I enter the game, I am descending into what seems a white background and immediately get dced. what's going on !
---
Citation needed for British SS influencing it. Because here in the US MLMs are saying it's the CIA influence.   
---
Hong Kong belongs to the people who inhabit it and if they want to not deal with china's shit then that's their own prerogative to take care of.   
---
You do not get 5+ million people protesting for months with CIA/British SS Propaganda.
---
Level 48 ele shaman with 300 skinning and 205 LW. I know I want engineering at 60 since I‚Äôm going to mainly focus on PvP so what should I drop? Probably Leatherworking? In retrospect I wish I hadn‚Äôt even started skilling it but I wasn‚Äôt sure on what I was gonna do end game
---
Dual wield sucks til you get + hit gear to support it
---
Fear in general seems totally nuts right now. It's completely debilitating, and in open world pvp there's a strong likelihood that you get feared straight into mobs just to compound the awfulness.
---
I'd say 1) HoT early so it's ticking while you're feared, 2) feral charge to get back quickly/stop casting, 3) use the buddy system, so even if you get feared your friend can stab them in the kidney.
---
Get a dreamweave circlet. Shouldn't be more than 8g.
---
Of course it will be. Easy honor.
---
Level up and fight back!
---
The crowd is the same on both side bro, everyone is older now. There literally is no difference between factions.

Yes! Us offspec brothers need to stick together :D
---
This is the tool I've been using for BiS lists: http://wowclassicbis.com/

cool story bro
---
Agility by far
---
What did Samsung do to violate human rights exactly? Blizzard is silencing people and banning people who support Hong Kong. I'm at a loss that people can't figure this stuff out.
---
I‚Äôd certainly have more time
---
I'll check AH later
---
&gt;Yes, engineering is the min/max choice.  No, it isn't required to be competitive. 
---
Which is it? Because the two are mutually exclusive.
---
&gt; You don't want to see what the economy looks like if you do.
---
First of all, that's completely irrelevant, second of all, it would be healthy for the economy.
---
PLUS totem buffs. OP is nuts with the ele sham hate
---
In my realm its scummy alliance abusing only 3v1.Never dare to gank solo
---
Armor and dodge
---
Used to have a mod back in Vanilla that allowed me to bind keys and cast based on mousing over party frames. Ie. Right click, Renew, left click Flash Heal.
---
Can anyone tell me an addon like this for classic?
---
Oh yeah, they fight. For absolutely nothing, tho. It won't help Hong Kong to boycott Blizzard, it won't even affect China at all.
---
Like, picking litterally ANY other fight would bring more result than this.
---
A tip for something usefull and linked to freedom : Donate to Wikipedia. That's nice. I give them whenever they ask to repay them for those years of service to my studies, and it bring knowledge to everyone.
---
Or to research against rare illness perhaps, or if you don't wan't or cannot give money and particularly hate China, go and sh\*t on them directly. But I can assure you that cancelling your WoWsub for that particular reason is probably one of the less meaningful move you can do.
---
You're probably right there...I probably have that order wrong. Fight dependent obviously.
---
yes!  üòÑ
---
Yea that's just a pissy warlock which would be better off rerolling. If that's the case Id lifetap as low as possible, cannibalize and bandage.
---
A group of 5 in my guild started at release 6pm EST on Monday and were all 60 by late Friday afternoon, roughly 3 days 11 hours of play. They just jammed AE Instances all the way up with Warrior, 3 Mages, and a Shaman.
---
Solo mage ale farming
---
And how successful do you think that strategy is long term?
---
It‚Äôs not about whether I can or not. I can do long division, but I‚Äôll be fucking damned if I reach for paper over a calculator
---
It's all good. Was pretty much talking about the subreddit as a whole regarding attacking. I've been asked several times in comments if I own any Apple products. Answer is no. I've not owned an Iphone since 2009. Nor do I have any of their tablets, TVs, Ipods, etc... Never been an Apple guy really. 
---
And almost everything is made in China. Pretty much near impossible to not buy products made from there. But it doesn't mean I have to support what Blizzard did.
---
&gt;People or more accurately, the majority of reddit, wants Classic for a while.
---
Pushing the boundaries of hyperbole since whenever you were born, huh? The community that wanted classic is playing classic, and again is not representative of the wow community as a whole. The reason we got Classic in the first place was because the Nost community was willing to go to whatever lengths to get their game back. Nostalrius was not the most popular private server, Warmane was peaking at 10k when nost peaked anywhere between 6-8k during peak hours in Asia. Even leading up to Classic their numbers were higher that what Light's Hope was posting for the longest. Even if the community wanted TBC Blizzard would have started with Classic, it makes sense.
---
9/10 I don't get the chance because my group throws a bitch fit and pulls before I can.
---
It's 1.12 behavior. In fact it's probably like 1.5 or 1.6 behavior. It was definitely already like this shortly after AV went live. I specifically remember in the Tarren Mill/Southshore battles having to constantly yell at people to pull back from the town so we wouldn't get guard spam.
---
Yes,  it unfortunately as you have observed it is literally only possible to take one action in an entire human lifetime. Sorry all other important causes. Guess I won‚Äôt be donating to the food bank any more
---
&gt; I am sure that, as someone who feels sick about the ruining of 3 people's livelihoods
---
Personally, I don't really care that much about these 3 people not being able to work in hearthstone anymore. I mean sure it sucks for them, and it doesn't seem fair, but I'm not losing sleep over the fact that Blitzchung can't compete in grandmasters, or that Tommy can't cast anymore. 
---
What I am upset about is Blizzard's reaction and the precedent it set. If this had been a Venezuelan player and he made a statement about the Venezuelan protests, Blizzard would NOT have had this reaction. But Blizzard is in bed with China now, and the Chinese government is incredibly oppressive and anti-human-rights. Blizzard has shown that they're willing to censor people to match Chinese ideals, and things like the announcement of mobile diablo have shown that the Chinese market is becoming more important to Blizzard than the Western market that made them big in the first place. 
---
The people who are really upset about this are the ones who are noticing a trend of this happening and are becoming scared of what it means. We need people to be really upset about this and to make Blizzard regret it so that other companies see what happens when you bow down to China. If we were actually successful in getting angry and boycotting any Western company that censors or bows down to China, we might actually be able to scare other companies away from making the same mistakes. 
---
Most people deleting their Blizzard accounts are doing it to send a message that we're not OK with this or the precedent it sets. Again, it sucks that 3 people lost their jobs, but that's not the main problem here.
---
Blizzard is banking on china's playerbase for their Diablo immortal release, which will likely be 80% of the players of not more.
---
so how does this make striker's mark do less damage if they both get the same amount of autos in between aimed shots and striker's has better stats and the same damage range
---
Warriors are the top DPS class so telling them not to dps is a joke. Sorry you rolled shaman, one of the worst dps classes in the game. Maybe you shoulda done your research because you picked a healing class bud.
---
Now there is two of them!
---
I'm always shocked to learn there are still people like this in the world.
---
Have you figured out why when cleave is dodge by my non primary target, I cannot use overpower on my primary?  Also, if I switch to the target that dodged immediately overpower is no longer queued up?  I also have had cleave attacks be dodged by both targets, and overpower was available, but spamming the skill would not cast it.  
---
It might be a recent bug that cropped up in the recent patch, but I can't find people noticing it or telling me what I am doing wrong.  I certainly had rage to cast overpower and was in battle stance (I even have the stance swap in the OP macro.)
---
&gt;If someone tries to inflate the bids by bidding higher on an item than you do, why not just let them have it and waste their DKP?
---
I ran a guild with a bid DKP system and a few dickheads would try to do this.  At first I did just that but then it results in annoyed annoyed/disappointed guild members and still represents a corruption of what the system is supposed to be doing.
---
Luckily for me what the dickheads would often try to do is once the person they were trying to get to waste their DKP didn't outbid them, they'd tell me they didn't really want the item and the other guy could have it.  I pretty much instituted a 3-strikes policy:  First time I'd disregard their bid but give it to the other bidder at the non-inflated price.  Second time I'd do that but dock the fake bidder's DKP anyway.  Third time was a g-kick.
---
My only guess/thought would be if blizzard identifies servers that have large faction imbalance, and offers transfers for players, but I think that is a hard sell for a number of reasons
---
I do. Keep the message alive, OP.
---
There are drops that are similar stat-wise if you compared individually, but paired with the 2% hit from the set it puts it over the top.
---
No, jackass, you do that in questing hubs not fucking flight points.
---
Nah man...in the 15 years that this game has existed no one has ever gotten that close.
---
I mean, your chances of getting it over 4 others in your group is probably the same chance of someone ninjaing.
---
Their dps isn't "Fine" its the lowest of all the classes and specs.
---
What do you mean it wasn't a story?  It is literally an article on ARS Technica.
---
Oooo that is something I‚Äôll have to try. Thanks!
---
Human male. I was tempted to reroll female, but I‚Äôll keep that for another character
---
I don‚Äôt get it
---
&gt; I play Horde because the crowd tends to be older and less interested in the beauty aesthetic of their toon.
---
I could say that it sounds quite the opposite - children want to play more "badass looking" chars, and select Horde)
---
Yes, a lock should either be eating or bandaging. I won't say shit and see if healer does top me. If they do, great. If not, then I bust out the food. 
---
As a healer if you think it's slowing you down so much, tell them as much. And comment is correct, if they bitch about it they're not a good lock.
---
Obviously duelwield has priority, I was more specifically asking about duelwield warrior vs duelwield rogue.
---
What‚Äôs a good profession while leveling (casually) as a feral tank Druid? I would want to tank most of the time in dungeons.
---
This is wrong. I specifically remember the guard spam existing when I still did mass world PvP in Vanilla, which would have been before AQ release, at the very latest.
---
Get two good rogue buddies and 3 man him. 5 times an hour, that's 5% drop rate x 5 runs = 25% (avg) drop chance per hour, that's 4 hours per person = 12 hours (average) for all three of you.
---
As long as you say it in your recruiting message anyone who joins shouldn't have an issue with it. It's common accepted practice at this point. I even ask for reserved first righteous orb when joining strat parties as the tank.
---
That‚Äôs only 1 extra mana tic per mount up for 400g more
---
I‚Äôm also keeping a message alive. This shit is fake.
---
I disagree with raid tanking being the most boring.  I would think its actually the most fun even above healing (provided your not the third or fourth off tank reduced to just being a crappy DPS).
---
You have 4 threat generating abilities, 2 debuffs for mitigation, shield block and a few big CDs not to mention generally being a center point of the whole raid.  Way better then spamming frostbolt
---
Truestrike leather shoulders are a flat downgrade over Might for tanks. Full stop.
---
Yes, your poor daughter is going to immediately turn into a bloodthirsty murderer and/or sex-addicted whore as soon as she learns the word pussy. Especially once she learns her dad is one.
---
No, but you're likely to hit a few Civilians and rack a few DHK's up.
---
I remember stumbking across this waayy back in the day when I was like 15. Was so mysterious and epic.
---
So instead of the top dps class in the game, you rolled a tranq shot bot that falls off in dps for all of classic. You now do a quarter of a warriors dps because you didnt want to get r14. Good one.
---
And there are better weapons than R14 in later phases.
---
Yeah, I can see that. Obviously it's not such a cut and dry issue, but just offering an outsider's point of view. I feel like mages would be better off with a polite "no, sry" than grubbing for change.
---
Nothing of note or interest. If the guild was named Catholic Boys it would have gotten changed too. This is not a particular group getting singled out. This is selective outrage because people just so happen to agree with this particular group.
---
You can see me? Shady as fuck.
---
Do you remember when tanks prioritized stamina over everything else, including +hit/defense and the gold standard of raid tanking was whether you could get over 10khp?
---
Because that was a thing.
---
So you would like to see them /spit on you
---
No. You don‚Äôt get an honorable kill for those below 49 (or 48?) as a level 60. But dishonorable kills are only for killing certain NPCs.
---
Let me guess, you're the kind of guy who needs tone markers like /s to add context to text?

It must suck being as tone deaf as you. I'm not "set off" at al.

Great, now look at it with arrows added.

&gt; Plus you don't get to spam aimed shot every cd since it's a mana intensive spell so there will be times you will be autoshot only mode while you wait for mana.

Don't get me twisted, I'll take an ele sham if I'm melee but really only because of WF. But the killing joke is that every shaman spec has access to WF so why would I want an ele sham when I can get a resto sham and ANY OTHER DPS to increase my groups overall damage output?
---
I'm not trying to sit in BRD for 3 hours, I'd like to clear in a reasonable time and ele shaman doesn't bring anything to the table that a resto shaman does.
---
As a rogue I've skinned plenty of devilsaurs on one of the most contested servers in classic. Devilsaurs mafia is a bitch tho.
---
makes no sense since you get the same amount of autoshots in between aimed shots and striker's has the same damage range and more ap
---
Fake? Ok big boy.
---
Check your combat log.
---
When you land, don't you have an honorless kill buff for like 15 seconds?
---

TSM

Check the prices on the gloves and vest too. Should be a lot cheaper.
---
Get that song out of here.
---
I tanked a full UBRS yesterday dual wielding in DPS spec.
---
Maybe you cant tank it or play w shit healers, but others can.
---
The irony of you calling me mad as you reply to every comment in the thread xD
---
stay salty shitter
---
Oof.. crystals alone are going for 70g on my server
---
Skinning and herbalism
---
Out of all things Vanilla, or pre-Cata really, Barrens chat was the thing I missed the most. It truly is a perfect boiling pot of twats and you never know what the next message is gonna be about
---
Nice
---
Yeah, the tooltip is awful.  It gives 1 rage every 3 seconds, which is less rage than decays out of combat.  So, in effect it does slow rage loss outside combat, but the way it does that means you also get free rage in combat.
---
Skinning is always great while leveling. Leatherworking makes the most sense to pair with it. All of the professions are of course fine, however most consumables (alchemy and engineering) cannot be use in forms.
---
You also agreed China #1 and to obey the CPC.
---
So like, here's the thing.  He was veiled from sight before attempting to Sap.  His Sap's RNG kicked in, thus removing the veil and revealing him.  In order to protect himself, he quickly used Vanish in order to be be veiled again, or re-veiled if you will.
---
Voila!  You're welcome OP.
---
That's not a mainspec tank. Read.
---
It's almost like shit other than the damage meter matters to certain people.
---
Bingo.
---
If you‚Äôre anywhere close to your tanks threat they are not pressing their buttons correctly.
---
&gt; Or is there some selective 'algorithm' at work, and could you flesh those out for me?
---
So, at the risk of sounding heartless and robtic  --  frankly, yes, there kind of is a selection process for this.
---
A simple truth, while hard to swallow, is that it is functionally impossible to participate in society today without benefiting or marginalizing something awful.  I mean, look at [this list](https://github.com/caffeine-overload/bandinchina) and tell me what I'm supposed to do if I need to travel on any major airline for work?  Look at Nestle's vast network of subsidiaries and tell me most Americans don't knowingly or unknowingly buy those products at some point.  It's sad, but it's just reality that 100% avoidance is never ever going to be possible.  Hell, I work in Digital Marketing  --  Boycotting Google is absolutely *not* an option for me if I want to continue in the career I've dedicated the better part of my adult life to.
---
So obviously since 100% avoidance isn't possible, we should just be okay with 0%, right?  Of course not.
---
If I boycott Microsoft tomorrow, it wouldn't even make a splash.  Same with Nike, or Apple, or Gap clothing.  I'm not saying I won't still avoid supporting those companies where possible, but a hardline approach simply isn't going to accomplish anything.  In a case like this though, there is a clear and present public outcry happening right now.  **Now** is the time to actually do anything that matters and participate in the wave.  It's easy (and very tempting) to say *"oh it won't matter, I'm just going to keep playing WoW,"* but this cat's already out of the bag, and wheels are turning.  This is a clear and simple case where a hardline avoidance *is* possible.  And while I wouldn't shame anyone for not participating, this is a case where my choices can easily align with my beliefs.  It's why I feel bad for not *wanting* to stop, but I did cancel my sub this morning.  My game time lasts until November 2.  I am still going to hold out hope that Blizzard will recant until then, but if they don't then I might have to separate entirely.
---
You can't in classic. They broke wall jumping. Fun was detected.
---
This is my favorite thing as a Rogue main. I made myself a macro that pickpockets a random amount of silver and copper from other players. I use it at flight points, mailboxes, and at the AH pretty often. Always get a couple whispers asking me wtf I'm doing. I even have one that says I fumbled and failed to pickpocket. 
---
Always get at least one whisper or mention in general/trade calling me out. It's great. But I'm not nice and usually just reply with "YOINK!" or "finders keepers" and let them figure it out on their own later.
---
Wah I play on a PvP server and got killed
---
You‚Äôre disregarding what happens when you pick sides and cherry pick quotes to fit your narrative. Kind of funny.
---
The thing is, these people are NOT camping for honor. lol
---
I heard dragon hotboxes aren't like they were in vanilla making ony bugged
---
Is Classic WoW running on a patch that gives XP for participating in Battlegrounds or no XP?
---
I remember XP got added which was a negative to twinks but earlier on there was no XP gained from BGs.
---
Can I give him words of encouragement?
---
Youre waiting for bgs :S
---
Before you get whirlwind (lvl 36), all you can do is demo shout and tab sunder/revenge. Tell the dps to give you about 5 seconds (3 gcd's) to get threat. If they won't, let them tank the mob they pull. 
---
Also, mark a skull, charge in, demo shout to keep em for a little bit, and throw 2 sunders on the skull before you start tab sundering. If they stay on the skull, you'll be fine.
---
Big offenders are hunters multishot and mages blizzard. Just try to teach em or if they won't be taught, coordinate with healers to let them die.
---
What? That happened all the time in vanilla
---
North east EPL has a MASSIVE troll area that will always have mobs up and you can easily pull them 1, 2, however many at a time. I grinded out the last bit of 60 there.
---
ive known my guildmates for 25+ years  in real life, they would set your house on fire if i needed.
---
my point is i dont bother fighting back some alliance sissies that only feel strong when theyre grouped, im busy grinding and getting sweet greens. my best friend is a priest and doing progression right now so of course i dont wanna waste his fucking time for some lowbies in STV, he will be with me every second of the day if i ask him to/if its needed so the fuck you on about. 
---
camped? i never said i was being camped, i get randomly ganked at times but never camped. if you get camped youre a noob and wasting your precious time. 
---
you sound like you have zero social skills cause all you do is talk in assumptions or polemics, go outside from time to time
---
You trust people more than I do. üòâ
---
Ten will do this but it will take you a few hours to figure out how to do it, make groups import strings etc...
---
Oh if you see me out in the wild chances are I won't mess w/ya unless messed with.
---
Then he ninjas he item on the last boss because you forgot about asking for leader back.
---
23g that's too late I think.
---
I bought all of mine below 15 and they are now worth between 30 and 40g. I would keep the ones you have at least until DM has been out for a bit before selling(or sell if you see a rise in price), but don't expect too much profit.
---
How do you snipe? Do you just check the AH all day long or does something like auctionator auto buy items if theyre under a certain price? Have always been curious
---
You reported? What a scrub!
---
lol, k.
---
Now run along and play, the grown ups are talking.
---
Outrage culture doesn't use logic my friend, simple as that. This happens literally almost every time. Kony 2012 is probably the best example.
---
As opposed to what? A dead subreddit that's constantly hemorrhaging off the few people that still check it because no one posts anything because people only want to post on a sub that has traffic?
---
Besides that's not what I said. If they want to outlaw memes that's one thing but that's not what they want. They want memes, they just want memes that *they* like. That's subjective enforcement. Either ban them all or shut up.
---
How much Runecloth would one need to go from Honored to Exalted with a city faction? Is there a rough estimate?
---
How‚Äôs the paladin tank working for you? I did a Druid and I have such issues holding threat with 3 fire mages.
---
HT4 does not get the full spell co-efficient
---
Yes? What's your point?
---
That's literally how TM/SS worked for like 75% of Vanilla. You didn't go into the town itself because it always caused guard spawn spam.
---
Yes, you hamstring to fish for dodges so you can overpower, and crits for deep wounds.
---
I've had this happen on the mob you summon in Desolace, the ones with the naga.  Two people who weren't high enough level for it were sitting around waiting for someone high to arrive and help. They asked if they could join me, but I was in a full group already, soon to do a dungeon. I was met with immediate hostility and unwarranted rude behaviour. 
---
Had they NOT behaved that way, I would've waited around for them to summon it, let them tag the mob and I would take over and kill it. However, I believe that people who are toxic don't deserve to be given any leeway, otherwise they'll never learn.
---
This is false information.
---
Your yellow hitcap is 6% with 305 weaponskill(which you get from talents). That means you only need 1% hit from gear for YELLOW cap. However that is only abilities, white hits have a 24% chance of missing so you can never get too much hit, it's still a valuable stat and devilsaurs are amazing not because they give 2%hit, but because they give a butt load of stats including hit.

---
no, they do it because they are bad player who think they need it for threat without ever questionning why they should do it.
---
just like people blindly follow random BIS list on the internet and end up chasing a devout belt, tooth of gnarr and stuff like that... or how non-tank get FR for ragnaros cause... big bad fire elem lord, must need FR right?
---
Onyxia is a good example : tank go in there specced and geared like a tin can... but she hit like a wet noodle, her fire breath is the only spike damage and aggro is all over the place... go dual-weild fury with leather piece and maybe few FR piece, going turtle-mode is just an handicap.
---
If it persists you might have to submit a ticket via website or another character. I don't think they have an unstuck feature on the website do they?
---
or just wait for tbc and stop trying to fuck with vanilla
---
Just make Diablo 4 completely badass and all is forgiven in my book.
---
Or a Diablo 2 remaster.
---
You are complaining because you can‚Äôt ruin the game for others longer than 5 mins now? What a dumb post.
---
Just so you're never mistaken again, here's some math.
---
Say you have a weapon that does 100 damage every 4 seconds. That's 100 damage X15 attacks per minute: 1,500 damage. SoC procs and gives an extra weapon swing 7 times: 700 damage. Total: 2,200 damage per minute.
---
Then you have a weapon that does 50 damage (half) every 2 seconds (twice as fast). That's 50 damage X30 attacks per minute: 1,500 damage. SoC procs and gives an extra weapon swing 7 times: 350 damage. Total: 1,850 damage per minute.
---
The slower weapon does more DPS with SoC precisely BECAUSE it's PPM and not actually just a chance. The slower the weapon, the stronger SoC is. It's basic math.
---
Fucking lame..i keep finding more and more retail bs destroying classic wow
---
Yes, that's why they will sheep you first, wait for buff to go away, then nuke you down
---
When you mouseover the chat, you should see tabs appear (General and Combat Log if I remember well) so do the following: mouseover the chat, right click general, then go to settings, and check if emotes are ticked
---
The hell are you trying to accomplish, lol
---
You're the true hero!
---
Well, to be fair, he clearly stated his skills weren't epic.
---
Sorry im horde , dont have that much xo with prot pala tanks
---
More caster oriented than hotw. You'll spend more time kiting rather than being in bear more as hotw.
---
You're missing the dodge ring.
---
Vuhdo can also do this
---
I‚Äôm level 34, when do I get that Druid Demon?
---
You can put crusader on those right?
---
It adds 14 more yards before Damage is calculated.
---
On fifth avenue, no less.
---
Is it true that 40-50 goes by pretty quickly? I've read this several times. I'm 48 and hoping that questing gets better because other than tanaris, it seems to be slim pickings.
---
Also, what are things I should be doing to prepare for 60 while I'm leveling? Attunements? Anything else?
---
How can you say Blizzard threw their Diablo PC gaming base under the bus when they were literally planning on releasing Diablo 4 at last years Blizzcon? Overly emotional cancel culture, my lord. My way or the wrong way with you people
---
It's accurate to 1.12.
---
This is super cool, please keep this up!
---
No it is not. In raids they won't probably perform because of the mana issues but in dungeons their burst is so strong that short fights will be a breeze. Stop being so black and white about what is good and what is not. They might not be optimal but they have their moments and especially in dungeons (and not progress raids) they can be valuable asset.
---
I leveled a paladin to 41 and stopped to level my mage after that. but from 30-40 I would put the healing seal on enemies and refresh it on myself with a macro, and read a book on my kindle app while farming animals for skins slowly like that.
---
I've never tried an RP server. What should I expect?
---
Yo I am right there with you. When I was around 8 years old I read the Boy's King Arthur and there was a whole lot of sword and shield and plate fury running around. To this day I love sword and board and my warrior uses it almost exclusively.
---
how original
---
Came here for this. Thank you.
---
Gold. You vendor or DE the blues. You can also sell runs for the ring.
---
No some of these were **removed** from vanilla two weeks before the game went live (without play testing!) and some of them came with TBC prepatch.
---
I would love to. It'd be a pleasure to watch someone like you explain how people wanting to escape commie oppression is fake.
---
Paladins are such a bad class in classic. They are very useful in pve and as supports in PvP but alone...they are so bad. I always help them kill their mobs when I meet them in the wild. That is before I end them.
---
I figured out the work around as a rogue and I‚Äôll be nice and share.
---
Start looting the chest, which Aggros the mobs. When they get close to you, vanish and immediately start looting the chest again while the mobs evade run back to their original position. 
---
I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs a lot of rogues farming archmage patterns that would love to know this little trick.
---
Yep, nailed it.
---
I am gonna need you to try very hard to stop being toxic, ok?
---
Gotcha.  I am pretty sure you can disenchant any level BoE as long as you have enchanting.  It doesn't matter what level the profession is.  If you're enchanting is at level 1 you should still be able to disenchant a level 55 green weapon for example.
---
What's the point then? What super mega advantage is spy giving people?  It's not automating any play, just providing information, and the information is both extremely limited and not that useful to begin with.
---
Congrats, you played yourself. Hope you can keep up the facade for long
---
Niceee..banged her ?
---
I'm in the exact same boat as you, except that I instantly cancelled my sub when I saw what they did. As bad as it feels to give up on a years-long dream, it would feel so much worse to support a company that openly condones the slaughter and rape of civilians. 
---
I am also still hopeful that they make a complete 180 in their stance in the next couple weeks... if not, I'll be deleting my account and turning my back on Blizzard for good.
---
As Horde, this is how I always feel in world PvP. I'm always alone and outnumbered. Just cannot seem to get a fair fight. Although I do attack from stealth, so there's that.
---
I recall a couple of my healers in vanilla having to look at the ground, because their toaster would die if tried to render all the spell effects of a raid.
---
Not really... Hop on the Warlock Discord and check out the current best lvling method for Warlocks in Classic and NOT on Private Servers
---
Unfortunately not.
---
Blizzard: Parents live in HK?
---
I play on a pvp server but I can tell you this, the only people I know that wouldn't quit if many night in a row they couldn't level because the town are getting grief are the players that can play like 5 hrs or more per day.        
---
Regular players that can play an average or like 14 to 18hrs a week, all that I know would quit if this happened to them a lot, they wouldn't abandon their lvl 30 something character and start over in a PvE, they would just quit.
---
Well, it might get awkward when I tell you the subscription cancellation was what I was calling fake.
---
What are you talking about? It has timestamps in miliseconds.
---
To actually answer your question though, the title mentioned a faster way to do lava runs. However the video only illustrates the normal route for the lava run, in addition to the alternative anger farm route.
---
Which is why I called it a normal lava run. since the route he takes in the video, is the same route youd use on a normal lava run.
---
You don't need to do the second skip.. you can walk past them as 60s. Or just have a priest
---
Looking for advice on my final hunter pet.
---
I currently have Broken Tooth for PvP and Deathmaw for Group PvE.
---
I've heard either a wind serpent (for the ranged attack) or owl (for screech) would be good for a final pet?
---
I'd especially like a pet that is suited for farming in the open world (if such a thing exists?).
---
Thanks to anyone who can bestow their wisdom upon me.
---
Had one drop in scholo today and lost :(
---
Honestly if someone is defeated by special characters I don't think I want them in my group to begin with...
---
I used to raid with a group whose vent password was a really long random string of characters and symbols. They called it their "idiot test" if you couldn't get into vent you couldn't raid with them. Pretty simple way of weeding out all of the month breathers before even starting a raid.
---
I doubt it will be as common as you think.  People get just as bored doing that, unless they‚Äôre 12.
---
what pisses me off is tanks who pull and forget ranged mobs exist, so 5 seconds into healing the tank I get smacked with 3 fireballs and a bullet, or something similar. 
---
And on multiple occasions I have had to Los said mobs, bring them to the tank, and then literally type and ask him to taunt them off me.
---
makes me sad mmkay.
---
Well, at least no one T bag in vanilla lol.
---
me: I like this bagel
---
lots in this sub: WHAT ABKUT HONG KONG
---
Lol, it's not denialism. You're just being sensational.
---
What is the alliance zone version of the barrens?
---
Not a bad idea to do skinning/LW or alch/herb
---
Personally I really like having different options while leveling, especially as a druid it's like buff city
---
It is, and okay fuck every business then because every business tries to maintain a neutral PR. It's not a businesses job to spread political messages (unless stated otherwise by them). It's a businesses job to sell their product to as many people possible. They are under NO obligation to support or not support ANYTHING.
---
getting +dmg gear for a paladin is a great idea! how much impact does it have on judgement damage?
---
The problem with using 3 lignting bolts and a chain lightning is that it is single target, that means that target dies early even if you try to spread it out as much as you can. That's bad for aoe. Also assuming 10 targets is flawed, aoe groups do way bigger pulls than that on avg. which affects your dps massively.
---
Your guild is actually letting you raid with gutgore ripper? They shouldn‚Äôt be.
---
I leveled up to 40 with these two and was overall disappointed with the income. Most herbs and leather were vendored before level 35. And it slowed down my exp rate doing it.
---
You should probably reroll if you can't handle the leveling speed of paladins.
---
Doesn‚Äôt alchemy have pots with hour long effects? So it could last through being in any form? Would LW be worth it with skinning when there‚Äôs only a few pieces that are pre raid BIS? Or would the gear I could make while I‚Äôm leveling be more helpful?
---
My feeling is that the pace slows down on questing after 50 but you start going to instances more often which are good xp generator.
---
Good for you. Exactly. Though if the healer and other dps are worth something (healer especially) I'll try to talk to them and just kick the offending dps.
---
Ya there's not much point in picking up crafting professions early. They are a big time and money sink so it's a lot more efficient to level with gold making professions and then switch over later when you have better ways of farming gold. 
---
I wouldn't even bother with LW at all, it doesn't really give you anything special.
---
You said you wont play warrior cause you cant make your class the best possible, so you picked a class that gets given almost no loot and you will never have optimal gear on. Its ironic.
---
It went by pretty fast for me. Early 50-53 was kind of slow. But once I hit 54 and starting turning in quest, it started to ramp up in xp gains.
---
I had a priest in strat live that would shield me as the mobs reached me, heal/buff on the pull, and never use fade. Seriously wanted to strangle the dude. He bitched the whole run about threat and was trying to tell me how to warrior. DPS refused to cleave/aoe the non elites too. He also really liked triggering the fake crates and getting covered in maggots too then bitching about me not pulling them off him.
---
Apparently it made enough impact to upset you.
---
So it may be more worth it to just pair it with LW or ALCH?
---
Yup, Loch Modan is ally, Wetlands contested. Makes for fun ganking for horde when making your way to the Badlands for the firs time...
---
Cool man, that‚Äôs great to know it still works.
---
that's reddit for you. "pls tell me i'm good at pvp \^\^". When your ego needs flattering
---
Again, I'm not arguing that Classic should have higher performance than it does.
---
I'm saying that managing a 10k server compared to managing servers for millions of players is not equivalent.  Private servers are more than likely on a single server.  The realms we have today are most likely virtual machines spun up on Blizzard's network.  Which means they are not as robust but it gives the ability to scale more instances, which they did.  Did you really think that Blizzard installed more hardware for each server that came online?
---
Look up the pre-raid BiS list for you class and try to knock out as many of those items as you can by running dungeons. Better to get the items and experience at the same time whereas at 60 you're only looking for the items.
---
IMO Aragorn is a Paladin who has max ranks in first aid, herbalism and alchemy.  And√∫ril would be sword version of the [Maul of the Redeemed Crusader]( https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Maul_of_the_Redeemed_Crusader). He would use ‚ÄúTurn Undead‚Äù and ‚ÄúExorcism‚Äù while traveling the Paths of the Dead.
---
This has to be the coolest one so far.
---
I disagree, with all of the hit and expertise you get from combat tree and with proper hit gear the +50 ap from the set bonus is far more valuable than +wep skill. As long as you are hit capped AP over wep skills. Seeing how as a rogue AP is your bread and butter after you are hit capped the gains in weapon skills will not attribute to be as much damage as the dal rend will provide
---
I want BGs as well. But I don‚Äôt mind the world pvp. I don‚Äôt mind getting killed or camped. It is part of the vanilla experience.
---
It's bollocks and I have zero tolerance for it.
---
It's playing on people's desperation to get into a group.
---
Can I see it?
---
I see these names all of the time on Grobb. It's an RP server.
---
eciN
---
Just make sure to have the current level of growl and your current level of pet abilities and it's not that big of a deal for your pet to hold agro in MM.
---
Nobody cares about your suboptimal logs. I'm talking about rank 1 instant poison and how it nearly accounts for 50% of your damage at level 20.
---
Lmao pointless first sentence. Do you want a pat on the back?
---
Yes, you have the best time as a solo rogue compared to any other class. Looks like OP is a warrior though
---
Auctionator
---
Could be something left over from Legion.
---
no.
---
Define competitive then.  In my mind, competitive is being able to help your team win and working towards a positive win ratio.  With that as the definition, engineering provides a very small edge that is easily lost in the noise.  If you call the grind to R14 as being competitive, then every fraction of a percentage is needed and engineering is required.
---
Think of it like the Olympics.  Without engineering, you will most likely not get in the finals.  But you were still competitive during the rest of the event.
---
This is the 80/20 problem all over again.  To get into the top 1% of pvpers, you need everything.  To be competitive doesn't mean the top 1%.
---
I think so. I'll try exiting game entirely and just doing titan.
---
I convinced a friend to play. He has never played WoW or knows anything about it. He always likes to read out aloud some of the more colorful things said in general chat. 
---
We are both around level 40 and after saying another particularly creative exclamation while flying over barrens he asks me, "Is barrens always like this?" 
---
Yes Knawtar, barrens is always like this.
---
Mask/ony neck/bracers/blademaster leggings/accuria to get to 7% hit.
---
Band of accuria is MT&gt;OT&gt;Melee dps priority for our guild. 
---
I could switch to agi/str food, but the cost of consumes is so high I just rock with stam/spirit food.
---
I bring 12 MCPs to raid but usually only go through 5-8 for MC and Ony. We are doing split runs so I have to use less than a speed clear though.
---
Just a suggestion if you want more keybinds. Rebind Q R T F V C X Z to abilities. Use a modifier for interface hotkeys, i.e character panel, sit etc.
---
You can also use you mouse buttons with modifiers. Scroll up, down middle mouse button. If you have thumb buttons use them as well with modifiers. 
---
With this it is possible to bind 4 full bars.
---
With LC, you can gear up your MT asap so he can generate the most threat/have good survivability, and then from there, give the pieces to the classes that make the most use out of it and reward raiders on their performance, prioritizing the high performance raiders on the good pieces while still feeding loot to the others.
---
Because of this system based on performance, you usually end up with your raiders competing for performance, which is what hardcore guilds want.
---
At least that's in theory. In good guilds, the above will happen. In most casual guilds where abuse is much more likely, you might end up with a clique getting all the good gear regardless of how well others perform.
---
Best you can do is triage. If you have a healing assignment, make sure that‚Äôs handled first (like if you are assigned a tank to keep alive) then look into healing others in danger of dying.
---
To prevent yourself and the other healers from wasting mana, make sure everyone has Healcomm installed. It helps let you know which raid members have healers incoming to them. But every healer needs it installed for it to be properly effective. Luckily it comes built into Luna Unit Frames and Elvui. I‚Äôm not sure if others automatically include it, but you can download it and get it working for *most* other unit frames (I say most because I don‚Äôt know if it works for all, but I‚Äôd assume it does).
---
Note: if you are Horde, it only lets you know the initial target. You‚Äôll have no clue if the chain heal will bounce to someone else and waste some of your heal. It‚Äôs just something you have to deal with. Luckily chain heal works best for melee, so you can focus healing ranges players and generally not get sniped out by chain heal.
---
Lol is that what you're trying to do?  I don't know how to tell you this, but the flailings of a barely literate manchild come across less like a bashing and more like an amusing tickle.  How sad would someone have to be to give credence to a guy who tries to gatekeep one of the most accessible and family-friendly gaming experiences out there?  As soon as you log in, do you start your pathetic attempts at "bashing" there, too?  "No, toddler child of an adult tech worker, we don't talk about your baba in here, this is a serious gaming guild where we only discuss the issues that apply to real, gaming men!  Now hand me my pixel sword that I spent 8 hours killing imaginary zebras to pretend to afford, I'll show you SJWs how real men wait for a group of 19 other people to play pretend!"
---
I'm glad you're able to take pride in your ability to log into a website and misspell some words about how important your playacting is, because I can't see much about your attitude that would impress anyone else.  Most people are able to have fun doing their own thing without having their world upended because someone made a forum post that's not relevant to them.
---
because the other systems suck.  
---
They are inefficient and are riddled with problems  
---
on the other hand... 
---
there should be nothing to worry about with loot council  
---
if there is - thats your own fault for choosing to joining a shitty guild thats destined to fail
---
Would not recommend level 19 warrior twink. The class only has heroic strike and rend to deal damage with basically.
---
So...most of them?
---
Yeah I mean you're gonna pull aggro the question is when. If the mobs are still running at me as a bear they're gonna fly by me and you'll have aggro by the time you're 1/10th of the way through your channel because I literally haven't hit any of them yet. Then you have to stop channel, cast CoC, run around with everyone chasing you, etc. 
---
If you're a good boy and wait 5-10 seconds like you describe I've swiped all of them, roared, and I'm probably putting a maul on my second target. So now while you're channeling the first mob is dying because of single target damage, the second and maybe third I have control of, and anything else is still going to be interested in me for a few seconds until you pull it off me at the END of your channel, not the start. But that doesn't matter because the fight is already over.  
---
You clearly know all this but I wanted to type it all out anyway because I'm right, dammit.
---
It's pathetic but at the same time I think people should have the freedom to be pathetic.
---
The limited loot drops in Classic make efficient gearing even more appealing than retail now. You got 40+ people in a guild and around 30 pieces of loot a week (MC and Ony), minus the undesirable drops.
---
Are you just scared of loot council because of the horror stories you read on reddit or something? It's easy to avoid those situations and find guilds with fair councils. What system do you want and why do you think it's better than a loot council?
---
What my guilds did in the past and my new guild is planning on doing is roll against pugs and if the guild wins it goes by guild loot rules. We run an epgp system (very similar to a dkp buy system) so if the guild wins the roll we look at our lists of gear received vs points acquired through raiding to determine who gets the gear. Gives pugs their fair chance and hopefully evenly/fairly distributes loot to the guild.
---
It's maximising some people's progress at the expense of other mugs
---
I'm well aware, mostly just kidding, devilsaurs isn't for the average player especially not if that player isn't a rogue.
---
I don't think there is one tbh.  Barrens is just huge and a hub for a lot of zones and you end up staying there for 10-15 levels. The quests are mostly kill quests and kill for item quests so there's a lot of relative brain off downtime (which let's you focus on chat). You also end up using it for RFK and RFD at high 20's and low 40's as well as the rachet-bb boat.
---
Another thing I think that makes it such a social hub is you end up flying through it for just about everything south or org which means even if you chose not to level there you still see the chat.  People flying over like to say crazy or  troll-y to get the people leveling there going.  
---
Honestly it's a great zone.  I think its one of the most enjoyable leveling experiences in the game.
---
This is my first time really rolling horde and its honestly one of my favorite zones due to the social aspect.
---
Meh, we gave our first brut blade to a hunter.
---
What addon displays the combat info on your screen? i.e. &lt;Regrowth&gt;, &lt;Intercept Stun&gt;, amount you're healing, and amount of damage you're dealing.
---
Any addon that is similar in functionality to Altoholic?
---
He included himself. He‚Äôs bragging.
---
Sadly, yes.  Back in my PVP server days, we used to do this exact same thing to farm honor.  Its trivially easy to keep folks locked down when you have a group.
---
&gt;What can be done to quash these idiots?
---
Ask them whether all that agility helps with dodging kicks.
---
Sadly
---
You say "Pat"
---
I say "What?"
---
You say "Back"
---
I say "Shite"
---
You say "Inc"
---
I say "Hey man, that was never my fault and I don't like raid wipes."
---
Because with 40 people you are very likely going to have underperformers, who you really don't want to gear with a Mageblade/Viskag/Aurastone/Deathbringer. Some items are extremely rare + bis for multiple tiers of content.
---
There are some corrupt loot councils out there but in my experience, top performing players understand loot council benefits the guild the most.
---
And now the Kurds are doing terrorist acts in Turkey, which is our NATO ally.  So...
---
Yeah. They tried this on Rattlegore and I have the screenshot of a LOT of dead allies.
---
I love twinks ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)
---
If you really only need to sell items fast and don't really care too much for maximizing profit, I recommend [AuctionFaster](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/auctionfaster). Easy to use
---
&gt; Dude, dpsing wuth some shaman tank is honestly not fun at all. You can barely hit the mob without ripping off. No point using consumes or workd buffs. The raid takes 4√∑ hours.How long is your guild going to deal with slogging thru the content? All so you can feel special.
---
That's a very outdated mindset coming from a lack of information. The threat aspect and many others have been solved years ago. We're talking about a few seconds to a few minutes more to a normal raid run. 
---
All that you're complaining about is literally answered in that link I posted earlier.
---
Ran across: Tittibomb, a Paladin. Ran across Xshadow, a Paladin. Not really offensive but stupid. There are some others but their name escapes me at the moment.
---
Pantheon MMO looks promising, if it ever actually comes out
---
What addon are you using that shows how many of each item you have across your characters?
---
Warlock tank does NOT exist, except on Twin Emperor fight in AQ40
---
(and your voidwalker can tank a bit in 5 man dungeons, within limits)
---
Why u keep reposting this?
---
And that's why I don't bother PVP.  There is always someone who is going to be way quicker with their macros and attacks than me.  Been playing for years and years and couldn't get that quick, so don't bother with the "just gotta practice and get good!"
---
Wait so when I log out in StormWind or something and see the "zzz"s next to my name I am not getting as much rested XP if I logged out in an actual inn instead?
---
I don‚Äôt think there is one
---
The reason for why Barrens is the way it is is because there is just sooo many people there literally all the time. The zone encompasses like 16 levels and nearly every Horde player goes there, making it a giant melting pot/cespool of a gargantuan amount of people. There isn‚Äôt an alliance zone like that, really. 
---
It is well known now that Blizzard worked on the Alliance leveling zones first and took the Horde ones later which probably resulted in them having to rush to create a zone for the Horde after people yeet from their starter zones and thus barrens was born.
---
&gt; It's failing 75% of the time. 
---
It's +25% chance to resist ON TOP OF any other things that would increase the chance to resist a stun, like level difference or talents or gear, or dodge/miss/parry.
---
iirc it‚Äôs 35% since there‚Äôs an innate 10% plus the 25% they get.
---
Definitely Hunter.
---
Hemorrhoidic Strike
---
Paladins have two abilities that only trigger when they are critically hit - Redoubt which gives them a hefty block bonus and Reckoning which gives them an extra attack every time they're critically hit.
---
This makes both abilities kind of self-defeating since both are for tanking and tanks try to minimize incoming crits. And if you lower your chance to be critically hit it will mean you'll block less(Redoubt) and attack less(Reckoning), which cascades further as less blocks means less Holy damage from Blessing of Sanctuary/Holy Shield. And of course free instant extra attacks are great for threat too.
---
So I thought that, rather than try and increase your Paladin's defense, you should try to *decrease* it to try and get the boss to crit you to trigger these abilities on purpose.
---
Disgusting Oozeling is a pet that lowers your defense by 20, which should give you an extra 0.8% chance to be critically hit, but that's likely too small of a difference to even be noticeable.
---
And now that I think about it, doesn't sitting down "force" a crit? I wonder how useful that would be in PvE. Or does it only work on players...
---
Honor system was in place for 6 weeks before BG's with none having actual access to ranking gear within that time frame, and none knowing how massively OP it is, also doing that time ranking was signficantly harder, we are getting the "nerfed" version AND with the buffed rewards, seems fair right?
---
ITT: ppl who don't understand WCL all-star points

Seems like you're full of shit tbh
---
By logs I mean the details meter that runs constantly and showed instant poison pulling around 10% of my DPS around 22 wielding 2x cruel barbs.
---
soul link drain tanking... mmm sounds like hot garbage.
---
It definitely was titan panel for me. It's got something to do with it
---
&gt;like Hunter‚Äôs Mark being removed from Vanish
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Patch_1.12.0#Rogues
---
&gt; and rogues can be taken out of vanish if their enemies melee swing registers before they cast vanish due to the changes they made with spell batching.
---
That seriously was always a thing. Vanish (and FD) breaking was a damn meme for the entirety of vanilla and it didn't get fixed until Blizzard added in a short forced-stealth 'mercy period' in early Cata. [Here's  a blue post from 1.11 and user notes from late TBC](https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Vanish&amp;oldid=1023991#Known_Bugs).
---
The default strategy for 15 years is to refuse to run for mobs that other overaggro? Haha, aaah
---
It's almost as if tanks don't really have the tools to hold on aggro on 8 mobs simultaneously while a mage is casting AE spells.
---
I had not thought about that, makes a lot of sense.
---
Loot council does not cause that - poor guild management does.
---
Made over 2k sitting in Org afk clicking a button. 
---
Enchanting wants to talk
---
I don't know, I haven't been camped once yet, in Classic WoW, have you?
---
That said, in the event I ever got camped, I'd summon an army of my guildies, friends and passersby to come and protect my corpse from the evil Horde necrophiles.
---
It does work reasonably well with macros. Havent had a problem popping health pots tanking 5 man. I would be somewhat scared doin it tanking raid bosses tho, but it should work with macros.
---
Its going to happen  constantly. People ranking in pvp will be camping all higher lvl zone fp, camping BRM, camping the entrance to DM.
---
Which will be near impossible in P2 without BG's. The only semi reasonable way to farm HK's is to join a raid.
---
I need to press the scan button myself? It takes a really long time every time, right? Just to be sure.
---
If you are part of a guild, loot rules are rarely posted at the start of each raid in a chat channel in WoW. If this was a pug group with the loot rules posted in another channel, then he could have an argument. But by raiding with the guild, it is assumed that he agrees with the loot rules they have laid out, even if it‚Äôs in discord.
---
Gratz, I elso enjoyed this the last 100 times someone did this.
---
Sorry to be sarcastic, but we really have seen this exact thing done alot.
---
And on a platform that doesn‚Äôt have Karma!
---
Actually, with TitanPanel there is an option to adjust the scale of your UI in there as well, and with it you can have Profiles for each character.
---
You probably applied the poisons incorrectly.
---
Fact: you cannot aimed shot continuously throughout a fight due to mana
---
Fact: Strikers has more AP and the hit can also translate into more ap/crit by freeing you up to use better gear in slots otherwise taken by hit gear.
---
Fact: quick shots allows 4 autos between each aimed shot.
---
Are people leaving due to Chinese censorship?
---
Pro tip: You can keybind the markings. At the very least bind Skull, Cross, and Square.
---
entire identity? it's just a guild name
---
Fair enough, I officially endorse Ench as not a waste of time
---
Assumed this was a pug. If it‚Äôs his guild, then he fucked up.
---
Honestly that‚Äôs the best way to play!
---
The countless information websites about every damn game out has taken s lot of the magic out of them.
---
Or you have an offtank drag her away so she's out of range of the emperor
---
Is there any possibility, at all, of gearing for PvP at 60 without raiding? I don't like raiding. I've only done it in BFA, and although I did get the Ahead of the Curve achievement, I realised it's just not for me. It didn't help that I had rather toxic guildmates, but I've just never been big on it. I've only ever liked the PvP aspect of the game. In vanilla, I never levelled a character to 60, I just stopped them at 49, geared them up and did battlegrounds. At 60, I consider raids to just be the middle man in getting to do what I actually want, so can you cut out the middle man and not get destroyed?
---
Damn I'll make one too eventually. Played a 19 rogue in tbc, had 80% dodge chance!
---
Or maybe because almost every pvp server is horde heavy.
---
Didn't think of it that way. Makes sense if they thought that.
---
It grants an amount of rage.
---
What's the horde / alliance balance like?
---
LW done right can net you a ton of money as you level. LW made goods vendor for insanely higher than the straight skins. I've netted a ton of gold leveling my LW up and even have had stretches of buying cheap skins off AH turning into items and vendoring for profit. I'm level 38 with over 100g already. Not to mention if you put in some time for tribal LW you can make bank off of some recipes like Hide of the Wild, and devilsaur sets. Anyone who says LW is a waste of time just hasn't done it right
---
She went afk and the feign death timed out so she died for real
---
If you read what the potion does you‚Äôll get an answer pretty damn quick
---
That's where I am at too. I think my above idea would be great BUT I do not think I have the same confidence I had in Blizzard as I did years ago sadly. I think it will either be amazing or it will be horrible. There is no middle. Just one of the two. My hope is it will be amazing but with how Blizzard has been heading lately I think its sadly going to not turn out too well. 
---
Please Blizzard...surprise me and be amazing.
---
Great, action! I can't wait for the PvP to start.
---
Realized this when I played Lights Hope private server, the game is just great, probs in my top 3 of all time.
---
Thought this was going to be a good video without techno music but then it happened. Down voted.
---
No CHANGES
---
&gt; Curious to how you are getting the average value of items
---
scanning every 3-4 hours.
---
&gt; Does the TSM desktop app work for classic now for auto scanning auction house values?
---
no clue
---
sorry :(
---
Soon they will be in the Barrens chat
---
Yea that‚Äôs right behind world first pace so extremely fast.
---
?? Current WoW has this x10, you're just too oblivious and blinded by "muh classic" to realize it.
---
Yeah honestly Blizzard made WoW great.But there is no Blizzard anymore only Activision Blizzard devil in its place .They couldn't pay me enough to play retail lol... And have no wish or desire to play any of their "new " games,they are all hot garbage
---
If you can jump servers, try Earthfury. It‚Äôs one of the most balanced servers out there.
---
The benefit of a premade emote is it makes it seem like the player specifically targeted you, where the one you post is known for being generic and you can‚Äôt target someone with it so people don‚Äôt think it was specific for them
---
What are you channeling? Whirlwind is an instant one hit attack. This isn‚Äôt bladestorm lol
---
Curse of doom and kite op
---
What level is it again?
---
Looking at it from that angle I almost feel like the entire scenario is kind of a planned out "gotcha" by the leadership of that guild.
---
Instead of "so you're looking for people to waste their time farming for your item."
---
Think of it as "I am farming ONLY to get this item, if you want to join me for something other than that item then you are more than welcome." 
---
No one is forcing anyone to do anything here. They are up front and saying at the beginning of the dungeon that they are reserving something... My guild has been reserving the flask of the titans as we have ran UBRS 50+ times and still havent gotten it... when we have to fill spots with pugs we make sure everyone knows that the flask is ours and the only reason we are running. 
---
We have plenty of people that need the Reed and other BiS gear in there we dont claim, but if there is a conflict of interest. then it is better that we part ways.
---
They recruited me, as in asked me to join, around level 50
---
What server is that?
---
There's also still a chance that Blizzard is plain wrong about the difficulty being the same. They've shown they're more than capable of making large mistakes and not owning up to it, after all.
---
Haha. Don‚Äôt even bother leveling an alt in P2.
---
Awesome job with that.
---
Like I said you probably weren't even aware this was a thing that ACTUALLY occurred, because you have only one mindset to playing this game.
---
Hell you  might even consider it cheating when some guild manages to farm up enough to get 2-3 TF's the first night BWL is realesed.
---
I hope it is because mods are removing it, i do not want streamers putting this shit on this sub , fuck streamers, to busy playing myself,
---
Seal of command scales with spell power, the only melee stat it scales with is weapon top end damage. Seal of command does far more damage throughout leveling compared to seal of righteousness. You can notice it massively when you get the spell as it procs so often. Comparing consecration to seal of command in a questing environment is just plain stupid. Retribution is superior to holy for leveling arguing otherwise is pointless lol
---
They can. Heard you can donate some stuff
---
&gt; Sounds like you suck and need other people 
---
That's my point, yes. Use - any - resource - available.
---
&gt; to win 
---
It's not about winning. It's about killing your character and any other Horde that stumbles in our path.
---
You obviously didn't bother reading until the end of the comment you replied to.
---
Don't bother telling me that you were just adding additional information or other nonsense; I won't believe you anyway.
---
It gives you rage, i mean, you could have very easily just googled it, you would have gotten your answer in seconds.
---
leaf is just one part, you have to get the sinew from Onyxia too.
---
And shoulders...
---
I had Taintpuncher and it got me a 24h ban during classics release
---
Probably in much fewer number than it may seem and if they are they'll probably be back in short order.
---
I'm sure a few people have hard-left but emphasis on few. It's just something for people to virtue signal about so a lot of people are jumping on the opportunity.
---
It says increases rage by xy, if it would say it grants xy rage i wouldn't have a question but the text of the potion is not self-explanatory.
---
It can be bis for stamina sets though.  You want it for any fc set.
---
funny im starting my 19 twink hunter. What server are you on?
---
&gt; It fills in a lot of functionality the AH should have, but doesnt. 
---
It also doesn't add any superfluous features. It's exactly what an AH addon for regular people should be.
---
Duvados here.  Grats on the MH!
---
How can you not pay attention to how much damage your pet is doing? Do you not have a threat meter installed? How do you know when you are about to pull aggro from your pet?
---
Im a noob hunter but when I downloaded a threat meter I realized I was playing Hunter so terribly lol, was just guessing if I could keep autoing or not.
---
0/10. Not taken with a potato. Try harder.
---
And ive never been 1v1d by an ally, its always packs.
---
Maybe Mankirk was abusive and she feigned death. Then she was a Beaten ‚ÄúCorpse‚Äù
---
Yeah but icky alliance colors keeps me from buying it
---
I would omit CoA all together and get Immolate and Corruption started sooner. Pretty much send pet &gt; Immo &gt; Corruption &gt; Wand and you should be mowing thru em without much trouble.
---
You can look into Dive's Drain Tank Guide, which is a whole build designed to help you level up a Warlock as efficiently as possible.
---
on each hit (i believe this is referring to incoming hit - not you hitting something else), there is a 5% chance that the incoming damage will be reduced by 25.
---
You can muck around with the gamma/brightness/contrast settings in wow to give night a true night feel. i honestly love it with 80 contrast 48 brightness. but try out what works for you!
---
I believe it's fair to pay the guy for his hard work, plus I'm a huge fan of his Castlevania speedruns. You do you, though.
---
Can't wait to raid IF and blow all of you up :)
---
I'm on the total opposite side of the spectrum as you are and even I know that Soupa is very empathetic to the situation in HK and does not deserve the criticisms you are so rudely throwing his way. Grow up and try to be a better representation of the emotional cancel culture crowd than you are now, it's pathetic.
---
Alli are worse
---
You're blinded to the real issues here, kinda sad tbh.
---
Fuck blizzard. Save Hong Kong
---
I'm leaning that way.  I figure at level 60 i can pretty much re-level herbalism within a couple hours of just working my way up through the progression zones with zero cost.  Much cheaper than leveling enchanting and then spending the money to level alchemy too.
---
But prot doesn't offer a different playstyle, that's the issue. 1h+ shield arms/fury is still going to do better than 1h+shield prot, whether you're tanking or soloing.
---
‚ÄúIf I wanted to read, I‚Äôd go to school.‚Äù
---
dildobaggins lmao
---
So if I have 310 Swords, what hit% should I aim for?
---
Im a tank and my mate is a healer, my mate is usally party leader but i spam general and lookingforgroup too. We usually get like 10 DPS'ers that wanna join. Folks with the weird names just lose it. 
---
Unless theyre the exact class we want ofcourse. Its just a hassle.
---
Takes me back...
---
Westfall is pretty close. Lots of endless trolling, spam, arguing over if it's DM or not. It's as close as we get.
---
Damn, thanks for the correction
---
This has a lot of great info [GitHub](https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table)
---
I would go into detail but I can't until a bit later tonight.
---
You forgot "their best thing in years was the thing they did 15 years ago"
---
Assuming you're elemental...as a tank I love bringing along an ele shaman. WF totem of course is great. All the cleanse totems. Tremor totem. AOE/cleave is pretty great. Had an ele shaman in BRD and fire nova totem destroyed aoe room. 
---
Seems their only problem is lack of mana efficiency. In dungeons it's not a real problem, just slows down trash some. I can see though on long boss fights them having real issues.
---
edit. Forgot one other thing I've had and ele shaman do that helped. Drop Tranquil Air far enough back that it didn't hit me as the tank but allowed other ranged dps to go HAAM.
---
Imagine living in a world where a huge segment of the population wants your life to fail because of the dangly bits you enjoy. Wait a minute...
---
I used BigWigs the first week and swapped to DBM because Wrath of Ragnaros timer was not implemented. Didn't really pay attention to timers on any of the other fights, but there's a few things I watch for now with DBM.
---
As for "inaccuracies" with the timers, my guess is that you are confused about how bosses work in classic. Most of the bosses do not have hard timers - they have CD's on abilities like a player and logic to use them. When the timer tells you the ability is coming, it really just means the ability is available for use, but it may get delayed by animations or other abilities being used.
---
You can easily keep your mh up to date with only quest rewards as a sword rogue.
---
Dang, ty for the correction
---
The proc is on melee hit, but the equip effect is +20 attack power. Sadly there are literally no other useful trinkets for a hunter that are better than HoJ currently for your second trinket slot, with Blackhand's Breadth as your other trinket.
---
I hope the mods ban this guy. I don't care about streamers but this is spam at this point.
---
Not really, no. You need ranks to get PvP gear, and you will need raid gear to compete for those ranks. You are at a massive disadvantage not raiding.
---
Offer transfer to where? In eu eng almost all pvp servers are horde dominated. Do you want to transfer thousand of horde players to the single one server where the balance is 50-50 currently?
---
Thanks. When you say the MC is applied, do you mean cancelled?
---
You missed the biggest factor: RAP (including bonus rap) scales to weapon speed.
---
I started to write out a reply,  then I realized that it's not worth it off we can't agree on basic axioms.   It is well known and should widely be considered fact that vanilla Horde racials are vastly superior to the alliance racials.
---
That's not to say alliance racials are useless... they just aren't as good.
---
They did, we did, it was reported. You guys are getting bent at the wrong people.
---
Prot Paladin can aoelevel and/or reckoning so that's not really a good comparison. Plenty of people who level as protadin. It's great.
---
Prot warrior on the other hand, is just kinda bad.
---
I know you're asking someone else, but just out of curiosity, I use my auto-run on mouse wheel down.  Up is for my starting rotation ability, down is to send the pet.
---
If "a few bored 60s" can "ruin a zone", your faction is weak and its members deserve to die.
---
There was a Horde raid trying to lock down MC entrance earlier this week.
---
...and then there were none.
---
I have read this, and I agree it isn't Newsworthy. Not only would other groups of individuals using a similar name be forced to change (such as Catholic Boys, Jew Boys, African Boys or White Boys) but most people probably reported them because they thought they were insulting Gay People. Even in 2019 there are people online that use the term "Gay" as an insult. As far as the reportee's are concerned the Guild could've been filled with people named XXxmemelord69xXX trying to be edgy.

On a more serious note, I genuinely don't understand how a ~20% chance per hit to do an additional ~20 damage when each hit is hitting for anywhere from 50-100 is "50% damage, basic math" and I would genuinely love to see an example of this happening.
---
I feel that. Tanking definitely requires far more responsibility and mental energy than dps. Dps can be mostly asleep and you should be fine.
---
One of the reasons my warrior has sat at 57 is I just cant be bothered to tank for pugs sometimes.
---
&gt; Fact: you cannot aimed shot continuously throughout a fight due to mana
---
Not a fact.
---
&gt; Fact: Strikers has more AP and the hit can also translate into more ap/crit by freeing you up to use better gear in slots otherwise taken by hit gear.
---
This is true, but is that gear making up for all the lost damage from elsewhere?
---
&gt; Fact: quick shots allows 4 autos between each aimed shot.
---
But they hit for substantially less.
---
This is a pretty gross attitude.
---
Honestly I spam holy nova if I can get away with it in packs. if I have a mage especially in dungeons.Shit does so much, and *generates no threat*. Holy Novas only downside is its steep mana cost.
---
with rank 5-6 nova I can cast like 8 novas before oom. Not including deranking, but for it healing for slightly less renew ticks for, for 5 players. While dealing slightly comparable metrics to AE from mages for dps if the mobs die quick enough. When running MC with my guild. If im in a melee group for the imp trash. I can spam Holy Nova, and usually end up 7-10th. in dps on those pulls, while my healing is very consistent. My spec is [\[21/25/5\]](https://www.bobo-talents.com/?c=priest&amp;t=vhvMvNvOvPvrvvvqvwvxvgvCvDvtvivfvEvFvGvHvuvQv0v1v2v3vUv9BfC8C9C_C.C~wgvRwXwYvXv5v6vTv_v.v~v-wlwPwQwRwS) \- Where when u get a last hit, your spirit doubles, and scales into your spell dmg/healing too.
---
The biggest forgotten mechanic that people dont remember/mention enough is. It generates no threat. If you cast a 3s prayer of healing, to then draw a ton of threat. What good is it? If you renew your tank before they pull, it makes things harder for them. or preshielding a warrior- lol. However you can legit just spam holy nova as soon as you can, and everything is all fine. Mages cant even do that with AE. Their biggest downside with AE is that it does draw aggro (alot), and in a sense, they cant get away just standing optimally ontop of the whole pack, they need to be ready to nova/blink/iceblock. Holy Nova, you can optimally position where it hits every mob, and have no fear that youll pull aggro off at all.
---
I'm not creative in the slightest so i just hit the random name thing until it gives me something that sounds good. I've gotten some really good ones out of it where people just say like the first four letters
---
And then was doing RFC on an alt this morning and one of the party members was trying to tell the group leader to invite a rogue named Roll.
---
Yep, Roll. Roll on what? No, its the guy's name, he still didn't seem to get it and passed lead.
---
I‚Äôm sure your memory of a game mechanic 15 years ago is flawless
---
Running boar, he's running charge, highest rank bite, and highest rank growl. Do you use highest rank pet abilities?
---
425 for Winterspring and Silithus......
---
Anything decent to catch there?
---
Exactly. The Horde are all scum. Kill on sight.
---
Its true tho
---
I'm just glad I am not the only one.

Nobody cares bud

There is minimalizing your bars.. and then there is being a detriment to yourself.

---
What do I do if there's both a priest and a medic? 2 medics? No casters, just 4 melee mobs? 
---
Tanks should just mark IMO.
---
It works the same way that a mana or health potion works.
---
I think reservations are best left to guild/friend groups only.
---
That aside, people are too obsessed with BiS in a version of the game that doesn't need them.
---
As long as everything is clearly communicated, up front, it's a not a huge deal. It sucks when you're LFG and only see groups reserving stuff you want but better than being told after traveling...
---
I'm a troll hunter I got outofammomon
---
Do you think this would include all damage types and sources? Like spells and aoe effects?
---
If you're gunning for Darn rep then respect. But consider cleaning house for quests at Wetlands and Duskwood. It may be ridiculous and seemingly time consuming but you may possibly squeeze two levels from both zones. The part that makes it time consuming is both zones being relatively horde free.
---
I‚Äôd loved doing this on my undead rogue.  His name is Methmouth and he just needed a fix
---
&gt; simple math
---
And yet you're fucking it up.
---
&gt; I even gave a lowball number
---
That's about 50% higher than it should be, and again your were ignoring a ton of mana gain.
---
&gt; Very minor interaction that does not invalidate anything I've said.
---
It does, especially adding your aimed shot mana calculations it shows you don't even understand the very basics of how hunters function.

The only thing repeated reports do is bubble the case to the top of a queue for a GM, especially if it‚Äôs offensive. They will review it and determine if it violates policy, then force a name change. Suspensions aren‚Äôt usually common unless the name is particularly vile. 
---
I think you can just rename it back to the name that got you reported, but then you‚Äôre going to get your ass whooped if it‚Äôs reported again.
---
Fair point, but your title was very confusingly worded considering what you were really trying to say ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
This isn't a group who all agreed to harass Gay Boys with false reports. The guild was reported over time independently by different people. If enough people come to the same conclusion separately that your guild name is offensive, it should be changed. It doesn't even matter what the name is. This is the only way for blizzard to maintain a position of neutrality. They are not making a ruling based on the morality of homosexuality. It is never even part of the question.
---
This is a vanilla post BG-mechanic with legion amount of guard and respawn timer.

Here i thought Boromir got really salty and envious about some boe epic that dropped that Frodo won. So that's when the group ditched him and he got ganked by orcs.
---
That‚Äôs showbiz baby
---
correct answer. I don't care enough to bother reporting people. 
---
But, if you name your character something you know violates the rules, you shouldn't bitch about it, when it gets reported.

Then why is there a thread on the bug forums with this exact issue that has hundreds of upvotes?

If in doubt, always go with the Rule of Cool.
---
Well first, you dont need to keep the entire party above 70% like you say in the comments. You‚Äôre just wasting your mana. Focus on keeping the tank alive, maybe drop a HOT on some of the dps, and only heal the rest of the party if they actually are in danger of dying. I know instinct is to keep everyone at 100%, but thats just not reasonable. Remember, if your tank dies because you run out of mana, the whole party wipes, if a dps dies you can revive him once combat is over.
---
&gt; Define competitive then.
---
Trying to be the best.
---
Basically if they tap between pulls, they have until you sit down to catch a heal. Otherwise.. they shoulda brought food.
---
Focus on yourself and the tank as the priority.
---
Firm believer you can tap without being obnoxious. It just takes time for players to recognize when the appropriate times are..

If it truly violates naming, sure. But a lot of the time guy just get trolls who wanna get you 24 hour banned or force name changed to make you mad, as well as squelch you because they didn't like something you said. The system needs a full revamp to prevent trolls from abusing it. I'm not sure who OP is in the screenshot thought.
---
Above 305 you don't get any hit benefits from weaponskill(except in the extreme case of +15, you get 1%). The yellowhit cap which is for your abilities is 6%, which you almost can't get below if you tried, however getting more hit is always a benefit due to duelwield getting an extra +19 miss chance. That means you actual hitcap is 25%, which you will never ever hit, just see hit like any other stat, useful but not mandatory. I believe the value for a rogue is about 0.8crit = 1% hit.

Definitely. Guides are cool and all but there was WAY too much information and bias being thrown around before Classic, and even now in many cases.

Every person who responds to me says the same shit‚Äî-they quote one liners and make accusations without actually saying anything of value. Maybe enlighten me or tell me WHY I‚Äôm blinded.

Based on this -  [https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Proc](https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Proc) \- it would seem that anything that has to calculate hit and successfully lands on the person who is wearing the armor would have a chance to cause the proc to fire.

From the "because HoJ is among the later preBiS items one should acquire as weapons have a greater effect on ones performance".

We might've had some bad drop luck, but I'm a warrior with cloudkeepers, lionheart, onslaught etc. My rogue pal has two pieces t1, we both sport crusader Dal'rends.I yet have to see the savage, my buddy does not have his HoJ after 50runs. In this dungeon I have on averge 400-500 DPS. You can imagine how we cleave through the dungeon with windfury.

This easily averages 20g if you nuke your way from arena to tavern in 12mins. The backpack alone is worth 25g (you obviously cant sell it, however you still dont have to buy one for 25g or you can sell a travellers, you found).

But it's not hard to do, and it's much much faster than tanking as prot spec. Healers Mana is a resource and it should be used. It's very inefficient to tank in prot spec while healer has 90% mana

Weak Auras is what you want, takes a bit of setting up but I am sure you can find someone who has made one for a Rogue, just google Rogue Weak Aura and you can import their config.

Type /macro to bring up the macro window. Then select New. Choose an icon and give a name for your macro. Then copy/paste the 3 bottom lines on my previous post. Click save and drag the icon for your macro to your stealth hot bar.

Do this for each opener but change the lines that have Cheap Shot to the name of the skill you are using.
---
No taunt = no swapping with other¬†tanks¬†on enemies and bosses,  which makes them not an option for many bosses and raids. It's similar to how in theory you could do it if every single person watches their threat to a decimal point, but that won't be possible in reality. Some bosses reset their aggro, no taunt means you can't quickly take aggro. 
---
Also, to lower DPS threat they need to lower their DPS heavily for no taunt tanks. Longer fight is more damage (as well as the fact shaman tanks are shit), more healing so more mana used, etcetera.
---
Yes you can theory craft 36 druid 4 mage raids (since you need 4 mages for MC), and it could work, but in reality it won't come together. People are being hyperbolic, but the fact is you can't tank without a taunt. Well you can, but prepare for wipes.
---
I mean then we'd have people googling value when an item drops, and it'd be chaos. It's better to just let everyone roll for it.
---
Go back and watch molten core guides from 2006 lmao ..... Good luck understanding them ... Don't get mad cause nobody agrees with your stupid post ... Is hard for you to understand that it was knowledge of the game dumbass

WeakAura's.    It won't give you that, out of the box.  YOu have to configure it.  But WeakAuras can absolutely do this for you.

---
The only time you'd want to avoid hit is if you have 6pc shadowcraft. Aside from that it's real good. And 6pc shadowcraft does more dps than t1, so it's bis for all of phases 1 and 2. But the margin is very small, like 5-6 theoretical dps.
---
you got tons of downvotes but i didnt know i could do this, thanks for posting it! :D
---
Says the warlock. Of course you want 1/1
---
Thanks, that's a huge help!
---
One of my favourite tricks to get a peel + heal is coil a mob for the hp into a fear and turn it off/on with R1 CoE/CoE so they don't run into other mobs.
---
Best locks are resourceful locks.
---
Having priest shields helps, but its definitely possible; i did it at 57 or so in bad gear, more stam would make it easier.
---
But this does not change the fact that private servers were better in not having lag with a large amount of players in the same area. Sure, maybe the Blizzard server can hold a lot of player across their various shards. But have all in one the Blizzard server is 10 times worse than any private server.
---
Lol at people complaining about ganking it's called world of warcraft not world of friendship

I don‚Äôt like it. In fact, to combat this, as a tank I‚Äôll start a group and reserve things I don‚Äôt need. Or if a group needs a tank I‚Äôll demand a ridiculous reserve.

Based on swing timer add on, judgment doesn‚Äôt reset swing timer so judge/re-seal at will depending on remaining mana. Mana will be your biggest limit to pushing buttons and not just auto attacking

Also yes, slow speed = more damage from Seal of Right. Things can be more complex when you get seal of command but slow is still viable.

I thought something was off when we had a group trying to raid STV and the guards were just NON - STOP! Every time we killed one, it felt like 2 took their place!

Lashers: AOE farming nonelite mobs in DME.
---
Jump runs: You jump at the start to skip a bunch of trash and the ability to get the key, allowing you to quickly get to the bosses that drop your loot. It can either be done as a full group, or 2(or 3) manned for gold typically as a fury warrior+healer.

If he has the +100 health on his 8 stam goggles isn't the hat worse?

I thought it was 10hp/stam so he's sitting at +180 to the hat's 150. Plus he has some spirit.
---
100% agreed, that's awesome.
---
Yes, I was talking about the time from pressing the button til it fires, not from it begins firing til it fires.
---
If what he claimed would happen was the case then the aimed shot would hit 3 seconds after the auto was started, not 3 seconds after it finishes.

I automatically get suspicious when I dont see the +55 healing enchantment. It's like, ur gonna slip into shadow form and argue vampiric embrace is all we need, arent you you lil fucker.

It can happen either way. I've had 5 forced name changes since I started playing in vanilla. 2 times they changed it for me, 3 times I got to change it myself. Also, each time came with an escalating ban from the game.
---
Right click reporting can be abused to kick people out of BGs by having the whole team and guilds spam report a player. It has historically been a problem in retail, and people were worried about it being added because of how the ladder ranking system works in classic. This can be done to kick bad players on your team or overgeared players on the other team; but people are/were worried it will be abused to get the automod to auto temp ban high-ranked competition in the R14 warlord race. It's pointless to bring it up right now like OP is doing, since BGs aren't even in the game.
---
This was how it worked in private servers. Last I heard the 308 just wasn't true in real Classic anymore.
---
How is getting killed 5 times on your way to BRD an example of camping? But sure pal.
---
A bit late to the party but get an ornate spyglass and you dont have to wait at all. Quickest way for basically every class.

had the same thing happen to me yesterday i was aoe farming at the western plague lands and this other mage always pulled mobs into my aoe so that i would die but i went ahead and helped him out with blizzards and frost nova and the dude apologized and helped me later. gotta kill em with kindness

Lol in under 90 minutes. Why the fuck would I wanna do that?

I would definitely get these crafted, don‚Äôt buy them out right. you can save yourself a lot of the gold.

---
Your toon is still in the game even if you close, think of it like lagging/dcing. You'll log back in at the graveyard.

What‚Äôs silly about it? I‚Äôm not defending Blizzard or China, I‚Äôm questioning why all of a sudden people are upset with with Blizzard when shit like this is the daily norm.

I'm actually surprised you pulled this off as balance.
---
Couldn't you report players with a ticket in vanilla? I don't understand what is so fundamentally different
---
Exactly, I've had great experiences in dungeons and I think it's because of all the utility shamans have.  I cant think of one run I've had that disbanded because we couldnt get through fights.  Utility is really lost on people who just see DPS meters and think "omg if we had another mage, we'd have an extra 5% dps and this would be ez pz" not realizing all the buffs, off heals, etc that a shaman brings.

Which lead to them not trying to resist and call higher level players, which mean no organic world pvp. If you want organized pvp, go retail. Classic is a lot about player agency : no dailies/emissaries/missions etc. A lot of the content is organic player interaction because the environement has no obvious most optimal path toward your goal (gear/gold/etc...).         
---
If you remove the inconvenience from pvp, you remove organic world pvp battle.
---
And that implies what exactly? That Blizzard Entertainment has any remaining autonomy? They were stripped of a CEO, had founders forced out, and the Activision CEO Bobby Kotick became the CEO of Activision-Blizzard. And the kicker is that expansion into China is what sealed the deal on the merger for him.
---
Activision stripped away Blizzard's autonomy the same way China wants to strip away Hong Kong's. It's no wonder they were fine with their heavy handed treatment of Blizzchung.
---
Anti mage

Sure as long as they get their servers up to date by Phase 2 I'm ok with it. If they still fuck around by phase 2 I'll probably lay my subscription on ice.
---
After all they are still taking the amount of money from me for a working server not for a disfunctional one.
---
I'm honestly happy for new hunters in classic because they'll never have to experience that horror.
---
Level 42, I have yet to get attacked by someone whose level I can actually see. If you're going to wpvp why don't you want to go for fair fights? Where's the satisfaction in killing someone who has no chance against you? I don't get upset when it happens, I just don't understand it and never will. It's like cheating at a board game. Okay, you won, but there was no glory in it.
---
That's ridiculous, anyone with two brain cells knows underleveled healers don't really matter in dungeons.
---
Couldn't people just mass report with tickets before?
---
When people don't like what you're saying they don't actually attack what you said anymore, they just try to dismiss you and make sure other know you're automatically wrong because they decided with no evidence that you are upset, even though you were just having a normal conversation. This way no one has to put thought into anything and they can just downvote who ever has put the other down the most successfully.
---
People like him have ruined discussion on this website and on social media with how simple they are.
---
This is an alliance starting zone. You either gotta have some balls or be high lvl to get there was horde. There is a dungeon you can run later on.
---
Undead place is definitely cool but it's obviously suppose to be morbid. If you want brighter scenery catch the zeppelin and head to the barrens/stonetalon mountains/thousand needles.
---
Depends on the class, some crafting professions can actually get you some BiS BoP stuff, like robes of the archmage, so they are more valuable.
---
I'd say that druids are top tier for wpvp and excellent flag carrots in wsg.  If a druid doesn't want to fight you there's not much you can do to make them.  
---
As for 1v1s, they're weak to spriests and locks, but engineering+blacksmithing helps a ton.
---
Neither of those work, because in form you use the "claws" weapon which will not have the on hit and doesn't care about weapon speed (or skill - notice how staves, daggers, etc. does not rank while in form). Weapon stuff that does work is +stats, armor, and anything that starts with "Equip:" (best example I can think of is the offhand Totem of Infliction, or mainhands like Ardent Custodian).
---
DON'T TRY ARGUE
---
Honestly, if I could offer advice - just go for it.  It's what I did as soon as I hit 60, I was tempted to go resto and just be heal bitch to get my gear but I didnt want to.  People in general (unless maybe you're on Faerlina) arent nearly as elitist as they seem on reddit.

Cool thanks for the reply.  I love the Undead place tho! All dark and spooky how I like it :) Wow has some beautiful places I can't wait to explore it all :P
---
rhok does not drop 50% of the time, you have to get the sinew from onyxia as well
---
Rune of the Guard Captain if you're horde. But that is nuts otherwise. Makes sense as to why I don't see hunters roll on HOJ
---
Long answer: no
---
Math checks out. Statistics do not.
---
Oh you want CC? I think MC(or endgame raids in general) would definitely help scratch that itch. Some of these bosses have like 8 adds with them that have to be dealt with separately. Though if your referring specially to 5-man dungeons it can feel like a bit of a shame. Though with alot of the end game dungeons i'm definitely seeing LOS pulls and Focus targeting everywhere. Heck could even argue in UBRS you do need to CC some mobs if you only have one Tank.
---
Always assume someone's intent because you're totally always right!

Teremus is also my favorite dev
---
I do want Blizzard to try and make this better. 
---
I think free server transfers based on population imbalance would be good. Basically a really wide open transfer service where you can pretty much go from anywhere to anywhere (with a cooldown), but ONLY if you are leaving the dominant faction and joining the weaker faction. This system should also allow faction transfer as well. So for example I could swap factions on my current server if I was tired of finding nobody to fight. 
---
It isn't #nochanges, but I don't think stuff like this really falls under that umbrella since it is not a gameplay change, just trying to get healthier populations.
---
No I‚Äôm not at all lol I was just curious for more end game,
---
In general I've had good experiences as a tank but you do run into a few bad apples. I had a healer who would refuse to drink after pulls and sit around 1/3 mana while other mana users would be drinking up to full. I asked if he could drink before doing the next big pull and I got the response, "play your class and i'll play mine". He went oom the next pull and we nearly wiped.
---
Sounds like you never left the phallic stage of Freuds development map.
---
You could.  Streamers did not like how simple right clicking was.  Tipsout and Asmongold, among others, had it high up on their list of problems that Classic would have.
---
completely unsurprising given the kind of people you run into on this sub sometimes.
---
3g 14s 16c would better.
---
It would both be OMG! and someone who gets it would realize that is pi.
---
Looks like it‚Äôs cheaply made straight from the Chinese overlords
---
Lava damage is pretty painful but healing through the lava damage is very possible.
---
The masses may not always recognize the utility of certain classes/specs but some people do. And there are so many utilities brought by all classes.
---
hes pissed
---
I am Horde so had no idea that there wasn't a better option, I stand corrected
---
Fury warriors can tank just fine in dungeons pre 60.
---
That is why i started on a new normal server. I was at a pvp server and got a hunter to lvl 30. Being in STV or any other places where horde would come by, i would get ganked by some high lvl. I dont have that much time so when i play wow i wanna lvl, not use all my time hiding or being dead from 3-4 horde killing me. Where is the fun in that?
---
That goes for everyone but the tank, too.
---
You can get a whole UI overhaul and get elvui classic it has a countdown built in and a ton of other things.
---
Leatrix Maps (opting to use the default map over Leatrix Maps is just... weird... and Mapster is so basic and devoid of features compared to Leatrix - use Leatrix Maps for a while and you'll find it impossible to go back to the default map)
---
Leatrix Plus (does a million useful things, some of them really powerful and ALL of them completely optional)
---
Bartender (I have a BT profile setup for each CLASS so when I make a new warrior, mage, hunter, whatever, I just choose the BT profile for that class and I'm all set... Dominos uses less resources but I dunno, always preferred to use BT).
---
Don't really need anything else tbh!  Addon updates and conflicts are no problem for me!
---
I haven't seen a que yet, server Noggenfogger. 
---
It did take my 2 hours to clean my old razer keyboard key my key though in preparation for classic :)
---
As rogue you can vanish, blind or stun lock the mob that's on you.
---
Ret/feral/enh are relatively tanky and can heal themselves.
---
Warriors will do even more dps with a mob on them and they can always put on a shield if needed.
---
Well, this is not and overreaction. Organized world pvp pre-honor is effectively not happening organically.
---
Look at the polls regarding atheists running for office.
---
My guildmate made the argument that its official name is "The Deadmines" and deadmines is 1 word, so you only need to abbreviate it with 1 letter "D". So for short we should call it "The D". "LFG for The D", or "Looking for healer for The D", etc.
---
Lightning Reflexes is a waste. If you're being targeted in dungeons you're doing something wrong.
---
Improved Gouge and Sinister Strike are a better use of points.
---
Marking mobs is damn important.  I now always ask my groups who is going to be marking...makes such a difference.
---
Ill be honest. I don't find these names funny. :(
---
How much does the lack of decent spell hit gear affect caster DPS versus melee DPS? I was browsing wowhead and it looks like phase 1 had very little spell hit pieces. Does that help contribute to Warriors and Rogues being better early on?
---
Wart did not have 1 guard per player spawn system.
---
Well thats one way to get shadow banned real quick
---
Lol only horde can play shaman.
---
Its never too late. I picked up a [Razer Orbweaver](https://www.amazon.com/RAZER-ORBWEAVER-CHROMA-Progammable-Adjustable/dp/B013P0HW7K) a couple of weeks into Classic and haven't looked back. There was a few days of retraining/slowness but now I am faster than ever. Controlling all of my movement with just my thumb and freeing up 4 fingers for just spells has been amazing!
---
from where? lol. it looks like i can still transfer from Bigglesworth, but Earthfury is the only available east coast PVP server it'll let me (supposedly, won't know for sure until I get home)
---
Unless if you get Obsidian edged blade(which isn't bad, but not nearly as good as rag weapons), yeah you will have to get 9%. However that's honestly not much, with prebis/raid gear you will often find yourself struggling to actually find replacements for all the amazing hit gear.
---
It took mage 4 casts to do more damage than you with 9 casts.
---
You also set a condition how much mana you need while a mage does not care about this.
---
Please explain more how inferior you are and how much harder you have to work to do less damage.
---
I wouldn't mind taking an ele shaman to an aoe group but if I want to maximize my AOE then a shaman isn't comming.
---
why would I vanish instead of feint? 
---
this is horrible advice just BTW everyone lol 
---
this guy literally is saying to just die instead of using a 25 energy spell with no reagent cost...
---
just use feint lol
---
Can Bladestorm on Ravager proc the weapon's enchantment, like Fiery Blaze Enchantment?

Like Apple?

My literal WoW family eventually all drifted away from original game too. After playing with same core people for literally years, we were great friends.
---
In every relationship, if at least one person doesnt make an effort to maintain the relationship, it will slowly fade. Not forgotten, but just grows out with time.
---
If you value your relathionship with these likely great people, be the one that trys to step up!
---
I added all my friends to Steam and other social stuff, and we'd play many other, less time intensive games together off and on. Starcraft, Killing Floor, Left 4 Dead, Jackbox Party games.
---
Not ever one will be possible, but it feels nice to still keep in touch with the old crew when able!
---
Glad you guys had a funtime back together for reunion! GL in WoW. Id be your friend on Alliance - Herod :)

&gt;No offense but you're looking pathetic at this point.

Not an argument.

&gt;incorrect opinions

According to someone with the reading level of a grade schooler and who is incapable of arguing any of his opinions.

I've truly been cut deep.

/r/randommodestmouse
---
Tell them to stand in melee so they get hit my chain heal, or tell them to fuk off
---
They aoe like crazy, healer tries to save them, mage ice blocks, healer eats all aggro.
---
Because that group could be sitting there waiting for a tank for the next 30 minutes. Meanwhile that warrior could slap on a shield, tank the dungeon, and reserve whatever DPS item they wanted. DPS in the group don‚Äôt like a tank reserving the dps item? Go find another tank.
---
There are literally *hordes* of them!
---
Ah ok.. that‚Äôs actually good advice , thanks for letting me know
---
Im okay with the mundanity of fishing but the thing for me is that you have to be focused at the same time. Often time i misclick the bobber or click slide it and get a failure. Games like stardew or animal crossing have it perfect. You just click a button at the action time
---
i hope they start banning everyone who is spamming this stuff in a gaming sub
---
Then why would they wait until the honor system is in place to do it?
---
Well damn. If you said period it must be over.
---
Saying what amounts to ‚Äúit just makes sense that the company chose to enforce an open ended rule to silence a person trying to bring further global awareness to human rights violations‚Äù is, indeed, equivalent to the complacent that allows these tragic things to happen.

How come u got the loot?
---
We run 5 druids with \~75 minute MC time rn
---
Does alliance even have non-shimmering flats quests in 1K?
---
Your first time seeling a Zepplin? wow that's wild
---
Yeah thats the idea, I'll try and keep the mob thats aggroed to me within melee range of the tank. I'll just orbit around him till he takes notice.
---
But I see a lot of times people complain that I'm moving around too much, when in reality if I didn't move to signal the tank I probably would have died because they wouldn't have used taunt.
---
Yeah my guild noticed this too. We use the tiny threat plug in on details. Works much better.

Step 1, find a class trainer

Step 2, respec

I just need to know what is inside the other instance portals of Stormwind that are locked behind impassible gates.

WHY HAVE SHINY INSTANCE PORTALS THAT WE NEVER ACCESS!!!!

It‚Äôs fun when it isn‚Äôt you mean.

2v1. Becomes 2v5. Becomes 19v5 becomes 40v40.    
---
That‚Äôs the fun shit.
---
World PvP doesn't mean 1v1 only, sounds like you can't handle it. FWIW, I have rarely been ganked by only 1 horde, and it's not worth my time/reagents wasting cooldowns as a combat dagger rogue to fight a frost mage. I just sit still and deprive them the fight they want.
---
Oh, I've done that countless times back in the day. I got reported all the time.
---
"Clownboy".... Rofl
---
If I'm getting ganked in an obviously unfair fight, I just stand still and don't give them any enjoyment out of it
---
I seriously doubt it
---
He didn't say full leather, he said rolling on a leather piece. I just laid out 2 pieces of leather that are good for tanking, one is BiS for this phase. As we find out in the thread, the item he lost out on that inspired this post was Truestrike, again a decent alternative to other pieces if you aren't at hit cap, which is your absolute number 1 priority as a tank.
---
So yeah, if you dump a tank wearing ACLG because he's a tank wearing a leather piece, then no, you don't know what you're talking about.
---
Shadow banned LOL Oh nooooooo I have to make a new account....pleassssse nooooooo
---
Good tanks lol
---
I would start playing again just to read the chat
---
I still use this on my rogue in BGs, AV always gets one or two
---
This is a good idea, but how would a faction change work in practice? How do you determine the finished quests, faction reputation, discovered zones, etc. for the new character?
---
What is your strategy for leveling crafting professions? How do you figure out what to make to get the best level ups?
---
Every guide I see essentially assumes you have infinite money and can spend a whole stack of mats on a green recipe to gain one level. I don't have the resources to be doing that and most of my current orange recipes for engie are big ticket items.
---
Sure you do, there is a spot against the wall to the left of the stairs leading to him.  If you tank him with his shoulder in the wall under the lip, the adds never aggro and you can essentially one-on-one him after the initial adds die.
---
I learned this is a youtube video about duo-ing the boss with a druid/rogue, if I weren't at work I'd link it.  Hope thats enough info to find it if you're interested.
---
Wow snarky for a dude who can't figure out how to get gold as a mage, eh?
---
Thank you :)
---
8/11/32 is, imo, the strongest PvP spec for Druids of all specs. And it's strong *enough" to work in all major raid environments, including Naxx, in all but the most hardcore raid guilds. You just need to bring more consumables.
---
I've heard good things, its been accurate so far for you?
---
The coolest thing about a druid it seems is running into travel from without stopping.
---
I suspect that the bladestorm counts as additional attacks, similar to the warrior sword talent, in which case it would...
---
I hope they start banning retards such as yourself for being a Chinese shill.
---
Damn paladins are so OP.
---
Protesting Blizzard for freedom of speech on a platform like reddit is the fucking greatest thing of 2019.
---
Thanks. Sounds promising. Do you suggest doing this camp right at 29 before I start the quests there in 1000 needles?
---
Your insight is astounding
---
Or the #1 value that I was referencing FREEDOM OF SPEECH except when it effect corporate profits and prevents idiots from buying toys.
---
He seems like the type of person who relates a little too much
---
Some people WANT TO PLAY DPS, even if it means they wait longer.
---
This is a VIDEO GAME, people play how they want to in order to enjoy themselves. Stop trying to force people to play how you want them to.
---
It is.  Seriously, nobody except the outrage squad gives a fuck.
---
 I will try that.
---
Stuns and interrupts are probably the most important part of pvp. A 1/3 chance to resist makes any strategy that relies on a stun non viable. It doesn't matter if it fails 2/3 of the time because it makes stuns so unreliable that I might as well not waste the cool down. It essentially makes them immune to a core part of pvp because even attempting a stun is a mistake.
---
There isn't one. They just congregate at the Goldshire Inn for "RP time".
---
You can bind the interact on mouseover keybind to any key this allows you to not use right click all the time. This keybind option is located under targeting -&gt; interact with mouseover.
---
Pretty empty. I went there when I was a noob (2 months ago lol) and said ‚Äúhello horde trash‚Äù and nobody else said anything other than a couple LFG messages. I was like ‚Äúdamn, barrens chat was hyped up for nothing‚Äù. I then realized that you can‚Äôt talk to the Horde...
---
Yeah, same thing, I just sit down.
---
I had a Tauren hunter that had over 2000 health with a fort buff on. He had fishing hat, boots, full enchants etc.
---
Getting hit cap is the absolute number 1 priority as tank. If you aren't hit capped then truestrike are better than might. 
---
Ideally you get your hit elsewhere, but if you had to walk into a raid right now and you are under hitcap by 2% and you have might and truestrike, then you put on truestrike.
---
There you go, there's a situation where it's better.
---
She ends up a DK on the DK-only mini-naxx.

You seem to think that I am not in support of people who are gay. Wrong. I dont give a shit what people do actually, as long as it doesnt interfere with my day. That being said, having to explain to cousins why there is a man dressed with a dildo to his forward walking down the street, then there is a problem. Go be gay and happy, but express your sexuality like the rest of us
---
I don't know if that's true, and it doesn't really matter to be honest. I'm just glad to be around to challenge hateful bigots like you so that decent people reading this sub know they aren't alone :)

I can't get to any of the sites from work but if you do a quick google for WoW Classic realm populations or WoW Classic census you should get some hits

i fight back when its withing my lvl range, seeing multiple ?? alli bitches ganking me doesnt upset me, its part of the game. im just saying its a bitchmove and a fight without honour i personally wouldnt pick. yall get upset just because i call people out for their lil dicks
---
&gt;MC used to be very hard 14 years ago,
---
This is patently false, in 1.12 it was dead easy.
---
Also if you mean what took so long at the start? We didn't have the benefit of 1.12 talents or item reworks or 16 debuff slots simple as that.
---
We also shouldn‚Äôt have weather. They added because it‚Äôs obvious it‚Äôll make the game better for most players.
---
Yay!
---
I never paid attention to see if dismounting cause gcd. If it does, then yes that would be the issue. Thank you!
---
Gnome Lock here. Was once farming elementals beside a Human Lock the exact same level as me. For about half an hour every horde that came by immediately killed me (probably ganked 3/5 times) I whispered the human Lock if he‚Äôd been ganked at all. He responded ‚Äúno they‚Äôre weirdly leaving me alone‚Äù. Moral of the story is Horde are all racists against Gnomes
---
In my experience, if I start my own group and say I can tank, dps, or heal but I want a rezzing class, I have no problem forming a quick group and end up tanking 80% of the time, and dps or healing evenly the other 20%
---
Bandages are dirt cheap next to Mana Biscuits, and you're speeding the dungeon up by using them. A faster dungeon means you've got more farming time so, by extension, those bandages are actually *saving* you money instead of costing you it.
---
Thank you for your post - good to see some more neutral view points around here.
---
Looking for someone actually went through the process for guidance !
---
That‚Äôs fine, but it‚Äôs not smart. Tanking and forming your own groups will get you that dps gear much quicker than trying to find a group as DPS.
---
I‚Äôm not sure why people are so surprised by this since there no actual threat counter in classic and it purely more an estimate then exact.
---
If the game is only old 3d models and new code why do the exact same quest bugs from vanilla all still exist in Classic?
---
Don‚Äôt forget Manapause!
---
Gandalf: Priest or Mage. He‚Äôs a wizard but he‚Äôs also basically a ‚Äúlow-level angel‚Äù
---
Aragorn: I would say Survival Hunter but this is Classic. But then again Classic Hunters can still use melee weapons. Either that or Warrior or even maybe Paladin. 
---
Boromir: Paladin. He‚Äôs noble and feels righteous in his duty. 
---
Legolas: Hunter. You have my bow. 
---
Gimli: Warrior. And my axe!
---
Frodo: Rogue. Sneaks into Mordor, can turn invisible. 
---
Sam: Rogue maybe. Can Gnomes be Paladins? I feel like he could fit that because he‚Äôs noble. 
---
Merry and Pippin: Arms Warrior and Protection Warrior.
---
The undead one is cool because it goes from dark and spooky to more brighter lit areas like hillsbrad. Really paints a picture of the battlefield line - what zones the undead scourge control and what zones humans control. Silver pine is one of my favorite places in the game but hillsbrad can be a harder than thousand needles with ganking on a pvp server.
---
Actually if I recall correctly WSG at its release was 21-30 and so on, and AB opened at 30+ initially. There were no teens brackets until later, then moving the brackets to 10-19, 20-29, etc at later patches.
---
Not that this is relevant or even necessary to state, I could be completely wrong, but you‚Äôve just ignited my curiosity to study up on more nostalgia deets from Classic I thought I‚Äôd remembered
---
Idk, my hubby is playing a shaman and doing pretty well as a shaman tank. Granted we're both pretty low level atm.
---
Ez scam, nice 20 silver
---
raggy doesn't care about your threat. It's a first come first serve principle and sometimes with the tank swaps it be can be very buggy.
---
Don't blame this on the threat addon, blame this on the boss mechanics instead. Or better yet, try to find an example of threat meters being wrong outside of rag :)
---
You don‚Äôt got a hot but toss me a downranked spell now and then.   Tell locks that tap to 5% life you get one small heal that‚Äôs it.  
---
A Druid or a pries would have tossed them a hot.  
---
I would expect locks to sit and drink in dungeons.  Wasting healer mana is not ok.  Still they might tap to use only food to heal them with so talk to them.  
---
A good lock taps slowly normally to not incite panic in healer.  And eat to Regen life.
---
It greatly affects Warlock specifically, who have no way to talent for (relevant) Spell Hit. Mages are in the lucky position to get 6% via Talents, Shadow Priests can spec into it too. It's one of the reasons (among various % based talents) that Warlocks scale so well with gear - they finally get to hit things.
---
Oh man this is the stuff of my dreams. I‚Äôd absolutely love a guild that banded together to help eachother make twinks. Twink characters are my absolutely favourite part of Vanilla.
---
Don‚Äôt suppose you‚Äôre on Nethergarde Keep are you? üò≠
---
Why don't you just ban this user?  He has multiple comments removed in this thread alone.
---
Keeping your toon at a certain level with the best gear possible to be amazing at BGs or PVPs (such as lvl 19, so you‚Äôre destroying the 10-19 bracket).
---
Only super hardcore raiding guilds will expect certain roles from certain classes. If you find yourself in that situation and its not what you want find a new guild. There is a guild out there somewhere that will take a dps shaman. Play what you think is fun.
---
Problem is everyone else stops queueing for BGs while leveling. Despite what twinks claim nobody else is having fun besides them in BGs.
---
Start attacking - thunk....thunk....thunk....
---
Hit Slice &amp; Dice - thunk..thunk..thunk..
---
Then Blade Flurry (with 2 mobs next to each other) - thunkthunkthunkthunk
---
Kirtonos is heavily Horde skewed.
---
We told you to play a rp server, you didn‚Äôt listen...
---
Tanks will find a way to complain no matter what man :)
---
I agree.  Punishment was necessary.  However, it was extremely heavy-handed punishment.
---
In my mind they can still salvage this, all then need to do is overturn the ban/firings.  I would say a fine would have been appropriate punishment, but at this point they've waited too long and perhaps should consider pardoning them entirely.  They can still make it right, and their unwillingness to do so in the face of so much backlash is what really bothers me, because they are proving their critics right.
---
And I‚Äôm explaining that your problem isn‚Äôt the tank it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre aoeing and pulling aggro in a situation where you should be focus targeting. If you run from a tank you aren‚Äôt going to get it pulled off of you since he can‚Äôt abandon the rest of the mobs and chase you down so you do what you can to survive, toss on a shield or whatever. It‚Äôs not about killing everything the fastest if you can‚Äôt control your threat you deal with the consequences.
---
A bad tank won‚Äôt be able to hold threat on anything, a good tank will work through the priority targets, a great tank will make allowances for stupid mistakes of others. There aren‚Äôt many great tanks, but there aren‚Äôt many great DPSErs either.
---
&gt;"FUCK YOU AND YOUR FUN."
---
Basically what I got from that.
---
He's not saying "maybe people want DPS gear." He's saying maybe people want to play dps. As in they don't want to tank. As in they don't have fun tanking.
---
Games are meant to be played. For fun.
---
*pushes up glasses* 
---
Actually if you're dual wield fury, you should be toggling heroic strike on / off in between mainhand swings. Make sure the heroic strike is toggled on during your offhand swing, toggle it off before your main hand connects.
---
This way you don't waste rage if you're rage starved.
---
What this does is make your Offhand hits count as yellow hits. the chance to miss an OH hit while Heroic strike is toggled goes down roughly 6-8%.
---
Giving "Best in Slot" gear and enchants to low levels that they normally wouldn't otherwise have access to.
---
It's most commonly used in WoW terms for getting a level 19 character fully decked out to run in Battlegrounds.  In these cases, all the best possible gear (blues in most slots) and top enchants in each slot.
---
Do the quests, but there's not many so that's why the grind. 28-32 or so sucks
---
You do essentially what the guide says, just as you can. They're generally optimal and the cheapest paths. It just takes that much shit to get it there. If you can't afford it all, then that's that. That's just what it costs to get a maxed out prof.
---
The big ticket items generally have a huge diversity of reagents which usually make them less cost effective for leveling. Grinding out yellow/green items might be more cost effective just because you can do it with extremely common mats along with a vendor item like flux or something.
---
You're fine at 40 as the healer of zf. I healed an entire BRD run as a 51 pally the other day. My tank was skeptical at first but we only wiped like twice the entire dungeon. Keep doin you booboo
---
Go to the Guildmaster or whatever it's called, and buy one from the Tabard vendor there for 1g.
---
It'll be blank unless you have a guild that has created a Tabard.
---
There are some Tabards available from Reputation grinds with certain factions and once BGs come out, you'll be able to buy a Tabard with a Horde sigil on it.
---
In raids yes.
---
Only warrior and arguably druid has the luxery of being dual role.
---
Building a lvl 19 character for pvp. 
---
You are the highest lvl for that bracket and you also have many rare items with stats favourable to pvp over pve. 
---
Basically building an over powered pvp character.
---
No you are not locked to a role, but you may find it more difficult to be accepted in a weaker role.
---
You're being ignorant. Every server is different, and the grass isn't always greener. Alliance on Skeram get completely shit on, to the point where the pop went from 70/30 to 85/15 since the census. The camping at times can be unbearable. On the other hand, I am a sensible person and can see *your* side of it, where there's a shit ton of Horde and nobody to fight. 
---
That's a mature conversation, not dismissing what everyone else says because u haven't experienced it.
---
Meh people just need some drama in their boring lives, let them be part of the mob, gives them a sense of purpose in life.
---
STV is pretty fire on my server. Boycotting Blizzard now with Hong Kong, and STV is the reason that makes it the hardest.

Shit move

I wish I was....
---
Vanilla Druid was very different from even BC where HoTs became the focus and HT was kinda left behind.  It‚Äôs all about HT, Rejuvenation when things get hairy, and then the ‚Äúoh shit‚Äù Regrowth spam when death is near.
---
Alright go away then.
---
This happens because even if the tank resists the knockback the threat reduction component kicks in anyway, best to take one or two knockbacks as warriors and then just intercept back in, rogues can vanish, feral druids just take the L
---
It's all situationally dependent upon you knowing the group, knowing the healers capabilities.  If you are extremely comfortable with them/the instance, then blaze away.  If you have a curious face pulling shaman who wants to see what's around the corner, and an area with potential adds; then it makes sense to go light on your healing requirements.
---
Could of chugged one and found out. They're not gonna break the bank
---
I found Desolace to be pretty easy.  Granted it's a bit slow in the water but there was no one there and they re-spawned nice and quick (never needed to pause, just kept up the circuit).
---
Toxic gamer culture has been the toughest part about returning to Classic. It's so disheartening to me how many young people are still growing up with this.
---
There are more appropriate places for you to have this discussion, there doesn‚Äôt need to be a separate thread about this on every single Blizzard-related sub..
---
On Tuesday.
---
DO ARGUE
---
That's because they're not; they're the kind of names that would amuse an immature 12-year-old.   Any name with special characters is an instant comedy killer.
---
I loved doing this in the AH way back when.  Always got at least one sucker get pissy.
---
Right but even if it isn‚Äôt actual intended fog it adds to that element of ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs just past over there where I can‚Äôt see‚Äù.
---
You're right.  But did you read the post you're responding to?
---
There was never meant to be a code of ethics in world PvP, you're trying to impose your rules onto others.
---
Go ask your healer who they prefer to heal?  Prot Tank?  Fury tank?  Arms Tank?  some trash hybrid?
---
Yes, any spec'd warrior can slap a shield on and go to town tanking a dungeon.  Anything less than Prot tank, and you're healer isn't thinking kind thoughts about you!
---
\- Resto Druid here!
---
That‚Äôs going to take a minute, there‚Äôs only one or two horde guilds really large enough on Grob to raid IF and most of their members are still leveling. The rest of the horde is splintered into smaller guilds.
---
Alliance side has two major guilds (Enclave and Clan Battlehammer) that are likely 50% larger than either of the two largest horde guilds and have way more players at 60.
---
I think Horde will get there eventually, but as it currently stands the Alliance always show up with twice as many players and squash the horde attempts. If Horde brings one raid, alliance show up with two. Horde brings two raids, alliance show up with three to four.
---
It may not be intentional, and may just be fervent ‚Äúlet‚Äôs go defend!‚Äù garnering too many players, but there‚Äôs no fun in just getting squashed for 2hrs.
---
In my opinion the Alliance need better moderation in constructing fair defenses - which is what makes for legendary wPvP events - and is that doesn‚Äôt happen I think horde attempts will likely either fizzle out or remain small scale. 
---
Why would I raid Alliance territory with 2 raids of horde players when I know we‚Äôll be met with3+ raids of Alliance and I‚Äôll be corpse running 80% of the time?
---
Maybe raid defense should start with one raid group at a time, and if it falters they bring in a 2nd. Slowly ramp up until the opposition is matched and the victory is earned, not just granted through sheer numbers.
---
For additional perspective, on Grob there are raids of Alliance attacking some horde zone just about every other day. Horde players have become desensitized because when it happens every day, the events lose meaning.
---
My suggestion: horde and alliance leaders collude to hold special wPvP events on say Saturdays, 40v40 or 80v80, hell 160v160 and make it a real spectacle. Half the server would show up to just watch, then likely duke it out on the sidelines.
---
Not saying all wPvP should be this way, just special events to keep the server PvP morale healthy. All other random wPvP is perfectly chill and I love it, but alliance players can‚Äôt raid every day then cry about not having opposition. Not saying you‚Äôre complaining by the way, just in general. 
---
Unfortunately I don‚Äôt have time to counterraid more than once a week, I work 55+ hours and don‚Äôt have time to farm gold+consumables+raid as it is. 
---
I love Classic, love the PvP, love Grobbulus server and all its benefits, hate that I feel like I‚Äôm getting old haha.
---
This old Orc can still raise daggers though, so when you least expect it I‚Äôll bring the fight to you!
---
My phone messes up when I go on this subreddit*
---
Fixed the title for you
---
Play what you want, and how you want, it's a free game and the content is easy enough, but don't be surprised if a certain class/spec combo doesn't perform as well as others. Certain classes esp hybrids usually won't keep up with pure role classes.
---
This happens to me any time internet d/cs, seems like it's a bug in this version of the game where if you suddenly d/c you drop from the FP
---
I don't think it, I know it. You're wearing it on your sleeve, and making no attempts to hide it.
---
Fair enough. I'm used to my cheat-ons
---
What...? The world is teeming with PVP. Maybe it‚Äôs just your server? I haven‚Äôt gone a day without seeing group PVP.
---
Interesting solution.
---
The coolest
---
I'm not the one who downvoted you, but I thought I'd clarify: chain heal has a bounce range of about 12 yards, so casting a chain heal on a warlock will almost never bounce to the tank or melee dps.
---
Diablo: Imortal was never marketed to the fans in the first place. They made that game for the Chinese Market. You can read it here: https://us.battle.net/forums/en/d3/topic/20769548632
---
They never wanted a ClassicWoW but oddly decided to come out with one when all the other big mmos started to come out with their own classic versions. I.e. Lineage 2. After seeing how successful and the competition of other mmos, they finally decided to make ClassicWoW even though they publicly said they wouldnt make and that the fans dont know what they really want.
---
Sorry...but waiting 30+ minutes for a group to form just to do the instance I wanted to do, and have the group fall apart after one run without your item dropping....that‚Äôs not relaxing in anyway. 
---
I really don‚Äôt know why anyone would play this game at max level as some way to relax. It‚Äôs fun, it‚Äôs exciting, it can be challenging, and it can be rewarding. But relaxing? That‚Äôs not how I would describe most end game content.
---
Being the most versatile class it seems as druids have also the most versatile build in the game in HotW/NS. Currently around lvl 30 with my alt, I've been thinking about sticking to this single spec throughout the whole game for multiple purposes - leveling, tanking dungeons,  offtanking raids, pve healing, PvP including WSG FC.
---
 Is there anyone trying to do this and actually making it work? Druids on my server seem to be to focused on their dedicated role, deep into the talent trees and not ever needing on any offspec gear, even when there's no one else to take it.
---
Lastly, PvP set looks amazing, having all the stats on almost every piece, I'll be definitely pursuing at least rank 10 to get the blue set. But before that, going into phase 2, what similar pieces of gear should I be looking to get? So far I know only about Tome of Knowledge.
---
&gt; demonic runes
---
Not to burst your bubble but Demonic Runes are BoP.
---
I'm more of a fan of Dildoshaggins myself.
---
I completely failed to inspect any of them. I got a screenshot to share with my guild then I was like... hmmm... maybe reddit would like this.  
---
The weirdest part is they were moving individually and emoting at me individually. Either one really dedicated multiboxer was switching around a bunch of these are all unique players who are doing... let's call it performance art.
---
For Enhancer Shamans just try to get 4/8 D2 set (Boots, Waist, Hands, Chest) and fill up the rest with Leather/Mail gear that provides the most Agility/Int; for Elemental get 8/8 and use standard caster shit for the rest.
---
Unfortunately with professions like Blacksmithing and Engineering, it's a matter of choosing what's easiest to acquire and hope you get level ups.
---
Here is a pro-tip though:  You are always guaranteed a skill up on the first craft after a pattern goes from Orange -&gt; Yellow.  For professions like yours, it's extremely helpful.
---
they are the same as in real life. fair fight or youre fighting without honour like a lil bitch. how often did you get jumped by 3 guys and said afterwards "damn those were some pretty honourable guys"
---
I ran with 31 shadow 20 holy for very long.  
---
Decent enough to cover all grounds it‚Äôs sustainability that suffers but that we got innervate for ...../s
---
Shoot I was running around Elwynn last night and I had two different people send me tells asking me if I needed bags.
---
When Battlegrounds come out in phase 3, they are organized by level brackets. All players level 10-19 play each other, 20-29, and so on.
---
A "twink" is a character optimized for PvP at one of these lower level brackets. Usually that means a character at level 19 or 29 or 39 with a lot of expensive BoE drops and endgame enchants put onto them. Once phase 3 hits, twink items like the Assassin's Blade will sell for hundreds of gold.
---
This is the exact reason you‚Äôre not going to be priority on Benediction
---
Hahaha haha haha hahaha sex and drug number hahahahahahahaha
---
Don't drop tailoring. Bloodvine set requires 300, and will be BiS for mages for a whole phase.

I have a Pandaren shadow priest I named Pezzi because the servers at my favorite Chinese restaurant pronounce Pepsi that way. Lol

---
LF1M TANK PP
---
but the answers you seek will never be found at home
---
How do you have to put in more time as. Feral tank? A few MCPs each week, and even those are almost never mandatory just helpful.
---
Feral Bear is not a meme spec like balance where you need to do extra work to just be passable. It‚Äôs probably a better choice for a more casual player than a Warrior tank is in all honesty.
---
Hell the best guild in the world uses a Bear as a MT and intends to use it as the primary off-tank going into BWL.
---
Give an example where I posted my shitty China statue?
---
Give an example where I praised a company that supports Chinas Government over the American people.....
---
Nope no hypocrisy.
---
What if i took 3 points out of feral instinct and put it toward imp motw or I'm entangling roots?
---
Oh, thats pretty neat. Also a weird thing happened once. Tank pulled anger back up the stairs to the tunnel we came from, like people often do. But then the boss somehow evaded and ran back while the rest of his goons stayed and got killed. Would be very handy for solo attempts if it was possible to reproduce.
---
Because most (if not all) of the computer parts you're using to play other games were made in China and with that you're directly supporting low paying wages and bad working conditions.
---
And anyone can just pop a screenshot like that for karma then hit cancel at the end. Not to mention we're talking on a site that has received a considerable investment by a Chinese company not too long ago.
---
There is if you're doing so purely based on conjecture with no research to back it up on an internet forum where research is easily done. IMO at least 
---
SoC works on a PPM (procs per minute) formula, and is only worth using on a weapon 3.5 speed or slower, otherwise SoR is better.
---
As a tank I'll sometimes ignore the skull deliberately on big pulls while I build up agro on the other mobs. 
---
I'd rather a DPS face tanks one mob and I tank the rest than me tank the skull but have the other 6 mobs attack the healer because I couldn't build up enough agro on them and the skull.
---
There's a mile of difference between *can* and *will.*
---
Hey druid friends. Thinking of leveling a druid as an alt to my 60 hunter. How is healing 5 mans? Do you think that the lack of a true rez screws you up a lot? Or do you just use a spec that lets you tank 5 mans and roll on healer gear?
---
Yes but only in l337sp3ak
---
Thanks it took me 4 tries. First two was getting used to the clunkiness. 3rd time was going great until a mage said "I need help" in discord and the druid helping me thought it was me asking for help and caused me to fail with like 20 seconds left. I was not happy with the mage because he knew  what I was doing and was talking nonstop through it.
---
&gt; It‚Äôs clearly a joke fellas.
---
Whenever you think you need to say that realize that it's a bad joke ;)
---
Found the china shill. You're a fucking moron.
---
Anathema and Benediction are the same weapon, it has a clicky 30min CD to switch between the two.
---
use stealth to help get around mobs or other people without being seen
---
This is only somewhat true. Only the top guilds that are pushing the content will care about specific classes/roles. 
---
Your average guild will do just fine with a dps Shaman.
---
&gt; your problem isn‚Äôt the tank it‚Äôs that you‚Äôre aoeing and pulling aggro in a situation where you should be focus targeting.
---
Not every scenario calls for all dps to single target.
---
If we're in a dungeon its objectively better to cleave and aoe down mobs to clear faster to get more loots faster and reset the instance faster...etc
---
&gt;If you run from a tank you aren‚Äôt going to get it pulled off of you since he can‚Äôt abandon the rest of the mobs and chase you down
---
I'm not running away, I'm orbiting the tank.
---
No. If I want the reed from Jed, and a group advertises the run with that reserved, I find another one. Very simple. It's only an issue if you let someone else take advantage of you.
---
Tell me, how much dps does your highest dps deal on Magmadar?
---
How do you plan to tank ebonroc? How do you deal with Annihilators and other mobs that drop aggro and typically require a taunt?
---
If your answer is that dps have to throttle, then its a garbage strategy and you are hindering your raid group.
---
What is your fastest MC clear as a shaman tank?
---
Ur not funny
---
 Now that offical legacy realms exsist, private servers have lost the justification for thier exsistince
---
The problem with Druid and duality of the class (my alt was a feral Druid in 2007) is that once you drop form to perform other tasks your dps drops and you get questioned to why?? 
---
Some ppl don‚Äôt see the full picture.  I do love Druids and there ability to do everything.  And we had a great Druid in our guild who was 21 restro 30 feral and was a real jack of all traits guy.  I wish I learned how he did it.....
---
The HotW/NS build looks something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0ZxgoscMdxVxf0xo) with some flex options.    
---
- besides feral instinct, you don't need to put any more points in the second row, you can put them elsewhere in the feral tree according to your preference    
---
- the 2 points in improved enrage in the feral tree aren't necessary, put one in insect swarm instead if you want to pvp, you can put the other one anywhere else, subtlety is usually the choice    
---
- some people like to go 4/5 in HotW and put 1 point in nature's grasp for pvp    
---
I personally used [this] (https://classicdb.ch/?talent#0zLVcoZEzMscbdtV0o) until I hit 60 and just tanked dungeons instead of healing as this is still really good for solo grinding and dungeon tanking. This is by no means the optimal or best way to do it, there's a lot of play style options when speccing druid
---
Too much effort for dps I agree, but not for heal or tank.
---
I spam demo in some edge cases, like the tabard guys after Herod dies. It lets me control them until the AoE starts, and the guys have so little hit points that they die before i lose them. But for the most part yeah i just put it up to mitigate damage, or for weak initial threat.
---
I also intended to have this game as something I love and cherish and could always fall back on for the next few years.
---
I unsubbed the day I heard about this. Solidarity for Hong Kong.
---
Why so serious? I‚Äôm pretty sure you are overestimating the impact a few kills here and there makes. Besides I never said I was camping people (which is a waste of time). I just don‚Äôt get the salt, although I do get salty IN THE MOMENT it happens to me. But never enough to make a fucking post about it. Just accept it as a part of the game. Killing servers my ass.
---
This is a Classic WoW sub.  I'll stay.  _You_ go.
---
Oh crap was the druid right there and he walked into the area?? Damn discord guildies, gotta get into a private one for something like that. And he kept talking üòë. 
---
Is it basically just spam flash heal and cure disease? And what did you use for targetting? Just click the npcs im guessing?
---
**Striker's Mark**Item Level 69Ranged Bow 69 - 129 Damage Speed 2.50 (39.60 damage per second)
---
the average damage between 69 and 129 is 99 damage.
---
99 damage every 2.50 seconds means that 99/2.5 = 39.6 damage per second. This is where you get the 39.6 damage per second number written on the bow.
---
If you cast aimed shot, your shot time is now every 3 seconds. Your new dps is 99/3 = 33 damage per second. So, because your weapon is too fast, you lost 6.6 damage per second. This is what is known as "clipping". This is why hunters shouldn't take fast weapons.  
---
Do you understand yet?
---
Same as any pvp server, only 95% less asshats and 100% less stupid fucking names.
---
RP naming policy alone is the only reason I play on those realms. Shit like "Lolusuck" and "Craigslist" or fucking "Twinkforlyfe" are forced-changed names.
---
shh it's the only reason im healing atm, don't let the cat out of the bag
---
I suspect this will be gone soon, but pretty funny :D
---
Mods, why are you guys suckling on Xi's tits?
---
it wasnt an automatic change. blizzard did a "thorough investigation" and changed it anyway. but it was changed back now so we got justice
---
We 2-man farmed Arena+Angerforge with a friend (Elemental Shaman + Bear Druid) with this skip + also skipping the packs after this skip with Lesser Invisibility Potions so we essentially just killed the bosses and did no trash.
---
Once u get 9% your capped and yes it‚Äôs better to go for agi, crit, etc. The additional hit past hit cap won‚Äôt have any effect so it‚Äôs basically a waste
---
Look outside right now and find out
---
Who the fuck cares about honor? Once again, you're injecting your opinion into what world PvP is.
---
Do you also have weapon expertise raising your weapon skill 5 points? Then you only need 1% hit after accounting for talents.
---

This is the best value in components you can get for 500‚Ç¨ or ~440¬£ right now.

You can play Wow on highest settings with a lot over 120+fps (if needed). The system is also very good for newer e-Sport titles and even games like ACO or SOTR (with lower graphics though). If I had to go for a budget PC that's also pre-built, I would definetly go for this one.

---
Have you actually looked at talents in prot tree? There's hardly anything in there that makes prot tankier than fury or arms. 
---
10% extra armor, extra charge of shield block and last stand are nice, but make hardly any difference in 5 mans
---
Ya my group wanted to do this yesterday and we had a couple of deaths and it definitely took longer to do this shortcut
---
thanks for the response!
---
Lockpicking can be lucrative.  It's not going to get you 1,000 gold an hour but it's got some good perks.
---
Pickpocketing not only gets you money but saves you money too (junkboxes from mobs can have poison reagents in 'em).  
---
The poison that makes people run slow (crippling?) is situationally awesome.  
---
Never leave home without Flash Powder.
---
Distract is so damn useful.
---
Just get shadowcraft/cadaverous pieces. Easy to obtain.
---
Be bifactional to enjoy ALL of the game you pay $15 a month for!
---
Samwise was an orc, change my mind
---
I don't expect a moron such as yourself to understand something so simple. Not surprised that a China sympathizer would be as dumb as you are honestly. Never have children please, don't want to poison society with you raising more dumbass kids.
---
No amount of salt is going to stop Balance being a worthless spec
---
Group yes. Raids ? only at blackrock.  
---
      
---
https://imgur.com/a/TeeWcAX
---
There are 2 hit caps in this game. Yellow hit cap and white hitcap. Yellow hitcap is for abilities like sinister strike and eviscerate, and white hits are for auto attacks.
---
For a 2hander, those two caps are the same, however with duelwielding, you get an extra 19% miss penalty, which means a duelwielding class never really gets properly white capped.
---
The yellow hitcap for bosses with 300 weaponskill is 9%, but with 305 weaponskill which rogues automatically get from talents, it is only 6%(more weapon skill after this does not give you extra hit). So with 5% from talents you only need 1% from gear to make sure your abilities do damage. However it is still a nice benefit to get hit to increase your auto attack and poison damage. In my last raid, 58% of my damage came from white hits so getting a 1% increase from that is quite nice.
---
How does it look like a month later? Is it still balanced ?
---
You will get it force-changed. Same for guild names. Some big guilds already dissolved because they had stupid fucking violation names.
---
When *x* people report you, it's automated.
---
https://us.battle.net/support/en/article/135764
---
The magic number is 3.5 second swing time.  Faster = SoR, slower = SoC
---
You should be running arms/fury for leveling which is just fine for tanking. 
---
for packs:
---
Charge =&gt; sweeping strikes =&gt; berserker stance =&gt; bloodrage =&gt; whirlwind + cleave 
---
for bosses just sunder/revenge in defensive stance.
---
SAME
---
God forbid somebody enjoys the mechanics of playing a warrior, eh? Besides, it's not like Fury is literally the best DPS class until Naxx or anything.
---
Why is it necessary for you to push your idea of how people should play this game? You still operate under the idea that what this person wants is DPS gear, but *they literally just want to play a dps warrior.* That's not smart or dumb. That's just how they want to play.
---
- posts random picture with an utter absence of context
---
- gets trolled for posting picture with no context
---
- gets butthurt at being trolled for consciously posting with absence of context.
---
We need to teach everyone to assist the tank at the start of the pull.  Just follow the tanks initial target, thats the one getting the first sunder or maul.  I'm a bear so aoe threat has been pretty solid, but its only solid when all the mobs attack me at least a few secs.  I love marking a skull then a non skull immediately aggros a dps.  If it runs to heal, i'll pick it up, a dps though I just let them deal with it.  By the time I run over, pick it up, then the other 2 mobs peeled onto the other dps cause I caused 0 threat to them while chasing that runner.  Its a vicious cycle.  If dps want a smooth pull, let me have demo roar up, with about 3 tabbed swipes then you're free to do whatever.  Sometimes i'll open a pull with only an auto attack to build rage for a swipe and I see blizzard go off lol.
---
That juice cleanse, though... Lose weight the Forsaken way!
---
Because of the idea that Gnomer is a waste of time, I've been having trouble getting a group to go. The pants from the quest and the MCP (even without on-use) would be a huge upgrade for me even now (limited play time). I wonder if the bosses are soloable at my level? (I'm pretty sure I read that you can MC the final boss with the engi trinket and push all the buttons.)
---
Checked OPs comment history, the dude is telling people to kill themselves. Get fucking help OP
---
Yeah and they took his prize money and fired the casters.

What a joke.

Only mount that fits a T3 Rogue, colour matching spot on, not to mention the eye glow (:
---
Mistakes were definitely not made.
---
Prices for most things will go up, especially materials for DM recipes and warlock/pally mounts.
---
More gold is entering the economy, this causes inflation.
---
The majority of players are approaching 60, this increases demand.
---
The reduction in layers is lowering the supply of most things.
---
who cares about honour? alright lil bitch hahah
---
Kicked the can down the road due to selective outrage. It will be renamed again after the next 100 reports.
---
I'd replace %t with "you", since that's how most emotes display to their target
---
This is false information please stop spreading it. The yellow hitcap is not the same as the white hitcap. Duelwielding adds a 19% miss chance to autoattacks so getting hit still gives a massive boost to your dps.
---
I have a very simple method of dealing with people pulling that shouldn't...if you pull it I will absolutely let you tank it and tell the healer not to heal dps. After you die I will taunt it and me and the rest of the group will kill the thing you pulled. I generally don't have to say anything at all. Simply do this about 2 or 3 times and that person will either stop being stupid or they will leave and we can replace them with a less stupid person.

Don't expect too much during a fight but you are welcome to mana tap afterwards and receive heals.
---
What goes uncontested? You seem to have taken this moral high ground while not saying anything of substance. You've made personal attacks at me and claim im a hateful bigot with zero evidence. Just because i believe all people should play by the same rules, you claim im a bigot.

This. In a group, all melee should be behind the mob that's targeting the tank

It's only b/c enough people havent' reported him. Force name-changes happen constantly.

Pickpocket all humanoids when questing. Not only does this give you extra money, but occasionally rare loot and lockboxes that you can pick to raise your Lockpicking skill. Use Distract to make them turn their back to you, then pickpocket and follow with your Stealth opener (i.e. Ambush with dagger, Garrote or Cheap Shot with sword). In fact, go into Stealth and use Distract all the time when leveling to get your Stealth opener in on as many fights as possible.
---
If you do a lot of solo questing, don't underestimate Spirit on gear. It increases your out of combat health regeneration which allows you to move from mob to mob faster without waiting long for HP. There are a lot of +Agi +Spi leather items out there that are perfect for this.
---
One more tip: Start saving for your mount ASAP.
---
shut up bitch

Your thread is literally removed, and you're deleting your comments, there's nothing left to derail but keep getting mad lol

&gt; The backpack alone is worth 25g (you obviously cant sell it, however you still dont have to buy one for 25g or you can sell a travellers, you found).

That's not "20g/hr".

---
On the subject of buff overriding... I play a Druid that does NOT have the talent for increased Mark of the Wild and had a Druid friend that DOES have the talent. Even when they're lower level than me, using a lower ranked version of Mark that still does significantly less buffing with the talent than my untalented one, it would always tell me that a more powerful spell was on the people we'd buff.
---
Really boring, Rejuv is like 50-75% of your healing output, depending on your level compared to the dungeon 
---
Can‚Äôt say the lack of a proper rez has had any real impact so far, but I imagine that‚Äôll become a pain once you hit places like strath
---
What if said persons name starts with special letter? Then what?
---
I believe the Tanaris Quest is abusing mechanics seeing as you don‚Äôt loot the quest item and keep farming pirates as an exploit in sense. I got banned before on a private server doing this for levels and gold before they said I was abusing it.
---
Enchanting and alchemy are the only profs that have a continuous need throughout every content patch.

But yeah as the servers get older, alch and enchanting will be the only profitable profs, with small windows of opportunity for the other crafts when new reputation recipes are released.  The key for tailors/bs/lw is to be ahead of the pack as far as faction rep goes.
---
Engineers can craft good ammo for hunters, but I doubt theyll make too much money from that.
---
Its a tongue in cheek response. The  post I was responding to was being facetious and so am I in a way. Because in China they censor any mention of the Tiananmen square massacre and they come down on people who talk about it.
---
Well it's not secret anymore
---
There's nothing wrong with being prot specced.  You understand the limitations of doing so, and as long as you're successful and having a good time; everyone elses opinion of you matters not-one-bit.  
---
There's three talent trees you can freely dive into for a reason.  There isn't "Fury Tree until 40, then we'll take most of that shit away and here's an arms tree, and at 60 we'll give you part of a protection tree"  It's designed so that you can cherry pick what has value and what doesn't...  for you.
---
I leveled DW Fury on vanilla all the way to 60; damage was consistent, and my highest value asset; rage...  was in ready supply.  People can say it's slower.  I don't give a shit.
---
And in instances, I'm going to discuss my tanking with the healer, and forge an alliance with them.  Anyone who thinks the way I pull, or the way I tank is inefficient, they can go find another group to play with...  if they can find a tank.
---
And there's the rub.  Lots of people want to offer advice on "how to be efficient maximally" and I'll bet not even half of them even play warriors.  They're greedy little loot whores who want to dictate to you how to play your game.
---
And if you think about it like that; you'll see that their attempts at dictating how you play your game really have no real basis.  Because it's how YOU want to do shit.
---
imagine thinking someones wow guild name dictates their entire identity... im not even gay btw
---
Yes, anyone who supports the Chinese government such as some of the commenters on this thread should off themselves.
---
Man I love the Classic Community.
---
Post this in /r/wow and you'll be bombarded by people claiming you're just doing this to hurt noobs as they level. Whereas here theres nothing but encouragement from everyone besides the 3 people at the bottom of the thread.
---
I love seeing people paying attention to gear at lower levels. Thats what makes WoW fun! Excellent job on your twink!
---
The additional hit gives you less chance to miss on white attacks and less glancing blows.
---
This is good for the guys still leveling or re-rolling here, trust me.
---
I found using an addon like fishing buddy made fishing tolerable enough.   You can set it to double click to cast, and turn on one click auto loot.   
---
There is also a feature to have it adjust game sounds when fishing.   This lets me get a nice loud fishing bobber sound only when fishing.
---
Shadow panther has a great website for rogue leveling, crafts, raising, etc.
---
There are other ranged weapons, sure. But they're better suited for the melee classes. You could maybe make a case for the AQ40 gun if you're a dwarf or Soulstring from Naxx, but those are at best sidegrades to the BWL Xbow. So why waste the DKP and take it away from someone who would actually see that item as an upgrade? The most important aspect of a hunter's weapon is its attack speed and it's not a coincidence that the best hunter weapons in each tier of content are the slowest. You should look into the differences between a full vs clipped rotation and its effect on sustained DPS for more information.
---
Go away &lt;pupper pals&gt;
---
Looks like it's time to make myself unpopular.
---
I believe that Blizzard was in a no win situation. They obviously had two options here, to either idly stand by and in their silence grant support to the political views shared by the player in support of rebellion, or to take a stand and shut him down, which in contrast supports China.
---
So what happens if they do nothing? Well, there's a lot of potential here for future statements from Blitzchung and other gamers on controversial political views using Blizzard as a platform. Even if they do nothing in response to this incident they may have to do something similar in the future in a similar incident for a different cause, possibly causing worse backlash since they did not take action here there would then be precedent against taking action in the future with people saying "You didn't stop Blitzchung, why take action now?" There's also a good chance that China will lash out banning all Blizzard products (there's precedent here, as China bans a lot of things for worse reasons), which means a loss of profit. With Activision taking over they have put a lot more resources into mobile gaming, and China is the number one consumer of mobile games. More than likely investors from China will stop supporting Blizzard, which has been a significant source of money for them in the past. Don't forget, this is more than just annual revenue, this is future investors as well. There's also a good chance that near future events like Blizzcon will have protesters at it.
---
Let's look at what happens if they do take action. To start with, they help protect themselves from future similar incidents by setting precedence that such conduct will not be tolerated. China looks favorably on it, which is money in their pocket (they are a company right, not a charity? Pretty sure they're still a company). Then there's the huge backlash, probably more than they anticipated. I think we can all agree that this has turned into a PR nightmare for Blizzard. That backlash is largely fueled by sensationalists though, and when a new story comes along that those people can latch onto the internet will most likely focus on the new threat taking the spotlight off this incident. Sure, there will be people passionate about this, but the vast majority will just move on with their lives in a little while, subscriptions will continue, and the loss will be minor in the end. 
---
Over time the damage will passively fix itself as people forget and move on with their lives. On the other hand, laws have to be actively changed, so if they get banned in China they're just done there unless somebody in the Chinese government takes action to reverse the law that bans Blizzard.
---
Then of coarse there's the moral issue of shutting down Blitzchung. Obviously they have to think about what's right, if for no other reason than their public image. Their main consumers are individuals, not businesses, so they need the populous to think favorably of them. At least enough that people won't just outright boycot them. 
---
Personally I think they went too far with dismissing the two casters that were performing the interview, unless they have proof that those people were in collusion with the statement. Sure, it could be seen that asking Blitzchung about his mask was off topic, and setting him up to make his statement, but I don't think there's any proof that was the intent.
---
Do I think they did the right thing with silencing Blitzchung? Logically, yes I do. It makes the most sense from a business point of view. I think that his point was made, and he has publicity for his political views, probably more than he alone could have accomplished had they not shut him down like this. He had to know going into this that such a statement could have repercussions, and it should have been a calculated risk that he deemed worth it. I am sorry to see that he lost his source of income, and status in his esport of choice; but heartened to see that his cause was brought to the forefront for many that had not seriously considered it.
---
Now if you'll excuse me, I think I'd better go invest in some fire extinguishers for the inevitable flame war that will be unleashed upon me.
---
Stupid question here.. how can you see someons lvl and class in chat like that?

I don't remember that combo working in vanilla. I remember game rules doesn't permit to cast those 2 spells right after other in same macro. I remember we had to cast it by both pressing dedicated judgement and seal buttons.
---
I might be remembering wrong tough... It's been what 13 years ? I don't have any paladin char at WoW Classic servers... can you confirm that this macro works ?
---
Damn, you really need help.
---
I can try that not sure if I can handle all the pulls but maybe I can get a couple lads to help me manage adds.
---
Reiterating what lots of others are saying, but play the way you want. A lot of that stuff is based on top-tier end-game stuff. To me it's like saying someone can't get from City A to City B in a Camry because a Ferrari faster. I'd take an ele/enhance sham who really knows their class over a mage who rolled it "to top them dps charts" but doesn't know how to play.
---
Some people will grief you, a few will be skeptical, but mostly people will be fine with it. &lt;-- my opinion and experience
---
I leveled my 29 twink warrior in BC by hitting the Cenarion NPC by the Org flightmaster. Some level 70 one shotted it and it leveled me to 30. 
---
One of the saddest days in my life :(
---
In retail I always got hit with the Blizz randomized name after a single name change. So far, in classic, my hunter has gone from Fuccboi, to Notfuccboi, to Trolololo, to Darrel with only a 24h and 48h ban. Still get to pick my name.
---
People are gonna be who they are. If you are a genuine and kind person IRL it usually shows in game. Same things if it's a complete fucking asshat.
---
Again, that may be your experience, but not mine. We have Org raids regularly. I‚Äôve seen Tarren Mill, Gromgol and Crossroads get rolled several times as well.
---
Lmao, crazy internet people are the best.
---
Yay! Thank you! 
---
A friend of mine originally from HK saw that I cancelled and she was really touched and happy that I did.

The cancellations mean a lot to people like her.

Once floating Dalaran is in the game again they'll just roll the class up into the cooking profession as a subspecialty.

BGs will be cross-realm FYI. Doesn't change the fact that you need to be on the same server to group.

You know there are some realms with huge faction unbalance? How much time will it take for a 80/20 realm to be able to have a proper town defense? And if it's happening in multiple places around the world since one faction have huge numbers?

You are using complicated math, you have to use basic math.

Quitting one doesn't automatically make you in the clear either, when the core problem is China, not these companies who have relationships with China.

You say it's just an excuse, well I say you're not doing enough if you really truly believe in these principles. The clothes on your back, the technology that you use everyday, the materials your house/car/everything is made out of. All contain components or labor from China.

My step grandpa caught me using a cheat code in a single player star wars game when I was a kid(mind you I had already beaten the game and was just bored) I had to sit through a 4 hour conversation on how cheat codes where made by the devil and his demons, and people ask me why I dont believe in religions.

I have a few different add one that have options to use the color wheel to customize the color of certain things. Unfortunately there is no hex code attached. Is there an addon that can help normalize these

If anything it just fucks up all of their metrics and starts to make them look bad number wise; which investors will see, not fully understand why it happened (even though there's all this media coverage) and then the price will drop at the end of the quarter.

This protest has also made international news, it's pretty big.

While his response is quite uncouth there are a number of issues with ethical consumption as a philosophy. In general there isn‚Äôt enough information or time in a day overall for a person to made ethical decisions on every single thing they consume, so focusing moral efforts and supporting by donating are much more effective and morally feasible imo.

Nothing is better than Carapace Spine Crossbow until you get Rhok.

Nothing is better than Rhok until you get Ashjre‚Äôthul, except the AQ40 gun if you still haven‚Äôt gotten AT by then. 
---
Nothing is better than Ashjre‚Äôthul until you get Soulstring/Nerubian Slavemaker. 
---
You‚Äôd be taking gear from your melees because you were such a loot whore you wanted an item even if it was a downgrade.

You‚Äôd be doing the opposite of contributing to your raid team by not only taking gear from your melees but also downgrading yours.

Hunter

You know what I hate?  Spiders.
---
I'm Leatherworking/Skinning so typically if I can't pickpocket the mob for a bonus I can skin them for a bonus.  
---
But spiders...dude...no pockets and no skin.  Yeah things like Elementals &amp; Demons are the same but they ain't anywhere as common as spiders.  Plus spiders often have a poison debuff that keeps me outta stealth for a while.
---
Spiders, bah, I avoid them at all costs.  Creepy looking fuckers anyway.

Didn't catch that. Sorry.

It's the people who quit wow when it was dying, started playing league of legends or a competitive shooter, and now have come back at relaunch saltier then ever.

And no one is giving up their iPhone. But please folks, continue to pick and choose what to get worked up about insofar as effecting real change wouldn't actually affect you a bit.

Try and stop buying Chinese goods. Just try, I dare you.

Yeah, they sure are taking there sweet time.

Abusing game mechanics to prevent another player from playing is the verbatim definition of griefing in the tou lol, this constant conflation of ganking with griefing is funny, didn‚Äôt really happen back in the day, everyone knew the difference between pvp and griefing, serial griefers were reported until they lost their accts
---
I'll never forget when I was running around Ironforge one time in Vanilla and I saw some lvl 60 female human warrior jumping around outside the bank with the name **Vaginasaurus** lmao
---
I whispered the person and was like "lol love the name but how did you make it to 60 without getting reported?" and they responded with "I didn't.  I've had this name for like 4 hours, someone reported my original name and I'm pissed because there was nothing wrong with it"
---
Maybe they're still on tanking 101?
---
Retail wow
---
Happens to all of us ;-)
---
Ok, so let‚Äôs say you have, for easy numbers, 30 dps. If they were all equally as efficient as the other they would each do 3.33% of the damage on a boss. Let‚Äôs say you bring a dps in a ‚Äúmeme‚Äù spec. Even if they are doing like 75% as much damage as everyone else that‚Äôs still 2.5% of all damage on the boss. That means the fight will take 0.91% longer, or literally seconds longer. Would you want an entire raid of ‚Äúmeme‚Äù specs? Absolutely not, but it‚Äôs not like bring 3-4 because they are your friends is going to drastically affect the encounter.  
---
Now, if you are pushing content and struggling then that few dps MAY be the difference between success and failure, but other than that there are just so ma y people that it hardly makes a difference. Bring a ref paladin or go with 39 people? Might as well bring the ref.
---
This is neither. This is a news article with input from Blizzard employees.
---
In Seattle? All they‚Äôre going to see is grey
---
What‚Äôs the extra line that does this?
---
I mean, I get where that‚Äôs coming from but investment wise, China brings in waaaay more than they‚Äôre losing.  The real solution will be the US government stepping in like they just did with adobe.  Then acti-blizz will be in deep.

Get out of our subreddit you sheep. Go repost another china meme.

I'm enjoying tanking so far, just not the AoE spam. I like the old-school skull-cross-moon method, and it doesn't feel any slower to me. I guess times change, and that's fine, it just kills my enjoyment a fair bit.
---
My man its literally sunny-ish in Seattle right now
---
Hunter probably.  Best solo leveling class, no buffs/utility that people would be asking for, and gear isnt a big deal while leveling so you wont have to run that many dungeons.
---
I'm a hunter and sometimes I wish it had more to enable social interactions.
---
Yeah while leveling I don't tend to mess with others trying to level but once I'm max hell yeah I plan on going for some max Ally after all it's a pvp realm

If you don‚Äôt think selectively nuking lowbies crossing the bridge at Redridge Mountains then disappearing back into stealth until they all start jumping off the bridge and trying to swim across instead is hilarious, then I don‚Äôt know what to say. 
---
The best part about classic/vanilla is lowbies can gang up and beat a much higher level character. Also, when phase 2 comes, it will be extremely punishing to grief like this so we gotta get it out of our systems now *shrug*
---
No, they didn‚Äôt lie. Yes, you can still do it by abusing the way spell batching works.
---
Maybe try checking configs or reinstall it.

I used DBM vs Shazz last night and it had all the timers including CS.

50g is pretty decent for 34.  Just be frugal and you should be close to 90g by 40.

This sentence is gold, il copy it and paste it everytime i loose a roll.

There is no "annexing". Hong Kong has been a part of China since 1999 and be sure that that is exactly what majority of their population thinks.

Thank you. But nowadays in this internet era, people seems to be either too busy or too emotional for the long rational opinion. People tend to favor either like or dislike, which is sad. "No comment" should be showed as the third opinion.
---
&gt;The employee said that ultimately whether or not Blizzard stands up to China won't make a difference in the long run because the game industry more broadly is relying on revenue from offering its products in China. Change will only matter if it happens on a scale that is bigger than just Activision Blizzard.
---
Classic EPGP if your guild uses EPGP. Everyone needs the add-on.
---
I would not write them off totally, but I do agree they don't have access to the showcase warrior skills at this level, but the meta game is also very different in the 10-19 bracket too. Warriors have charge and hamstring which can dictate the flow of battles and flag running, like mentioned below, with enchants they can do solid damage and take a beating too. Not a sexy as rogues or hunters, but they are a fun project.
---
I think this says more about your other healers.
---
Tangentially related:  
---
I just dinged 40 and only had 23g. Ran SFK about 8 times. Found 3 BoEs, and one of them happened to be The Shadowfang. Sold for 100g, and I had my mount too. Felt good man.      
---
About 34 minutes per run doing a 100% clear. 4g vendor, and about 15 auctions per run.
---
Dungeon resets have been a thing since vanilla, it is in no way an abuse or exploit. You sounds like you have two different issues confused and are bringing out the pitchfork because of your ignorance.
---
No, the above post is accurate. The guard civilian change patch was well after pvp patch was live. You didnt even need to hit a Civilian, if you agroed one at all which you could do just by being close, waves of guards would spawn and it ruined town raiding.
---
Definitely recommend getting improved threat. If you're running with geared dps it's starts to get harder keeping aggro especially if your gear is good so youre not getting much rage.
---
Wow sounds like something someone from China would say.
---
I dream of the day I can get my shadowy mitts on one. I will be passing to every Holy priest in guild until I get mine.

It's not bad for ferals. Wolfshead helm and devilsaur set is nice.
---
I've been to a few Pride events and while there are people with that kind of thing they aren't exactly the minority. I think it's far more likely that it's you as an adult that are noticing these particular people as you already know what a dildo is. A kid with no knowledge of those sort of things isn't going to be drawn to it anymore than they would any of the other things that go on there - and if they are then it's possible they already know what it is and are just trying to be funny.
---
If your issue with gay people expressing themselves is having to potentially have an uncomfortable conversation with some kids then I'm not sure what to say else to say. They're your cousin's so I can't say that you should tell them what it is but couldn't you just say "that's something to ask your parents" and leave it at that?
---
Come to Kromcrush, it‚Äôs nearly 50/50 A:H and there‚Äôs always fun stuff happening .. high population as well

I prefer bleu but that's personal preference.
---
...but be aware if you've got a DOT on 'em.  There's been times when I've thought I can Gouge + bandage my way out of trouble only to have the mob instantly come out of stun 'cause of a DOT.
---
Thats impossible. Corporations sold their souls to China long ago to take advantage of slave and child labor. Tons of goods are manufactured in China.
---
But you can actively avoid Blizzard/Activision who chooses to side with the Chinese government over Their own nation of America. Its easy to just cancel your subscription and never buy blizzards garbage again. I also refuse to buy or watch anything related to Disney. See how easy it is to make baby steps towards being a better person instead of a stupid consumerist slop?
---
 I do a couple things. First, communicate. Tell the DPS when they're wrong. 
---
Two, I friend all the Good healers I group with. Good as in, "I know when to tell the DPS to stop pulling aggro" - or Good as in "I can heal DPS who pull aggro." That way I know if I grab a healer off my friends list, then we'll have a competent tank/heals for the run. 
---
Third, besides tab-sundering, I end up taunting every 10 seconds to maintain aggro on bigger packs. 
---
There just aren't that many "good" dps players out there, who know what/when/how hard to hit. The only exceptions I make are warriors, because as one I understand they can offtank a mob or two, and they'll build crazy amounts of rage and murderzone everything if they do.
---
Naw braw
---
Twinks and twink guilds before there are any BG's.
---
grats lol
---
You can download a recount / details parser addon and watch healing / damage done (hps, dps, etc lots of data included) to easily test combinations and rotations and downrankings to see what gives you the most damage / healing per mana.
---
Ah.  I play a tank and actually understand how to equip a sword/shield and generate threat, so I can understand your frustration on that account  =p
---
Regarding your stance, I don't think you're wrong, and I actually think this is a great point:
---
&gt; when you host a tournament in another country, you are beholden to their rules.
---
It's true.  What bothers me is that in the face of this backlash, Blizzard hasn't said anything.  Like, come out with it one way or the other, but *say something.*
---
&gt; But you just keep playing
---
I intend to.
---
&gt; ignoring the plight of others
---
Just what do you think posting memes on a subreddit completely unrelated to Hong Kong or China is going to accomplish?
---
Absolutely nothing.
---
You want to do something about the situation in Hong Kong? Go to Hong Kong.
---
Wait - before your subscription runs out..can I have your gold?
---
Who tf buys a preowned PC lol

I appreciate your input on this, and at the very least take comfort in knowing that this very discussion is happening in &lt;Hurricane&gt; leadership channels right now. We are strong in our purpose and goals, but we also want what's best for Grobbulus as a server.

C'mon fellas, leave it out please.
---
Why the cloth shoulders with int?
---
The point isn't that they take money from chinese government/companies. The point is that they shouldn't silence speech to appease their money overlords.
---
You can max it.
---
The frugal :)
---
You can strike something twice as fast with two fingers versus one.
---
Nope. Nice try tho :( sad
---
So true! I ended getting help twice from the guild, and put it in my guild message that if any Paladin is about to do that quest to hit me up I will escort them through it.
---
PTSD is not cheap, it's deer.
---
I'm very curious about any sources of info you'd be willing to share on this. I've done a deep dive of the rogue min/max scenarios but I haven't gotten this deep yet.
---
What is the difference between fearing someone into enemies and backstabbing them while they‚Äôre fighting them?
---
It‚Äôs a spell in the priest toolbox. They‚Äôre not unbeatable. They‚Äôre not cheating.
---
Make a couple macros.  Bind "/startattack" into all of your combo builders, and bind "/cast pick pocket" into all of your openers.
---
This relies on whoever got the loot not being a dick, not exactly guaranteed in a pug
---
True but wasn't it written after the fact?
---
Care to share the macro?!?

Yes and no. Some specs are worse than others and because of that some people won't want to take them to their groups. Does that mean you will never find a group? No, but it might be more difficult to complete some content if you choose an off-meta spec. Not because it makes the game harder, just people will be more likely to overlook you because of your class/spec combo.
---
The tier gear does kind of railroad most classes into one spec but there are plenty of non-tier pieces to wear and some of the bonuses aren't even that good depending on what you're doing.
---
Unless someone's gonna do something about blatant obfuscation, strawmanning, goading, and stupidity, then I'll call him a salty shitter like he is.

Get agil or crusader on those weaps!!
---
Different abilities have different coefficients for how they scale, it's never a direct increase as you noticed.  You'd likely have to look up each classes different spell scaling numbers to know for sure since it varies by class and ability.
---
I think not caring and not being in a position to care are mutually exclusive. Like yeah life is hard, it's hard to do something truly impactful (because you know unsubbing isn't going to do shit) but I don't think that lack of drive indicates a lack of caring. Like I still empathize with people over there being in the situation their in. I'd have far more respect for someone being a realist and recognizing they are powerless to stop something, than someone who understands that something and chooses to consciously oppose it. It just shows such a lack of empathy. It's the difference between "I wish the best for these people but I know unsubbing won't do anything" and "fuck them I could care less about their problems, it doesn't affect me, so I'll buy another 6 months of sub out of spite"
---
lol, so so true.  I'll run a guild lowbie dungeon before I run a PuG that guarantees me a drop.  Not even kidding.
---
Because it has to do with unique instance ID's not "resets"
---
You got the hat! How many attempts did it take before it dropped?

Than you for your reply. Would you recommend it with clear conscience ? ^^ is it easy to find a group for dungeons and group quests?
---
And you can skin the dragons.

MAGERS OF THE WORLD UNITE!
---
Everyone knows about the Jadefire Run/Toxic horror farm in felwood and it can be over crowded most time. But as a druid you can use moonglade, run over to that area, then hearth out with minimal time lost.    
---
You can kill elementals in silithus for essences, but that can take travel time as there is not much else around.    
---
Lastly, you can kill bats in eastern plaguelands. They have a pretty good loot table of grey vendor trash, the occasional random green drop, and you can skin them. This is one of the most consistent, uncontested gold farms imo. Not the highest but still pretty good, never contested, and not dependent on low drop rate, high value items. You could log on for 5 min killing those and log off richer than you started
---
That is why I included may.  It has not been my experience in game that people are all that selective either.
---
Man how‚Äôd you get this to post. I tried months ago and the mods kicked it back. But this is a classic video that rang true in the year(s) leading up to TBC. It was great. Still great!
---
Yeah that shit is pretty sad. Private servers ran better than the current client in world pvp...
---
I mean, seriously, without actually playing thru multiple classes and factions / zones, you just won't know why certain 'random' things like Buzzard Wings can be so much more expensive than they would be given what they are.
---
Druids never attack other druids. This is an unspoken rule.

[You can change the icons in your actionbars automatically using shift, alt, ctrl modifiers if you just set the icon in the macro to the question mark.](https://i.imgur.com/iWnCGsP.gif)
---
Just ask if there are other miners (or skinners, herbalists, etc) and then either alternate nodes and roll on any rare ones
---
just a video game bro calm down, not any real battles.. also acting like loyalty to a make believe faction is significant in any way is beyond ridiculous.
---
I'm not paying Reddit though. And honestly my activity on Reddit has declined probably 75% in the last two years anyway.
---
World chat
---
Man, I loved StarCraft like none other... I bullied my way through Terran/Zerg campaigns in SC2, but dropped in the Protoss campaign when they made a whole mission out of you standing on platforms to open a door. Never went back. Such disappoint.
---
Steamed hams but it's a shaman on WoW classic.

China liked that

Myriad Condensed Web, black border / shadow.  Its the default UI for most aftermarket UI's.  His looks to be ElvUI, full package

I love that people are writing stories trying to prove "other side bad". It's just a meme lol
---
Wow big mood my dude
---
&gt; and out rolls a dead-end WoW nerd contributing not only nothing to society, but extremely negatively to the world.
---
Interesting projection for someone spewing so much negativity.
---
The best thing you can do as a Ret paladin is when your logging in, pause on the character screen for a moment and press delete character. Type in delete and press enter. That way all the other players in the game have a more enjoyable dungeon and raid experience.
---
layer inv plz
---
&gt; if the pull is too large you have to pray you don‚Äôt run out of mana because you‚Äôre pouring heals into everyone
---
Do you honestly think that a prot warrior can hold threat on multiple mobs any better than fury??
---
If you have some random fury warrior trying to tank for the first time in his leather dps gear because he got tiered of not getting invited to groups, then yeah it's going to be tough on a healer.
---
But a fury war with proper tank set and who knows what he's doing will be able to tank 5 mans without any issues.
---
Having 10% extra armor does not make someone better at tanking.
---
Yeah I could see doing this if you're gonna do like 20 runs with the same 4 people but the idea of having to re-teach this to some guy every 3 or 4 runs is a nightmare.
---
üòÇüòÇüòÇ
---
True, I can't say how much you get rested when not at an inn. Also, yeah, I forgot that you can have max 1.5 levels of rested experience.
---
Arguably the most expensive due to the popularity/OPness and the lack of dungeon gear, i'd do it sooner than later as to buy it all and enchant it after p2/p3 will easily be 1k+ gold.
---
It's not a story the Aliiance would tell you

So, it is your opinion, that by canceling your Blizzard account, that China will repent of it's sins and free hong kong?  Lol?

There‚Äôs a mace called Fight Club in Grobbulus AH right now for 4g 20s 69c
---
I wish I was home so I could SS it
---
What a non-rational way of looking at it. Good job.
---
Congrats
---
Use actionator if that is what you want. Simple easy to use and far less confusing, unless you want to sit at the AH all day and trade then TSM.
---
&gt;  Every SJW out here acting like unsubbing is going to do anything.
---
hahah yeah fuck them for doing the right thing bro
---
Would you mind please telling me what macros you have on the end of your first bar? This is my first time war tanking in vanilla and I only have auto attack and stance dancing macros, so any help would be greatly appreciated!
---
Back to retail with you!
---
I think he means server westfall? Not sure if that is a server but it would make more sense
---
1v1 me kiid
---
Still doesn't work. When you target someone with an emote it doesn't say their name, it says "you".
---
I'll sometimes hibernate low lvl druids but that's about it.
---
Ya, not like these are new and exciting ideas in Vanilla. There have been 15 years of gaming advances since Vanilla and this basic concept of killing the healer/caster still eludes people.
---
I hotkey them, works wonders
---
Staying quiet and waiting for something to happen by itself is usually a less effective way to get it than speaking out about it?
---
I‚Äôm at maraudon on my alt and so far had basically no issues with just spamming rejuv and the occasional real heal
---
I do see the issue. Right click can easily be done just for fun and cost 0.5 caliories to do. 
---
Reporting someone takes more calories and mist players would probably just skip it altogether
---
That's the thing that confused me. My crit chance remained unchanged from 1-125. Now it seems to incrementally increase with every 2 or so weapon skill levels. 
---
Maybe it calculates based on last enemy hit? Because it started to increase only when I could reliably hit level 30 enemies. 
---
Anyway, yeah. It's weapon skill.
---
As a former altoholic I definitely understand. The classes you listed are all pretty much DPS... What cured my altoholism was trying out a priest, for some reason that stuck. Maybe try a different role.
---
Yeah, I've never wasted my time camping anyone. Too boring.
---
hOrdE BaD AlLiaNcE GoOd
---
It‚Äôs also a huge advantage to have a dedicated healer.
---
Highly reccomend being more specific on cancelaura when using another shapeshift.  The way I use is a bit overly verbose but it's good for cancelling any form to go into the desire form. There is a shorthand to it that many use but I've had trouble with it being finicky. 
---
I use one that cancels based on named stances. Other option is something likely cancelaura [noform 2]. I'd have to google it again.
---
Maybe for most people but for me the way I bound them helps me remember. I‚Äôm going to change Death Coil to 1, and move Fear and Howl of Terror down to 2 and 3.
---
Disallowing registration for the larger faction once disparity reaches a certain percentage?
---
I could add this in 5 minutes.
---
It's definitely not a preference. Stamina is just better than agi if you want the best mitigation. I do have a set that's a lot of agi/hit chance for threat though.
---
What is that glowing orb and why does it burn my skin? These changes confuse and frighten me.
---
Thwre is always that guy.
---
Bagnon does the same as well
---
the lfg addons work perfectly fine and in exactly the same way they did before census broke. in fact there are now several of them in addition to the one that caused all the freakout.
---
That was not the reason
---
Thanks! I haven‚Äôt played vanilla at all before classic and this has been very helpful, I‚Äôm setting a goal for rank 10 which as far as I can tell seems reasonable and gives me access to the pvp set
---
Leatrix plus add-on has an option for it as well
---
I love wpvp when its anything resembling a fair fight. 3v1 fine lets go. Want to engage when i just pulled a mob sure. But camping greys who literally cant fight back? You have to draw a line somewhere. If your idea of fun is stoping someone else from playing a game i think that says more about you then it does about me.
---
and maces
---
Anybody saying not enchanting is wrong. Smoking Heart of the Mountain is so essential. 
---
I also like to skin until I get my Brestplate of Bloodthirst (need 315 to skin The Beast in UBRS for the chest‚Äôs questchain/key item: pristine hide of the beast). 
---
After getting that chest, I drop skinning and max herbalism to squeeze more profit out of my DM trash packs farming. 
---
Also make sure to get cooking maxed for the Tubers from DM. 
---
Look up the barkskin/hurricane guide for farming DM trash packs as a Druid. 
---
All of this assumes you are going for bear tank main spec at 60.
---
I actually like Ashkhandi to a hunter if they pvp alot. People argue about melee weave making it BiS for PvE for hunter. We'll see about that.  Its really not viable to melee weave on most bosses because of various mechanics that prevent you from moving freely.
---
So generally I see ashkhandi as a pvp hunter weapon. It is very good for melee too though and probably a bigger upgrade for a melee than a hunter. 
---
Unlike Strikers which isnt replaced til like Naxx, there is a very good two hand for hunters in AQ, the next raid after BWL, which is not also desired by melee.
---
Pvp happening on pvp server. 
---
Sometimes I feel like some of you don't actually want the classic experience.
---
I'm not all about super efficiency, min/max farming, getting to 60 ASAP...more about exploring and questing and such, so take this with a grain of salt...
---
I like Rupture.  Although it screws with the Gouge + bandage mechanic I'll use it when I'm soloing and having to fight multiple mobs once where they are going to run (and potentially aggro others).  It's nice to have them die while walking away vs. pulling more mobs on top of me.  Plus it's a bleed effect so I *believe* it ignores armor (might be wrong).
---
That does make it situational.  I know a lot of people skip it.  But it's been good for me at times.
---
I dont know anything about twink, so what‚Äôs best class at 19 twink? Is it rogue?
---
Just seems like an odd choice for fluidity. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
---
You do you. Binds can always be altered.
---
Welcome to classic, where warrior DPS rotations were more or less literally BT/MS - WW - wait for them to come off of CD, dump rage &gt; 80 into HS/Cleave (MS Axe/Pole or DWFury) Hamstring (sword spec or HoJ user or Horde) or Slam (2h Fury)
---
Just a heads up, icy veins is notoriously bad so far in classic. They've gotten multiple stat prios and gear prios wrong. Wow head is a safer bet for all guides but they have a limited number
---
No amount of anything will make you a fun person to be around. :) buddy boy wants to meme it up but perform best as is capable. Live and let live. Nobody will make you group with them. Nobody made you read the comment.
---
How do I still get invited to gold seller channels still every 10 minutes
---
I haven't done much of the theorycrafting myself, but I would advice to look into the Fightclub discord, although it is meant for warriors, same concepts apply to rogue too(assuming they are talking about duelwield..).
---
Here's their website: https://www.fightclub.academy/
---
Discord: https://discordapp.com/invite/RbCZJtw
---
And specifically the stuff about hit caps and glancing blows:
---
https://github.com/magey/classic-warrior/wiki/Attack-table#miss
---
This table in particular explains most things. https://i.imgur.com/wjoEKTd.png
---
Remember it's in difference of defense skill, so 15 is 300 weaponskill, 10 is 305 weaponskill and 7 is 308 weaponskill.
---
&gt;Maybe you can vote for officials that are not chinese shills?
---
I did, the shills still got voted in any way because the people in my country like money
---
&gt;Maybe you can spend your green on content from companies that doesn't suck China's dick?
---
Which ones, the list of companies that are unethical is massive, and not even just about the China situation. Nestle for example and the crap they've done in 3rd world countries. Even the company I work for is reliant on parts ordered from China.
---
Thanks, appreciate it!
---
You'd have the same problems in prot spec.
---
this is literal creative fiction. both the addon themselves and the websites that collected its results allow you to see any range of levels. In fact the default view shows only  lvl&gt;5, you'd have to try extra hard to get to the level 1s
---
This is the best solution so far. To be honest I was probably going to go through my spells with a pen and paper and work out their mana cost per damage manually. Trying to find break points in the amount of mobs being fought where things like Consecration become more mana efficient than Judgements. Should be pretty easy to find out if I should use it against 2 or 3 mobs.
---
which has guess what, nothing to do with hit rating which is what this whole thread is about!
---
That's not really nimbyism, is it?
---
It's "I don't want this in my back yard", not "It isn't in my back yard so I don't care about it"
---
For you maybe, for me it makes perfect sense. 
---
Most used go on bar one, second most used or reactive go on bar two. Least used or emergency go on bar three. Simples. 
---
Always eager to hear what other people use though - if you can share yours?
---
Agreed. Balance/resto druids are some of the toughest PVPers. Especially in duels and small skirmishes like this. Wear you down and kite until your health/mana is gone.
---
Nope, nothing so complicated. 
---
We have a rule against politics and remove comments by anyone who we find breaks it.
---
Currently +9 int (more mana for power shifting), Phase 3 is +15 agi to 2h, and finally in phase 4 we get +25 agi.
---
But this is all entirely up to the situation. If the tank is rounding up mobs not taking much damage but the healer is spamming max rank Flash Heals for no reason, then it kind of is the healer's fault, not the tank's. 
---
If the mage jumps in and starts spamming aoe after 0.2 seconds of warrior threat, it's the mage's fault. 
---
Now if it's been 10 seconds into an aoe pull and there's 1 mob with 5 sunders and the other 4 mobs have nothing then... yeah, that's on the tank.
---
Pretty sure people preferred/were used to be governed under a western democracy rather then an oppressive communist regime, which is becoming more and more intrusive.
---
I know lol, it's like, you know that repeat offenses typically get you harsher punishments, longer ban times, etc right?
---
You are unable to downrank feral abilities as they only appear once in your Spellbook at the highest rank trained, but this is a good reminder on other classes or for resto/balance macros.
---
Fuck em tbh, as long as you put the reason why you cancelled, they will know. Standing up for what's right is much more important than your entertainment and happiness.
---
My shamans level 46 sooo I've already done that
---
I was trying out a class on private servers the couple weeks before classic and was waiting for the AB gates to open and some one was like "/s hey so and so accepted the BG but bugged out and is stuck.  can someone help me summon him" and then a portal pops up.  Of course I mindlessly clicked it thinking it was a summoning portal and not even thinking just to find myself in Org again with a timeout on joining BGs again for having quit one in progress.  Such a dirty move.  I laughed my ass off and sent the dude a /tell congratulating him for making me feel like such a noob.  Good times!
---
IIRC it was stated multiple times but I think it is in this video for example:
---
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O3b423uqrdo
---
So I think there is some weird behavior with weapon swaps that I haven‚Äôt been able to figure out but putting the shield as the first line and the weapon as the second line always works with me.
---
Met someone on retail during end of WOTLK I believe named Rhaggy, my warrior was Rutrow. We ended up doing so much together.
---
BTW nice area code
---
Me and my buddy made rogues with similar names, Sappin and Fappin, my name got reported so I had to change it. So now it‚Äôs Fappn
---
I reported them, but it's still happening. As I seen some lvl60 ppl came to get them, they run away and came back to farm low lvls again
---
Hunter and Warlock
---
Of course, but that's down from 9%-5% for 63-60 mobs.
---
When I am at my pc sure.
---
Different strokes for different folks.
---
As a rogue, I'm just there to kill Devilsaurs.  I solo them and typically get ganked immediately by an Alliance mage which is pretty typical of their faction and class.
---
I've had to let a couple Devilsaurs rot because I sat there as a ghost watching the mage corpse camp me as I refused to spawn and loot.
---
His hearthstone is on the same CD as my mana stone and I need that mana for more frostbolts.
---
You can't make this stuff up. Makes you wonder whether those people are like that in real life too, or just in the game...
---
Kurrinax US. The ally / horde ratio seems decent in some places but STV is overwhelmingly horde. I have been ganked only once as horde and been leveling there since 40-44.
---
You can't max first aid, need to be level 35 to do the triage quest.
---
Because at level 60 everyone will be more or less geared, but at lvl 19 99% of players will wear half white/gray shit and will get oneshotted by a twink with 5 times their hp and damage. 
---
Honestly, was that your best shot? I will ask you as i asked the other guy. Can you give me three valid reasons why thinking should be treated seriously?
---
Now the real challenge,  hitting level 60 as horde discovering orgrimmar
---
How does it work? Do you vendor or AH your mats? If its dependant on what mat thats cool I dont expect you to give me a full list, but I‚Äôd like to know if thats the case.
---
Let me know when you guys decide to do anything that actually makes a difference.
---
Me too, multiple times, but I didn't stop at 46 :]
---
Also some stats also take race and even faction into play. Depends on what you're playing and what buffs you have access to.
---
It is out there if you are in a queue
---
OK so I just hit lvl 37 and I'm currently sitting at 52g. What's the best place to gold farm for me right now so I can afford a mount when I ding 40? I play a human mage.
---
Definitely, especially in WSG when healing the flag carrier. However, I HAVE tried healing with randos and that was NEVER successful. They don't defend you and you spend most of your time at the GY while someone douche fighting in the middle calls you useless.  BG charts didn't show healing done until later right? or was that always a stat at the end?
---
Plan on speccing something crazy like 17/13/21 For Imp Mana Burn, blessed recovery, and silence.
---
I had a 19 gnome warlock with over 2400 health without buffs. I literally made a warlock just to maximize my health and for no other purpose.
---
I couldn't kill anyone, but dammit if I didnt survive a few seconds longer in fights than I would have otherwise.

When you crit holy lights fr

Error speech, its under the audio settings
---
It was after vanilla, so it won‚Äôt be in classic. No way to manage shaman and paladin players.
---
Dude, that is amazing! Keep rolling em out!
---
I like to make it look like I'm cannibalizing a dead party member by targeting a dead mob while standing on allies corpse.
---
*crunch munch*
---
&gt; you'll be waiting for aggro to drop,
---
The reason you see me standing waiting for aggro is because I'm recording a video to show people that mobs get stuck then drop aggro.
---
Normally you just start climbing the wall while the mobs are stuck.
---
&gt; people to try and fail to get up the wall and not miss the jump.
---
That's your problem for playing with bad people.
---
This is some min max shit we talking about. No room for hunter players.
---
&gt; and miss out on chances of a 16 slot backpack.

---
I used to hang out here as Horde just to listen to the music (back before the days of just YouTubeing it). Occasional Alliance would pick a fight but usually I just chilled and helped low levels do quests.
---
Maiming warlock because most black metal class. For alt I‚Äôm stuck
---
- warrior. Swole bro, most bad ass gear, but slow leveling and I am not very good at wow so prob not a great tank. Also overrepped, but somehow everyone needs tank
---
- rogue. Orc rogue looks like Letho and melee dps is fun.  But.. already have dps and literally everyone plays one. 
---
- shammy - hordiest of all classes. Okay leveling. But will only ever heal in dungeons. Which I suppose isn‚Äôt terrible. Seems like always wanted and not many play them.
---
Shield first then weapon is what I was going to suggest too
---
Hunter or warlock. Having a pet helps quite a bit while focused on soloing.
---
printscreen
---
This deserves GOLD!!!!
---
that's how it used to be before they changed it
---
Faction swap won‚Äôt be a thing. Shaman and paladin cannot be managed.
---
You really don't learn from your mistakes do you?
---
Like...99% of players don't check population counts. Most players roll where their friends roll, and there's like 1 guy in the friend group who actually gives a shit about faction so they followed him (and for me that guy quit).
---
What is this, real life?
---
50% drop rate for just the 2 - 3 hunters and you call it waiting forever. No. The melee are waiting forever for the 14% drop strikers that all warriors and rogues need. 
---
You do not get strikers and if you think you should you are a selfish turd. Maybe raiding in Classic isnt for you if you think 50% drop is waiting forever. Like not even joking. You will go weeks and weeks without loot in classic. Get used to it. 40 man raid isnt your personal loot party.
---
Or you listed the bid price as 1c and someone won it for 2.5s
---
Admit the error and move on

If you truly think it's a bug screen record every AH interaction you do, and watch over later if something happens.

I need to tweak stuff but this is what I am working with.  
---
\----------------------
---
Dot Timers, Reminders all my own.  
---
Imported DebuffsOnNamePlates so I can keep the classic nameplates the same.  
---
Keys are closer together. Tinyass board.  
---
Forgot to show cast bars but mine is below the dottracker and the classiccastbar one is above it. Zoomed in for the pic but zoomed out it's not intrusive.
---
Pet controls MWup/down Shift F-G Control F-G  
---
Curses are all Shift1-4 Ctrl 1-4, except CoE and R1 CoR (I like to twist and flicker my fears on mobs)  
---
F1-F4 is my Shadow Ward  
---
F5-f8 is the taxi service  
---
F9-F12 is Eye of Killrogg.  
---
Stuff and things. Sure I forgot stuff, I am rushed IRL.  
---
Kinda concentrated on leveling before I continue the tweaks
---
The stun isn't really on demand since it depends on your pet to proc. If it's cc's and you have no BW, you wasted it. Or if your pet has a slow attack speed, it's not really instant.
---
That makes sense then lol. was wondering why I never see an alliance shaman. I never played shaman.
---
Wasnt it also the name used in Lord of the G-Strings?
---
For the minimalist, 3 ranks is plenty. Dont scare people too much ;)
---
If you're thinking about twinking, I highly reccomend druids, they're insanely fun to twink. Though rogues, hunters, and priests also seem fun (though I haven't twinked as any of them).
---
I just straight give any green armor/weapon drops to lowbies around me that could use the upgrade. Benefit of being max level and playing an alt.
---
For AoE farming you'll want items that give some sort of damage on hit taken. So lightforge is not your first priority. Still a base line as it's plate with int and stamina. Also the set bonuses are not bad. 
---
Still getting https://classic.wowhead.com/item=12628/demon-forged-breastplate will be better then light forge chest for example for the rest get spellpower/int or avoidance plate. Just don't pick up anything with defense rating if you can help it as redoubt is pretty important. 
---
Heal Shields are hard to come by outside MC. The one you get for the quest killing blightcaller is pretty decent and easy to get. Other shields are tank oriented  and you'll find a decent overview here: 
---
https://classicwow.live/guides/860/paladin-aoe-farming-build-a-complete-guide-for-going-against-the-stigma-classic-wow#items_thorns_
---
For PvE healing? Get the offhand from BRD or something green of healing. It's BIS for a reason, in PvP however you'll prefer those 2k armor a shield brings.
---
Ha I didn‚Äôt say anything about rhyming...
---
Just because it‚Äôs poetry doesn‚Äôt make it good
---
shit u right
---
1. Move slightly away.  Make it easy for the tank to notice the mob moving, but not so far the tank can't get it back.  (Dragging it to the side helps with this).
---
2. Your tank should have a priority target marked and you should be on that.  I'm going to assume that you are a Rogue, Ret Paladin, Enh Shaman, Feral Druid, or Warrior, in which case there's an 80% chance you shouldn't be generating much AoE damage anyway (as melee).  The tank should pay extra attention to the focus target.
---
3. Communicate.  Say "\_\_\_\_\_\_ is on me."  Mark it if it's not marked.  Even easier if it's a guildy in discord.
---
4. Reroll and tank so you don't have to deal with the tank not pulling off of you.
---
Yeah but what's offensive about that?
---
I'm going to say you lost money, I sold one for 300 go on whitemane. From what I understand even though you don't appear green you still get the debuff for being near it.
---
Likely something messing up with the "main hand" thing.
---
Switch the macro to equip shield first then hammer and see if it works.
---
I know this, I was asking to see if they were actually doing this or just assuming every clown with just a 2H was DPS spec'd and everyone actually using a shield was prot.
---
Last night I had 2 people, not 1, 2 people rage quit what was suppose to be a full run of BRD because the tank wouldn't give the dps an item that dropped after everyone hit greed. 
---
He claimed it was "almost BiS" but he didnt want to hit need... Because he didn't want to be "that guy"....
---
So instead he demands the item be given to him and has a temper tantrum when the tank refused.  The tank said no and him and his friend quit. 
---
Why in God's name would you afraid to need on and item THAT YOU NEED? What kind of toxic people play this game that would be mad if someone needed something they needed.
---
If you need it, NEED IT! Don't hit greed and cry about it.
---
I can't figure out how to use details for much else but a dps meter. I've right clicked and toggled options or so I thought and it's always a dps meter.
---

---
What about rule 5?
---
Bear in mind that shapeshifting is on the same GCD as any of your spells.  So if you drop form to toss a heal or moonfire you need to wait the 1.5sec of whatever the GCD is to be able to shift back.
---
You can only do 5 dungeons per hour no matter what.
---
There's two things you can do:
---
A) Clear those arena runs without anyone sharing loot and as fast as possible. You can skip all the trash by opening the two gates to the left, then going up the stairs (maybe you have to kill fire ele), and walking up in the middle and jumping down to the arena. Do 5 runs like this as a chest needer + caster for belt and maybe a healer helping out, then you are locked out for 1 hour minus how long it took to clear. Use this time to get a break or pvp or whatever.
---
B) Clear arena+angerforge+golemlord as fast as possible. It's possible to do 12min runs check out this skip:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgcur9/brd\_window\_skip\_faster\_angerforgelava\_runs/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/dgcur9/brd_window_skip_faster_angerforgelava_runs/) This way you can have a full 5man group all needing on items. You can have 1 caster needing belt, 1 warrior needing chest, 1 rogue needing HoJ, 1 healer needing the trinket from golemlord, and 1 caster/melee either rolling on hoj, belt or the boots from golemlord. This way you have a consistent group of players and still getting the most runs per hours while helping out others(potentially your guild).
---
It's more of just being shocked that this is the line when it comes to China. Apple just removed actual protestors ability to track police presence making their protests more dangerous but we are going to lose our minds over Blizzard firing and banning some people for breaking a set of rules that were known. Did their actions deserve punishment? Yes, most likely. Was the punishment harsher than it should have been? Most certainly. 
---
The real issue is no matter what Blizzard did, there was basically 0 impact on HK protestors. Blizzard doesn't have a product or service that impacts protestors and their sway in China is non existent. They simply protected themselves and look shitty to a western audience, that is 100% the extent of their damage. Apple is putting protester lives in danger, they actively are helping the Chinese government try and squash protestors. I'm just sitting here tired of being told I'm a terrible person for still playing WoW by some attention seeker with their brand new iPhone and airpods. Statistically, a significant number of people posting in this thread are doing so from an iPhone and frankly they can get fucked for looking down on anyone else.
---
Quite a few people have access to it, I don't know what you are going on about.
---
&gt;One thing I was looking forward to in classic, was doing 5-mans the "proper" way again.
---
&gt;
---
&gt;You know, pick a target to CC, pick a target to focus first, do LOS-pulls and all that.
---
&gt;Instead everybody's just AOE-charge-zerking through everything ... and a lot of the time it's working.
---
Honestly, this has been a big let down for me. I played some on a private server before classic released and the dungeons were (deliberately or accidentally) overtuned so that even a starter dungeon like dead mines was tough and nails. You actually had to coordinate your plays, come up with creative tactics...
---
... I miss this stuff so much. At the beginning of the instance, people would often distribute buff potions, food, sharpening stones, etc. - not only because it was a nice thing to do but because it actually realistically upped the chances for a successful run. When overcoming the dungeon itself is the principal challenge, it also fuses people together more and there is less bickering over who should get what piece of loot or who did the most damage.
---
The problem here is so many dps warriors try to tank with their dps gear on. I have a threat set, and a mitigation set.
---
When I‚Äôm full fury dps spec, I tank in full mitigation. When I‚Äôm in prot, I tank in almost full threat (dps gear). The damage taken is about the same regardless of spec.
---
Sorry answered that Primarily based off a pve mindset
---
Feign Death and Hunter pets, offer a lot of flexibility. As stated earlier you can literally solo dungeons.
---
They are also the only class that has a class quest that makes you learn all parts of your hunter 
---
Rok'delar.
---
If your on a PVP server or pvping it will be completely different.
---
In that instance
---
Druid or rogue would be the best because of stealth. And their utility like dash and vanish.
---
&gt;E: A lot of comments on how mobs shouldn't be only rotating slightly due to melee dps being behind the target, news flash you can be on their arms to avoid parry.
---
Then it would be at least a 90 degree turn.
---
I'm the same level and feeling the same way. Hello fwend

Guard spam came out with DHKs in summer 2005. OP is probably talking about the original tarren mill which was big from like February through May.

Nobody cares.

At the time of recording it was something like this 
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/embed/druid/510050300255103
---
4 DPS 1 Healer is definitely doable. Becomes much easier if you have 1 or 2 pets to taunt back and forth and share the damage around.
---
Indeed. The PLA are literally in my room now forcing me to type this.
---
Whats the name of these addons :)
---
This is why I hate devilsaurs so much, they ruin an otherwise glorious zone. It's all zen and peaceful, and then the assholes come out of nowhere and then it's pain and suffering.
---
Rogues can evasion, too.
---
Honestly just playing the game normally is the best way.
---
I just entered the world of macros.  Is there a way to make it so I don't /say something everytime I use a combat macro? It's insanely annoying.
---
Congrats dude!
---
My experience has been tanks think they are God's amount men and I should be honored just to be in their presence.
---
It goes both ways.
---
Yay you won! ^_^
---
üòÇ
---
There's a lot less room for mistakes as feral. If you're resto you can just kinda moonfire and insect swarm and run around in circles.
---
Yeah but what world PvP have you come across where everyone involved was a perfect player? üòÇ
---
Am I losing my mind?
---
Is the only horde elemental leatherworking trainer in arathi?
---
The number of undead locks who don't cannibalize after pulls is ridiculous. You've got an ability that heals over a third of your hp in 10 seconds that costs you absolutely nothing and is usable every 2 min. How do you not take advantage of that ability?
---
Exactly the same situation except worse with cowardly Alliance players.
---
No brother.
---
Single mob farm? Then you have to farm rare mobs. Things like devilsaurs(if it isn't too contested), water elementals in felwood/epl, satyrs in felwood, maybe the WPL mobs that drop crusader etc. etc.
---
Hell yeah, that's the way we do!
---
How bad would it be to skip NS to keep lotp? Would it even be worth going 20 into resto if you dont take ns?
---
[This](https://twitter.com/Slasher/status/1181926542080958464) was the big one imo. 
---
"We will always respect and defend the pride of our country", the rule violation was fairly neutral but over the top, this tweet is flat out pro-China.
---
Fragile little kiddies.
---
Ah that‚Äôs right
---
Yes. It's not like you have much range on taunt. If you pull aggro, bring it back to the tank. 
---
I'm not sure what is amusing you about this, it's incredibly basic group gameplay.
---
Nah that‚Äôs just the number that was in my first xbox gamer tag and I stuck with it cause I liked it lol
---
I had the same problem when I bought [Hanzo Sword](https://classicdb.ch/?item=8190) and [Aegis of Stormwind](https://classicdb.ch/?item=1203).
---
Having the macro equip the sword first then the shield didn't work and left me with the shield only. I had to flip the macro and make it equip the shield first then the sword and it worked.
---
After getting new gear later on I went back to equipping the sword weapon first then the shield.
---
Yeah this is probably the smartest if you know on character creation that you ll be going for a certain mount other than your race's but if OP is asking after having already levelled then he just simply has to turn in runecloth.
---
If you have the mats you can just have someone make you the devilsaur set.  Supposedly gather to 60 then power level a craft or two to 300.
---
Isnt that literally the worst choice? Even for shadow stacking crit isnt viable. Please explain more.
---
&gt; FFS how hard is it to come up with a name that isn‚Äôt intended to show off how immature you are?
---
You realize children play games too, right?
---
Are you serious?
---
This isn't remembering a dead person it's an ongoing issue that people are tired of supporting.
---
They are boycotting because this company cares more about profits over human lives. Stopping their revenue is the only way to show companies people are pissed and make them change.
---
Your friend obviously has a moral backbone unlike you who just cares about playing a fucking game.
---
Really dumb post.
---
In all honesty just drop full shadow and go disc/shadow. You'll have PI along with the increased shadow damage
---
Wow are you being obtuse on purpose?
---
There is no server limit blocking a new player from playing on their friends server lol.
---
Ahh excuse my then ignore that comment lol
---
Just use numpad numbers for your mouse. Simple as that.
---
Or, more likely, you entered it in wrong. There is nothing you can do.
---
It's the same as it was back in the day. The only difference is kids these days can't take jokes and are super sensitive.  It's the outrage culture we now live in (aka "I'm offended by everything").  
---
So cringy when people use the word toxic to describe anything other than a chemical compound.
---
Well your spec helps a lot. As full feral there's a lot less room for mistakes. Resto or hotw you can just moonfire/insect swarm and run in circles and youll usually be fine.
---
Depends on the server, it could be low or high. I know patterns that sell for 9g on some servers sell for 300g on others.
---
Is there an addon that lets me see my mana while i am a cat/bear?
---
at the character select screen look at the bottom left there is a store button , it had the free character transfer there when i looked a week ago
---
Asking why you would level that many times also are we talking gold efficiency or time efficiency? Because in alot of the research it seems that the most expensive but fastest is to start ele, swap to enh 25-45 then back to ele to 60. Did you just go with that one build and say that it was fast and efficient without testing out other builds?
---
If you got a blood fang hood would you be ‚Äúmore happy‚Äù?
---
I keep wondering what mine will be. But, I have to hit 60 first for the good stuff.
---
If you did that to me, as a warrior, I would /slap you and challenge you to a duel
---
Trust me you d be happier if it was perdition's blade but in all seriousness grats. First epic being a bloodfang piece is sick üëç
---
but i thought strikers was bis for melee until naxx
---
:thinking:
---
Yes : druid bars
---
It doesn't really matter there's no global morality in an mmo. For example, I got ganked by a couple ally high level led than me in stv. So, I respawn, and kill another ally that is the same level as me. That guy then comes back (I don't corpse camp) and finds me and kills me.
---
The people you gank and that gank you are generally unaware or don't care about previous actions.
---
Locks have this magical ability to take Mana from their healer. As a priest I throw a renew on them if I got plenty of Mana, but that's it, as far as I'm concerned if they life tap too much and then pull aggro and die, that's their problem, not mine.
---
Sound like a bad healer.
---
Nah, you can actually train it at lvl 1.  Capt. Pedant up there isn't actually right.
---
lol
---
My alt hunter named Tributebot is lvl40 now, I'm having a hard time manning up to finish up the char, no way I'll make it now :( Guess I had a bit of an unfair advantage there ;)
---
Yes, but the mods here refuse to let anyone talk about it except in this thread
---
As a healer in classic dungeons, in general your job is to keep the tank alive. You only really need to worry about that. If dps are taking damage then it‚Äôs usually avoidable. Sometimes it‚Äôs really good to let them die so they have consequences for their actions. Esp as a Druid healer as we don‚Äôt have a rez. Warlocks are able to recover their own health as need be. 
---
Though I personally will throw efficient heals on warlocks as much as I can. Healing touches so we can just keep going. I‚Äôm pretty efficient with mana and pop down those drinks as soon as I can.
---
wowhead is also notoriously inaccurate about drop rates so if it says 40% you're pretty safe to assume it's not :p
---
Benediction/Anathema is a single staff that priests get from a class quest.  Benediction is for holy priests and gives bonuses to healing and can be activated to transform it into Anathema which is for shadow priests and gives bonuses to shadow spells.  You can only switch between the two with that activation once every 30 minutes.
---
This post is a joke about a group helping a priest get his class quest staff because they think they‚Äôre improving the capabilities of their healer.  Instead, the priest switches the staff to the shadow variant and starts blastin‚Äô.
---
I feel like i ganked you as some point....
---
lol are you on kurinnaxx?
---
Examples? I'd love to make 300 g on a pattern.
---
yeah..mages love more mages....I would avoid that toxic shit too.  Playing mage is easy/boring...I enjoy actually working for my damage.
---
This is not the walljumping they are talking about. You could go up any wall as long as it had even the smaaaaalest slope.
---
even going with the old monitor photo from 2005 #nochanges huh.
---
OPs picture describes the face I made reading this rationalization.
---
Starfire and ravage can crit pretty big, but in general we aren't a big burst class. If you want to see big crits don't play a druid.
---
Phase 2 brings the honor system, sure, but the real grind comes with battlegrounds, which will be cross realms, at least I think so? 
---
Anyway, sucks with the imbalance tho.

That's when you go arms and do tons of deeps and holding threat like a boss.
---
With scholo and strat making up such a huge portion of the end game dungeons right now, the lack of a disease cleanse is far worse than the lack of a true Rez
---
Yeah, I was thinking that 4 DPS also kills approximately 30% faster than 3 DPS, at some point your might just go 5 DPS and race everything down (with someone capable of rezzing, healing after each pull).
---
Probably questing tbh. You should have 90 around 42-43 or so if you also vendor everything.
---
If you really wanna farm and not care about lvling there are 2 options I know 
---
1. Fishing stonescale eels in Tanaris if you have at least 175 fishing (I think). Forgetting the amount of gold here
---
2. Arathi highland fire elementals have a 10% drop of an item that sells for 2-3g on my server.
---
Both of these are competitive and kind of a war zone on pvp servers though so beware
---
Honey, I've been playing WoW since its original release. AoE groups have always been common the difference was your ability to access information via online forums / reddit.
---
Just because you dislike a particular zoom zoom playstyle doesn't mean it isn't objectively better. I get it, you like to go slower than others so you can handle more. 
---
I'm specifically speaking about higher level dungeons with tanks who have been through all the motions, doing ubrs and lbrs farming brd for specific drops and trying to get my pre-bis is where I'm currently experiencing the kind of tanks that just turn their brain off after pulling initially and love to blame others for not focusing 1 target at time. If its my group and a tank is deliberately slowing down the dungeon I ask why hes doing it and if he is comfortable speeding it up for everyone's sake. 
---
Most groups at a higher level are melee cleaves on Horde side due to them having higher damage and tanks being able to hold more aggro. your statement on mages isn't necessarily true after level 58.
---
The point of this thread wasn't to try and analyze behaviors and ask for solutions its just social commentary.

.rehtorb oN
---
Does Arms get raid invites?
---
I would love for you to come up with an explanation for how the game accidentally gave you 1% of what it should have given you.
---
Pretty sure the character limit is 12 since that's been ingrained in my mind for like 10 years. Is it not?
---
I agree with you completely also.  There is *nothing* better than only having to heal a person or two instead of 4 and OOM'ing every large pull because the warrior takes as much dmg as a shaman.
---
youre a casual i see, not putting any passion into what you do
---
Also just helps reduce downtime between fights. Not a major stat loss.
---
Sure, I linked it in the post above. The goal is to maximize the strengths, giving you an interrupt with charge, making shifting cheaper to break roots/charge at will, and improving your ability to heal on the fly via Swiftmend and NS. 
---
Imp regrowth is big for PvP, as it's your only short cast, big heal spell. Regowth is almost never used on pve, but it's often used in PvP.  
---
A Crit regrowth and immediate Swiftmend is a huge burst heal that no other class can match without NS. Mana efficient? Nope. But as a druid, you can back off easily and drink (Shadowmeld is low key best druid PvP racial), and quickly rejoin the fight.

Maybe, not sure about either of those but if you want a gathering profession mining is actually pretty profitable right from the beginning. At 5-10 silver per copper node on my server you can pay for your skills and be more liberal with what you actually train as well.
---
I‚Äôve long been searching for an attorney of your caliber to represent my shenanigans properly.
---
Your hired!
---
assuming there's only 2-3 hunters in the raid
---
assuming there's no other part to getting rhok apart from the leaf
---
So I just need to save all the leather I gather on the way to 60?
---
Incoming noob question: I'm new to WoW classic and want to make a twink, where do I start? Currently have a lvl 29 Priest as my main character, but should I first focus on getting this toon to 60, then focus on a twink? Thoughts appreciated! Cheers.
---
&gt; Combat spec all the way, and combat spec can go 1-60 never using a stealth opener and never see any real loss in efficiency.
---
Even with full combat sword spec, opening with Garrote will bring quest mobs down faster than just facepullling with SS+S&amp;D or SS+Evis.
---
&gt; Spirit on gear is trash, and so is anyone that says otherwise, buy some food, level first aid, you‚Äôll be fine.
---
Yes because nothing says efficiency like having to eat after every pull. I'm well aware that Spirit is worthless for dungeons &amp; raids. We're talking about solo questing here.
---
Oh boy I got a comment removed from a mod who trolls afterwards.
---
Must be a sad life but at least you have power.... In a dying subbreddit!
---
The issue with other classes face pulling isn't getting the mobs attention, or even marking the mobs.  It's converting an ordered approach to dismantling "that group over there" into an utterly chaotic "Ahh, fuck, sunder-tab, sunder-tab, revenge, mark on the fly and forget about CC" way.
---
Maximal survivability is the counter to chaos.
---
I lot of stupid comments in this thread but I would also like to know if the gloves can roll shadow wrath since im killing mini bosses while I farm drakestone
---
I'll usually wait 5-10 seconds depending on the size of the pull. If a WF totem procs on my WW theres nothing I can do but swap to shield and run around till tank pulls back aggro.
---
I'm not in control over whether or not WW procs the WF and if it crits or not. 
---
Its either, use aoe or don't. But when the tank is consistently pulling larger packs the goal is to cleave everything down in a fast manner after the tank has established threat.
---
What's he farming? The charms?
---
Just Feint. The mob will 9/10 times immediately turn around as long as the warrior put some aggro on it.
---
I'm on Herod with Convergence. I found them while I was camped out at Guru, they inspected me and called me a beast. I asked to join and then as I helped them get their twinks their agms, they moved me up on the priority list like total ballers.
---
But ... how do they then target those mobs?  Selecting a specific target in the melee zone is a pain in the ass.
---
I tried threatplates, then decided it was useless since I was having to tab-target to (reliably) select that specific mob anyway.   I went back to just watching target-of-target as I tabbed.   That way I know I‚Äôve lost a mob ... and I have it targeted so I can respond immediately.   (And I can tell if I‚Äôm about to lose one - if it‚Äôs half dead with only 1 sunder, someone is probably about to pull agro.)
---
To be fair though, I‚Äôm biased, since I‚Äôd already learnt the other way.   It may work well if someone learns with threatplates from the start.   Just wasn‚Äôt for me.
---
Special characters make me look down on a name.
---
Thx. Planned on more tanking than healing, but obviously want to do both. Keeping 3 flat crit was something I wanted xD
---
Unrelated but I just learned you can use /e when I've been using /me all these years
---
Ban incoming, all hail China
---
That was beautiful.  It brought a tear to my eye describing my thoughts exactly.
---
Nowhere did I mention strikers or melee. I'm talking about what gear is good for hunters.
---
Stop trolling, thanks.
---
IT WASNT THE CLAAAAAAAMS!
---
Amazing for pvp. Not pointless.
---
lol meant this to reply to someone but apparently I just commented haha
---
That's the opposite of how PvPers think
---
Yeah I mean I follow that logic, but I'm a druid healer and I also have tanks items but 99% of a time I wanna heal only ^^ I very occasionally will tank if our tank left midway and I feel super enthusiastic about the group or it's my good friends, but usually noo, I'm druid but I don't tank or dps
---
I like the game. TBC is better but pre-TBC shit is cool too.
---
Well then embrace your vaunted research, instead of doing anything whatsoever for yourself :]
---
No, I don't recall offhand when I swapped and where, as I spent more money and time on respecs and eyeballing TTK/dps/damage taken than I could quantify if I wanted to.
---
I'm unfamiliar with the alot of the research. I tend to find the alot of fire to be my favorite alot.
---
Did Asmongold swap to Horde? Or does he play Ally on that server and everyone wants to kill him?
---
God forbid we have any fun.
---
Once you hit 40, go to the crystal vein mine in STV, the basalisks in front of it are good for gold.
---
Horde shadow priest troll!
---
Just play the game. YOu are already have more gold than average player.  
---
Higher level -&gt; more gold earned.
---
I remember there being an addon or a function in game from either classic or another early expansion where you could have aggro in percentage under the mobs health plate.
---
I can't remember the name or really tell if it'd real since I can't find it.
---
As a fellow shaman I just tell my warlocks to stand closer to tank. Chain heal all day for Max effect :) it's the most efficient and quick group if they can keep getting chained in the heal
---
Yeah, stun resist is good for sure but I still think escape artist and fear ward are way better than 25% stun resist.
---
I don't recall ever using fences for damage, what's the best height?  3, 6 10ft?
---
Yup, its really just this simple. Some people assume all tanks play optimally with threat plates and keybinds but the reality is 90% of the playerbase doesn't use keybinds.
---
That thing will be worth at least 500g when the market settles down in 2-3 months as most people have secured their epic pony... you sold too early.  I would have banked it for awhile, abysmal drop rate, there's never many on sale.
---
I love Taurens but they look ridiculous on everything besides kodos. Even in retail I can only ever use a handful of mounts because of how stupid they look riding most things.
---
Rogue is certainly the best melee dps at 19, and the most overplayed class in the bracket. Personally I find them the most fun for fighting, but in terms of OP for what is needed at 19, healers (specifically priest) and warrior peelers and druid FC/heals are freakin great!
---
You sure put some effort into joining that raid though, is that a riphook from lbrs? Only seems like you are missing prebis belt shoulder and chest well done.
---
Unfortunately your piece sucks, you need some better glove in order for it to be worth breaking devilsaur
---
i used this guide https://vanillaguides.com/2018/07/30/1-300-lockpicking-guide-for-vanilla-world-of-warcraft-wow-classic/
---
Alliance kn Myzrael is great, well populated but no queues. Seem to be a whole lot of leveling guilds. No issues so far.
---
Saw ‚ÄúFreebowjob‚Äù on thunder fury yesterday lol - reported
---
##FreeHongKong
---
Makes sense! Thanks!
---
no but it's a sentiment that many others hold here
---
unfortunately there are no better shoulders with stats at this level. The only reason they are there is for the stamina, as HP &gt; Armor
---
Interesting, I was just going off of what I'd heard.  I appreciate the explanation.
---
The first "exploit" many of us learned.
---
I'm just at work so I'd have to check the addon name when I get home but that sounds like the same one (minus that having aggro even when they're green). I wonder if there are settings you could try messing with?
---
Also, for context, the colors work opposite when you're tanking IIRC.
---
We dont have the mount journel in classic and tigers require tiger training and horse require horse training so if you start adding mounts in then they would have to add the requirement for that mounts training for it to work otherwise people would just buy a mount from the store and save buying mount training aswell as the rep requirement for humans to ride tiger for example.
---
I agree the demons were really easy. It was people walking up and "helping" and making you have to wait 12 more hours to kill them.
---
They can all be viable with your play style. Rogues And hunters are just the most common and easiest to play and succeed with
---
For the longest time I called that areola borealis.
---
Garrote, assuming you keep it on curve as you level, does at best 10% of a mobs HP. 
---
The time you spend stealth walking, getting behind, and energy spent distracting mobs before you open is far more than time spent hitting 3-4 auto attacks to make up the difference. 
---
As for spirit, your health regen from spirit massively falls off past level 20, so yeah it‚Äôs completely useless. More offensive stats = more damage dealt = less damage taken = less time regenerating hp. First aid &gt; 5% more hp regen per tick
---
Someone Photoshop a Devilsaur approaching in the distant mist.
---
 [https://shadowpanther.net/](https://shadowpanther.net/)  was the source for rogues in vanilla , still is the source 15 years later
---
I'm obviously not an english major, whats the difference between using few before far if there's an "AND" in between?
---
to be fair my guild is truly a raiding guild, with about 10 members who also see merit in buying items before their price inflates 1000x and getting Arena trinkets before world pvp is out, making things much harder.
---
if you cant see the same merit you should get your eyes checked bub
---
only on dead servers will you see a devilsaur anywhere other than its spawn point
---
Nope, but it's amazing for dungeon spam. 7-31-13 won't get raid invites either.
---
I go the route of having a shitton of bars and then later on when I'm ok with the setup I'll start hiding them (and put all the skills with CDs on one unhidden bar). 
---
This is a reasonable thing to do though. I worry that it's a bit annoying to change stuff though.
---
You could naively implement it in 5 mins sure (assuming you knew the codebase) but actually getting it to work without breaking anything else would take a lot longer.
---
This IS the best of Classic WoW. 
---
Nice to see the old tricks live on.
---
Getting black sinew is dirt easy. Like literally a joke. If you think you get a BiS melee bow because getting your blue sinew takes effort, classic is not the game for you.
---
Again, Strikers Mark is Worse than your prebis. You have no argument here.
---
Do priests try to get other staves since Benediction is too hard? Hell no. Only lazy piece of shit hunters try to pull this shit.
---
Grind. Welcome to Classic
---
Oh no, believe me, your feeble attempts to try and belittle me have not gone unnoticed. I just chose not to humor you.
---
&gt; Blizz fucked up and I already hate Apple or Nike. If calling other people hypocrites helps you sleep at night knowing you are supporting a company that is willing to bend backwards for China, good for you.
---
The problem is that you're supporting a company that is doing this in one way or another too.
---
The only difference between you and him is that you pretend doing one small thing gives you enough peace of mind and morality that you can ignore the other thousands of human rights violations going on with companies all around you. Because let's be honest - trying to leave so many things out of your daily life that it would make a change would be seriously inconveniencing.

FROSTBLITZ
---
In principal as you level your pet will do less and less of overall damage as you get better gear and it's not a getting outdated as fast. Pet is basically there to tank for you and hold aggro so that you can shoot from range, even as beastmaster spec. You can send in your pet against an equal level mob without assisting it. You'll see that the pet always wins but it takes quite a long time.
---
If is relaxing for some honestly, for me for example if quite often is more relaxing than tanking hehe
---
Which is imo "slightly"...
---
geez chill out, not everyone is going to be able to read addon code (or even know where to find it ) to work out how it works.
---
Oh please enlighten me on what makes good poetry then.  I'm sure you can give me your whole community college English TA analysis right?
---
Why no improved rejuv? Is it not beneficial to keep on yourself if taking dmg pvp wise? Or is it not worth it because of dispels?
---
I did it once in BC days, it was "fun" in that it's really busy. But very limited in other ways.
---
Lol, you think a tank is going to just dip offline and find a threat addon?
---
I'm just posting this cause its funny how many times I'll read "JUST STAND NEXT TO TANK IF YOU HAVE AGGRO" then I just get slapped cause the tank didn't notice.
---
Looks like this tard doesn‚Äôt know about the legit exploit that blizzard had to step in and fix
---
Oh, but you keep replying with nonsense such as this. I'd say you've humored me plenty. I'm certainly laughing at you now. Have a great day!
---
I‚Äôve only seen that once so far.
---
I‚Äôm on a PvE server, just minding my own, some Alliance player came up and started spamming /spit, lol
---
That doesn't answer anything about why though.
---
As a mage, I have thankfully not run into this because I do this often. I'll nova or something similar.
---
Are you going to answer my questions with questions of your own?
---
When i read this, i hear it in the voice of the three little pigs from Shrek.
---
I had the same issue and found out the questie addon does this.
---
Until you run out obviously...
---
Camping towns was never the best way to get honor anyway. Scheduling PvP with the opposing faction on the server forums, and pushing / pulling away from the towns was always the best way to get honor.
---
so can you transfer all your characters to my account after giving the other guy your gold? You wont need it anymore right?
---
Oh my goodness that is crazy! It really warms my heart to hear other people have the same or a similar experience üòä. Good luck on your guys' Classic journey!! üíú
---
Gotcha, thanks. Very weird
---
There's another spot, if you're looking at the bank, to the left before you get to the mage area where there are some shops. One of them has some crates out front you can mount clip through and slow fall down there as well. That one should work for anyone. I'll have to double check exactly where it is, it's been a long time.
---
&gt;  the pop went from 70/30 to 85/15 since the census. 
---
Source?
---
&gt; The camping at times can be unbearable.
---
Right, I'm not saying that's not the case, but I personally was never camped, I was ganked, I was violated, I was repeatedly killed by various Horde members on my way from point A to point B, but never actually camped by a single person, camping my corpse an waiting for me to res to kill me again before I can even heal myself, which is my (arbitrary?) definition of "camping".
---
&gt; That's a mature conversation, not dismissing what everyone else says because u haven't experienced it.
---
Glad to hear it, not my intent to do so, but when I asked specific questions, I didn't get specific answers and then your previous comment wasn't really something I should even have bothered to answer, also glad we got this back on track. Anyhow, the work day is over, I probably won't be back on reddit until Tuesday, Canadian Thanksgiving, so we can resume then, if there's still anything worth being discussed.
---
Lok tar... comrade
---
It's happened to me so much in vanilla that I made it an iron rule now to never put quest items in the bank, even if I'm starved for bag spaces. Because I'll eventually forget to take them back out of the bank when I leave town.
---
If they ever do classic wow plus, I hope that's one of the things they fix: just more unique icons, especially for quest stuff. They could just use existing icons from retail, so no additional artists need to be hired.
---
The feeling is mutual buddy, you have definitely made my day at work a lot less boring. Thank you for your contribution.
---
What I've been doing recently is starting a fight with SoC, auto attack until a proc, Hammer of Justice, Judgement, then switch to SoR before the next auto attack. 
---
Can usually can bring a mob down to half health.
---
Keanu has always been a wholesome person irl. But his "No you're breathtaking!" remark kind of reminded everyone how much they like him.
---
Most people don't play zoomed in such a fashion that they can tell in a pack of 4-6 mobs that one turns to the left/right 90 degrees.
---
Here's an easy single valid reason: Autism shouldn't be a fucking insult.
---
That is why you name something like vagina, but in foreign language
---
I put on my robe and wizard hat.
---
Why not Desolace...just get a lock buff you can level it in like 20 min there are tons of boxes down there
---
lmfao
---
As much as I can see why people don't want it, I'd be stoked for faction changes. I'd pay it in a snap.
---
I have plenty of free time for many hobbies and life improving activities now that I am done playing WoW for the foreseeable future.  There I answered you question, now you go please.
---
it's not really that much less damage.  You can still run a 2h weapon for questing until you get the +10% 1h weapon when you can grab 2 good 1 handers and dual wield with very good damage.  The biggest advantage is being able to charge into a group of mobs and live through it as well as being able to tank dungeons much easier having improved threat generation with better and cheaper threat abilities.
---
Because you do in subsequent expansions
---
Maybe it's just me, but your game looks insanely crisp compared to mine, maybe it's the zone or screenshot format or something, but man it looks good.
---
You are on a PvP realm, look at the racials from a PvP perspective. Why would anyone play alliance outside of social reasons and/or wanting to play hardmode?
---
Horde will always be easymode in PvP. Everyone wants to play the strongest character they can, it's the nature of a RPG. That means within a PvP context more people will always play horde. Which snowballs.
---
I honestly don't understand how this still shocks people. It was true 15 years ago, and it's still true today.
---
Rogue named Stabulots, Mcstabbins, Stabstabstab, Rightbhndu.
---
We'd love to see more Horde on Heartseeker, to be honest, I don't regret moving there per se, since I doubt it will die any time soon, but I like Stalagg at 40A/60H (according to census before Blizz killed the mod) better than Heartseeker at 65A/35H (guesstimate).
---
this is correct. but you only need 225 to use heavy runecloth. My main makes the beeg beeg bandages and mails em on over.
---
Any Cheese AT 3am is my cryptonite
---
Idk how you would even confused Dire Mail for Cookies Cove anyway.

You can enchant soulbound items... Thats how raid items work.

Hell, don't forget shield enchants, either. A sword&amp;board Warrior will be impossible for most anyone to kill.
---
I'm currently playing double sword, Sword of Serenity main hand and Vanquisher's Sword offhand.  
---
If I'm playing combat swords Rogue isn't necessary to play 2 swords or can I go for 1 sword 1 dagger?
---
Same
---
I said drunk not an alcoholic. I go to parties not meetings.
---
Guys like this probably want to ban semi-trucks from the highways too.
---
Some tanks are just clueless. Had a warrior on a princess run earlier who never used sunset regardless of how many time I told him to sunder. I pretty much face tanked everything that run.
---
It is a thing. Even druid cats have a version of it. Why people don't bother to use it when they're threat capped, I dunno.
---
He might have turned anti-aliasing off.
---
It won‚Äôt weapon swap mid swing, do it while moving or right after a swing
---
If there is any actually shop im 100% going to private server. Not paying frikin 15‚Ç¨ per month to see an in game shop.
---
Sounds good, have a good weekend.
---
Anahita. Still have that hunter.
---
It depends a little on your group.  If you already have great dps, you will have better damage mitigation by being able to stun mobs a lot and block the stuff you don't stun.  Threat talents make threat a non issue except on 5+ mobs but you'll have that as as arms or fury as well.
---
I mean, you would hate to meet them in the real world, but not because they are aggressively hostile. Because they are sniveling losers or 13 years old.
---
so much this. people who flame me, go look up shadowfang right now. On my server, its already 300g. I got it for mroe than 75% less.
---
How do you think gurubashi will be when world pvp comes out? come on guys. its smart to plan ahead.
---
petition to ban this sort of post please!! i saw an idea for a ‚ÄúShare Your Success‚Äù megathread that i really think is a great idea

I report them when I see them on Grob. You gotta take an active hand if you want to cultivate a server culture.
---
That chest is not easy to obtain
---
It used to be that way in vanilla too. I was always under the impression that it's because level 19 battle grounds twinks consume lots of wool bandages.
---
I'm so sorry for your loss. But that's great you were able to  form such a great bond with him. I play on and off as well, I didn't play for about 7 months this year, yet I always come back eventually. I hope you are doing well, and I know your uncle is with you in spirit. üíôüíõüíú
---
Well, if you have a bunch of free time for hobbies, you should consider playing WoW, it is a great time waster.
---
actually im waiting for phase 2 to get my pvp trinket and scouts tabard, and then ill be waiting for bgs.
---
Pair up with a warrior and pala/shaman and pvp can be super fun as a healer. I always enjoyed playing a healer in arena the most.
---
I guess our skillsets were different. I did the winter spring first try and as first demon but kiting things was/is my forte.
---
Oh man it's not even the guys movies... He's wholesome IRL just a super good guy. Check out some of his other work, I think he has a subreddit like Keanu being awesome or something.

Oh, yeah, thanks man, I use the Nvidia post processing through geforce experience. It is the details filter, I cant remember exactly what values I use off the top of my head, but it is a night and day difference!
---
Ymirrrr
---
Ediquette they picked up from retail in 2004. People in retail now wave or say hello when farming because you aren't fighting your own faction for nodes anymore. That's a feature that should have been brought into classic. Stop blaming retail for problems because you don't like it. You people always blame retail for the problems that don't exist anymore because blizz fixed them. I just don't get it. I see shit like this all the time and it's so frustrating to read. It's like you haven't played retail in 8 years or something. Go use your 110 boost and play bfa you'll probably like it.
---
Why would you want to lose your money AND your honor?
---
Who is telling all these mobs our names???
---
&gt; an oppressive communist regime 
---
There are more people living under "oppressive communist regime" than in the "free" US and EU combined. And most of them are pretty happy with their lives.

Daily reminder that warriors who choose to dps are the main reason we struggle to find tanks. OP did the right thing!!

I don't know if you're intentionally missing the point or what but I think most people were largely shocked to see an American company take the line of the CCP, and then aid/abet their censorship efforts of a movement that the American public sees as largely sympathetic to their own values. What Apple is doing is *also* bad (as you've rightly pointed out) - however, why would Apple also being bad prevent you from doing the right thing in re: to Blizzard? 
---
&gt;i'm just sitting here tired of being told I'm a terrible person for still playing WoW by some attention seeker with their brand new iPhone and airpods. Statistically, a significant number of people posting in this thread are doing so from an iPhone and frankly they can get fucked for looking down on anyone else.
---
I gotta be honest man - you feeling bad because people are pointing out you're making a morally lazy choice is 100% not our problem. That's a you thing. If you feel ashamed, perhaps look inward and try to figure out why it is you feel that way. I'm sympathetic to the "god damn fuck these people who live terribly and then chide me for JUST THIS ONE LITTLE THING" - really, i am. Like... I love Juuling. It got me off cigs, i love the feel.. all of it. So when people who slug 40 beers a weekend ask me "if i'm okay with just killing myself like that" it used to drive me insane. After a little while though I realized that Juuling is unfortunately shitty for you and I should definitely stop and the only reason I had been resisting the right choice was because I was digging in my heels against all the nanny's telling me to stop. So, tl;dr: I get it, man.
---
Thank you! Right?! WoW has taught me quite a bit that public schooling never has. Especially when it comes to AH economies and how they work!
---
I‚Äôm not kidding I‚Äôm thinking of making another priest just to have two of each spec so I don‚Äôt have to. First time every playing priest and I‚Äôm just ripping everyone to shreds. It‚Äôs really nice
---
You could say they are far between and few.  It is two ideas:
---
There are few good tanks.  
---
There is a far distance between them.
---
lmao "Well Spotted"
---
Wowhead is very accurate for a lot of things especially raid drops, and I think you will find most people agree with me when I say 40-50% sounds correct. 
---
If you know the reasons why drop rates might be inaccurate, you know how to judge if it is accurate.
---
Pretty sure you just hit the play button and then you get to see what happens, since you know, you would love to.
---
hope your server is in my battlegroup bud. so I can make your 19 WSG experience enjoyable.
---
You people keep saying this as if it makes your "tiny stands to do something" any more relevant in the grand scheme of things.
---
I only had 77k. Rip me as of 18th

That's great and all but it only works if your DPS waits for you to get aggro first lol

Currently farming the pre-BiS pieces (or near-pre BiS) from Mara and ST. 
---
For the bear tank shoulders in ST I am soloing the guards that drop them (and the drop rate is abysmal). Once the belt, pants etc drops off of one of the 6, is it still possible to have the shoulders drop or should I run out and reset?
---
For Mara, I haven‚Äôt seen too many comments about feral druids (cat or bear) soloing Princess. I would think it‚Äôs possible but haven‚Äôt tried yet. Anyone have input on this as well?
---
I realized this after I made it, sad priest noises.
---
If you could replace the healer ... Since you have heals .. that could be nuts if y'all sweat
---
So no proof?
---
You run subtlety right? I‚Äôm just doing a standard combat spec
---
You don't think, after the *fourth* time you won a need roll, you might think, hey, maybe I'll let someone *else* win a roll this time?
---
No that wasn't available in vanilla.
---
I can't think of any issues stemming from Blizzard being "severely neutered" by Activision apart from what's happening right now to be honest. Besides, isn't it their fault if they now lack autonomy, given that they willingly relinquished that when they agreed to be purchased by another company? 
---
Also, to address your original post - isn't it fair to blame Blizzard for this latest controversy given that they're the ones who officially took action (regardless if the orders came from higher up)?
---
HEY, THE KING'S BACK.
---
When meele out &amp; meele in thingy.

---
LOL you're selectively picking shit to "protest"  while ignoring other shit that is convenient to you. How nobel. How rightous. 
---
You're only "gamer chair protesting" Blizzard because you want to feel included in something and it's being spoonfed to you.  Did you protest China before MeAn OlE BlIzZaRd? Do you protest against the 85,000 children under five dying from starvation in Syria? The 200,000+ Civilians killed in Syria, 30,000 being children? How about the Armenian Genocide? Cambodia? Rwanda? How about Bosnia? Of course not. How about those AmErIcAn VaLuEs you bring up - in Iraq? South America? Vietnam?
---
How are you protesting China whilst still using a computer/phone? How are you protesting China while using Reddit, which as received funding from Chinese companies, ran on chinese made hardware? Gotta get that Karma right? You're pitiful, woefully uneducated and needing attention. You speak taking "baby steps" but ignore the bigger picture in your quest for karma. Get fucked and go read a book.

My friend's main name was Hole with the salty title. He then leveled a paladin and asked me what should I name it? I was like why not Pinkhole since it's the class color. So his pally was Salty Pinkhole. Got reported and he just kept putting it back to the same name. They finally were like LISTEN! So he is now  salty pinkpeach
---
It's okay buddy. You can still go to STV and kill level 30s.
---
Sorry, that‚Äôs just some sad fantasy in your mind. 
---
Griefing was always quickly responded to because it was an opportunity for the victim faction to mobilize its own 60s for free HKs. DHKs also nuke your honor, weakening your own faction in a sense by denying potential pvp gear. 
---
Go play on a fucking pve server if you don‚Äôt want to get killed or griefed. That‚Äôs literally what they are there for.
---
Or.. ya know leave it to people who care to share what foresight they have.

Hong Kong
---
Hey, thats my nr. 1 excuse!

you can top the threat meter!

A dps shaman. Stressing "A". I've found that almost all shaman want to go dps and it's simply not feasible to have 6 of them with none healing.

thanks! I try to challenge 30s and up when I can, usually on either ratchet boat or ratchet itself, or on the zeppelins!

So, you're a racist then? Gotcha.
---
Idk why you would want to do this, but unless you have a full group of good players you already know i wouldn‚Äôt suggest doing this... just seems like a lot of extra time and effort having people leave because you don‚Äôt have a warrior tank, or impateince with group running into problems
---
classiclfg is the original one, now there is group bulletin board, dungeon finder, and like 5 others that I don't use cause they are buggy / shitty

Basement scum.
---
I've given up fighting back in clearly unwinnable situations (??, multiple people, or the most common: engaging when I'm @ &lt; 50% hp). 
---
Instead I stop whatever I'm doing, turn to them, and /sigh.
---
I wish my friends hadn't wanted a PvP server :(
---
It actually does as well... 
---
Spell batching, layering, bugs like skull of impending doom not working as intended or frost reflector not working properly, connection issues, performance issues with mass PvP...You need more?
---
got really lucky when the game first launched on auction house.
---
No I think they might consider one down the road if you mention it to them. People just love going to Reddit to complain (or talk about how ‚Äúfunny‚Äù it is) when all we really need to do is actually educate people where they will see it, in game.
---
You do you, I just hope that next time you consider taking a few seconds to inform them before making a post like this.
---
It's allowed but requires a bit more explaining.  You aren't allowed to log in on myltuple characters from the same account, but if you pay for multiple subscriptions you can log in on one from each account.  So multiboxing requires one subscription per character you see them controlling.
---
Did you play 1 to 60..or you bought a 60 lol
---
The auction house is saturated with leather right now.  It's pretty straight forward to get to 225 in 2-3h if you're willing to spend ~30g.
---
Because of the utility of lifetap you basically never want to be at 100% life (unless you're at 100% mana as well) because it means you're not in a position to regain any life (i.e. recharging your mana battery).  Because of this I'll try to usually float around 75%ish health.  Then after some fights I'll tap lower an cannibalize or if I need to eat.  Or maybe one easier fights just use siphon/drain life to sustain myself.  That said, it never hurts to just mention something to the locks just to make sure everyone's on the same page.

Long live China

Because feint uses Energy, and I, as a rogue, am contractually required to use all my Energy on dealing as much damage as possible because otherwise I can‚Äôt link the damage meters showing how massive my epeen is.

Sarcasm, btw.

You need a better guild then, I'm afraid. Druids make fine tanks and excellent healers. 
---
Even cat or moonkin brings a lot of utility to bear(Im sorry) with innervate, combat rez, etc. Plus, someone to help with buffing never hurts.
---
Named myself Kuntpunt. Someone was salty and reported it also.

We were also talking stupid like on purpose haha yeah or next video will be a lot more edited and see how that one is received.

I'm going to be honest. I don't think I had the spellpower enchant, so I enchanted it with Intellect and never really changed it.
---
Hmm I just checked. 5 agility on my 60 warrior is 0.25% crit, so 20 would be 1% crit, so I was a little off.
---
Your job is to keep the group (reads as "the tank") alive, not to keep everybody filled up at every time. Focus on your tank and just heal them a little bit if you feel they will die. If they complain remember them that trading their mana with yours (that's what they do when they life tap as hell) is not going to benefit your group because you will need it to keep the tank alive and it will also slow you down because of drinking (but you will probably drink a lot anyway until you get some sp/hp or mp5). If they keep doing it just stop healing them. Let them die. I know it's an hard thing to do as a healer but sometimes it is a necessity.
---
Great minds think alike
---
I kinda feel bad for hunters who haven't played any other class.  The pet always runs up and taunts the mobs and you can open up right way and usually won't pull threat off the pet until 4-5 shots in and that's only if the next taunt misses.  I'm sure it confuses new hunters as to why tanks don't do it the same.
---
I prefer dildobangings
---
Cheese and some processed lunch meat. So good. So bad.... Lol

My god i hate you

As 2 others have already explained, this sounds exactly like how MadSeasonShow said it, but I'm not blaming you  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
---
Not if they move it to Shanghai...
---
As much as I would prefer classic +. at this point trusting Blizzard is borderline retarded. The company is falling apart.
---
Respectfully.
---
Eh. 2h Fury is still fine, just don't dual wield.
---
The benefit to MS is that it's weapon damage based, so a better weapon makes it hit harder. Bloodthirst is attack power based, so a better weapon might make it slightly weaker if the better weapon has less attack power on it. 
---
You'll kill things slightly faster as Arms, but Fury is more resistant to weapon droughts imo.
---
My "job" is to use the tools at my disposal to ensure the run go as smooth as possible. You wanna argue the semantically defined bounds of that, be my guest.
---
thats a million dollar idea right there lmao

That sounds like a problem with your internet or hardware, twitch is pretty reliable for showing video content, that‚Äôs pretty much all it does.

Not even with some bread??
---
im not 100% on this yet, but I chose 3/3 improved sinister strike, 3/5 raw crit chance, and 5/5 opportunity. I have macros to make my backstab and ambush automatically equip my +5 wpn damage assassin's blade into the mainhand, and sinister strike automatically equip shadowfang.
---
remorseless attacks looks juicy though
---
In early vanilla, I was always in IF. Easy raid access and AH access. 
---
In later vanilla, I used SW and IF depending on needs. SW for buffs. IF for proximity. 
---
I also had a horde alt 60 shaman in vanilla, but he was pvp only. 
---
As a horde player now, i find my hearth and main town is Kargath (badlands) as our closest main city is a very long flight away. I am much more reliant on an AH alt to manage my AH related needs.
---
Gz, I had mine drop on my 18 run, but at least it's easier to solo as a hunter.
---
Does Syria control American corporate policy? NOPE. I protest when foreign governments interfere with american freedoms or when american corporations enforce foreign policy over domestic rights! Your argument is misguided.

---
How do you turn on extended stats?
---
SA upgrades in the 40s and 50s make it more valuable again. Otherwise, your experience is generally right.

Thinking same thing, but our server is chill af

Especially since he‚Äôs updated all the content for Classic and he‚Äôs back to active.

You wouldn't do this over MS. You'd do this because you don't have MS yet and need a rage dump.

You‚Äôll see Daggers rogues using Feint far more often than any other type. Combat doesn‚Äôt care about mob facing, so they‚Äôre going to keep hitting Sinister Strike all day. If a Daggers rogue gets aggro, we can‚Äôt Backstab, and our Sinister Strikes suck. We‚Äôre going to ditch aggro any chance we get just so we can go back to Backstabbing.
---
Stealth runs to princess are a common way for rogues / druids to make money.
---
I mean surely there's a line somewhere though, right? You'll play the game if it's worth $15, fair enough. But there is NO action a company can take that would make you not support them as long as they make a good game?
---
22 agility on shoulder seems quite a bit better if you dont need the hit since that's 0.4% crit and 44 ap vs 24 ap
---
It's worth noting that, even though hit's affecting 60% of your physical dps, attack power affects 100% of your physical dps. There's got to be a balance, mindlessly dropping a high +ap item for a +1% hit item is probably going to be a loss overall as a result.
---
Rogues probably have the second most complicated gear decisions to make as a result, following only Fury Warriors, because of this.
---
Great, thank you.

You don't see anyone helping in a Mak'gora. All 1vs1 is considered a Mak'gora in my eyes. For the horde!

You're right.  I really should have phrased it that I want them to go down in flames.  They won't though.

I hope it'll stop bothering me too

I just don't understand why they couldn't make theese sounds for striders done right, I don't remember other mounts to have the same issues

But again, looks like it doesn't bother anyone

i think this is overstated; low level healers will struggle at times depending on the dungeon and group. but a strong group wont miss a beat with a low level healer
---
The top comment of the first link literally has someone saying they sold theirs for 10g. 
---
The 4th comment says it dropped on one server from 400-50g and a comment to that says it was still 300 on their server. 
---
Here's a chain that mentions numerous prices including as low as 9g

My pet is called meatspin, I'm unsure whether that's offensive or not. I mean, I guess it's only offensive if you know what it is? Meatspin is a fitting name for a bear imo!

Ganking is literally the point of a pvp server. Some guy killing your mobs? Kill him.

Some guy killed you while killing your mobs? Call a guildmate to take care of him. 
---
It‚Äôs called emergent gameplay, something people don‚Äôt seem to be very familiar with anymore now that games cater to the lowest common denominator.
---
Turned on the "Details" filter and holy shit everything looked amazing, only problem with it is for whatever reason it slaughters my FPS hard, I got a pretty beefy machine, went from 144 FPS (V-Sync Monitor cap) to 63, still playable but I didn't think it would take a huge tole on FPS considering all it does it just add a filter o_o I'll tweak it a bit and see if I can fix it, but yeah this is amazing, thanks for opening my eyes to this.
---
And Shaman Elemental Mastery to Chain Lightning feels like that every 3 minutes.

5-8 sets a day lol. Screenshot and make a video of that please. Lying sack.

oh i thought they were soulbound but you‚Äôre right you can just apply to someone else true
---
I'm leveling a sub rogue... Improved ambush : there's no way I would put the sword in the main hand (and I don't want to bother making weapon swap macros). But sometimes I run with a sword in offhand if I didn't find a good dagger.
---
So sometimes people aren't wrong, they are just playing differently.
---
yeah if you're the only hunter in the raid that needs one
---
He should have killed the warrior and then rezed his friend.
---
This increases mend pet? What content would this open up specifically?
---
Just for the additional challenge; I would clearly announce it before the run and only invite players that are wary that it's experimental and for the fun.
---
Are you trolling?
---
If you saying it says for 9g isn‚Äôt proof. Why would someone else saying it be proof? Why can‚Äôt you just show me actual proof instead of rumors on reddit?
---
Same exact thing happened to me. Super awesome guildies helped hook it up. Now I‚Äôm in debt and have benediction, wouldn‚Äôt want it any other way lol
---
That would be super effective
---
&gt;The taunt is for the healer in fact they should rename it to the ‚Äúsave the healer‚Äù skill.
---
That's so wrong.  Taunt is a short cooldown, you should be using it often and not just for healers.  If a healer is pulling aggro you have other issues.
---
I was using hyperbole to make a point. Obviously people outside of those places can dislike him too
---
Twinstar is garbage
---
Of course! And yes, I can confirm, it takes a toll on fps, actually almost exactly the same as you described, on my machine.
---
not even close
---
You're absolutely right, but if the trinket is already equipped, it will use it. So the same button can be used to equip and use it.
---
Yes. Totally fine. That‚Äôs the game. You compete against other players. That‚Äôs the *multiplayer* in massively *multiplayer* online rpg. 
---
It‚Äôs also the *player* vs *player* part of *pvp*
---
If you don‚Äôt want to get ganked (or gank) literally why would you play on a pvp server? It‚Äôs *literally* the point.
---
&gt; Because it likely wasn't a decision made solely by Bobby Kotick?
---
And you're calling *me* obtuse? lel
---
Yes, but you need to get the hit elsewhere. So you already wear a subpar bow (striker's) as 1 of your hit. Now where else are you going to sacrifice stats to get the other 1 hit truestrike gave you?
---
Your 22 agi on shoulder is going to have to outweight the 24 AP from truestrike, the dps loss from striker's mark, and the dps loss from whatever other item you sacrifice to get the hit back.
---
You cannot win this argument dude. Just give up. Its fucking pathetic watching you try to justify stealing a melee BiS when you have fucking Rhok Delar all to yourself.
---
USE YOUR BRAIN MAN. STOP TRYING TO STEAL MELEE GEAR.
---
I've stayed as Feral at 60, doing an almost full tanking spec (11/35/5). I play on a PvP server and there is no way I'm not having Feline Swiftness. I find it too essential for PvP and solo farming. I've got my two BiS trinkets, shoulders from ST, Devilsaur set, Warden Staff, and one of my BiS rings (no-one's doing Battle of Darrowshire for my other one). 
---
Now the question I'm facing is that I always planned to be HoTW spec prior to Classic's release. I'm also picking up healing gear as a consequence of most groups I'm in not having Druids. Switching to a HoTW build would mean losing 5/5 Thick Hide, Natural Weapons, Leader of the Pack and Omen of Clarity. I'm curious about how much this would affect my overall tanking ability. 
---
I should state that I have no intentions of raiding. I don't have the time freedom to do it. Sure, I obviously have the time to play, it's just inconsistent. I have a 5 year old so my time is highly fragmented. I can run a dungeon, but not when it's at a specific time, if that makes sense. 
---
So for 5-man and 10-man dungeons, is HoTW spec good enough in  good enough gear to get by? And is it fair on groups for me to put my hand up to tank if I'm not running the best spec for it?
---
Have you heard of the High Elves?
---
Sam should be a mage that‚Äôs only spell is conjuring food.
---
"lmao" someone types this when they're upset? lol
---
Spy should be banned
---
Thanks for the reply! I‚Äôm feral but have a pretty decent healing set (pre BiS/2/8 T1), maybe I could do it without the talents.
---
I‚Äôve had 5 straight leafs drop. There was no hunter present for the fifth.
---
What about that stealthed Devilsaur that's about to jump on your ass?
---
I was going for Dr. Ian Malcolm, but that works too :)
---
Geddon is just bad. Don‚Äôt follow the geddon timers at all.
---
Look. There should be AT MOST 3 hunters in your raid. If there is more, find a new guild. 
---
There should be 8-15 melee in your raid that all want strikers. 
---
Leaf is a 50% drop.
---
Striker's is a 14% drop.
---
USE YOUR BRAIN.
---
STOP TRYING TO STEAL MELEE GEAR.
---
I love omen. It's a fun mechanic that adds some RNG to the otherwise repetitive process of killing mobs.  My goal was to get feral swiftness and then get omen of clarity. 
---
What actually happened was I rushed Feral for the 3% crit at the bottom of the tree. At 55 I Respec'd full resto which in my opinion was a huge mistake.
---
If I could do it again I would do something like [this](https://legacy-wow.com/vanilla-talents/druid-talents/?tal=00000000000000005032021303022100055000000000000) and then continue going down the feral tree. 
---
If you don't see yourself healing anything I'd still consider getting furor and forego improved healing touch.
---
Show me?
---
My friends response to that was "wow i suck"
---
Of course.
---
The balance is roughly 16 ap = 1% hit.
---
I like your style

Ill just delete my account. I don't want to offend anyone. No point in coming on here if it's all just memes.
---
That‚Äôs fair, Jeff Goldblum is the üêê
---
I was pretty clear that AOEing is fine at appropriate circumstances. And of course at top tier you can just burn through everything anyway because of superior levels and gear, at that point tactics hardly matter because of how quickly things die, but don‚Äôt sit there and say ‚ÄúI was just making commentary‚Äù when you grossly oversimplify the situation to make a point and then get all indignant when you‚Äôre treated like you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôre doing.
---
It's worth running if you don't even sell any rings, that's why they do it.
---
&gt; I can't think of any issues stemming from Blizzard being "severely neutered" by Activision apart from what's happening right now to be honest.
---
Then you either don't play Blizzard games or are not being honest
---
&gt; Also, to address your original post - isn't it fair to blame Blizzard for this latest controversy given that they're the ones who officially took action (regardless if the orders came from higher up)?
---
It's fair, only if you put equal parts blame on Activision
---
They just vendor the other drops they'd be farming anyway.
---
It doesn't change anything about the Maraudon boss farm except rings are worth 20g instead of 1 and change.
---
You can make almost 40g/hr without selling the rings to players.
---
Showed this skip to a pug and they kicked me out because I was "retarded" and "wasted their time."
---
Cause I'm at work and I aint gonna log into wow and go onto every server and fucking price check something and screen shot it for you. If you don't believe me fine, but it's well know that depending on a servers economy items prices can fluctuate. On Mankirk wool goes for as much or more than silk ATM it shouldn't be that way but it is. 
---
Plus what would all these people have to gain by lying about the prices of a pattern on their server at various points over the last 3 weeks.
---
I still have my 10th anniversary Thrall. It's definitely a prized possession.
---
wtf do you mean, downranking starts at 60 with enough gear.
---
Rejuv + cat dps while levelling, with the occasional HT is enough
---
I‚Äôd agree unless you‚Äôre on an RP realm
---
This is hands down my favorite meme to appear on this sub yet!
---
Maybe not in defensive stance?
---
Battle or berserker stance = 0.8 threat, defensive stance = 1.3 threat (1.45 if specced into defiance in the prot tree.)
---
"Alliance scums"? Aren't you a horde faction fanboi??
---
2 handed, to many misses with the offhand
---
retard alert
---
Not often, but at times. It matters more for when you'r have a pet on you and can't hibernate it for whatever reason. Most classes have an interrupt, so you either bait it and cast away, or you get locked out. 
---
It's probably the least important of the resto talents. I'd argue that reflection has more value in certain group PvP fights if your gear has decent spirit on it.
---
You can soulstone items?
---
Best bet is going arms from this point until 60.  You can tank fine and also solo quest with out much issue.  Once 60, go port for tanking or 2h fury until you are geared enough for dual.
---
Yeah, but that's not what people mean when they say NIMBY. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIMBY
---
I had a healer do over 50% overhealing. Idk what he was thinking or his logic behind his heals lol
---
Ring Menu type mods are great for that
---
Are you coordinating your targets with other dps members in the group? I‚Äôve found it works best to designate one dps member as the target focus. Once he‚Äôs attacking a mob then press F when targeting him or click his target mob. That way the tank knows which order to target with his singe threat generating abilities. This also will drastically improve your groups efficiency and time on runs as well than having dps members not focused on the same targets most of the time.
---
For the Alliance!
---
my spec is in favour of tanking 31 feral, 5 furor , starting on natures grasp. i need to respec, but holding off currently till i know if i will dps or tank long term with guild. Gear is all high str/ agi would be the same if i was pure feral dps i think. rotation is in cat form claw x 5 into ferocius bite, occationally refresing energy if i have mana. or if bear to save hp just maul till dead.
---
Why is Mc easier? 
---
1. We have 1.12 gear and talents. Basically, our gear and talents are twice as good as they were when MC was first cleared. 
---
2. We have 1.12 conveniences. We can mark adds. Imagine doing Garr without marking adds. 
---
3. We have 1.12 MC nerfs. MC is just flat out easier. 
---
4. We have addons that were not around when MC was first cleared. Addons like DBM came out after BWL was cleared by early guilds if I recall right.
---
5. We have faster computers and internet. Less latency means faster response times. The number of wipes due to people lagging was significant. 
---
6. We have 15 years of data on how to min max based on private servers and vanilla experience. We also have 15 years of videos on how to clear content. MC was released back in an era when people did not share videos on how they cleared content. It was secret. My guild was a server first guild. Nowhere near world first. We had no one telling us how fights worked. We kept wiping and figured each fight out slowly. 
---
7. Raid leaders in most MC farming guilds know every fight well. Most members have watched a guide. People know how the fights work from videos and experience and not just from multiple wipes. 
---
MC was challenging 15 years ago. It would not be challenging in a game today. Even if the game was new. Our computers and internet are better. We have streamers who make money by giving away tips on how to kill bosses by streaming the kills. The world is different. But MC is even easier because some of these people have been doing this for a rude awakening. 
---
Are MMO players better today? Maybe. But a lot of it is the better systems, better information, and just better talents and gear in 1.12.
---
I do some aoe farming in ZF and if I aggro a mob at the beginning on accident the aggro drops before I get to graveyard. Epic mount so idk if that matters or not.
---
I'm pretty sure people have received suspensions for doing this, so I'd be careful using emotes like this.
---
Yes but you can't really compare 2hand leveling to duelwield raid minmaxing.
---
Manual crowd pummelers are BIS weapons as well to be honest. Not the most fun
---
Her majesty's ship
---
I would say I disagree. When grinding for Rank 13 I liked just how much of a difference I could do as a dedicated healer in random groups. Especially in the opening AB fights. Just running after the warrior with the biggest weapon and spamming dispells.
---
The key is to just let the warlocks die. I've had locks like this. And I try to make them understand, as a healer, it's much easier for me to heal u in rotation if you are tapping in rotation. If u tap yourself 5 times in a row down to 5% hp, dont cry when you get 1 shot. 
---
If all else fails. Let them die. They will learn when they don't want to keep paying repair bills. 
---
I also find that trading their own healthstones back to them mid dungeon helps get my point across too.
---
Why is this the only Blizzard-related sub that is suppressing all discussion about the Hong Kong situation? Even /r/wow has a megathread about it. I realize that we don't want posts flooding the front page, but it seems shitty to just completely block all talk about it from the sub.
---
Haha, right, he complains too much to listen to anyone. All I ever get from him is sass. Send me back this, I don't like this place that. We get it negative nancy.
---
I had a friend who was forced by Blizzard to change his name from "Bra" which he had for years.
---
The criteria for offensive names truly took a turn at some point with Blizzard. I just assume any name that can be remotely construed to even mean something as juvenile as women's underwear will get reported and changed.
---
But this is what is confusing for me, most end game warriors are raiding, which means they are attacking higher level mobs which should increase misses. I was confused as I did not get why missing is no problem for raiding but when grinding, questing on lower level mobs it is such a problem
---
Accidentally, I believe. People were mostly having to guess at certain things like armor values and damage values when making the private servers, as Vanilla just didn't have the same kind of robust theorycrafting and data mining community that would come with later expansions.
---
it's simply one action among many available avenues.  Cancelling my sub to Blizzard isn't the only step I'm taking.  I'm raising my personal awareness of the atrocities China is committing.  What's going on in Hong Kong pales by comparison to what they're doing to Uighur Muslims.  China's pushing their agenda on the world, and I don't think we can afford to be complacent with a nation that doesn't balk at murdering healthy individuals to feed their booming human organ trade.  It's well beyond time to push back.
---
low level leather isn't worth much but if you vendor it as you level up it gets you quite a bit of extra gold.
---
We understood them fine back in 2006, maybe the issue is you?
---
&gt; paying for network access...
---
I think you've hit the nail on the head as to why Blizzard didn't hesitate to take China's side (part of the reason, anyway).  If all of their servers are in China (the way all of Apple's manufacturing is located in China), they've painted themselves into a real corner by locking themselves into a cheap option over a secure one.
---
That being said, they still did what they did, and they had options, just less more complicated ones, so they're getting no pity from me.
---
Yes but you still make like 60g and hr just doing the runs lol, the 20g from the ring dropping is just a bonus
---
Thanks for reminding me to download the extended character stats mod. I keep forgetting!
---
[Yes](https://web.archive.org/web/20151211090030/https://eu.battle.net/support/en/article/ninja-looting-policy). I'm sure you'll find something more up to date if you want to go digging for it.
---
I disagree. It does for me.
---
I guess maybe the steady flow of rage with dual wields allows for a smoother raiding experience
---
Oh shit really? I‚Äôve been doing it for a decade lol. I only do it once in a while, though. Definitely wouldn‚Äôt do it often enough to make yourself known for it.
---
Nice work, but I have to take off point cuz I see ganking someone especially while they are mid pull as a massively dick move.
---
Instant ignores are probably from reports.
---
Mine are DotOrg (warlock), MicDagger (rogue), Winfurry (Tauren shaman). Pretty happy about them tbh.
---
Because everyone is farming gear at level 60. 99% of level 19s are just trying to get to level 20 and taking a break to have some fun. Or not, if twinks are ruining the low level bgs.
---
Not to mention a twink isn't getting their own gear, they're relying on higher levels to run dungeons and quests and farm gold for them.
---
Meanwhile, the average level 19 might be lucky to have a Cruel Barb or Venomstrike.
---
There's a reason twink bgs died off when they were quarantined to no-xp groups. Its because the fun dies off when you cant dump on noobs.
---
how is it a non sequitor?
---
it's not my fault you can't read.
---
Offer in .org or under city that you are doing free lockpoicks
---
Ice cold.
---
have you tried the classic druid discord? This sounds like a question right up their alley (esp in the feral board)
---
leveling gear doesn't have hit. dual wield needs hit.
---
Don‚Äôt play retail, babe. But after a couple characters, not everyone is interested in the slog of classic leveling again. Some people value their time differently than you and find leveling not a worthwhile expenditure of their time. Thus, they are willing to spend some money to skip that task, feeling a few hours of pay is worth skipping a few days /played (weeks of work for many).
---
I think it‚Äôs pretty clear if you‚Äôre this twisted up about people suggesting you‚Äôre making a morally lazy choice then you probably know you are. If people think it‚Äôs the ‚Äúcool‚Äù choice to do the right thing I don‚Äôt really care if they jerk themselves off over it, tbh - and neither should you, imo.
---
Your laptop is greasy af
---
29 is rogue crit not sure for warriors. agi is also ap for rogues but not warriors
---
It's only so far off because it's surprising to anyone who's played a Warrior. Warrior tanking is tedious and boring to most of us, an exercise in frustration. And that's before missing out on talents like Sweeping Strike that can make the process a bit easier.
---
If it fits you, if you aren't feeling put out and you like the pace of it, that's great. People just aren't used to that sort of attitude.
---
Same, even if it‚Äôs a toon even with grey gear, no mount, barebones abilities, for people that can only play a few hours a week this would be a godsend. I don‚Äôt see them implementing it this early.
---
I know that it was a thing around wotlk and cata that could get you a slap on the wrist from blizz
---
Burning question about hit chance and weapon skill level,
---
  So basically there‚Äôs a big debate in my guild about the importance of hot chance for humans vs non human classes due to the passive weapon expertise skill.
---
  Is it true that humans technically only need 6% hit chance va raid mobs with swords or is it will 9%, where weapon skill only affects glancing blows.
---
 This has become a huge point of contention regarding loot distribution and as such, I would be happy to finally quash it.
---
  From what I gather most sources explain that a higher weapon skill does factor into what is a require hit chance to never miss on a 63 Raid boss; thus humans requiring less hit in gear to compensate
---
Gay
---
Actually classic wow is doing great right now!
---
There is a macro you can use to insta buy the recipe. Only way I got it
---
You just made me gain 10 lbs
---
Yeah, that's my hyperhydrosis Lol
---
That makes sense, thank you
---
This is about a video game not politics. Take that stuff somewhere else imo. Glad I don‚Äôt have to go through politics while trying geek out.
---
because they can pick up a ton of chance to hit gear by then
---
Woolcloth is always more expensive than silk.
---
Is shredded American for the English ‚Äògrater‚Äô?
---
Not attacking, just asking
---
Ok, thank you
---
I feel 1000% personally violated by this meme. 
---
I will literally have enough food to make a meal but something about 3am shredded cheese straight out of the bag just....slaps.
---
Here is some tips!
---
Pay a mage for a bunch of water, even if it‚Äôs just a second drink and start healing. 
---
Renew before a pull doesn‚Äôt cause any threat. So prepull Renew tank drink. 
---
If a dps dies just say my bad, a lot going on. 
---
Rez and move on. 
---
Speak up, a lot of people think tanks run the groups. You are the most important part of the group. Bad tank, bad dps it‚Äôs fine with a good healer. Bad healer is always a wipe. 
---
Also man, as frustrating as it is shitty groups like that condition you to be a better healer in terms of prioritizing heals and mana efficiency through down ranking.
---
Friend of mine bought one from a guy and they did a total of 23 runs, never dropped. The guy gave him his gold back and said sorry but he can't keep going lol
---
my friend won the roll on one sold it on ah for 100g
---
I remember seeing theme for 400-500g in vanilla at least on Kil Jaden server
---
So legit question, how is twinking a thing in Classic/Vanilla? Especially with no BGs out?
---
Are you basically going to just retire him until phase 3? I can see you going around and trying to gank players in open world, but even with that twink gear, I don't see how you can ever win against a level 60 (you'll miss all your attacks).
---
It's not only "the impact a few kills and there". Multiple that by the number of players who think like you. Plus, since every players are braving about themself about ganking (ie: advertise on faerlina), that makes more players want to gank lowbies to get use to WPvP. Then, all the attacking faction are tracking down every players on the opposite faction and gank them down.
---
Yes, ganking lowbies does kill servers.
---
It's a lot of things.
---
One example: For duelwield fury to be nice, you need a good uptime of flurry, which means having high crit chance, you won't ever get that while leveling.
---
Second: For duelwield to be good you need 2 strong weapons. That's easy to get when you have all the time in the world to farm dungeons and getting those best weapons, but when you are leveling it is very difficult to keep up having 2 strong onehanders compared to 2handers. You can get 2handers so easily while leveling.
---
Why you can buy it from a vendor
---
Yes, god forbid human rights abuses intrude on your entertainment.
---
i would just spam /lol at my friend
---
Have I got some good news for you...
---
True. My lvl 28 shaman is 225/225 because I took skinning on my main while leveling. Leather is extremely cheap to come by so I didn‚Äôt bother selling it.
---
I don't think the argument "if it was an exploit it would have been patched" has ever worked against blizzard, if they felt like it they would ban people for doing this and say "you're walking on the air, obviously an exploit"
---
its pretty much required on a pvp server
---
Imagine thinking a single person makes decisions for a multi billion dollar company.
---
That'd actually be fun if more people acted like u did.
---
Re ‚Äúcapitalism cannot fix these issues, only our ideals can‚Äù:
---
You are very close but I think you‚Äôre missing one critical point. In order for our ideals to fix anything, we have to be able to TALK about our ideals. That‚Äôs why China is working so very hard to prevent people from talking about foreign ideals within earshot of their people, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs so very important that we stand up to Chinese censorship wherever possible. If we can talk, then we can convince. If we cannot talk, we have already lost.

There‚Äôs 4 chickens striking a majestic pose and then the one chicken that‚Äôs like *CLUCK CLUCK WTF SHE GONNA EAT US YOU IDIOTS CLUCK*
---
Looks good, I just got mine in the other day, was a bit put off that I had to attach some parts but it is what it is. Rag is one of the best bosses in the game and one of my favorite Heroes in HOTS
---
I think it would be great for half the community and shit for the other half based on what they want
---
My guild is doing Molten Core tomorrow, and as a 53 and 51, I'm wondering what level we HAVE to be. Our guild is accepting literally everyone that can get in, so that's not an issue.
---
The attunement quest is level 55, but would it be possible to run it at 53 through BRD? Many websites show 50 being the minimum level for Molten Core, so if we can travel through BRD, we would do this. Just wondering if it's possible or if anyone has done this before.
---
It shouldn't be but Blizzard has always allowed it because of money, so it is what it is.
---
Yup.
---
Dont forget about the lifetapping warlock. THATS MY FAVORITE.
---
For end game, no "hardcore" players would like to raid with a protection or a retribution paladin expect if you are a "celebrity" (ie: Esfand).
---
I always love to see what other people do with their key binds. I've more or less used the same type of setup since I started playing heavily in TBC.
---
For me, I always have a movement speed ability bound to T, my interrupt on ` with openers on E and finishing moves (or equivalent) on Q.
---
I've also got a mouse with 12 buttons on the side that I bind to the Num Pad and I assign various cooldowns there.
---
As a rogue in Classic I only have about five buttons I use on the regular so I'm used to having more stuff as I raided on a lock for the majority of retail's life. It's been an odd adjustment.
---
Delete cache, disable all addons, Reload Ui, Update/Restart BattleNet, unplug/plug it back in. Start there and see whatch‚Äôya get.
---
Definitely an odd one but most likely UI related
---
There was a megathread a few days ago
---
Of course it is. Cancellations don‚Äôt take effect until the end of the billing cycle so people who cancelled their accounts (myself included) are spending more time than usual on the server to get their last hoorah.
---
*You* not wanting to leave over this does not mean the mass amounts of people literally burning their Blizzard games in public somehow isn't happening. 
---
My friend group all deleted our accounts because we don't want to support genocide.
---
Exactly. If unsure what to blame, retail
---
Yea I see what you mean the nameplates can get cluttered at times. However I find them still easier to target with over not having them in the same situations.
---
Use Heroic Strike only if you have excess Rage.
---
Arms is definitely not best in dungeons lol.  WTF you on?
---
highly doubt it.  Much more likely to just be a random stranger spreading some love.
---
Yeah, this also happens if you crash. It's when the client is unexpectedly disconnected from the server.
---
You didn't count shatter and ice shards ?????
---
I use seal of command with a slow 2 hander. I used to judge on cool down but I don‚Äôt do that anymore. I save my mana instead and I feel like it‚Äôs not worth judging and re activating a seal. Not worth the mana. I just let the SOC run it‚Äôs timer and just reup my seal and not judge. Also I judge the mob with seal of crusader to up my holy damage. When seal of commander procs it usually adds 100-150 damn each proc. 
---
I just reached 60 as Ret. something I just changed in my talent tree is I grabbed consecration. Against world mobs it‚Äôs nice to have but it dungeons instances it feels necessary. Without it‚Äôs AOE damage you end up super low on the damage meter. I. E. It feels like your not contributing as much as the other dps. The added damage of consecration helps so much. Just my two cents. P.s. the guides out there are split. Some say grab seal of crusader for extra holy damage. Some say don‚Äôt it‚Äôs a waste. I find it helps in dungeons and with mobs. My consecration damage does from ticking 8 to 14-15 or something. It‚Äôs adds up.
---
Because the conversation is literally about how your personal opinion is completely meaningless.
---
Hm guess we will see. Doubt it though.
---
No not really .....
---
You should have mind controlled the alliance warrior and giving him fort/renew as a congratulations!
---
Fair enough, I think my biggest reservation is losing all of the BfA progress because I wouldn't maintain my NA subscription if I switched to EU.
---
I thought he was equiping an off-hand :D
---
It also just clearly picked the person with the name closest to erection.
---
Feint is 20 energy.
---
You don't need to be balance, it just makes it faster. You do want caster gear though.
---
Honestly I just realized what sub this is. Not too surprised now. 
---
He‚Äôs fanboying very hard.
---
I believe there are addons that show enemy cast bars, but I personally don't use one at the moment.
---
Just watch his hands when he's casting something at you. Purple/ black Shadowy stuff around his hands means it's a Shadow spell, and red/ orange Fire is... fire lol. Same as when you use Fireball or Frostbolt.
---
When I unlocked Mind Flay as a Priest lmao
---
The yellow hitcap(abilities including heroic strike) is 6% for 305 or higher weaponskill, and 9% for 300. 
---
But that is only forabilities, for duelwield your autoattacks has a huge chance to miss and you will never really get "enough" hit. It's not a god stat like it is before yellow hit cap, but it's still valuable.
---
I run into so many dps that focus on the UNMARKED targets, rather than the ones that are marked, like skull. I even explain to them in the beginning the kill order. Some people are just bad
---
 If you try to enter through BRD solo you will get the message that says You must be a minimum level 50 and in a raid group to enter this instance. So yes it is possible to get into MC under the level of 55. Personally however I think it is an unwise choice to take anybody like that because outside of healing your effect on the raid is more likely to be detrimental than helpful.
---
I don't value stats the same way as you do at 19. I think HP is the best stat across the board for every class at that level, so I have to respectfully disagree.
---
Log out, create new character, pick rogue or shadow priest. Bam problem solved.
---
Respekt!
---
Thanks &lt;3
---
I agree. Its absurd how 'Blizzard' is the wake up call for all these people. Not past few decades of other outrages. But oh no.. muh beloved video game company does something and suddenly 'IM A DEFENDER OF FREEDOM.' Yah right.. what about reduction of free speech, removal of liberties, and more, all around the world? In your own country? 
---
Guess we have to wait for Ubisoft to limit free speech in USA before anyone will do anything.
---
Yeah I'm saving brd strat scholo for Sunday 59 to 60.
---
Most people have to be frugal just to afford their first 100g mount at Level 40. You can check out the mounts on [classic.wowhead.com](https://classic.wowhead.com) if you want to browse how they look visually
---
Nightsabers ARE pretty cool... but it's probably about 1000g to buy enough runecloth to hit exalted.
---
I'm 45 currently healing/tank spec.  But there are a few quests I need to do.  A 47 priest attacks me while I'm low fighting a mob, I was about to turn on him when I see a 54 standing by.  Like I'm going to waste my time.  I just /clap and /sit.  
---
Wooowwwww so good. Do you feel good?  You must be 2400 elo.  So strong.  Wow. 
---
I've had like 10 decent battles with horde.  They are so overpopulated I rarely see 1 alone it's always multiple.  And if you actually beat one they obviously go straight to QQ in /1 and a 69 shows up in minutes to camp you while they quest for free.
---
Oh lmao mb.
---
Im pretty sure, after the last phase, they are just gonna open up BC realms.
---
I‚Äôm not trying to convince anyone mate. I can only speak for myself. 
---
Not sure why you‚Äôre getting so angry over others exercising their right to not play a fucking game you like. 
---
How silly.
---
currently sitting at 53x Rumsey Rum Black Label, 20x Thistle Tea, 20x Swiftness Potion, and 100x Big Bronze Bombs. I need to make/pick up some explosive sheep, and get some elixirs.
---
RFK is a 28 min dungeon. Mobs start at 26 but get much harder by the end.
---
Thank you for the reply. I agree with you, but the 51 is a healer, and as the 53 I think I might hit 55 when we raid. My guild doesn't have enough 60s yet, so it's more of a fun raid.
---
you will 100% make more money if you wait. I made my twink so soon because it was so cheap.
---
That term is a old adage and the full phrase is ‚Äújack of all trades, master of none‚Äù meaning you excel in many different areas but are not the ‚Äúbest‚Äù in one particular area
---
Hobbits we‚Äôre naturally very good at hiding to the point of being near invisible though
---
If you're using any addons, check their options to make sure you don't accidentally have an option enabled to do this. 
---
Someone asked about something similar previously, and it turned out that one of their addons had an enabled-by-default option that caused them to spout random rp lines when they used some of their spells. Can't for the life of me remember which one it was.
---
Regardless, saying things shouldn't happen even if you screw up the macro text unless you have /say &lt;stuff&gt; on a line in the macro.
---
Convergence, Herod NA
---
Ive said nope cause rhokdelar. Nope cause you lose dps compared to prebis. Nope cause its BiS for melee. Nope cause its the worst weapon in raids in the game for you and a rare item for melee. 
---
YOU JUST IGNORED ALL OF IT, NOT ME. 
---
Stop focusing on gear and focus on playing better.
---
Top DPS hunter:
---
https://classic.warcraftlogs.com/reports/DWdLVzKPXmp8g2aC#fight=12&amp;type=summary&amp;source=2
---
500+ dps using carapace spine crossbow. Focus on your play not your gear scrub.
---
You could only make a macro that you hit when you see it happen.  A macro isn't going to parse your combat log and see when resists happen.  You can't also make a macro check to see if something fails:
---
    /cast fear
---
    if resisted
---
        /yell fear was resisted
---
You can't do things like that in macros.
---
Or maybe not use dbm in a raid with three mechanics per boss?
---
The goldsink for mounts is a necessity for the game, but mount skins would be cool, I can definitely see myself eventually getting sick of seeing the same handful of mounts running around
---
Lock engineer here. My favorite is casting seduce on someone, then casually waltzing over for a Gnomish Death Ray blast straight into a Death Coil. Missing health is instantly generated back, followed up with a fear and DoTs.
---
It's great.
---
I'll take that as a compliment, now get out of my swamp
---
Aragorn should be a paladin.  The hands of a king are the hands of a healer, after all.
---
Usually guilds will have 1 sp spot if any
---
I have a problem... I keep making alts and idk what to main. I enjoy each class for different reasons.
---
I like mage for aoe killing, warrior for being able to get groups faster + tanking, and hunter for being self sufficient in soloing content when no one is online to play with.
---
level 38mage with 225skinning/225herbalism
---
Level 39 warrior with 265alchemy/225herbalism
---
Level 39 hunter with 225skinning/225 herbalism
---
Level 26 priest with 190tailor/190enchanting
---
My questions are, is it better to just pick a main and level it to 60 or level each class evenly as I go along? Which class do you recommend leveling first?
---
My second question is professions, should I stick with what I got? I was told my hunter should go mining and engineering, but losing out on 225 on both my gathering seems like a tough pill to swallow, plus it has allowed me to generate income while I level. Any advice?
---
Also my warrior will soon be able to transmute Arcanite, so maybe it would be better if my hunter had mining so I can make my own Arcanite? Idk what to do.
---
D:
---
its hella expensive and im gonna wear WSG ring so stam for now it is
---
I hate rogues. I dont tank for them. So bloody annoying.
---
They always dps when they shouldnt. TRY to pull aggro off me. AMD usually ninja a chest or item. They just.....suck.
---
I know I'm generalizing. But I havent had ONE rogue I enjoyed partying with for a dungeon. And I tank on 3 of my characters. Just..... fuck man. Rogues...
---
You could get lucky and be the raids only shadow priest to help buff the warlocks.
---
Yep.  He doesn't belong as part of the group proper... too powerful.
---
I prefer lifestealing vs crusader but will prob go 15 agi when its out
---
How much dose the +5 Weapon Damage matter? What's the math?
---
Then why are you here?
---
bagnon
---
Not sure if super relatable, but had a warrior drop group as soon as we got to BRD after traveling there and ask "wait is this paladin going to role on Savage Gladiator chain?" and leave after the paladin said he would like a chance at it. "I'm not wasting time to lose an item i've been grinding for since 55 to a meme class."
---
For an interesting screenshot.  It is neat, but not very entertaining on social media over and over.
---
If people do it for themselves to reminisce later, that‚Äôs fine.  However, it is getting a bit excessive at this point.  (As most things do on this sub)
---
If you renew me before a LoS pull I will remove that. Also if a tank is marking and not good at splitting rage among targets that renew can be a pain in the butt.
---
Way to misinterpret literally everything I said on purpose. Just because you personally don't care about this situation doesn't mean other people are wrong for wanting to spread awareness, and people boycotting Blizzard is a hell of a lot better than doing nothing and silently endorsing their shitty behavior. People are literally getting gunned down by police and you're here getting upset about what, someone bringing "politics" into your safe space for vidya games?
---
I know a priest twink on my server who was done before anyone. He crafted my minor recombobulators!
---
Just a couple things to keep in mind for anyone reading that guide: Whirlwind should always be used on cd even for single target rotation. Impale only improves your yellow damage crits so it's not a very good talent for levelling you'll get a higher overall dps increase from just putting those 2 points in 2h spec. for 2% dmg
---
whoa mister high n mighty has to flex about having enough silver to buy cheese from a vendor. not all of us were born with silver spoon in our mouths.
---
That crap has been claimed for over a decade and has been repeatedly debunked, of course journalism is dead in this day and age so you can't expect people to know that. However the US Congress launched an investigation back in 06 and... Found zero evidence. Any time major media outlets start screaming about human rights abuses it's a good indication that the story is a hot mix of conjecture and bullshit. 
---
Everyone upset at blizzard is just #outraged so they can pat themselves on the back. They're hoping their whining and very temporary cancelling of subscriptions will result in some token apology so they can all feel like heroes that are #makingadifference but it's so self-contained it's embarrassing. 
---
And personally as someone who has learned to avoid fanatical conjecture artists that deliver us "news" like the plague to preserve my own sanity, I very much can't wait until this 24/7 broadcast gets out of the game. It absolutely is about politics, and it doesn't belong here.
---
There's no free market here, no competiveness. I would gladly give up classicwow if there was an alternative that didn't support china. But there isn't a game that I enjoy nearly as much as classic, so I have no choice.

If that‚Äôs what the overlords are telling you, you clearly don‚Äôt believe in democracy.

??????????????????? HOW was this political or religious wtf?
---
im having a blast beating level 39 characters in duels
---
Yea we shouldn‚Äôt be allowed to play/enjoy are selves because Hong Kong.
---
Yeah mobs can't parry from behind but I believe players in pvp still can. Swing timer does reset during a parry so that hurts the tank a lot haha
---
Herod!
---
Because commenting in /r/classicwow is not an immediate endorsement of Blizzard?
---
You have to spec down to shadow vulnerability to be allowed in raids basically in future content. 
---
After that idk what you'd do with your points
---
Commenting to try this later, thanks!

It has a chance to break every ~5 seconds.

And you call him steamed shams despite the fact that he is obviously baked

i swear i read this exact post like a week or two ago

mhm though someone recommended deja vu stats too in this post
---
Neither, gandalf is more like a cleric. He is basicly a mix of priest and paladin. Or an abjuration wizard? Dunno. Gandalf doesn't have a lot of attack spell thought. Def not a mage imo.
---
Druid miner here.
---
Rogue here definitely no spoon. Had to pick a  lot of pockets to get this silver.
---
Druid is best at 2 things. Running the flag, and party heals in raids. Back in the day, we would keep everyone topped up, so the priests and pallies could stay focused on the tanks.
---
I'd feel bad for you if you weren't Alliance.
---
It's almost as if it was meant to be!
---
There are a bunch of "melee cleave runs", especially hordeside after level 30(Just ran melee cleave strat UD this evening.   
---
You want your dps to be pushing the limit, the amount of time you save per run is quite noticeable. The dungeons are easy, no need to rule out cleave and WWs from rotations.
---
Yeah, I'm not sure how it uses weapon skills in the calculation myself, but I ran into the same thing. I unequipped The Rockpounder (+2% crit) to wear a Lord Alexander's Battle Axe (some agi, and 5/5 Axe Specialization) and saw my crit chance go down. It caught me off-guard, too.

I feel sorry for you mods at the moment. Blizzard has fucked up and you now have to deal with the wave of political posts, regardless of your own opinions.
---
Might not be popular to say, but thanks at least for trying to keep the sub clean. Fuck blizzard for their bullshit tho.
---
There might be a secret quest involved if you /chicken enough at one of the little cluckers in Westfall. And maaaaaybe you can get a chicken egg out of it. And MAAAAYBE that chicken egg is a mini prairie chicken pet you can take with you on all your adventures :)
---
stupid nerds. Think they're so smart!!
---
Early on in levels, like pre-40, it could be argued that Spirit is best for Warriors as it lowers your (significant) downtime by increasing your passive health regen. Strength translates to attack power for Warriors, which is obviously helpful, but it doesn't matter if you kill stuff in 8 swings instead of 10 if you have to spend 30 seconds eating or you have to bandage after every fight. This, in addition to great damage for the level, is why you see Warriors taking Cresent Staff/ Staff of Westfall from Wailing Caverns/ Deadmines. I believe Spirit should be at least on par with Strength at these levels
---
Spirit = Strength &gt; Stam &gt; Agi &gt; Int

Your pet is level 2 or 3? You should just abandon it and tame one your level. It'll make everything much easier. Spend the points as you wish, but I'd recommend stamina and armor rather than resistances. 
---
For your rotation you'll mostly just serpent sting and auto attack most mobs while questing. If you're full on mana you can throw in a multi-shot here and there. Also make sure your pet has Growl turned on as that'll help your pet regain aggro.
---
Are you high? Final Fantasy is owned/published by Square Enix.

Yo dont need to be in holy spec to heal dungeons until 50

Is lightwell worth getting or should i just get divine spirit and put the rest in holy?

As long as you have enough clout to form a competent group with people who don‚Äôt mind the reserve it‚Äôs fine. But there reaches a point where you are disrespecting your group if it takes too long to fill or if the quality of players is total shit. This happens a lot when a dps starts a group with big reserves  and has to pug a tank. 
---
Like you shouldn‚Äôt be reserving so much shit that your group becomes a revolving door of exasperated people
---
I would blacklist that asshole.
---
If the tank is doing what he can and the DPS do stupid shit and pull. 
---
Fuck em. Let em die
---
I disagree. The raw dps on Claw is significantly higher, and that's before counting the higher damage range as well. Smoldering Claw should always outdamage Bonebiter.
---
Had this happen the other day with Auctionator. Wasn't a bug for me, just me being dumb. 
---
What might've happened was, the auction addon last saw that item listed for that price and automatically entered it as the recommended listing price and you may not have noticed? Lost a set of shitty green +8 STR bracers to an AH bot instantly lmao. Cheap lesson to learn, hate that it happened to you bud.
---
Thank you, alliance master race of course.
---
Thats stupid, how can you predict when they will come out of cc?
---
Ahh, In my day it was all Chuck Norris talk in barrens. I see people have moved on to Keanu now.
---
Oh ok gotcha
---
I'd be deeply concerned about your memory then because that is definitely not the case. 
---
This exact same post?
---
No, sorry.  I always get them mixed up.  RFK*
---
How is your view distance so big
---
Colonizers?
---
Where exactly did they... Colonize?
---
No. If the addon is doing something Blizzard does not sanction, they will break the addon.
---
Since the ClassicLFG addon author spoke with Blizzard's API team and removed the offending functionality, the addon has been deemed suitable for use in Classic.
---
There was are way to many mages on my server for civilians to not be killed.
---
He just happened to say almost that exact quote in a video that came out yesterday lol weird coincidence
---
Lol it's insane to me how ignorant people are. Truly mind blowing
---
Ohh he has "stolen" 10' of 1000's of the years üòÅ
---
Idk man, I get a ton of compliments on my heals. I think resto Druids, particularly in leveling content are very rare. And none of the guides I've read had any useful advice about healing while leveling, so I've had to figure it all out myself.
---
I think the potential is there, but you might not have come across a good resto Druid while leveling.
---
Actually he's right, Cruel Barb is the best Rogue 19 OH and not Assassin's Blade!
---
Haven't had any issue healing any instance as hotw spec, the lack of a rezz can be a minor inconvenience for your party members but can easily be circumvented by having a shaman or spriest with you.
---
Yeah I didn‚Äôt t think to include it. Technically master of none was added several hundred years after the phrase and I assume the master of none part was added even after that. I‚Äôd do some etymological digging but hate doing that on mobile.
---
Maybe it's for the best
---
Been collecting pre-raid bis since about 55. Consistent successful BRD runs, and getting decked out with tank gear from a nice Scholo at 58. But okay...
---
But actually past 1% because combat rogues get 5% inherently.
---
The people on grobbulus tried it on rattlegore? That makes sense...
---
you are on the opposite faction, of course its the opposite for you, both are the same
---
Lightwell is not worth it. 21/30/0

Fishing for likes or upvotes is and has been a thing for ages, eben on websites that don't actively track your total amount of internet win points.
---
There used to be a duping exploit that relied on wrapping paper to work, so being suspicious makes sense, imo
---
Hmm I didn‚Äôt see 1.13 in the OP?
---
Still sitting at work.
---
But yeah, I'm excited to get back into MC and the all the classic raids.
---
That's interesting haha. Honestly it shows hos real it is.
---
I‚Äôm almost all pbis and I still wouldn‚Äôt risk it myself. Mainly because I find I really enjoy using the stuns from deep prot as a mitigation tool. Oh mage pulled something taunts on CD stun it then taunt. Same for revenge oh this things about to change aggro revenge oh it‚Äôs stunned that was lucky I needed a second to get a heal.
---
Maybe you should go to a political sub or something. This one is for wow classic.
---
tsm
---
I do realize I lost aggro.
---
Here's the thing, though. Taunt has a cooldown, and 99 out of 100 times, the DPS are either A) spamming AoE right from the moment I press Shoot/Charge, or B) all attacking different targets. Therefore as a tank I have to choose which mob to keep aggro on, and which to leave be for the DPS to burn down on their own. So usually I'll hold aggro on the melee mobs, while a caster or two is targeting some Earthshock spamming Shaman, and I'm OK with this.
---
Also, if the target I don't have aggro on is a skull, then that's by design. Usually it's a caster mob and the skull is there as a "hey, nuke the everloving sh\*t out of this thing first while I get aggro on the other mobs". Assuming everyone does focus the skull, it'll usually live approximately 3.7 seconds, give or take a second or two.
---
It‚Äôs because people put spell damage on it instead.
---
They have always been a pvp guild. They cleared MC and Ony first because that is what competitive guilds do. They clear the content fast.   
---
If they wanted to optimize for PvE, they would all go human. There is a reason literally all their warriors are gnome, because they min/max pvp.
---
did you just quote your own quote?
---
If you were done then you wouldnt have responded.
---
You truly are an idiot
---
They were cross-realm in 1.12 so wouldn't surprise me if it's true.
---
my buddy's name was buttholegirl, had to change it to fapulous.
---
I always ask in chat for the names of folks who are ganking and specifically target them. If you are just questing and not killing the lowbies I'll probably let you be.
---
I have seen a few videos of people doing it. And 1 of someone soloing the hyenas and first boss in north. I wish I could test it out and then decide but sadly that‚Äôs not how it works lol üòÇ it‚Äôs like making a decision without ever really knowing all the facts
---
Maybe after 4, but not after 1. And even then, that‚Äôs the way the cookie crumbles. I‚Äôm a tank and I can‚Äôt even count the number of times I‚Äôve lost rolls to dps warriors but that‚Äôs the game.
---
You can't. It's called RNG. Welcome to fucking classic lol
---
Nothing beats /sigh and /pat
---
You are the one who started asking for proof and are now claiming the other poster cares too much about proving you wrong? Projecting much
---
Hell yeah
---
Warlocks summoning at the bottom of the pool was funny as hell.
---
sick 40% res scale
---
Who are you?
---
Hm, do you have threat issues? I would strongly recommend taking claw off auto and putting growl on auto. I'm honestly a little surprised if your pet can hold aggro without using growl on CD. Claw is a huge focus dump, I keep mine on manual and only use it when I'm close to focus cap or when my pet has a ton of threat already. 
---
Yeah, you can put lower level scopes on leveling weapons. It's a small boost, but more damage is faster clears and less damage taken.
---
For arcane shot, I just use that when I have mana to spare, kiting, or if I need to have as much dps as possible. It's not a fantastic ability because it doesn't actually scale with much. Generally, if you find yourself having mana problems use it less, if you aren't, it doesn't matter a ton.
---
I think they are vanilla players that didn't play since...
---
So my guess would be altered memories from a time we were all very bad.

---
Everyone who plays any game professionally faces this. It's not just speaking out against the Chinese that gets people in trouble with the body governing the game they play. 
---
Look at comments made against police brutality by prominent NFL players, and the way the NFL reacted to them doing it. 
---
This isn't restricted to Blizzard, and it isn't restricted to China. While there's a racism component to this that isn't being discussed, more importantly, it's incredibly naive to keep acting like it is just Blizzard and China. 
---
What's even more frustrating is that it isn't even the people working on Classic WoW who had anything to do with it, and might not even be anyone actually at Blizzard. It could just be entirely Activision, we don't know.
---
:OO alright that's what I'll do for next two hours then!
---
Just drink some Potions of Giant Growth

And apparently never go on an airplane either. Or stay in a hotel.

People need to understand, the CHINESE GOVERNMENT is the problem.
---
Bene is Latin for good
---
‚ÄúLet our priest get good‚Äù
---
Yes it does. It lowers the hit cap. It also adds to the white hit cap. No rogue will be fully hit capped unless they wear ridiculous gear to do so. They need 24% hit to cap their whites. 5 weapon skill is always 3 hit for a rogue on their white swings at the very least. A good rogue will wear less hit gear and more crit since they have weapon skill. Swords are literally always better on a human than a gnome. ALWAYS. Your statement couldn't be more incorrect.
---
Completely wrong, you barely use rejuv unless everybody takes some damage. It's not mana efficient either. Like the other guy said, you mainly use healing touch r3, 4 and max depending on the situation
---
I‚Äôve seen the pattern 5 times myself still pretty rare if the mage in the group wants it.
---
Freedom of speech is a basic human right that in America is a government focus but around the world various instruments have broadened that to include private corporations. My point is that blizzard talks the talk about human rights but the moment they stop supporting their profits and instead get in their way  they shut that shit down. Besides, that pathetic rule He broke was so broad and purposely poorly worded as to give them almost total carte Blanche to fire anyone for any conduct they dislik. Very shady behaviour.
---
A Hunter raiding question:
---
When should I prioritize rank 1 Multi-Shot over max rank?
---
As far as mana efficiency goes, I'm dealing with (slightly over) twice the mana cost for 120 extra damage on an outside weapon swing auto-shot. That's not good so I'm thinking that I'm probably missing something.
---
Oh that's a funny extra level!
---
It's okay, I'll make up for all the lost honor by feeding on carebears like you :) mmmm, gnome flesh
---
wrong. DW is 24% miss on both hands. 5% miss on special attacks which are based on MH weapon.
---
Did they add school specific spell power yet? Cause the last version of it I tried only had spell power and healing power, not shadow/frost/etc. ECS has it all.
---
https://youtu.be/lT_67cORjPE haha
---
its literally a nerf raganaros and all other bosses in REAL 1.3 had much more stats
---
Did u ever notice how dungeom bosses/adds hit like a wet noddle in classes- thats why aoe is more popular than ever
---
Wait, aren't orc the colonizers?
---
Basically I just went 41 points in Holy for Holy Shock and then went Ret for cheaper seals, faster judgment, improved crusader, and faster run/mount speed.
---
In Holy I went Divine Intellect, SoR damage, Consecrate, Healing Light, with extra points in the talent to ignore damage while casting up to 70%. Obviously I prioritized Inspiration and got the spell crit, too.
---
Now that I've finished Ret, I'll go back to Holy for improved wisdom and Lasting Judgement.
---
I'll probably keep this build at 60 unless my guild is desperate for Blessing of Kings.
---
Hope that helps.
---
49.99? That‚Äôs honestly deal of the century.
---
he didnt contradict himself.  read the 2 posts you pulled those quotes from again.
---
Dude I'm a troll shaman.
---
You have several tools to heal yourself in non emergency situations. If you are a lock and a healer is spamming you with heals when they shouldn't maybe try communicating with your healer. 
---
Use your first aid. Eat food in between fights. Life tap and siphon life. Not everyone know everything about every class.
---
Tanks are noobs too.  If you have a tank clearly struggling who to pull/focus or where to go, whisper and *kindly* ask to mark, etc.  The person that knows the dungeon should lead.
---
Blade Flurry*
---
Waste 31 talent points with not one benefit healing... yea not really......BUT
---
With all the hardcore/experienced players now, most dungeons are extremely easy with no surprises. Making a crappy healer actually viable in almost every dungeon. 
---
As a shadow priest till 60 (then switched to holy/disc) you can heal almost every dungeon as long as your not hard carrying low levels.  The only dungeons I would stay away from were ST, and the the other high level dungeons Since I hate wasting consumables/time dying. 
---
There‚Äôs honestly been short BRD spam runs where it was actually so easy to heal that I swore I could heal the whole group with vampiric embrace and bubble. 
---
I don‚Äôt doubt most people would catch onto your crap and call you out for drinking after every 5 heals w/ 0 dmg.
---
That's what i would have done on my priest, butttt I wasn't there and who knows if he felt like chasing.
---
Honestly you wouldn't even notice them in the real world, because they wouldn't say shit to you no matter how angry they were. Too much risk of actual confrontation.
---
you will need to watch a tutorial on youtube
---
I don't mind healers dpsing when they're bored. But when I typically deal 30-40% of the groups dps while taking (extra rage from damage intake is very nice) it's better if they just heal.
---
That's a fair point!
---
Poor mankirk's wife. At least she/they got a cameo in the legion invasion pre patch
---
What about when BGs come out? Do you get XP in those?
---
This is wow classic, a game brought to you by Blizzard. Can you see the connection?
---
&gt;you could prevent a faction from leveling any new characters
---
I mean, its clear you never played vanilla, but if you have evidence of this it would be cool to see! 
---
There's only one way to level right? It's just SO easy to completely deny people from leveling up! Like one raid can just completely prevent everyone from leveling!! OMG!!! One faction will be so pitiful it can't even defend itself from a single raid!
---
There is a talent to add a 4 seconds silence to counterspell no matter when you use it.
---
Yeah. Part of the problem was that they had to tune it for people who had no clue what they were doing. Theorycrafting existed, but it wasn't the monster it is today. There weren't tens of thousands of people working to figure out everything about each of the most minute of details. 
---
It was just a few dozen, maybe a hundred, dudes collaborating across faction and server lines doing their best with crap tools, if they had any tools at all.
---
So I'm willing to believe vanilla dungeons were always this easy, even accounting for the rebalances that gave everyone just a bit more power. Things were less known, less figured out, and so things were balanced to be easier over all as a result.
---
I don't think the notion that hit isn't as important for hunters is correct at all. 
---
Majority of the damage a hunter does is in slow but large hits, a rogue missing a few more autos is not the biggest deal in the world. Hunter missing aimed shot or tranq? Yeah that's a big deal.
---
Most hunter also would loathe to go for survival as their secondary as you're basically handicapped while trying to do anything solo. If you live in raids then sure go survival but I doubt anyone at this point would want to or is doing so.
---
You're kind of right about quick shots/rapid fire but there is a caveat. Aimed shot is always a base 3s cast and also not modified by quiver so lets take a deeper look:
---
with quick shots up aimed shot is a 2.31 second cast, carapace goes down to a 2.21 attack speed and striker's mark is 1.67. First auto for both weapons fires as soon as aimed shot finishes at 0 seconds, there are now 6 seconds until you cast aimed shot again.
---
I think you can work out the math from there.
---
Good to know, thanks!
---
Search this subreddit for the word hyjal there's seriously like hundreds of posts. People doing it at level 60, people doing it during the stress tests etc. It's very much still possible.
---
You on Windseeker? Recognize guild name
---
Lol. Ill remeber i have that skill.
---
There are two possibilities here:
---
He literally thinks that you can just hop from server to server to your own liking
---
By "they" he means members of the alliance faction, and not the exact same players
---
You pick which one is more likely
---
Yeah, if you cleave (or WW) and a non primary dodges, you can swap to them and hit them with a OP, but if you skip over them it will not let you do it again, or so I've noticed.
---
Well maybe, but it helps me to get my mount well enough!
---
git gud, or play on a pve server
---
So I shouldn't worry about drain tanking as a warlock till around level 40 or so? Just fear juggle mobs and use Drain Life only when necessary?
---
unfortunately for you we are on Herod. Sorry my man.
---
not until p4 likely
---
This original post would fail guidelines then lol.
---
You're right, but that is what people in this thread were complaining about.
---
I like to use R for pet attack, shift R for pet follow, and Ctrl+R for pet stay(rarely use). Just something I like that may help someone.
---
Not that I've seen. Even as a shadow hybrid or something Your lower mana pool, lower mana regen, lower healing amounts and higher healing costs are going to become pretty obvious pretty quickly. If you want to be Shadow then be Shadow. This isn't retail. You don't get to be everything.  Unless you got 50g and 3 sets of gear. The closest you'll get is a feral Druid spec'd HotW/HT, and you'll still need 3 sets of gear...
---
As a druid, having no mount at 40 is absolutely no problem at all.
---
Smoking heart is bis dude, it's amazing on a feral tank
---
Maybe. I can safely assume from its use is that it used to convert a value into a formatted coin string of some kind.
---
You're not end game, its not a huge difference. If you can get something that is 5dps higher in white damage, and gives you higher SS\Evis... take it.
---
I‚Äôve never played a warrior class ever... but to think that threat and rage doesn‚Äôt matter when it comes to survivability is insane. The DPS clan has brain washed you lol. 
---
 Night and day difference between an actual tank who runs into a mob of three and holds aggro compared to a warrior running around doing extra dps trying to save group with dps dmg.
---
Found the salty useless rogue.  We‚Äôll call you if we need a lock box opened.
---
&gt; if you cant see the same merit you should get your eyes checked bub
---
I don't see the merit because WoW Classic PvP is already both simple and unbalanced. Finding joy in exacerbating both of those issues seems insane to me.
---
But you do you.
---
LOL I remember getting fucked over from that macro in like wrath or something lmao. I never knew what the fuck was happening
---
So much of this is avoided by simply killing extra mobs sometimes. I group up often and am constantly overleveled.
---
The game was designed with exploration in mind. Exploration means grinding. Trying to minimize it is fine but grouping up is  not necessarily a detriment if you play in a balanced fashion. I hit sixty first among my group of 25 with plennnnnnnnnnnty of lead time and lots of group questing.
---
But sure, if  you only read guides and repeat what they say, then that's fine too.
---
Classicdb by far
---
I have a vanilla thistle tea recipe on my rogue on retail. I'm literally probably one of a handful of people out of 10s of millions who can actually prove he played in Vanilla :) 
---
&gt;Griefing low level questing hubs shits on your honor
---
&gt;You don't lose honor if you don't kill civilians

Looks like we're in agreement fam.

Oooooor, you could have 2 different enchants on them?!?..../droolsinShadowPvPAnticipation

The quest is a random proc so don't be afraid to really spam that /chicken emote, friend!
---
Introduction and ramp up of microtransactions in every game happened under Activision. Though largely cosmetics, Hearthstone is one game where it is more than just cosmetics.
---
Shoehorning Modern Warfare or Black Ops 4 onto the BattleNet launcher was not popular
---
General decline in quality of some games, particularly WoW. The latest expansion is generally agreed upon as the worst in its history with none of the polish or fun that Blizzard usually brings to the table.
---
Announcement of a highly unpopular Diablo mobile game in lieu of a real game announcement. Diablo Immortal's only objective is to cater to the Asian market where mobile games like that are popular, even though Asia comprises only 12% of ATVI's global revenue.
---
Remember, when the Activision-Blizzard merger took place, a key part of it was that Blizzard was seen as a way for Activision to gain a large MMO into their portfolio, and gain market access to Asia. And with Blizzard being stripped of a CEO, it's plain to see who sets the policy there.
---
No shit which one it was. 
---
They are entirely different people with different gear and different skill sets. The coordinate differently. 
---
Why is he even saying "they" tried it and failed in response to them saying it was only on AFK players? There is literally no reason, it doesn't make sense, so I made a sarcastic comment about it
---
Arena isnt in the game and neither is BG so yeah consider my guilds got MC/Ony on farm this was my next project =D
---
I know this is a dead thread but I'm researching builds for a 4fun alt. I am a warlock main. We get left over debuff slots for corruption, especially in early raid tiers. Corruption has 100% sp scaling over 18s. Serpent sting is 100% over 15. Even with them getting curse of shadow amplification, you can beat them for the slot if you have more SP.
---
LFG addons will only be allowed after Chairman Xi approves them.
---
You don't need to target for Cannibalize, though.
---
Nah, I love my horde bros, but duels are always fun
---
its an addon by the same name
---
It's a supplement.
---
Cool. Thanks for the insight.
---
Herod NA!
---
I find it weird we have to explain how a prot warrior is a way better tank.
---
yes, you're right. however people in this thread are complaining about exactly that: "killing low level quest givers".
---
Projecting.
---
ill never hit 20. they introduced exp to bgs the same time they let you turn off exp. if that ever happens meh cuz whatever on wotlk meta 19s, but TBC meta 19s was the shit
---
More like gets ganked by 20 orcs, kills all except one who kills him with a crit arrow.
---
shame
---
You won't want to stop, Itll be impossible :). Do watch though, show had the hour hype for good reason
---
Memes guidelines.. What a world we live in..
---
Then give it gold.
---
Can i do this as a spriest and/or holy?
---
Personally, I believe it is easier to get 1 class to 60 first. This opens up the game and allows you to help level your alts even more.
---
You need to decide what you realistically do with your time end game. Do you like raiding? Do you like tanking, dps, or heals more in groups? You are on a PvE server, but do you plan to frequent Battlegrounds when they come out?
---
Warriors are awesome and in demand, but you will need to put in some time to get gear to really make them shine. A few Warriors raid as tanks, most raid as Fury DPS, but all can tank 5/ 10 man dungeons. If you do want to be effective in PvP you will need to respec Arms and try to get a good 2H weapon, which neither Fury DPS or raid tanks use.
---
Priests are great healers. If you want to be Shadow it's an uphill battle to get loot that will be useful for you, you will likely have to heal groups/ raids for it, and you'll only get second dibs after Warlocks/ Mages.
---
Hunters and Mages are both great for solo content, and like you said, Mages are great for AoE. Their rolls in Raids/ PvE is pretty obvious. There are a lot more 60 Mages than 60 Hunters right now, but Raids also tend to prefer to take Mages over Hunters. Both of these make great gold farmers.
---
If you like to Raid/ PvE, my recommendation would be to stick with the Warrior or Priest, and then focus on the Hunter or Mage as an alt to make money.
---
As far as professions, keep gathering professions on your gold farming character, and put crafting professions on your main character. If I were you, in your exact situation, I would:
---
Level the Warrior to 60. Keep Alch, drop Herbalism and pick up Engineering or Blacksmithing.
---
Level the Hunter or Mage to 60. Keep Herbalism and replace their other profession with Mining. Use your Mage/ Hunter to farm gold and herbs/ bars. Send it all to your Warrior and make him a god tier tank.
---
That's just me though, mix and match to your preference.
---
‚ÄúDumpster dps‚Äù lol
---
I stopped seeing 90% of toxic behavior after looking out for the signs and generally dodging sketchy situations. Still get the oddball here and there but its to be expected. Supposed to ignore and move on. Eventually these people weed themselves out after no one wants to deal with their shite.
---
Crit scaling is different for each class. It's 53 agi/1% crit for hunters.
---
Thanks for the original response, tumblr
---
TIL stinky is racial.
---
you'll have to deal with optimized 60s who spent way longer grinding the best stuff for pvp than you did though, basically the same concept
---
They work fine together IMO
---
Make a pug mc and ninja the BRE 10/10 best idea ever
---
"Press x to doubt."
---
&gt; Ive said nope cause rhokdelar.
---
Have I ever tried to say that rhok is not better?
---
&gt; Nope cause you lose dps compared to prebis.
---
Still yet to provide any kind of solid reasoning or evidence to prove this.
---
&gt; Nope cause its BiS for melee.
---
Oh no they lose 22 ap, boohoo. 
---
&gt;  quick shots and shit, that isn't part of your rotation 
---
Do you even know what quick shots is?
---
&gt; Top DPS hunter:
---
Who's to say he wouldnt do more with a strikers?
---
Yup and most don‚Äôt require turning in for a chain so you can cash them in all at once for that sweet sweet feeling
---
If you start a fight you shouldnt assume your friend will jump in to save your ass. Same thing applies to real life. I will gladly take a beating for a friend who unjustly got into trouble...but if you start a fight, you should be able to handle it yourself.
---
also true 1.12 brings actual useful talent trees but the game is still nerfed
---
I found +5 agi leather bracers a few weeks ago, is of the Monkey preferred?
---
Where?
---
No problem! Spread the good word when you find out how great it is :)
---
First question: level a main to 60 first just to make the other ones easier. If you have a 60, you can gain money much easier and pay for better armor while leveling. Go for speed with hunter imo.

Second question: stick with what you got, use guild mates or make another alt for other professions. You only need to get to lv 35 to max professions.
---
Third question: yes I recommend alchemy and mining together
---
Am I the only one who has had easy and flawless runs with ST? I see it meme'd a lot here but my 20+ runs have been uneventful lol
---
i don‚Äôt think you understand, he‚Äôs gonna do the runs either way, he keeps all the loot besides the ring
---
Rule #5.
---
weapon damage scales with strength. 14 attack power gives you 1 dps, more or less the same as if you had a weapon 1dps higher. 1 strength gives you 2 attack power. so 7 str = 1 dps. 
---
agility gives you dodge and crit. the 1/20 number is for level 60, and it‚Äôa different (more crit per agi) at lower levels. 
---
crit and dps and dodge are all good, you would have to calculuate it out given your stats and levwl. but generally get a mix of all of them (str/stam/agi).
---
Ok?  Who cares?  If you don't want to follow his rules find a new guild
---
confession: i look down on anyone who uses a special character in their name.
---
Cool I was thinking a shield is better for pvp. From what I gather the deathbone set is really best for pve tanking  and subpar for aoe farming and pvp.
---
Hunter beast mastery tree:
---
improved: spirit bond (2 points):
---
While you have an active pet every 5 sec transfer 1% of health to whomever of you is more injured (as a fraction of total health).
---
new talent: shared trauma (1 point):
---
Whenever you or your pet takes a critical strike, the other one receives it instead. Can only occur once every 8 seconds.
---
dang! im on Grob :(
---
I did go heavy spirit which helped me out tremendously. However with strength, I'm very skeptical.
---
As far as I can tell, the only thing that benefits from strength is my auto attacks. 
---
Every point of strength equals 1/7 dps. So even if I get 60 strength from gear (what I currently have), that's roughly 8.6 DPS. In a fight that's 15 seconds, that's 129 damage.
---
Thanks to axe spec and cruelty, I'll gain 10% extra crit. At level 45, I project I'll have nearly 24% crit. That's starting to get really great, considering how good Impale is, plus deep wounds. 
---
Strength seems marginal at best because it only helps my white damage, while crits can come from anything, especially since I have mortal strike, overpower, whirlwind, and execute to cast.
---
Casting renew causes no threat prepull. 
---
Overheal causes no threat. Even in an los pull situation the priest should position himself at range to where he has to hit the range threat thresh hold to rip Aggro. Also what‚Äôs the first thing you do when they round the corner? A shout or a thunder clap. All ready beats the possible 1-2 ticks of renew threat during travel. 
---
When the mobs are rounding the corner the priest should be studder stepping a heal onto you anyway and that‚Äôs where the real heal threat begins. The argument of the renew causing problems doesn‚Äôt make sense my friend.
---
Yea hunter, warlock, then priest cause those are the two classes that usually beat me. Honestly can‚Äôt kill a priest 1v1 unless your hunt/lock. I usually end my duels with a 15 second dance in my bubble with full health while the warrior aimlessly try‚Äôs to alter my health. 
---
I know this is pvp advise but it goes for leveling/solo too.
---
Search the wowhead site. They have twink guides with gearing information
---
&gt;Nobody cares about your political frothing at the mouth bud.
---
Then maybe you should stop commenting on post with political inclination, bud.
---
It's BIS at 60.  The +7 resistances and 3% DR will not be noticeable while leveling.  I'd much rather not have to skimp on Resto spells and 20% travel speed than dive in the money pit that is Enchanting.  Maybe if you already have a main that can feed you Gold, then sure.
---
TFW there's 7 priests in your MC raid and you're the only shadow and the 6 other priests have eye priority because they're heal spec.
---
Who cares.
---
I feel like during TBC Blizz started cracking down on names, did they stop?
---
Ohhhhh that makes me sad now.
---
You might be talking about Forest Leather Bracers, which are best in slot for the pure agility burst build. I prefer stamina in this bracket so of the monkey is my choice, but yours are still good!
---
That‚Äôs like the undead sailors in wetlands talking about my pet. ‚ÄúA living Killzugs. Soon to be dead like me. . .‚Äù
---
It‚Äôs his guild, he can set the standard however he wants. Why is this corruption?
---
You might, but a majority don't

If you dont like it it probably isent a guild for u
---
Downvoted for trying to help.
---
Sums up my life.
---
Thank you, this miss information is pissing me off quite frankly.
---
Also for a rough guesstimate of the dps value, 1% hit = 16 AP, 1% crit = 20 ap.
---
I know how to deal with this.  Blocked
---
From my experience as a lock, drain tanking becomes pretty viable from lvl 30 and is very good/better than wand from level 38.
---
Fair enough. By level 44 I expect I'll have around 24% crit which is starting to get really significant. I agree strength is good but literally the only ability strength seems to impact currently is my auto attacks.
---
As far as having items restored I‚Äôm not sure. I think I remember reading something about someone restoring a piece of gear they accidentally disenchanted during a dungeon or something by hitting the wrong key bind. They had to submit a ticket and go through a GM to have this done though, whereas the character restore function is available to everyone at the character select screen and can be done manually every 15 days. Maybe some rose can chime in and shed more light on getting items restored as I have no idea what the parameters are on that.
---
Explain to me how cancelling my sub helps Hong Kong in anyway. I'll consider it if you can make a good argument. At best, all you can say is "the punishment Blitzchung and the 2 casters received is harsher than it should have been for the rule that was broken."
---
Druid macro;
---
I've been trying to get a macro to shapeshift straight from my mount, but when I use it it prompts that I am mounted even when I am just dismounted. Pressing the same macro again shapeshifts as expected:
---
/dismount 
---
/cancelform [noform:2]
---
/cast Cat Form
---
It makes me think I might have to add in some sort of delay after /dismount.
---
Any thoughts?
---
I enjoyed the Stockholm comparison to that lol, 
---
Just my take on it. It‚Äôs worked for me for years, never had an issue with a hot prepull if done correctly.
---
You're going to get more value out of intel/stam/spirit then you are agi regardless of level, but wands are very useful all the way up to endgame content.  Once you start raiding you won't really be using it, but wands make 5 man dungeons take less time since you won't need to drink after every single fight.
---
You seriously don't think that it's just a couple of "tards" who are quitting, right? And we're also not just talking about WoW. It's obviously all of their products.
---
And you're actually getting to the point right there. When have greed over fundamental human rights ever been a bad thing to fight against? It's more important now than ever after all the cases of big companies kowtowing to China.
---
I would definitely look into devilsaurs first.
---
Then you can go pickpocket man its boring af.
---
To put it in the most simple terms possible. If you don't want to do the math. Daggers = weapon damage &gt; attack power.  Swords = attack power &gt; weapon damage.
---
nice drawing. i still h8 it.
---
Do you find Tranquility worth it? I'm only level 44 on my Druid at the moment but the tiny amount of healing Tranq does doesn't seem worth the time/mana it costs.
---
&gt;Would something like 30/21 in holy/prot enable me to switch off between the roles?
---
I've used 20/31/0 to tank and heal dungeons. I feel like tanking requires more talents in its talent tree than healing. As long as you get Illumination healing is possible.
---
Can‚Äôt say I agree, especially in dungeons. 
---
As Ele main myself I have litterly 0 trouble finding a group. Also got pretty easily accepted in a decent guild as ele with the deal that I heal ( but roll on ele gear ) bosses with crazy nature resist. 
---
It‚Äôs about the effort you put it. As much fun as those ‚Äòmeme‚Äô specs are they require more effort then other specs to do ‚Äòokay‚Äô especially in raids because let‚Äôs be honest you won‚Äôt get top dps but for most guilds that‚Äôs alright ! It‚Äôs about the clear and not the speed for a lot of guilds.  
---
But maybe I just got lucky with my guild who knows
---
Shadow is super fun, at 60 there‚Äôs really no want for you and you might get into a dungeon every now and then. 
---
But PvP? Talk about the fun part of the game!?! One of the hardest classes to kill especially 1v1. 
---
If owning in pve/PvP isn‚Äôt fun then idk what to tell you. 
---
Go be the best healing class in the game too? Be wanted / needed in every dungeon? 
---
Go kill bat handlers for fun or Mc people off of cliffs,boats, drown them.
---
... wut
---
You could grind mobs around your level for hours and not get anything but trash drops. Yes, it still makes money but not a ton. Also directly depends on which mobs you're grinding and what their loot tables are like. How much of their shit sells for a good amount to vendors or other players... 
---
Alternatively you could find a mining/skinning/herb loop that no one else is running and make a ton of money just off the materials. Kinda hard to do with a healthy populated server though. Additionally you could farm mats for a specific eng, bs, alch recipe and sell those. 
---
Both are very valid money makers. Just depends on what works for you man. 
---
In short, NO, professions are anything but useless for money making. It's just up to you on how efficient you want to be and what you choose to farm/grind.
---
We all know there aren‚Äôt any rogues with sweet dispositions
---
Nah, I just eat the cost of potions and try to keep my rings and neck items + spirit and + int to balance it out. Only secondary weapon I carry is a 2-h for when I sign on as dps.

I play on Grob amd everyone there is a huge RP stickler so if your name isnt some variation "Morigan" the you're lucky to go a month without enough reports for a forced name change.
---
But the question is if they prioritise greed over fundamental human rights. I don't know about you, but I'd much rather support a company who goes with fundamental human rights. I like my freedom of speech.
---
lol imagine playing on the 80 side and thinking that was a fun experience. thats when you reroll on the 20 side.
---
I plan on running the flag for a bit of fun!  
---
I didn't know about the raid healing though. I thought Druid healers were just considered 'good' compared to other healers and 'best' compared to other Druid specs. lol
---
Looks like it killed your print screen button, too.
---
Tyty still fresh to macros
---
I didn't know the pickpocket one, it works instantly with an opener like that?
---
Good to know, thanks.
---
Holy hell. Thanks my man. Looks like I can go all in on my twinks now. 
---
You guys know about running your Alt yourself? You just need someone to invite them in the same group.
---
IDK if I did it right, but basically I'd clear to boss. Log over to alt and get close to "boss room". Launch a new wow so that my alt can be online for about a minute while my main rushes boss. Master loot boss loot into alts bag. Bada Bing Bada boom. Not torturing my friends for the 10th WC venomstrike run üòÖ
---
&gt;What can I do to make priest not so boring?
---
Netflix on the tv or second monitor while you waste your life away dotting and wanding.
---
Why not just grab the devilsaur set
---
Doesn't have to be an NPC, you can cannibalize dead enemy players. I prefer that over teabagging or emoting at their corpse.
---
So true. For every person that knows how to play the game there are 10 braindeads who just want to charge into packs and pop sweeping strikes or ae.
---
Good tanks should run through theoack and turn around, so they are looking back at the entire group. This gives melee easy access to the back of the mob, standing directly bejind them instead to of at 90 degrees. Pats will aghgro tank initially, and you have full visibility over the entire group. More importantly, mobs not facing you arent on you.
---
Nothing, people on Grob like to arbitrarily report names for "not being RP" when you kill them in WPvP.
---
The chicken on the left is the one who always screws up group photos. "THE REST OF US LOOK GREAT.. WE'RE KEEPING IT"
---
i've been doing that since before this game launched.   UO was my first 'set it and forget it'
---
To shreds you say...
---
Lol devilsaur, afk your funny
---
Oh man I was healing as spriest spec at 51 for my group. It's incredibly easy. Yeah I got the gloves as well...drakestone is pretty good too. Bonus if you're skinning because there is a metric f ton of skins to be had.
---
Thinking twinks are compensating == fragile egos?
---
If so, guilty as charged.
---
Jesus christ you people and "virtue signaling."  Learn what it actually means please. This was a fun, lighthearted interaction that nobody was upset about. 
---
Stop taking this shit so seriously and get over yourself lmao
---
If it's your first lock, don't put it off for too long, you'll be missing out on a great pet and the class flavor.
---
Meme. Meme like there is no tomorrow... My suggestion is to go 18/3/30 and make a shadow healer. Works basically like a legion disc priest except you run out of mana even faster!
---
Get the spell power.  You gotta PVP bb.  SMITE!!
---
I don‚Äôt believe you.  Netflix wasn‚Äôt even a thing during UO days....
---
I'm a rogue on Gehennas one of the biggest and most competitive servers on classic not part of any collusion and I made all my gold from devilsaurs.
---
It's ez mate.
---
As a healer... pallys are the absolute worst tanks, maybe better then hunter pet idk. To go and half your effectiveness and crutch you even more to not even go into a full tank build is horrible.
---
I can tell you most of the pallys I played with who tried tanking took twice as long or group disbanded before we finished. Horrible aggro so if you could fix that it might work out.
---
Another factor would be we have good itemization in 1.13, in early patches many items simply had no spellpower/healing or half the amount that you see in 1.13
---
usene...  oops
---
Nice name.
---
Word. I love you, go in peace :D
---
I have a feeling it's somebody you play with being kind. Don't get why a level 1 would go all the way to westfall to deliver 1 gift otherwise
---
Do you think that Square-enix gives any more of a damn? They will do the same thing as Blizzard and Apple  and Riot and every other company because they care about their profits. Not you, not me and not the horrible shit happening in China.
---
How about if 60% of the loot wasn't mail with spirit at the main stat?
---
I tried to explain it to a WoW BfA player xD
---
You as well my priestly bro!
---
I'm in a state of unsure.
---
I've returned to blizzard in the last month because finally the sub fee feels worth it. And this happened.
---
I boycotted Eurovision, so to be consistent I should boycott blizzard now. Frankly I don't want to, because it feels like a lot to give up. So I'm effectively playing as normal but feeling aware that maybe I shouldn't be playing.
---
It's so irritating that boycotting seems to be the only way to fight against questionable business choices.
---
Here is what I use:
---
/run SendChatMessage(format("has pickpocketed %dg %ds %dc from %%t!", random(10), random(99), random(99)), "EMOTE")
---
Rag threat is really weird. He seems to ignore tanks until they taunt him back following his tank knockback ability, even if I (the MT in super high fire res) fully resist the punt.
---
True. I would primarily like to heal, though, but my server has a ton of healers and a major tank shortage so I‚Äôd like to be able to switch off now and again, which was why I was thinking more points in holy? But from what I understand it might not even matter for pre60 dungeons so I guess I can do whatever I want üòÇ
---
Nice bro I‚Äôm weird and an making another priest on a PvP server this time so it‚Äôs definitely on my bucket list since there‚Äôs only a few dungeons I know nothing about. ( lvl 36 dwarf on white mane)
---
What is so hard for you to grasp?
---
Big companies kowtowing to the Chinese government is going way too far and like many others I would like it to stop. Trying to win this fight (which currently is against Blizzard) doesn't make the attempt any less valid just because I have a phone or clothes produced in China.
---
Again, you can't fight every single fight in the world. You have to pick the ones that you feel strongly about.
---
If that's still incomprehensible to you I can't help you any further. You can try to read it again when you've gotten older.
---
30+ it's good and gets better and better. Fear juggling uses too much Mana I feel like. Slower in the long run.
---
Good Friend: \*laughs it off\*
---
Bad Friend: You fucker. Why didn't you help? I would have had him! What the fuck is your problem?
---
qq some more eve of the one has to pay the same respec fee.
---
If you're a mage that expects payment for water I'll never group with you again. 
---
Oh you want a Fort buff? 20s each!
---
Too bad for them I've already saved this gem to laugh at later
---
Because a lv 34 can‚Äôt use the pattern considering you have to be lv 35+ for things above 225 if I‚Äôm not mistaken. Also, those same people have the pattern already on the ah so they‚Äôre camping it for gold where as Id like to be able to learn and make bags.
---
Gehennas most competitive. Your really funny mate.
---
ü¶Äü¶Äü¶Ä
---
NICE, but this isn't a sketch. You cleaned it up and added pen lines. This is a line drawing. good work. :)
---
Glad i get to see this before the mods kill this magnificent creation
---
Been buying hundreds of silk cloth below vendor price.
---
i was always a disc healer, i didnt like holy in wraith+  or was it bc?
---
People are not interested in changing anything about classic wow, at least not yet. Not until we have "completed it", with naxx being out and farmed and all that.
---
This isn't OSRS sorry mate.
---
Can‚Äôt you click EU? I was just using my NA sub but I thought when you log in you get the option NA/Brazil/Europe. I have one friend who speaks Russian/English he‚Äôs American/UK but he studied in Russia for 2 years in college at a Russian university he got good grades and passed as fluent to go there.  I‚Äôm trying to get him to play the game, he played in vanilla but isn‚Äôt sure if he wants to go back I can let you know if he does. He would play/speak Russian with you but I‚Äôm really not sure if I can talk him into coming back and it wouldn‚Äôt be as good as a Russian community. I know their are some mandarin communities but I‚Äôm really not sure about Russian.
---
I couldn't be less angry because I'm having too much fun playing, I just find it crazy that people who have looked forward to classic for years would deprive themselves of that enjoyment over this.
---
nope
---
Tbf, unless they know priest, they have zero context. Even knowing priest, initial glance looks as though you are showing off the Truefaiths more than the Benediction.
---
yeah the horde are pretty fucking gay
---
2 elites and 3 normies: dps should solo down the normies first without needing a tank to hold the agro.
---
Should‚Äôve shown the name, why cross it out? They are obviously an asshole
---
If the only change possible is +memberships (without allowing -memberships)then the memberships will increase no matter the reason lol.
---
I‚Äôm currently deep feral, but have been having a lot of fun healing on my priest alt. I‚Äôm thinking of respeccing to the tank/heal build but I‚Äôm unsure how good it is for leveling. Also what‚Äôs a good strategy for learning to heal from such a high level? Does priest experience carry over much?
---
You said lvl 37 originally iirc. Also camping rare recipes to resell on ah is a legit way to make gold, I really don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs wrong with that.
---
Nah more like those stats barely existed in real vanilla-we have updated 1.12 items in classic most of those were shit items or had half/no spellpower in 1.3
---
That's not really any better lol..
---
Lol do you really think a little online boycott of western neckbeards not buying hearthstone packs or playing blizzard games will make them lose more money than they‚Äôd make being able to sell their products in China? Only reason this even became a somewhat bigger than normal news story about an esports player being banned is because of US/China trade tensions and how HK is being used by both sides media to influence public sentiment.
---
Not best? Excuse me. Bear is the best. Being a Bear automatically makes you the best.

---
This is what I am using for raid healing and dungeon tanking.
---
As stated by blizz they were there as placeholder abilities, just so players would have buttons to press whilst the devs finalised the class for launch.
---
This is pretty cool, and actually would be a lot of fun to do with a friend or significant other you're duo leveling with, you rock, OP, hope to see more episodes soon!
---
You did the absolute correct thing. It‚Äôs so lame when you are 1v1 and the other faction has some rando or friend run by and heals them up.
---
We get Oceanic, Latin, and Brazil for the American servers. I remember when you could just switch to EU but I think that was when MoP came out, and I played on the EU servers then on my down time for raids.
---
Last ditch would be trying to do effectively the same thing with one of my friends in the military here who speaks Russian, but if I remember correctly he hates WoW.
---
I hit 33 before the first reset.
---
I'm 39 currently, been a busy month.
---
The increase to your AP is an increase to your weapon damage, which is still an increase to your yellow damage skills (Not whirlwind does "Weapon Damage" to all targets). Your Instant, yellow attacks just use a different formula for "Weapon Damage" with a normalized Weapon Speed.
---
This means harder crits, which means more Rage, which means more skills used. It takes 20 Agility to get 1% crit as a Warrior. 20 Str would be 40 attack power (or an additional 2.9 DPS from your calculation) . Is going from 24% crit to 25% crit better than adding 40 AP baseline to all of your attacks? Obviously other factors come into play, but AP increases the damage of ALL your attacks, regardless of if they crit or not.
---
No. They are entirely different
---
Steady solo and consistent vs big payout when it happens fighting over it with many others. 
---
So risky payout that pays big or steady smaller payout without big contestion .
---
Crater is afk as hell mate what are you on about? Most of the time is sitting waiting for the dino to spawn with a 11 minute long spawn window that takes a while.
---
/sigh. You're so wrong, you dont even realize how wrong you are. Please, go read any of the dozens of guides out there on how hunter rotations work. And then re-read them until you understand it. People have had this theory crafted down to fractions of a point of DPS for years now. I can assure you, you're not smarter than every single hunter that has come before you who have cumulatively spent thousands of hours perfecting this. People have tested Striker's Mark. Repeatedly. In game. It is not a good hunter weapon. But if you wanna piss off the rogues and warriors in your guild while also lowering your DPS because you think you know better than everyone else, go ahead. No one here can stop you.
---
Wait, priests have mind control?! I thought that was mages.
---
How exactly do I do a scan with auctioneer?
---
Having some pieces with int is reaaaally useful for bigger pulls or when things go wrong. Spirit also has some uses but it's not as needed.
---
Orcs are noble POCs and therefore cannot be colonizers.
---
Oh god, not this again.
---
I actually had a UD Mage learn how annoying a Prot Warrior can be. I was out in WPL yesterday morning and he thought it would be funny 2 sheep me and round up the mobs around me and AoE them down. Soon as the sheep wore off I blood raged, intercepted him and popped a Concussive blow on him. He blinked away  I ran up to him, resisted his Frost nova and shield slammed hi and got lucky dispelling his Frost armor. Watched as the mobs descended upon him and murdered him. As he blinked away I may or may not have started shooting him w/my cross bow.
---
Whatever you say clown boy
---
I think it‚Äôs just because some items can roll different effects like +healing if +shadow damage and therefore have the text stating it like a normal stat. Whereas other items have their fix amount of spellpower or healing.
---
Shredded is little strips. Grated is very very small pieces, like between a mince and powder.
---
oh SoC 100% outdamages SoR with any reasonably slow 2hander.  Sure 3.4 isn't 3.8 but it's still pretty slow.
---
It's tank bis at any level, for the armour alone. The mats aren't level 60 though, you can get everything you need from running brd which you're going to spam anyways
---
Yes, it is. And that would be far enough. Not taking all of his winnings from 2019.
---
Seems to be that +spell is *usually* a greentext additional effect on rare or epic gear which also have +stats in white. However there are some green items which have no stats, and include the +spell as the sole white text.
---
I think.
---
Shows up like this:
---
&gt; Lyfa pickpockets Lyfa for 1 Gold, 53 Silver, 78 Copper
---
Hardly.  None of that shit bothers me, just wanna know where the boundaries are.
---
This subreddit is nitpicky and biased, I win bye bye.
---
That's true but the spell school lockout is still longer and will be more valuable if you hit them during a shadow spell
---
That's a new level of cheese
---
&gt; Learn what it actually means please. 
---
Context works here; get triggered more.
---
Yeah nowhere near enough rogues use feint. I keep vanish for when I really need it.
---
Lol, you get downvoted while op literally said it's elvui a few posts down.
---
Is it from the Malazan Book of the Fallen series? It rings familiar.
---
Aye, thanks for the ping!
---
In the bigger picture it has very much to do with human rights. 
---
If they punished the Asian player only because he broke their terms of service or contract, how come an American team in n American tournament holding up a cardboard with the exact same text as the Asian player said, didn't get punished?
---
I'll tell you. Because Blizzard is kowtowing to China, like so many other big corporations. China has their grasp in so many western companies that we see their censorship over here, dictated by China. You can look that up if you wish.
---
Employees can go out and support renewable energy, but they can't go out and support human rights. The first is a big political topic in the western world. The second is a big political taboo in China. How is that not fucked up.
---
Yes, Blizzard has products to make profits. But prioritising greed over fundamental human rights is never the right thing to do whether you're a company or not.
---
You not caring about people losing fundamental human rights is your choice. You do you. I'm not telling people to quit games that they enjoy. But saying this has nothing to do with human rights or what is going on in the western world is not correct when you look at the bigger picture. Fact.
---
GOTTEEEEEEEM
---
Shhhhh no one comment. Just let it die.
---
But why though, are you insinuating that there is nothing worth while in any genre of anime ever? By what bar do you measure it by?
---
A lot of western media (especially recently) has been constant remakes and cash grabs. Hardly anything original coming out anymore. There are the odd good ones like stranger things for example but they are few and far between.
---
It is refreshing to see the world through a different lens. One where introverts for example aren‚Äôt constantly shit on by society and are actually valued! Imagine that! Obviously not all anime is the same or as good as the next but there some absolute master pieces that touch on subjects that most people over here wouldn‚Äôt dare.
---
It‚Äôs honestly just too bad if you don‚Äôt watch it because ‚Äúanime bad‚Äù or some other lame societal cliche ingrained into you and not because you actually don‚Äôt like it for some reason of your own.
---
I‚Äôd like to close off with just saying you should consider being more open minded in the future. Not an insult just some life advice. Have a good day.
---
The closest you can get is a pi-weaving build. 
---
Which sounds cooler than it is. 
---
Basically means you are a power infusion slave for a mage, and rank 1 mind blast on cooldown to keep shadow weaving up for the warlocks. In between mind blasts, you heal.
---
Also: curse of doom on sheep and other cc targets that get picked off last.
---
Yes 100%
---
Oh I wasn't playing a meme spec, or is that what really disc was?    Maybe I was tanking those years
---
Classic Cast Bar lets you see enemies' casts, although it has to guess the time left and is a bit wonky so I turned that feature off
---
&gt;You want to tank? You can heal!  
---
While true, this made me cackle manically.
---
Y'all wild

How dare you besmirch the good name of Mankrik you heathen

It's my rogue, actually.

I must not been paying attention but at 60, I have never seen a lock resurrect someone

Which server was it?

Rogue here - happy to /roll for locked chests &amp; happy to unlock anything for zero charge.

Blizz did not kill the last one, it works just fine. Blizz can not stop them without destroying an endless amount of other add ons

Reddit is a funny place
---
Not really, what you wanna do is make a character for PvP and one for PvE. 
---
Aside from this it is probably possible to specc into shadow once you have MC on farm with your guild.
---
You misunderstood, I'm feral 5 days a week. I do tank a LOT of dungeons. Last week I didn't Respec after raid because I was going to be out of town and not playing.
---
I don't think it is possible to do both in 1 key stroke, you would have to press it twice no matter what.
---
I remember a video of a hunter soloing the blue dragon world boss in ¬øashzara? with it.
---
My first epic, and it is a Hunter weapon too!

Lmao mining making more money than farming literally anything else, as if

It's a little different then resting someone. Basically it's a orb we make and can put in on 1 player or ourselves. When you die you'll have to option to auto Rez.

---
Warlocks have a many pet abilities and stones.  I'd say lock and shammy have quite a few buttons that can fill up a couple action bars even with modifiers
---
Never heard me holders are expected to share chests.
---
Becaus lockpicking is a class feature and not a side profession is generally what I hear.
---
What came first, World PvP or Battlegrounds?
---
I'll wait
---
The Swiss and gruyere shredded mix makes me so wet it‚Äôs insane
---
Yeah, you have a couple options. Yours is probably better, overall.
---
Easy cheese and spam is fuckin mint
---
Sorry, I didn't mean to trivialize, only to explain. Arguably, they faced both choices, In different contexts.
---
The Schindler's choice came first.
---
When Blitzchung made his initial statement, they had to choose between standing with him at personal risk, or supporting the tyrant by helping to silence him. They chose to quietly work with the tyrant and hope no one noticed. Disappointing, but not surprising- after all, much of the reason heroes like Schindler are famous is that they are so rare.
---
But the problem came when we DID notice, and Blizzard began to lose their old base, their ‚Äúchildren‚Äù if you will. Now they face the Sophie‚Äôs choice as they look sadly at the customers abandoning them, knowing that if they move to save us, they will be seen and attacked by the real tyrants.
---
I'm not though... my rogues undead

I shall translate it for you real quick...yes.
---
Yes it is!

They just love being upset
---
Almost everyone who actually types out a message to say shitty things to someone is a coward and it's hilarious
---
A reason I see is that herb/miners usually have a profession that uses the mats, whereas other people would just AH the node. Most items in chests can be used by everyone.
---
At lvl 40, am burned out. Gonna go sleep, come back in a week... or a month...

Yeah you‚Äôre right, people don‚Äôt share feelings for any reason other than fake internet points.

Debatable in shit Green gear, advisable as soon as you start collecting them epics

And where is your evidence? I know this bow is bis for melee and shit for hunters. Everyone knows this. Bye scrub.
---
I'm not really interested in ganking lowbies (that's hazing logic and it's toxic) but I've had one too many problems with horde rogues so they're kill on sight now for me.
---
I bet you're an American.
---
Oh it‚Äôs very worth. As a mage I hit 300 skinning and was soloing devilsaur a by 52. I am 55 now and it takes me less than about 2 min to kill a saur. I got over 12 skins today in about a hour and half to two
---
Uh can you pickpocket the opposite faction?

That's why I'm looking at LFG on my screen and all I see is LF 1M tank.

The addon to have your exp bar on top is actually aids.

They couldn't help but not show faction imbalance!

Herbalism/mining take up a profession slot while lockpicking doesn't.   Keyholders shouldn't be rolling if there no rogue
---
If you count the cloth donations as quests, then yes; otherwise there are not. You've got enough to get a little past revered, if you do every quest at a level for max rep; and that's all quests 1-60 not just 47.
---
Yeah modern games have made people so entitled with personal loot, it's a shame
---
I am Alliance and am looking fornthat level 34 quest for Scarlet Monestary, in the name of the light, but cannot find it anywhere. It's supposed to be offered in Southshore by Raleigh The Devout, but he does not offer me any quests at this time. Does anybody know what I missing? I'm level 35.

Professions are much more luck based, of you get lucky with nodes/drops/buyers/AH trend then you'll make more money than grinding

You might be right if the target is a higher level though. I'm not sure about that

Looking for weekday raiding 8pm EST or later, with intended end times no later than midnight EST.
---
I'm level 54 mage currently, looking for a relaxed group of people to raid and hang out with. Priorities are a fair loot distribution system, guild mates that aren't assholes, and progression. My friend is has a hunter and rogue in the 40s will also be joining.

Please feel free to contact me either in game (Dezderp) or here.

I'm starting to collect my Hunter preraid BiS, so I'm trading out some Agility and Stamina for things like +hit% etc.  As I trade those stats, I'm a little lost as to what those totals for AGI and STA should look like around 60 (gear dependent, of course)

I like the color coded names so you can still tell who is who

Crippling poison is great for kiting mobs and letting your energy regenerate. For an elite mob that only does melee damage, you can build up your CP while kiting or wait out cds on kidney shot or gouge etc. 
---
I‚Äôve leveled many rogues to 60 at this point and it‚Äôs extremely beneficial for you to do all dungeons once, while having all the quests. Great gear to pick up from dungeon quests.

Use it for a while then try to go back to the default map... impossible!

Would you prefer AD trinket, carrot, luffa, nifty stopwatch, or linkens boomerang?
---
You shouldn't blame a class for the actions of a handful of idiots. 
---
After mid 30s-40s, a properly geared and spec'd Paladin is possibly the best 5man tank there is, only having issues with aggro wipe bosses.
---
Definitely not a raid tank by any stretch of the imagination, though.
---
Boycotting WoW and other Blizzard game might be micro but it is something that they will nltice. But i‚Äôm sure your apatethic way of seeing things is superior /s

The name was Gestapo. I'm sure it was against TOS because practically anything is.

Who ever told you that hates you

Honestly retail did good by adding personal loot but also made those type of players even more obnoxious now they play classic because they are used to having absolutely everything to themselves.
---
ah the good old "look it up yourself" argument, never fails
---
No wipes in a pug? My trash guild run went 4/10 and wiped every other pull. I think I need a new guild.

Either this was a very obscure reference to Star Wars or I am going crazy. Either way take my upvote.

&gt; The time you spend stealth walking, getting behind, and energy spent distracting mobs before you open is far more than time spent hitting 3-4 auto attacks to make up the difference.
---
True, but if you're not approaching in Stealth you're not pickpocketing. The mob may go down a little faster but you're missing out on free coin, junkboxes and occasionally useful items. If you're going combat swords you might as well take the free DoT.
---
JFC, man. Just treat "you couldn't defeat him pre nerf" as elliptical for "you couldn't *realistically* defeat him pre nerf" and everything follows just fine. You're being pedantic.

I have a level 45 orc warrior and got bored. Wanted to make an alliance alt cause I've done horde so many times so now I have a dwarf priest. Ive played that dwarf over the last 2 nights and he is currently at level 12. I got a wand as fast as I could and I have been loving leveling, haven't died yet and I feel like I'm so strong. Im so excited about getting mindflay, and once I'm at 40 getting shadowform. I'll probably get back on my warrior soon enough cause I really want to get him to level 60, I just needed a break from doing the rotation everyday for hours on end.
---
11 million people played vanilla, myself included. Attacking civilians was always a fast way to ruin your day.
---
Oh and it‚Äôs hilarious to me that you include completely locking down an area and preventing people from playing as ‚Äúeveryone having fun‚Äù. Sure it‚Äôs expected as part of the game but when you‚Äôre leveling it‚Äôs just annoying.
---
The straw that broke my camel's back was when I reached 40, saw that I literally had just enough money to get spells and buy 60% mount. Can't do this for another 20 levels and 1k gold. I need a time off man, I need it desperately.
---
Holy crap, I remember keeping light  feathers in my bag around Christmas because of this for slow fall.  So funny...
---
What about 16 slotters?
---
You don‚Äôt have to read the code. You kept pushing back and asking how the addon does things despite receiving explanations. At that point, go read the code.
---
The fact that it just uses the combat log and tab-targeting has been widely known since it was released. Just use Occam‚Äôs razor, if an addon provided game-breaking information for PvP that wasn‚Äôt available already in the game...would blizzard allow it? No. 
---
A bunch of people who suck at PvP want to blame the addon for why they get rocked.
---
I appreciate you taking the time to list these - I actually forgot or didn't realize some of these things happened after the merge with Activision. You changed my mind - it doesn't seem fair to only blame Blizzard for this when it's pretty clear that they're not exactly in a position to bargain, especially given some of the things you mentioned. It's all of Activision Blizzard that's responsible for this. 
---
That being said, I stand by the fact that Blizzard put themselves in this situation the moment they accepted the very first acquisition by another company. You didn't say they deserve less responsibility for any of this, but I've seen others try to minimize their involvement in this situation, which I definitely don't agree with.

Raid Main tank.  Was a trash mob tank (a couple bosses) through aq40 into naxx in vanilla.

Doesn‚Äôt rogues get 5% hit from talents and only humans get 5 extra sword/mace skill?

I mean just kill the 2 packs.  You're getting locked out anyway, it's too fast.

Anyways, the whole spacebar thing is too funny. My son just turned one and he does this EVERY DAMN TIME I put him on my lap. Frustrating as hell but at least I'm a hunter. I really hope some form of classic is still around by the time he can understand how to actually play.

I seem to never have it quite right or have not enough action bar space.

I'm running the classic ui, buttons 1-5, q e r f (+shift versions) and f1-f12 on my mouse + shift f1-f4. 29 keybinds in total and it always looks messy and uncomfortable.
---
Any help would be appreciated.
---
I think that bag becomes avail when AQ is released. Then you have to grind rep to learn it.
---
I feel like the draw distance in classic is longer than retail?
---
I understood that reference.
---
Good looks. I try to point people to that one over my preference xD
---
It's all lies...I tried and lost a roll when the best other roll was 16...Out of 4 people, I literally came last and just looked like a knob...rolled 4.
---
Still gonna keep doing it in case it works.
---
You have to stand still for a moment in order to pickpocket
---
!remindme 10 hours
---
Draw distance turned down to almost 0. Thanks Blizz
---
Let‚Äôs not pretend that people who hit max level after a month did it in 5 days /played.  
---
People who hit 60 within two weeks are highly skilled levelers.
---
It's funny because I don't consciously remember what my keybinds used to be, however, my muscle memory does. If I bind something to a new button and try to use it in a panic, I almost always hit whatever button it used to be on and realize "Oh yeah, Drain Life should be on Shift-W."
---
Only for 3/4 spawn. After that mages are oom.
---
This is off-topic, but how do you get enemy nameplates to show up from so far away?
---
You defo need a new guild My guild was a bunch of 58s-60s in greens a few blues and we only wiped once and that was on Garr mainly due to lack of warlocks and now we have the warlocks we blow through MC zero wipes.
---
Just type /loot in chat.
---
I‚Äôm pretty much with you there on that. It‚Äôs fun, but I can live without it. My main take from the whole shitshow of this, is that as an American, and this being an American company, I can‚Äôt agree or support someone who won‚Äôt embody our basic First Amendment right of free speech. I‚Äôm fully aware Blitz is neither an American, nor in America when he said what he said, but it‚Äôs the intent behind it. Those people there are suffering under an oppressive regime, and to have Blizzard pander to an enemy of freedom and basic human rights honestly boils my blood. Same with the NBA and the interview I saw with Harden basically sitting there silent looking like a gun was pointed at him if he spoke. Fuck that, and the moustache they all rode in on. I can‚Äôt do much, but I can speak with my 15 bucks a month.
---
&gt;Your personal experience (and my own) do not apply to everyone.
---
Right, so I don't know why you're assuming you and your presumably like-minded, politically-conscious friends are the norm. It seems a much more reasonable assumption to me that most people don't care, or don't care enough to follow through permanently. Or don't even know. For real, what seems more likely to you for the vast majority?
---
Oh yeah sorry shit wording on my part, you can use all the bandages as a 19 twink.
---
yeah no shit the classic threat meter uses the code from a 2005 omen version.
---
someone just recycled it and made it not show up as outdated in classic. 
---
its shit and it will be shit until someone actually writes a new one using the new combatlog entries correctly
---
If the mages are doing flamestrike shatters they do a lot more damage then blizzard mages do, which you are already worse then.
---
Also, you will end up killing mobs unevenly making the mages damage less effective.
---
Yep, I know whether or not the priest is paying attention right away. Lifetap, tap, tap..(bubble). Really cracks me up sometimes. As dps, you're part of the team, and at no point am I on autopilot.
---
After 308 is a very small amount of miss/dodge/parry etc. It's effectively worthless.
---
&gt;A:  While anti-Chinese propaganda in America is a real thing, the fact that the Chinese government has committed several atrocities is an objective truth.  
---
&gt;B:  As if the US, and every other country in the world, hasn't committed atrocities.
---
I didn't put words in your mouth. This is the epitome of whataboutism. The reason you're seeing the word "whataboutism" everywhere on reddit is because you're resorting to whataboutism. The US's atrocities have nothing to do with the discussion. It is not a valid retort. It's a separate topic entirely.
---
&gt;Calling an accusation of hypocrisy "whataboutism" does not discredit the argument. I don't know why so many redditora think it does. 
---
Because whataboutism is dependent upon an accusation of hypocrisy. That's what whataboutism is. We can have a separate discussion about US atrocities. We can have a discussion about the hypocrisy of the US criticizing China regarding atrocities. Both are good topics to discuss. But neither of those things are relevant to the discussion. 
---
&gt; They have lied to us time and time again and have been caught in it. 
---
If they've been caught in the lie, who caught them? Who is they? Sometimes it's the government and the media catches them? Sometimes its the media and the government catches them? If all parties involved are compulsive liars, then how is anyone caught in their lies?
---
Nope, Skeram. I bet it‚Äôs a popular guild name.
---
I have a feeling blizzard is going to fuck classic up one way or another. I bet the moment it doesn‚Äôt start making them money they‚Äôll pull the plug on it. It costs money to keep servers going and if it‚Äôs not making them profit I wouldn‚Äôt put it past them to just shut it down
---
I see  you went to the Prometheus School of Running Away From Things.
---
I agree with everything here...but there is a reason they want to off tank.  They want one of the mobs hitting um for rage.  So that's why you'll generally see this from war dps.  If it's worth it or not probably depends on the group, but there is a reason for it I think.
---
Yes that is the definition of a pvp server you nailed it
---
I like that "usually" is in quotes. I found that people that are PvPers will notice (like the higher ranked people). Random BG queue-er will not. 
---
I also like actually winning, which requires people to go for the flag. A lot of times people just run at each other and FFA.
---
&gt;I cheered at the alliance champion
---
You're not allowed back inside any horde institution again you filthy traitor scum
---
Generally the locks can get it back with drain life, I wouldn‚Äôt worry about healing them.
---
I agree with this - the only tough ones are shadowpriests as they seem to have the most amount of agro with the least amount of oh shit buttons. Group comp makes a big difference because if it‚Äôs mostly single target dos like rogues and hunters you can easily taunt back and focus on the mob, but when you have a shadow priest mixed in with mages and warlocks doing ham on aoe it can be tough to maintain the aoe agro while still saving the shadow priest
---
&gt;Sometimes I really wish I could play warrior so I can just tank myself.
---
I'm about to blow your fucking mind.
---
***You can.***
---
Haha as if there will be a Classic Shop, even ActiBliz would be foolish to think a shop wouldn‚Äôt kill the game a second time. 
---
However, good for them if more people play retail and use the shop again. That‚Äôs more people keeping the Classic dream alive for me.
---
Maybe he doesn't like warrior, maybe he also doesn't like pallies, maybe he also doesn't like druids. What a stupid thing to say.
---
That would require rogues to be on the run. I haven't seen one lately. It's all mages and warriors.
---
Minor Recombobulators aren't unique by the way.
---
Yea he's totally gonna see this
---
Not everyone gives a shit about powerleveling. I guarantee there are plenty of skilled players who take there time with the game, just as there are plenty of mediocre players that can read a leveling guide and level fast.
---
My 5 stam arena trinket was my 2nd best one as a priest until a fair bit after I hit 60.
---
someone else buying level 60 in no way affects the effort YOU put into the game.
---
Playing druid after they rearranged talents so that you didn't need to go full 31 resto just for innervate was a godsend.
---
Which server?
---
Is this Fairbanks? I see a female orc named Main running around here
---
It's not really about what Blizz **wants** but what blizz **wrote.** If they don't specifically ban it, or have a bail out clause (Like, a clause saying any final decision regarding naming will be left up to Blizz discretion, etc) then they can't force him to change it without some major backlash.  
---
I haven't read the ToS, but if I were OP I'd be questioning what exact ToS I broke, and possibly it's line number.
---
Your tone was clear. You didn‚Äôt grasp his intent, it‚Äôs plain to see.
---
is this on retail? it seems really cool, but I feel like I've heard about something like this being removed
---
I was implying that you were not aware of the fact
---
Just because you're on a PvP server doesn't mean people won't want to PvE. Alliance is great for PvE. There are current PvP servers with solid faction balances, Stalagg just isn't one of them.
---
Make sure you know how to control your pet.
---
Clearly this person isn't in a group with them. It's a random.
---
What if I asked you to find me in the zone, travel to me, and give me a fort buff? Would you do it with no issue?
---
That's what people expect from mages most the time. And yeah, you love that intelligence buff I bet.
---
Save it for now.
---
Nice. We ran mc in 1.5h today
