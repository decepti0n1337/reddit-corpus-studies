Honeslty they're not that good even with good gear. You can make highlight videos for the 1 in 10 fights where you get a nice proc, but 90% of pvp as an enhancement will being kited to death by hunters/mages. It's like playing a warrior with no charge/intercept and in mail armour.

You've summed up the average wow player and  group.

Its usually better just to lie 10 minutes in and say "Gatta go, cat is on fire " then spend the repair bill and 5 hours of torture with badbgroups.
---
Dwarf paladin or an Undead priest
---
Summary, paladins are poor tanks, worse DPs, but solid healers and offer by and far the best buffs in the game.
---
THIS. And was always the reason people rolled the latest fresh server after 1.8.
---
The first half is an extremely social open world RPG with multiple layers of character progression. The second half is raidlogging with imbalanced PvP. 
---
Gotta admit tho, T3 looks amazing.
---
6 months minimum. But because the server isn't going anywhere, maybe 10 years. I like to do all the quests and explore the zones.
---
When playing as hybrid HotW spec Druid, at the gear level I obtained on private servers:
---
Against a near evenly geared rogue:
---
- IF I got the opener, I had about a 90%+ success rate. I considered rogues tricky but one of the easier rights.
---
- If ganked, I had about a 30-50% win rate if I stayed to fight, if all cooldowns were ready including pots and items. I had about a 99% chance of escaping to reset the fight.
---
Druid is a decent counter to rogues. The greatest limiting factors are gear (end game rogues get their gear fast and don't face the hybrid gear limitations a druid does), and player skill (most druids suck).
---
Still anecdotal evidence. And doesn't prove anything about hardcore guilds actually actively using it. If it was actively used, I would most likely remember it like you think you can, but lets say I could be wrong, like you could be - We would find actual evidence of it in a majority of the videos out there together with forum posts. The entire point is that people wasn't as knowledgeable as back then, this is shown in gear choices and DPS numbers. Unless you actually believe private server numbers are off so much off, which is the reason why a lot of the DPS classes are doing twice the DPS back then. 
---
I think its either 3 or 5 seconds to drop combat? Basically just hamstring and kite when you know they can’t hit you with a ranged attack or spell.
---
Orc. Lucky procs. Good enough gear where one proc and burst ends a rogue instantly.
---
Otherwise, advantage rogue.
---
It's pretty rare you get to use this against an enemy that knows what they're doing as a Warrior. About the only time is when kiting a warrior/shaman/paly. It's usually impossible against a pet class because the pet will keep you in combat, and even if a priest/mage is oom for some reason they will often wand you every few seconds if needed to keep you in combat if they're kiting you. The only real trick is to LoS (line of sight) enemies where you can, mainly mages/priests - so they have to stop attacking for a few seconds to cast something on you again which can be enough to get off another charge.  
---
  
---
The matchup where dropping combat matters the most is rogue vs warrior, but in that case it's always the rogue trying to drop combat to get another stealth -&gt; cheapshot off by kiting the warrior in the deadzone and the warrior trying to strafe back and forth to get a melee swing or intercept off, or use demo shout to keep the rogue in combat.
---
I mean I'm not going to lose my mind over it, nor will it stop me from playing, but I personally prefer the mayhem of seeing everyone and the chaos that ensues, call me crazy.
---
Don't tell him not to tell people how to play the game!
---
6 seconds. 
---
&gt; We understand, and I understand completely, that sharding is antithetical to a cohesive Classic community.
---
and
---
&gt; That said, when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials, when everybody is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time limited way, to solve the initial launch day load problems, while making sure in the long run, that as server communities solidify, there's a healthy population as single worlds for everyone to live in."
---
Just re-highlighting for people.
---
90% of the discussion and drama around sharding is not relevant to what they want to use it for  
---
Depends on what you liked. They were definitely different games though.
---
First half of the game was the exploration and learning for so many people. Leveling just because it was a new game and you were having fun. Running 5 man dungeons with 10 people because they were hard and everyone was bad. Raid content was a mystery for so many and it was hard.
---
The second half was amazing if you were in a raiding guild. AQ and Naxx were amazingly fun. Naxx 40 is probably my favorite gaming memory. But if you weren't involved in it, it would have been silly.
---
Cross realm battlegrounds were fucking dumb though. Killed all sense of community outside of raiding IMO.
---
*THIS GAME'S USER INTERFACE IS SO INTUITIVE, YOU MAY NEVER NEED TO READ THE MANUAL.*
---
And all I'm thinking was, "Does this scrub not know what class quests are? Why does he only have battle stance?"
---
Technically you don't really need to level either
---
Hmm... was it Gorilla that was END+Int? Or was that STR+INT?
---
USA is so fucked up
---
They're okayish if the content is relevant and/or difficult.
---
If you're speed running or just doing big AoE pulls, Paladins are significantly better than either Warriors _or_ Druids IMO.  The bigger the packs, the better.
---
I certainly hope they stick to their guns and only use it for that launch window, if at all.
---
lol ya, as other's have stated: It's known as Shimmering Flats on pvp servers ... it is that name that sends shivers down leveling player's spines.
---
It's a pvp death bowl with no place to hide.
---
&gt; Most people will not run with you when they see you.
---
In my personal experience there are so few people willing to tank at all that most people will take what they can get and give it a shot.
---
But Classic might be different from Vanilla. I'd wager we're going to see a lot of warriors out the gate. 
---
I feel like this is appropriate. it's when Ion was talking specifically about this topic. [https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2144](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2144)
---
So assume 16 until they say otherwise. As for the OP questions, i don't feel like it will have a major impact. 1.7 was released in late 2005. Wow had 1/2 the subscribers at the time as it did when 1.12 went live. The majority of players never even experienced this debuff limit in the first place and the change was universally welcomed at the time. It only affected MC, BWL, and Ony, and all of those raids received various nerfs or bug fixes on the way to 1.12 that had more of an impact to those encounters than the debuff limit did. #nochanges has a dark side if you go too far down the path of authentic progression. Unless Blizzard is going to emulate various client patches, recreate all bugs and exploits, and anything else that changed along the way...they have to draw the line at some point. 
---
If this were a funserver opening next week, I would 100% play.
---
For classic, this just activates my 'slippery slope' anxiety.
---
I really fail to see how it's "really hard" to recreate the quirks you're talking about (this is coming from a game dev) - there may be things initially missed, but they'll be hotfixed or patched fairly easily. If they're smart, they'll have a beta closer to the summer where these things can be reported en masse.
---
&gt;If it doesn't even compete with private servers in authenticity, what is the point?
---
Exactly
---
totally reasonable IMO
---
i didnt say they needed it to, just that druid tanks become obscenely strong and have raid gear progression, unlike prot paladins.
---
Hmm, looks like sadly the modern corruption of the term "PvE" meaning just raiding, is entering the Classic vocabulary.
---
The starting cinematic... I wanted a fkn bear pet 
---
And notoriety 
---
If you had teebus you were SOMEBODY
---
When you had never stepped in a raid before that experience was quite different
---
ROLL 67 OR HIGHER DOUBLE YOUR BET, ROLL 98-100  AND TRIPLE YOUR BET! 
---
I'm usually broke af so alliance-sponsored horse is my reason. Oh and I'm unkillable which is cool too
---
Buy low sell high 
---
Long term server stability trumps having the "authenticity" of sharing Elwynn Forest with the entirety of the server on launch day in my view, always feels like a non-issue when people bring up starter zone sharding.
---
Every class IS viable in classic without changes 
---
People complain about inoptimal itemization but honestly, I hope they nerf pre-raid items. They're too good and it makes early raiding a lot less exciting, both because of difficulty and because it means there are less upgrades to find in MC. I would prefer this to progressive itemization.
---

---

---
Yup, I said it after Blizzcon and I’ll say it again. No issue with how they want to use shedding.
---
Yeah details matter, but having experienced the original launch, using some sharding to prevent 2 hour queues and unplayable zones that disappears as people spread out isn't unreasonable. I'm 100% against it in any kind of long term thing, but if the technology and implementation is done right it seems fine. I don't need 1000 people in The Barrens.

Whaddup fellow Shaman/Rogue guy. Same here. Just trying to decide on races. One will be an orc and the other a troll since I don't want to deal with the gigantic tauren model again and I feel like forsaken rogues will be a dime a dozen. Troll rogue/orc shaman or orc rogue/troll shaman?
---
As long as they have RP-PvP servers I’ll be happy. I don’t know why, and I cannot quite put my finger on it, but something about RP servers in any game just leads itself to a great community with some really chill people. That’s been my experience at least. 
---
I played WoTLK, Cata, and Legion and I really enjoyed Legion. Could have done without the AP grind though. Super hyped for classic to play what I missed out on. 
---
Ah, I see. Thanks :)
---
I was going to reply to other post, but instead I'm commenting here to just keep a nice copy-paste reminder I can put into this thread when it gets re-created in 2 weeks about another person who's advocating for "nochanges".

---
You do realise that mc was never cleared prior to dm being released. And if I'm not mistaken EU servers were released when dm was out. 
---
Waiting until mc is cleared before releasing dm wouldn't actually be an authentic vanilla experience. 
---
I'd only suggest it for undead dungeons.  RazorFen Downs, Scholo, Strat, or SM runs (especially graveyard).  It's feasible for other dungeons, but like shaman tanks, it's harder to pull off, and has glaring weakness' that only the most desperate of groups will consider letting pallies/shaman tank in lieu of a hard-to-find warrior tank.
---
Human Paladin is probably the perfect combo for this mount, running strat as an undead I don't even care about the mount lol :( 
---
# #nochanges #1.0forever
---
Or something like that. 
---
Are you aware just how little spirit you actually gain from the human racial? It's practically nothing. Stop saying humans are far ahead of NE just because priest benefits from spirit. 
---
The only two things worth mentioning that separate the alliance priest races are Fear Ward and Desperate Prayer. Not the human spirit buff. It's not even worth considering as a "nice little bonus".
---
While some bosses might be easier due to having stepping stones towards them, putting any raid *beyond* Naxx would diminish it's legendary status as the one true final raid in Vanilla. I don't mind there being content afterwards, but maybe not *even harder* raids. I'd sooner put in stuff that maybe isn't that relevant for the endgame, or rewards that don't infringe too much upon the existing BiS list progression.
---
At launch, I'd imagine the population per shard instance can still be made to look rather plentiful.
---
I don't care if sharding is used early at launch if only for stability and access of play. I've lived through the alternative many times and it's a total horror show for the majority of players.
---
The tiny few thinking 200+ players in a single noob zone is fun and "by original design" is a buzz easily drowned out by logic.
---
&gt; I just don't see the point in playing on a server that cuts out content and immersion.
---
It's shitty content though. WoW world PvP is a terrible game. It's wildly unbalanced, there are no catch-up mechanisms, it's far more based on class matchup, level and gear than skill, there are no goals or objectives, killing people doesn't get you anything, it's just dicks being dicks for the sake of being dicks in a very bad game.
---
I'd rather play the bits WoW does well and if I want to PvP I'll queue for a battleground, where there are even numbers and similar levels and objectives and a time limit and rewards.
---
The point is you're playing for a nostalgic experience.  Since day 1 people have always called WoW a "Theme Park MMO" and back in the day WoW used to get derisively regarded by other old school MMO's as having "too many quests" and "holding your hand".  
---
At some point you have to realize that your game-time and experience when you were 15-22 isn't going to be the same now as it was back then.  And here's a dose of reality for you:  Comparing WoW classic to private servers is like comparing a master forger who spent 5 years learning how to make fake Rolex's look like the real thing: and then comparing it to a real Rolex going....nah this fake Rolex is better than the real Rolex!

BA in Linguistics here, whatever that means to any of you fine folk here.  Mostly just stating my bias before saying:  Fuck. Yes.  Do it!!  For a lot of languages (especially those that use the roman alphabet), this is a great idea!  It gets you to practice shit you already know, it teaches you words, AND it gets you better at inferring things.
---
Sadly, I can't really do this because my main L2 is Mandarin and reading Chinese characters is a pain in the ass.  Every time you encounter a new word, you can use context clues around it to figure out what is going on maybe, but you won't know exactly what that word is until you go look it up....

---
Shaman or druid haven't decided yet.
---
I'm thinking this too currently, but my main concern is the enforcement of the RP rule set. It doesn't sound like Blizzard wants to have much of a live support team for this project.
---
&gt; It's pretty rare you get to use this against an enemy that knows what they're doing as a Warrior. About the only time is when kiting a warrior/shaman/paly. It's usually impossible against a pet class because the pet will keep you in combat
---
When fighting a hunter, I typically kill the pet to enable this.  Lots of hunters never expect you to hamstring their pet and burn it down fast.  Using terrain to get out LOS of the hunter is usually the time to do it.  Pet resummoning is pretty time/mana consuming and few hunters resummon unless they can catch you in a freezing trap.
---
I'll stick with what I know best, which is Human Rogues.
---
Given that's what I've played for the majority of my 14 years in WoW.
---
On the other hand, why would anyone in their right mind give a streamer money for that?
---
Screw Teebu’s, I couldn’t wait to kill that Yeti with my (friends) lol
---
Not if 39 other people decide to do the same
---
They brought it up because its a thought they had and wanted a reaction from the community.  We have heard nothing else and making assumption and grandstanding about it is pretty dumb.
---
Warlock is probably stronger in general, but the pet customization and taming to learn skills and all that adds a really fun, unique element for hunters.

---
Absolutely. For me, it would be fun to not have raid markers doing garr or having to train evocation as a mage.  I just understand that a line in the Sand has to be drawn. 
---
Ay! Racials doesn't matter THAT much honestly if you're not a min-maxer, but I am so the shaman will be a troll (for obvious reasons) and the rogue will be an orc.
---
Even though undead is the more popular choice for pvp thanks to Will of Forsaken, I will most likely raid with my rogue a lot aswell to get the best gear available for me which is why I pick orc instead of undead. Trolls can't match with orcs or undeads when we're talking about a melee class that will do a lot of pvp aswell as pve.
---
Management put more focus on community relations in Classic.
---
Keep it simple people. Conspiracy is usually just the quickest path to being wrong.
---
They just dont want starter zones to be literally unplayable for the first week or so, then everything goes back to normal.

Being vehemently anti sharding in light of that seems like an overly purist borderline elitist mentality.

Yes, I was the leader of an arena team called Nathletes haha

So you going to finally play as the OT in Classic?
---
The ne steal trait makes your stealth harder to detect. Tauren get stamina and a stun. The stamina is minor to nothing and the stun is great but cant be used when shapeshited. Not the best class to use the stun. 
---
My favorite class to play is Paladin, and my favorite class to have in group is Mage.

\-Free water, Arcane Intellect, Polymorph for easier pulls, Remove Curse since that is the only one I cant remove, Frost Nova can save the entire group in a dungeon if too many gets pulled, Good damage, They rare need on items I do.

I have similar experiences with the therapeutic thing. Which is why I can farm arathi fire elementals for 8 hours straight. Or grind mobs to level instead questing. (Multiple days in a row of 16 hours farming sessions)
---
There is only a bit of discipline involved at first until it becomes a habbit. For some reason very chill and relaxing.
---
The reality is Pally's FoL/Shamy chain is going to be way more effective and efficient for topping people up. Rejuv just heals too slow and too little to be a good spell. The first tick of rejuv lands 3 seconds after you cast it.
---
Surprised you’re not interested in warriors! 
---
I'm with you on the over reaction, I've rolled my eyes a bit at the 'if sharding is in Classic in anyway, then I won't play' comments. While I would prefer a non sharding approach, I'm not ***vehemently*** against it at the beginning, which I think is a good distinction that you've drawn.

Uh, he's being right. One sliver of good news and you guys are back to kissing blizz's ass. Constantly 'having a little faith' is the reason things got this bad, (if you're calling for faith now, you've definitely been calling for it every fuck up that lead to this point), there's a point where you need to decide not to keep second-chancing a company that *used* to give a shit about you. 
---
If classic comes out and it's reasonably nochanged I'll admit they'll gain a lot of my goodwill back, I know I'm that big of a fanboy for vanilla. But I won't give them an inch until then, they've used up all my slack.
---
If anything the sharding will actually improve the starting zones since the huge populations have always lead to very antisocial behavior where people group up and kill mobs together without saying a word and generally getting angry at others because so many people are hunting goldtooth or that last murloc that isn't being camped.

Easiest class to play with wrist issues?  I want to play a paladin and heal end game / ret for fun but I'm wondering if how easy it will be on my hands to be constantly switching targets to heal in raids?  Any other class suggestions?
---
Piercing howl/Hamstring are good tools to use to slow the opponent so you can run away into their deadzone (area in which they cannot melee because it's too far or used ranged abilities (charges, shooting ranged weapons)). Piercing howl only lasts 6 seconds vs hamstring's 15 but is sometimes easier to hit with because it has a much larger range and it can't be dodged or parried or miss (but it can be resisted iirc). 
---
MN usually uses it against druids because druids don't have any way of slowing enemies in Vanilla, and generally speaking the best way to deal damage to a warrior for a druid is to exchange hits in bear form. Bear form really doesn't have a lot of options to deal with this tactic. If the druid shifts out of bear form, he's just wasted a lot of mana (shifting into a form costs a lot) which he needs to outlast the warrior, since he will lose very badly in a straight DPS battle, bear vs. warrior.
---
He tries to use it against mages, and it works sometimes. Mages are able to blink (15s cd) out of stuns, so his strategy is usually to charge, and then if the mage blinks, intercept and give the mage a good smack during that 3 second stun. And then this is where MN's strategy is usually a bit different than you'd expect from a normal warrior. If the mage gets too far away after the two have already started fighting and the warrior has no intercept, then he'll be very comfortable to cast spells at you while the warrior is very far away, so in this case MN usually looks to run out of the mage's range and mount up (and obviously that entails getting out of combat), in the hope of getting in charge range while mounted. If the mage tries to get the warrior into combat by casting a normal spell, the warrior will be able to get the charge off. However, the mage can actually prevent the warrior from getting the charge off only by using *counterspell* which instantly pops the warrior into combat. Yes, an ability that counters a magical spell being cast is actually useful against melee classes. And there's a bit of a mind game that goes on here, since in order to even attempt to charge something, you have to dismount first, and CS has a 24 second cooldown. That means that if you try to charge and screw up, you're back to square one again. If the warrior simply does no action and stays mounted and the mage counterspells, then the warrior can just run away until he's out of combat again and the mage will have nothing to stop the charge -&gt; blink -&gt; intercept sequence from coming. 
---
For additional context, most casted mage spells have a range of 42 yards (with talents, which is common), while charge has a range of 30 yards. So you'll get into range to charge before the cast goes off even though he outranges you. Combat starts after the spell gets fired off.
---
Against paladins it can be good since they really have no way of hitting more than 20 yards (not sure on that number) away, although it might give them a chance to heal, but maybe it's worth it since you probably have mortal strike (50% reduced healing) on them and you get some rage out of it. 
---
Against rogues it might be okay, but only in a situation where you can escape combat and also be in charge range. Most of the time they'll have crippling poison on you, in which case the rogue will win out in the case of you guys dropping out of combat. If the rogue is slower than you though, you could kite them in their deadzone, and then run out at the last second to charge. He will probably try to stealth, but I'm about 90% if you guys stealth and charge at the same time, you will get them out of stealth (maybe against an orc with their 25% stun resist it's not worth trying) and a lot of rage. 
---
&gt;playing as efficiently as possible is gonna get old real quick. 
---
You forget how long the leveling process was, young one ;)
---
Sharding was up in the air and was still very dependant on what the community felt like and was a last-resort kinda thing. And even if it was gonna come, it was in a time-limited AND starter-zone context only. I would also not have that, but its not something thats disastrious when put like that.
---
Loot trading, yeah, fucking sucks. 
---
&gt; Everyone on this sub thinks they’ll be clearing naxx.

With the benefit of hindsight, we sure will ;).
---
&gt; a freeloader that probably won't get to endgame.
---
70% of the game used to be leveling. There's nothing wrong with having more lowbies in classic. 
---
The people willing to "boycott classic" probably forget that lights hope isn't going to stay live after classic launches, and the remaining servers will be shut down by blizzard most likely. They also need to chill out and reflect on whether or not sharding in starter zones during week one is a hill worth dying on when the starter zones last less than 10 hours.

---
You aren’t going to get groups with that kind of attitude.
---
Yah I found that without even hitting the AH I can easily buy a mount at lvl 40. The AH is sort of just a waste of time pre 60
---
&gt; I dont mind sharding in the starter areas at the beginning. I remember how impossible it was to find enough mobs to kill for the starting quests as a dwarf when there was only about a couple of dozen people in the area when wow launched.
---
This is necessary.  I also think it should spread to the 10-20 zones very early on (like maybe first month tops).
---
Its always good to hear about some of the designs that got canned, Things would've been so different 
---
They already know "vanilla means vanilla."
---
Gonna replicate my original journey and main a hunter once again
---
My guild was doing it at the end...but in no way, shape or form will I be doing that again.
---
I didn't say there was! I was just making the distinction that most of the players on private servers are generally going to either be serious players, or those that just want to play a free version of WoW and likely aren't going to dip too much into endgame if at all.
---
Tanking in raids is even funnier then 5 mans try it man you feel truly powerful tanking a raid boss.
---
I played an undead lock in Vanilla and play to do the same in classic.  We cleared BWL and had professed into AQ40 before the Burning Crusade. 
---
I'll be honest, during progression fights it was a challenge to keep my threat down. I still vividly remember having to go suicide tank on of the dragons in BWL so I'd just die and both tanks would be back at the top.
---
That being said, even though this was an issue we didn't bring less locks because of it. Just stand around and make healthstones for your friends if your threat gets too high. In the grand scheme of things, the time I spent waiting on my threat to go down in progression fights was only a very very tiny percent of my vanilla experience.  
---
Unless you go Conflag
---
What’s the deal with feral Druid dps is it viable at all? Or only for hardcore players
---
Naxx? I'd be more worried about the initial rep grinds.
---
This. Whoever is against this approach clearly has no interest in long term server gameplay. 
---
It's probably possible to pull aggro with Rockbiter and Earth Shock, but seriously doubt you can live through the damage.
---
Give this man a sheild!
---
I've loved playing the bad guy since i saw the lion king when i was a baby. Theres a video of a 2 year old me saying i liked scar.
---
Naturally, i went with the warlock.
---
When you discuss class viability, are you talking about the hybrid tax for shamans, paladins, druids, etc. or are you talking about things like the lock’s Firestone being objectively useless?
---
&gt; and he certainly wont be tanking
---
Feral Druids can tank, unless you're talking about 60 raids
---
Shocks gives you really high threat, along with totems like magma totem. It doesn't matter if they can have plate or not, look at druids. Shamans can spec toughness, shield specialization, increase chance to dodge/parry attacks and stuff, which made them OK.. in 5mans.
---
I actually tried it with my friends while leveling (I believe we were level 48-50 or something) and it was just annoying as hell to put out totems for every single pack, make sure you shock different targets to not lose aggro and obviously going OOM after one or two packs of mobs.. which means you will wipe since you can't do any heavy threat spells. You do have rockbiter which generates more threat on hits but that doesn't help much in that scenario.
---
They were simply just another druid and paladin, dwarfed like crazy by warriors.
---
*The optimist in me:* Maybe its such a small project with not much revenue that ATVI doesn't really care what they do with it.
---
*The cynic in me:* This guy got laid off and now he's throwing ATVI under the bus by over-hyping the no-change community, inevitably leading to a wider backlash. 
---
Problem is when peoples sole purpose is to camp Redridge or Sun Rock. Maybe it's just pservers and people are getting bored after having done everything, but it's incredibly hard to get stuff done in contested zones. I don't mind running back to my body, but I also have more limited time then I did when vanilla was live.
---
Interesting, so they were on par with druid and paply tanks? I hear paladins can pretty effectively tank most pre raid
---
I love how you put percentages on something that is non-quantifiable. 
---
Sharding is a short term change to prevent a long term change. RCR is a non issue. Only loot trading has no reason to be there. 
---
Nah I would put them on the bottom, easily. Yeah you're correct, both druids and paladins can tank 5mans with ease. Some even consider them better than warriors (in some dungeons) thanks to their AoE abilities. Paladins had to drink a lot aswell just like shamans but druids were pretty beast.
---
You just drink while your healer and dps drink :P. Only warriors rogues and feral druids have the luxury of infinite resources. 
---
Shamans were better at pulling than vanilla paladins (chain lightning), shocks were a decent snap-aggro tool (though not a true taunt), one of their weapon buffs (rockbiter I think) had bonus threat on it, and they did have +block and +defense talents.
---
But despite a cleaner pull and potentially better single-target aggro than a paladin (has anyone ever done head-to-head threat tests on them, with fully talented and totemed rockbiter vs. fully talented and crusader-judged SoR?) they still had a lot of the same issues.  They were worse at multi-target aggro, they still had the same mana issues, they had no defensive cooldowns, and the armor did mean they took more damage.  
---
They could handle low-level dungeons, they couldn't handle raids.  I'm not sure about how they'd do with dungeons say Mara and up, though (maybe they'd be on par with paladins and bears, maybe not, I just don't know if enough Shamans tried it to know for sure how it would go).
---
So warrior/rogue it is, thanks man. Needed someone to be brutally honest. 
---
I might keep shammy as an alt or even try it on a private server prior to release 
---
So much this.
---
I hope some of the devs see this and I hope it makes them smile.
---
&gt;Progressive itemization doesn't really make sense for classic since there's no TBC on the way...
---
Not sure what you're talking about in terms of TBC.
---
It matters because it makes gear like tier 1 when its the only tier out more irrelevant than it has to be.
---
I'm not sure me having an opinion is raging. I appreciate the concern man but I think you're blowing things a little out of proportion.
---
Is that a rehash (of a rehash of a rehash) of SFK?
---
"The game's user interface is so intuitive, you may never need to read the manual."  
---
I still have a manual, somewhere, I think.  Covers things like "plainsrunning."
---
Retail?
---
No death coil tho FeelsBad
---
Great post, or greatest post?
---
Shaman tank is an unfinished concept. It was initially thought to become a thing and some abilities were designed around that but they scrapped the idea in the end and didnt finish it but some things stayed such as threat-generating abilities and such.
---
So it isnt really a viable tank as for example Paladin etc. Its a dps or healer. 
---
As god is my witness, if I miss the AQ event AGAIN because my server can't stay stable, I'm gonna be pissed. I understand the need for using it as sparingly as possible, but they should look at server stability over the long term so situations like AQ crashing the game don't happen again.
---
"current PvE meta" doesn't exist in classic. It's just the game
---
Oh man "tauren are too heavy to ride mounts so they get plainsrunning" or something like that. 
---
Those people don't have any intention of leaving private servers in the first place. They're just bitching to hear themselves bitch.
---
I hope most of the players on Classic are like OP, that way I can be a god among Warlocks.
---
Hypothetically (honestly not trolling, but genuinely interested in knowing) how would you feel about the server being stable for the AQ opening, but knowing that 1/2 the server or more that was congregating at the gates had been sharded away?
---
Naturally, I'd take that over a server crash, but I'd be a little bummed out too.
---
There is no proof for any of this - pro or against pserver.  Anecdotal or Video.  One can simply claim what's that saying, Correlation doesn't mean Causation.  Or for those who are pro pserver, it's just anecdotal.
---
And for those who already believe a certain way, will always worm their way around "proof".  At this point it's just beating a dead horse.  I mean, I can sit here and tell you that pre-1.12, Blizzard actually ninja nerfed lashers in DM, ZG farming by putting in additional elite fish in the waters, etc.   But,  proof?  No.  Anecdotal like you said.  
---
But here's the thing.  Saying "players were not as knowledgeable back then" due to gear choice and DPS numbers.   At what point in time?  What patch?  You can't compare 1.1 and 1.12.  Remember, 1.12 wasn't out very long and by that time, many people were in TBC mode.  Were there any "hardcore minmaxing" vanilla guilds still on MC?  No.  We were all in Naxx.  
---
But at the end of the day, we'll never know unfortunately how accurate DPS numbers were.  1.12 numbers need to be massaged and merged into Retail - per that german dev interview link thing.  Classic will be its own game.
---
Unlimited WF proc chains you say?
---
If they can keep it stable, more power to them. That said, if they know they can't keep it stable, then sharding is the way to go. I gave way too many resources to the war effort to not be able to see it. We'll find out.
---
Considering they are running it on the modern engine; I'd assume so. 
---
aHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
---
I personally think anything beyond the Valley of Trials/other starting zones won't be necessary because you're allowed to do a lot more starting from level 6-ish and onward. The quests split up and you have access to other capital cities and professions. If there are too many people camping Zalazane I can always go fight harpies or grind crocolisks or even go to the Barrens early for a flight path, perhaps even fish while watching the hordes of Horde fight over raptor eggs.
---
Yeah I missed it in vanilla, I got into the game right at that time, I would have been gutted too if that had happened to me after putting into the effort! Hope you get to see it in Classic.
---
6 raids? Man, I love how you put a number on something that is really non-quantifiable. 
---
City raids are dope, though.
---
Dont fun away all the min/maxing
---
Most classes in vanilla require low apm so the wrists shouldn't cause much of an issue.  Pally would have a lot of slight movements.  Buffing can be done with macro.  Ret is one of the least engaging specs.  If your wrists are very bad mages and locks can be played on pvp with repetitive 3 buttons.
---
I could never figure out where to get those boots
---
Hunters are great in pvp for the entire game.  They have moderate dps and have fun elements.  Locks suck in pve/pvp for awhile then excel in both late game.
---
If you have a good guild yo can main tank with less then 10hrs a week playtime full clearing until naxx.  Not sure where the time constraints are coming from.
---
:')
---
Druid’s can juice their AC to levels Shaman can’t even begin to dream of. There is absolutely no comparison. 
---
No matter how many articles are written and in depth YouTube guides are out there, Shaman tanking is not a thing. While it is technically possible in some five mans, there are literally no pros to using a shaman tank over a warrior or Druid’s. 
---
The difference is that we got some footage and some forum posts from back then, and nothing shows that these things were actively used by the hardcore people. That’s my point and ‘evidence’. Dude couldn’t prove otherwise, other than anecdotal evidence and as soon as I requested more, he clearly left.
---
I obviously understand the differences in patches and content, from actual Vanilla and private servers. The statement about DPS was made with that In mind. My point still stands, without comparing back then and now, from movies and actually playing on private servers. Wolfshead Helmet is literally a direct showcase of us understanding and being more knowledgeable about the game today. It wasn’t used in conjunction with powershifting back then, as far as I remember and can see. On top of that, I’m pretty sure it was never meant to be BiS even for ferals in TBC for DPS. That even further shows, in my opinion, that not even Blizzard had the game figured out, like we do these days. Which goes back to my original argument that I don’t believe the numbers are so far off on private servers, that you can dismiss these things as working now or being known about now and not back then, because of that.
---
Hardcore raiding isn't a thing until naxx.  Most guilds raid for 3hrs two nights a week.  
---
Pretty much. I would prefer to not even need it, but im not gonna freak out and pretend its unwarranted. 
---
I wouldn't mind actually being able to play the game the first week is all.
---
Orc for enhance, Tauren for elemental.  Troll for pve resto, orc for pvp resto.
---
Good points!
---
This is when we just start spam sapping and running away to make sure they cant do anything but also not gangbang us hehe.
---
Rogue is 20% burst and bail and 80% mental warfare.
---
Human priest! Going to duo-level with my brother (night elf warrior) and plan on having a warrior alt.
---
How did *you* come to the idea that there could only be a minute amount of filler content?
---
Hunters and dagger rogues.  If you have a healer warrior.
---
That's what hook-and-loop is lol
---
Looking at the pictures on the box as my dad drove me home from the store..... reading the box as it opened.... wondering how can I become this legend of a character with this awesome sword!!!
---
Because there literally is filler content in place prior to Naxx, ZG itself is filler content. Six raids is an sbsurd number, hence the word minute. 
---
It will be only playable in 4:3 ratio. they have implemented a throttle to give you longer loading times and what appears to be choppy/laggy game play to give it that true classic experience. It's was apparently pretty easy to program as they just finished analyzing retail world pvp.
---
What do you classify as filler content?
---
I told my friend that I liked getting up close and personal with a sword and shield. He suggested warrior.
---
I was *terrible.*
---
I mean it was supposed to be in vanilla but got cut.  You could even get to hellfire via wall jumping out of deadmines 
---
I can’t pick a favorite class because I love them all so much , but I do plan on playing a priest as of right now.  So I’ll most likely be healing most of the time and dps when I can.  
---
The class I love seeing the most is for sure a GOOD mage.  Free water, int buff, and the most reliable cc to non undeads, and the frost nova for when someone pulls aggro.
---
The class I HATE seeing the most is a BAD mage.  Honestly I would rather have a Moonkin in my group than a mage that doesn’t give water, doesn’t know what cc means, and just spams frostbolts/fireballs nonstop with no peels when they need to.
---
I'm curious if the increase in server hardware performance over the past 14 years will allow for a massive event like that to run relatively smoothly. Client side it's hard to say as well seeing as in retail wow huge congregations of players can start bogging down even very respectable hardware.  
---
Also curious just how many people per server will be attending an event like that. I know on my server there were probably a few hundred or so present wading through the lag and dying to the giant anubisaths. In classic depending on the size of the realms there could probably be over a thousand folks wanting to be in silithus for the opening. I imagine at least a few servers are going to be very competitive with the top guilds.
---
Keep up the good work Josh
---
I'd be happy if they sharded uncontested zones, it's a limited pool, it's the early levels so you work out of it and then forget about it, and it solves most of the problems they've got. It's also got the advantage of being easily defined and not something they then need to justify why one area is sharded and another isn't.
---
You have either serious reading comprehension issues or are trolling.  Either way, bye
---
100% yes. I did several tests on this and made a few videos (no need to watch them, I can summarize them here): Classic's Demo ran MUCH better than the Vanilla WoW (original) client on my modern system. FPS is definitely not capped at 60 FPS. Most importantly, I found that while the Classic Demo client and the Vanilla client had similar average framerates, the 1% and 0.1% lows (basically, the "stutters" that you're referring to) were much less severe on the modern Classic Demo client.
---
Classic will run like butter compared to Vanilla.
---
I'm more worried about the AQ event than making it through launch. That was one of the top five moments of WoW in its entire history and so many people missed it because the infrastructure just couldn't handle it.
---
seriously, some people are such penny pinchers  
---
You've down voted everyone of my sensible replies, which indicates to me that you're not really in this for the 'two way' portion of the discussion.  Don't say bye, when we're just getting started now, stick around and show me where you say I'm wrong, rather than pseudo name calling - I'll wait.
---
People also forget that Druid’s can shift into bear form and use AoE taunt to then immediately die in a vain attempt to prevent a wipe.
---
I never once had it work, but one day...
---
Annoying zone to navigate thur and even more annoying when you die and try and autorun afk back to your body.
---
Having said that :D
---
All I read is " I am a liar, I am a liar, I'm doing it for the money, I am a liar."
---
but yall believe w/e you want
---
This right here is spot on from my understanding OP. As long as the Shaman knows what they’re doing, they can tank up to about 48-50. After that there’s just too much damage to mitigate. 
---
Thanks! Took 10 mins to transcribe 2 mins of this video and people want me to transcribe 2 1/2 hours of podcasts per episode :P
---
No there is no secret quests no one know about. 
---
1. If you want to heal for as much as possible you have to apply regrowth for the hot.
---
2. Downranking as a druid is interesting because you are not only downranking to stay mana efficient, but also because lower ranks (starting with 4) have lower cast time. Rank 5 is in fact your most mana efficient heal because it is the lowest rank that has a full cast time and as a result does not suffer from cast time penalty, but it (and all ranks above) are so slow that you will very rarely find a situation where you can use them in raids. It is still very nice to keep rank 5 and max keybound for 5 mans other situations where you won't get sniped. Rank 3 and 4 are probably going to be your most used because they strike a nice middle ground between speed and healing, but rank 2 is super and can be useful for sniping life tap heals and stuff like that. Rank 1 scales so poorly that even with crazy gear it heals for basically nothing, and it also GCD caps you. Don't worry about mana because you will almost never run out of mana with some gear, and if you have shitty gear you will have to cast high ranks anyways because the low ranks won't do much.
---
3. I keep max rank, rank 1 (for pvp) and 3, 4 or 5 depending on gear level, what I'm healing etc. Rarely use it but, if you only need a little bit of healing, you don't want to cast and you don't have to worry that the target dies or the healing gets sniped, you can throw on a low rank to save some mana.
---
I remember the realm I called home for a long time (Orc Warrior named Guda on Hakkar) had 1 alliance super guild that decided they didn't want to share the spoils and opened it at like 2am server time on Father's day when there was barely anyone on.  We were able to throw some make-shift groups together and kill some of the mobs outside but nobody wanted to stay for long.
---
[I mostly just danced in the middle of the alliance mob with my pink dress, after a while they stopped attacking me.](https://i.imgur.com/4C8pGur.jpg)
---
the AQ event is nothing special if you shard away the population. the AQ event was special *because* of the sheer number of people involved. it felt like a truly global event.
---
I've no doubt this sub will blow up around that time, with a lot of people fearing missing out too.
---
This is never going to happen. If you get your way and Blizzard just lets Classic be Classic for years and years, people will just stop playing. You'll end up on a dead server. 
---
From an initial profit perspective, #NoChanges makes sense. Less dev cycles to modify things. Get it up and running on the new hardware, make it stable, ship it. Then allocate devs based on community feedback/outcry to make some changes (read: keep it pointed at profits).
---
For sure OP. You had many things you could do with the first half of WoW. If you wanted to pvp for decent gear, you could. If your guild wasn't big enough there was always ZG. Molten Core eventually became clearable for most casual guilds. Even BWl to an extent was doable in lower tier guild. Then the dreaded AQ wait happen where people were just waiting for AQ to come out and were forced to farm pots and rep/mats. Many people quit during this time because of boredom. By this time PVP gear was becoming obsolete. Naxx rolls around and it's clear only a few top guilds can do it. God tier gear. 
---
&gt;the AQ event was special because of the sheer number of people involved.
---
Making it happen in the lead-up, yes. Not getting to see it was bullshit.
---
&gt;it felt like a truly global event.
---
No it didn't because the population in the zone made entire servers crash. It felt like a broken clusterfuck and just another broken promise from Blizzard.
---
Shaman are not well suited to tanking, and are easily worse than prot paladins which are already substantial downgrades from warriors and druids.
---
Shaman gets two bonus to threat. Rockbiter Weapon is a flat 72 extra threat per second, and earth shock does 2 threat per damage instead of the usual 1.
---
Totem threat is not attributed to the shaman so they can't even use fire nova or magma totem for AoE threat.
---
Imagine a tank that takes substantially more damage than warriors, paladins, and druids. Imagine a tank that goes OOM every pull. Imagine that despite this your DPS always have to hold back every fight because if they deal 100 more DPS than the tank they will pull aggro. Imagine a shaman tank.
---
So they eventually have to close the server? I don't get your point of it being a museum then. It's either constantly fresh or it has to upgrade in expac? That's exactly why I want classic, because it only lasted 2 years when it could have lasted 3
---
Yes, I’ve heard a blizzard employee say there are multiple secret quests in vanilla areas that even today no one has found. I can’t give source due to not remembering, it is in one of the Q&amp;As
---
There were many shamans that did try back in the day, they did have good threat, but their lack of avoidance, mitigation and health made them a tough choice in 5 mans. The only reason it was even fringe was because there werent that many tanks and a LOT of them sucked, so people were willing to give it a shot.
---
There's no better feeling than starting off in Elwynn for sure.
---
&gt; 1 alliance super guild that decided they didn't want to share the spoils and opened it at like 7pm server time on Father's day when there was barely anyone on
---
And people think Classic is going to be some mythical unicorn where everyone is nice and helpful. Something like this will happen again.
---
&gt; I can’t give source due to not remembering, it is in one of the Q&amp;As
---
This is driving me crazy. I so vividly remember this but can't actually find anything from blizz themselves. 
---
That's not anecdotal evidence. It's direct evidence, as I have personal knowledge.
---
Sure, 3 years is still somewhat reasonable. But eventually the game has to evolve or people run out of things to do. You can actually see the player count increase on every new content patch and then slowly decrease until the next one. 
---
Dynamic spawns &gt; Sharding
---
 
---
It's not the only alternative. Community is one of the most important aspects of vanilla and It's be a shame to filter that off to another shard.
---
Aren't you a ray of sunshine
---
3 years is perfect imo, I really hope they just wait to do fresh after naxx is out for 6+months. That those who can stay will
---
That doesnt sound like a tank lol. I could have tried the same thing spamming searing pain as an SL warlock. 
---
They are slower then lock / Hunter but beat everything else if good.
---
/raises hand. I'm literally the only one in my circle picking up classic. At best they tolerate me talking about it.

How do you use a trade API to monitor the Auction House without being near the Auction House?
---
Orc definitely better than undead.  Also the weapon skill isn't a big deal for rogues.  It's very noticeable on warrior though.
---
Frankly, the only class i really know is mage.  I've had no real alts, except 2 other mages.  lol.  But, I'm sure your example is correct in that Blizzard never intended for the Wolfshead helm to be BiS.  
---
I promised myself to never raid or pvp again.  That just ate me up.  But for fun i did MC on a pserver for kicks.  I saw the mages in greens and arcane power and i just lolled.  But who knows, 1.12 might have been that way in Vanilla.  But Naxx, I'm actually very curious.  I'd love to see a video of a pserver guild that's progressing through Naxx and not have everyone geared to the teeth and without world buffs.  Maybe that way I can gauge for me personally, how accurate they might be.
---
They've added in frame caps for certain zones. For example, in Ironforge you're hard capped to 5 fps.
---
You still can in Retail! Though the game is a bit smarter now, easier to view via Far Sight instead of dealing with disconnects as you fall through the world and stuff 
---
"4 people might team up and roll need on everything and give it to whoever among them needs it"
---
which conveniently ignores the "ninja looters get blacklisted on their server" which so many people are looking forward to
---
I've seen a few people (note: VERY FEW, seen way more scarab lords)  with a lowercase first letter thanks to a bug a while ago. I wish they'd just make it a dang feature already, gimme apostrophes too
---
If you have a private server installation, chances are the PDF manual is there! :D
---
so tell everyone that they are ninja looters, and they never find a group again
---
Shaman tanks work great for dungeons. They can tank every dungeon in game including UBRS. I don’t know much about raids.
---
Dwarf priest is probably the only class race combo where I would say there is no good argument for not rolling it. If you are a dwarf you are one step ahead of humans and nelfs in terms of competing for spots so you are just handicapping yourself. Not nearly as bad as feral druids though (you still need tons of priests and literally 0 ferals).
---
I would possibly be concerned with what others might think of you because don't roll dwarf. People will end up thinking of you either as somone who knows nothing about vanilla or as someone who doesn't care about maximizing their character. Perception obviously matters in a social game like WoW.
---
Despite this, some of the best and most autistic pserver guilds have had non-dwarf priests in them. So I guess what matters most is how skilled and dedicated you are.
---
They added a single target taunt for pallies but man I cant remember if that was pre BC.  So many classes were buffed and nerfed and buffed again.  Except warlocks, they just got the nerfbat again and again iirc.  I so miss permafear.  Anywho, if pallies get a taunt that will help, but yah the mana problems sucked hard.  My best friend played a prot pally and motherfucker doing anything with him took all day.  
---
LOL.  This is great.  It doesn't just apply to rogues, but to pretty much everything related to Vanilla, Private Servers, Classic, and everything else that's happened in the past.
---
Too funny.
---
I don't know exactly where I'd draw the line, but what I remember of original launch I'm okay with the first few zones. Keep chat all together (I assume that's possible? I haven't played since sharding) and get people together as soon as possible and I won't complain. The queues and complete desolation of the first few zones from overcrowding is something I'm happy to have reduced a little bit as long as things come together quickly.
---
Priest is definitely middle of the pack or better for easiest 1-60s. Perhaps check out some guides on leveling one.
---
In WoD we got new tech allowing for creature models to load incredibly more efficiently, allowing for us to have hundreds on the screen ALONG with the new model upgrades. Now that we'll be using old models with that new tech, I'm not worried. In terms of the server, well nowadays we have big time phasing and sharding and complex abilities (in terms of processing). AQ will probably have lag, Billy Joe Bob will probably DC, but I think it'll be way better than the first time.
---
&gt; shedding
---
The real threat to the game: dander from shedding hunter pets.
---
I'm a bit the same, I love pvp healing but pve healing sends me to sleep. I would like to play paly at 60 but don't think there's anyway I'd survive the autoattack levelling. Priest is a bit boring levelling but I'd still prefer it to paly.
---
How are they lying if it hasn't happened yet lmao
---
This is great for me because I am deaf. Judging from the picture I would have just guessed hes talking about how  truly tiny his dick is compared to his massive balls.
---
How are they telling the truth if it hasn't happened yet?
---
At least it fits the theme.
---
Similar averages? That surprises me, I had the demo but didnt have time to try out FPS differences myself (stupid lack of internet at the worst time). But between the Warlords of Draenor massive improvement to creature model loading, and Legion's massive terrain improvements, with old graphics and view distance, I expected a huge upgrade.
---
You spelled rouge wrong 
---
Blizzard is a multi-billion dollar, publicly traded, company. I think classic is going to be great and the constant worry is silly, but lets not be naive. They're going to do what's best for business, it'd be unethical to do otherwise. 
---
Ive thought about this some too and I'll list some of the synergys of my favorite class combo, palidan and warlock. You get the free mount at 40 for both of ya.  Invite a third and summon anyone.  Duo Farm with a voidwalker tank, paladin healer, and warlock dps.  Blessing of salvation on the warlock also makes it easier to do higher dps without pulling aggro. Both roll on different gear, probably some overlap if the paladin is holy.  The paladin can heal the voidwalker if its tanking too much.  Healthstones can be shared.  Even possible profession synergy; warlock could be an alchemist&amp;herbalist to make arcanite bars for a paladin with blacksmithing&amp;mining.  Spirit tapping is easier with a class that can heal too.  Because it's paladin it's of course alliance only. Both classes are two of the slowest until 40.  I'm sure I'm not thinking of everything.

Unfadeable carrying Deathborn and his trade chat and redridge antics were hilarious

If I am ever in a group, I’m going to try and be RL and throw it on ML right before the boss dies. Same thing with Thekal in ZG. I love my Kodo don’t get me wrong, but I never ninja looted a single thing in original WoW, but this time around I’m playing for keeps.
---
Get really good at the game, that is basically the only way to have a some what decent chance of success if you are a new streamer nowadays. 
---
I played a human priest vanilla in a guild that was consistently top 5.  No world firsts of course but many server firsts on Whisperwind.  I had Zero problems finding a raid slot or a group.  Ever.  Sure onyxia would have been easier, and yah there were always peeps that were like “ hummie wtf”.  That said, I was also one of the first 60s in a game that no one knew how big a deal it was going to be.  Honestly, with everyone knowing the fights and everyone having access to discord, I don’t think you’ll need to min/max nearly as much.  
---
If the server sizes are authentic we should not need sharding. Also as someone else stated already, its been 14 years and they cant figure out how to keep these presumably smaller servers stable?  
---
How about an even more practical look at it, what happens when the sharding ends and everyone is funneled again? Because if sharding really is only for starter zones (Elwynn, Dun Morogh, Teldrassil, Durotar, Tirisfall Glades, and Mulgore), that’s only the first 10-14 levels tops. I really doubt that everyone would truly be cool with sharding reaching as far as Westfall or The Barrens come live. Hell they even acknowledge that the demo was an isolated situation, probably to sate all the angry gamers that saw it in the demo (myself included). The reason being, if you are in level range of a Dungeon, you should have the chance/opportunity to have anyone you could possibly run into out in the open world as a party member. I can remember plenty of times playing Vanilla WoW and getting invites to groups just because i was questing near the right people.
---
Something else I haven’t seen discussed is how it will inevitably lead to faster PVE Progression if the raid content isnt gated at the beginning. This is something that immediately makes any server feel “smaller”.  The natural fight for xp when a server opens is part of the flow, period. Some people have said it could lead to servers becoming dead after the tourist leave. How many people do we honestly expect to be tourist, maybe 10-20% tops. This isnt going to kill a server, and it if does? They had no problem merging in the past. I dont wanna hear “They wont spend the money” one thing blizz has shown time and time again is if “We” the community ask for it, they’ll give it to us. The current state of retail is a good example.  Granted it feels like they’re Elizabeth Hurley playing Satan and putting evil twists on all of our “Wishes” lol
---
I could go on forever, point being, sharding was the nail in the coffin for retail and what the game once was. I will still play Classic WoW regardless, but a part of me will die inside if it launches with any extensive sharding.

dwarf hunter
---
If you take leveling out of the equation, which you should since you only have to do it once, then it comes down to:  
---
Do I play a class I like but I've played forever  
---
or  
---
Do I play the class whose activity I like but I sometimes have to deal with stupid people doing an activity I don't really like?  
---
Impossible for me to really help you make that decision. The only help I can offer is don't let leveling weigh your decision.  
---
Although I can say if you plan on raiding on that priest, expect to heal.  
---
Is it so crazy to believe that others have a different definition of fun? 
---
This is good news, considering the beefy PC I'm building just prior to launch.  
---
Go warlock, I suppose.
---
Even then, a paladin tank is pretty fucking abysmal due to all the down time.
---
I love the troll village. It's such an understated, low key home for one of the horde's biggest races. I also like Razor Hill just for my first introduction to orcish architecture. I don't the zone has much else going for it though.
---
This.
---
Blizzard started designing them to be able to tank -- but quickly scrapped the idea due to not wanting a class that could tank, dps and heal.
---
Its just more of a remnant in late vanilla that some skills still have high threat generation and very marginal talent points for tanking.  Even items like the savage gladiator mail lost its + defense rating in favor of higher base stats for dps... making it amazing for dps warriors too.
---
Yep. I always say this. All we'd have to do is repopulate our databases with the new info, which would be a massive crowd effect after we learn of the change. I give it 2 weeks before the new database has all the level 50+ gear updated.  
---
I mean, its impossible to know what you don't know...
---
Ironically, a SL warlock actually makes a decent "emergency tank" and there is one specific raid boss where you need to tank as a warlock.
---
I won't be playing with any of my old friends. I have no fear of the situation though. I'm good at making friends in game and finding people to play with.  
---
I'm excited to form new friendships in Classic.  
---
isnt quest data contained in the game files? at least quest id? im sure it would have been mined by now
---
I love the troll town in Desolace. After trudging through the ugly landscape filled with vultures, putrid horsemen, demons, and other nasties, you arrive at a remote little beach town off the serene ocean. I guess I just love troll places in general (tauren too).
---
Man I look forward to doing these dungeons with randos again. Such a good time.
---
Overwatch back in the day...
---
You sir deserve more upvotes.

That ore quest really fucks you up because it awards like, a white rarity sword or something. Such a beautiful slap in the face.
---
A lot of the jumps are really hard on gnome
---
As  mage player who loved fishing, I can comfortably say no!
---
Not everybody will be using old models.
---
Naxx coming out is when I will quit playing classic, the gear is completely overpowered and ruins PvP.
---
Late half of vanilla adds cross server bgs which completely ruins pvp as well.
---
Thats a troll just like the medallion in Dark Souls.
---
Likne ud rogue, was one of top dps in my guild and I was so bad it's laughable. I thought having the most shadowcraft made you elite. I then upgraded from shadowcraft to stormshroud. When I heard that dude's guild pooled money for teebus I was so incredibly jealous.  Game has changed so much, can you imagine trying to explain to anyone back then the correct way to tank vael is blood thirst specced while dual wielding? Have your full consumables and sappers or you don't raid? 
---
You plan to level two paladins?!
---
Travel to ashenvale/alterac/arathi highlands.
---
I got so much fun and interesting PvP by ganking and being ganked at these places.
---
Yeah but I don't blow mobs in SM to level. :)  
---
&gt; Or do you expect people give away their gold making techniques
---
You got it!

Stared at this box art for many hours. Why did I think this dwarf warrior looked like the most badass dude ever? Lol 
---
High society secrets. You wouldn't know.  
---
Nobody said that it will be time-limited and starer-zone only. Quite the opposite.
---
Most def true, same goes for other resistance auras as you might not get to see those totems as a lock.
---
Yup. I have a mediocre rig, but I get 1080 21:9 100fps in Ironforge on retail. 
---
&gt;I absolutely despise leveling a priest. Its honestly the slowest leveling experience.
---
Laughs in paladin.
---
I’m going to tell you that priest is far from slow. If you upkeep your wand you have virtually no down time at all. Almost no other class has the ability to constantly pull like a priest barring a hunter or a lock if you’re really good. I don’t know how much experience you have leveling priests, but if you know what you’re doing especially on alliance it is really easy to have a wand that does insane damage. I could actually win pvp fights just wanding in STV aka Vietnam. If you like healing in PVP I would go priest. If you want an undead to constantly use their racial on your warlock fears in PvP feel free to deal with that headache. I would personally choose priest for PvP specifically on Alliance over a warlock.
---
I still have my original wow box with this on it.
---
 `but quickly scrapped the idea due to not wanting a class that could tank, dps and heal.` 
---
uhhm, druid, pally?
---
I've heard about that. Something in AQ i think. Cool concept. Cant imagine tanking on my lock but it sounds fun
---
What are you blowing mobs in SM for then?
---
Taunt was added in 2.0.
---
Have some GOD DAMNED faith Aruther!
---
Probably human paladin. Orc or tauren shaman is a close 2nd.
---
It is quantifiable though.  
---
He rated BfA 40% as good as vanilla in terms of his own personal metric.  
---
It's an internal, subjective scale rather than an external, objective one.  
---
It's basically him saying he still plays and enjoys [current version] but is more excited for Classic.
---
Most "Scrub" guilds will clear BWL but the prep required for AQ will kill them 
---
Hi all.
---
I'm looking for a late night guild. I'm on the west coast and work until 10PM PST, so the raid time would need to be after that. I've always played alliance, but going Horde is not a deal breaker if I find a cool group of people to play with.
---
As far as experience, I played vanilla thru cataclysm. I was fairly casual back in the day and only cleared MC/ZG/Ony. During TBC I cleared all raid content but I'm not looking to go hardcore this time around, more of a casual guild focused on raiding 2-3 nights per week, let me know!
---
My real question is if wow progress will follow world first naxxramas...again
---
They can 'tank' up to level 45 or so. (Not specifically that level, but roughly)
---
Yeh but then you have to play druid forever 
---
F
---
I remember when they updated for the pre-WoD patch and I jumped from 30-50 FPS with a 12 year old rig.
---
If you level as shadow it is not bad. They are really efficient at leveling assuming you have enough spirit gear and a good wand. Have you leveled priest using a guide?
---
Playing Troll will give you a &lt;1&amp; increase to hit and a tiny agility bump. For hunter, your race won't matter as much as the min/maxing of having max consumes at all times, going max effort on gearing, and playing at max skillcap with shot rotation and pet micro.
---
My bet, it's literally going to be patch 1.12 with segmented content release. Just like Blizzard said.
---
Just going to point out that Blizzard gave Starcraft Brood War a perfect graphical overhaul without touching or altering a *single* game mechanic in the slightest. They have the power to fix bad pathing, broken ramp logic and whatever else but they didn't because the community asked them to leave it exactly as it is.
---
Even bugs like the dragoon move command attack target acquisition time bug was left in even though it was never really intended from Blizzard from a design perspective. The reason why is because that tiny bug which saves you like 50-100 milliseconds has profound impact on the game's balancing. Protoss wouldn't be able to attack against Terran if it wasn't for move command Dragoons which allows them to attack widow mines before they can detonate. It's just that you need something stupid like 350 APM to pull something like that off consistently.
---
Pleasure, obviously.
---
Lolol
---
I played vanilla with IRL friends and family.
---
One of them died. One of them slept with my brother's wife, they divorced over it and we aren't friendsies anymore. As far as I know none of us play wow anymore and I'm the only one interested in classic.
---
It's not really an issue is it? Make 3-4 you're most interested in. Get to level 20 and you either want to keep going or play something else. Repeat lvl 30, 40 with as many classes as needed. Before you know it you'll have a 60 of what you most wanted to play. If you want to get every class to 60 rather than sink all your time into one then do that...
---
I actually saw it drop twice in vanilla unfortunately i lost both rolls. It was not until Cata that i finally got it.
---
Tell your boy Hammerfell that he's not allowed in the raid. At level 60 still has no helmet, cloak, necklace, trinket or ranged weapon. Clearly not BiS. No enchant on his BoE sword of goldmaking either. Filthy casual
---
I'll be looking for a Dad guild for us 40 year olds.
---
It's just nice having flat land to farm on. It' s easy on the eyes
---
Join the altoholics!  I can guarantee you that I will have all but 1 slot occupied from the get go.  I end up playing a class, then wanting to change things up every so often.  I don't care a lot about progressing though, I play at my own pace (slow) and have fun along the way.  From start: fury warrior, hunter, lock and shaman at the least.  Probably fury warrior first.
---
I'm not worried about jamming to 60, that's for sure - but I do worry about the vast bulk of people sprinting ahead and finding myself going 1-60 in the overworld instead of delving into dungeons. 
---
Fair. 
---
Why would you tarnish your reputation for a mount?
---
I think he's more wrong about this than he thinks he is. #nochanges is not a gray scale, it's binary. You either make changes or you don't make changes. We've already lost with the implementation of loot trading, right click report and the four stages of content. There's no way for us to win anymore.
---
Personally, I don't think any sort of community is to be gained when the starting zones are a complete zerg. Maybe not the 10-20 zones though, that honestly might be too much.
---
Playing on private server and ya when classic hits its gonna be 10x worse. No one would be able to get anything done at all. And for sure servers would crash hard
---
Yeah :s
---
Could your /s be more obvious. 
---
I've always enjoyed the numbers and formulas in MMOs, but I've always primarily played the way you're describing.  I'm totally on your side here.  It's as if people don't want to really play, and I'll never fully understand it, though I get some of it.
---
Pleasure  
---
Going shaman and lock. Never played either so I'm excited for both.
---
Yeah, that's fair to say.  Back then, I mostly hated that raid guilds acted like basically like a business organization, but for a long time now I've come to understand why.  It's not really an enviable undertaking unless you're a born leader, I think, heh.
---
Druid...
---
I'm gonna level a bunch of toons and then level another toon when I hit 60.
---
Agreed. I have always thought that city bosses ought to have done more - perhaps provide a minor buff while they are alive, drop some decent loot when killed, and not be quest givers so they can stay dead for a week without blocking important quest lines. Or just give a big pile of honour when killed.
---
Oh well.

# What about cross server grouping?
---
Prior to TBC I had thousands of DHKs racked up from ganking and town pillaging from sea to shinging sea. For those not familiar, these  stats were displayed in the interface along with your honor.
---
DHKs were as broken as the pvp honor system. Both numbers at some point will become irrelevant. But nothing beats a sad low lvl tauren wondering what happened to their quest giver in Mulgore. Will he be back? Careful what you wish for.
---
Lol musta missed that. Dont suck a fat one dude.
---
The fact that you find so many classes appealing is a good thing. Now find the most appealing one and main the hell out of it. Once you reach a point where you say "I could probably do with an alt now" then choose your second one.  
---
Even a player who only plays one character can have alt-itus, but they can also control it too.  
---
You got me, sodapoppin is running low on money so he paid me to advertise his twitter in the /r/classicwow comment section
---
Gonna follow my old method here: either you're trolling or dumb. Either way I'm not gonna answer anymore, you're not worth my time anymore
---
Fuck sharding
---
Protip: avoid the pure pvp servers if you don't want to mix with this crowd. They will fester like flies on a dead corpse next to the streamers that will kill the entire server (unless they all run pve). 
---
I got this on a human rogue on one of the first  vanilla pservers that actually got anywhere. I knew it existed but don't think I'd even seen one before that so it was pretty sweet. I think I seeing remember a dwarf with it later on that server too. 
---
That was an amazingly thought out reply, thank you.  I might have to try that
---
Yes, that's exactly what Ion said.
---
Guess I'm rolling rogue 😂 
---
Oh baby, they’re flowing.
---
Once they outgear the content it's really nice. Biggest problem can be mana management but pally tank + pally healer is nice for BOW + wisdom and light judgements.
---
Druid also good for pally tank cause innervate.
---
One amazing trick that palas beat warriors is range aggro. As a healer casters always blow me up if I can't LOS, and warriors can't gain threat from distance. Paladin can heal themselves for threat + righteous fury. I'm excited to see how this works in classic 
---
Horde fur sure
---
I actually like that quirkiness of the cover art. Back when times were much more simpler....
---
&gt;Answered in WoW Q&amp;A at Blizzcon by Ion Hazzikostas, 03/11/18:
---
&gt;“The first few weeks when everybody is packed into Valley of Trials and everyone is packed into Elwynn, we think we can use sharding there in a limited, time limited, way to solve the initial launch day load problems while, making sure in the long run, as server communities solidify into a healthy population and a single world.”
---
For some reason this really, really brings me back compared to other nostalgic posts. It was just so new back then, and I guess the cover art was one of the first things I saw that in a way wasn’t “shoved” in my face constantly (such as the nelf box art).
---
ITS NOT IN THE DATABASE
---
Just level them to 35. If you don't like them, switch them to alch/tailor bots....may as well get some gold for your effort.
---
YOURE NOT IN THE DATABASE
---
They avoided giving Paladins a taunt for design reasons and druids can only DPS effectively because in the past thirteen years people discovered farming Manual Crowd Pummelers.
---
Kevin Jordan, the lead class designer:
---
&gt; “We didn’t have the total specific idea worked out on how [the Paladin] was actually going to taunt so we were still experimenting and learning as we went but our goal and our philosophy was always do it different; make the bear tank a certain way, make the paladin tank a certain way make the warrior tank a certain way and to a lesser extent make the void walker tank a certain way, just have him feel differently, have them function differently so that they give a different experience and it changes the dynamic of the group and how people have to play and there’s different things going on.”
---
From what I understand Shamans were *kinda* purposefully designed to be able to tank up until level 30 dungeons. They didn't want Shamans tanking content above that. It was a design decision. They thought that was a good balance at the time.
---
Vanilla was them throwing shit at the wall and seeing what stuck. That's why the meme back in the day was that patch 2.1 was when WoW finally left beta.
---
I remember seeing this as well.
---
Tanked 5-mans on different private servers and it went smooth and well. Just inform everybody in group about the difference to warrior and team up with the healer. 
---
After a couple of deaths most dds understand the information part from the beginning (you might need a chatmacro for the announcement, tho).
---
It's true that you need to push a little harder than a warrior tank but a bad warrior tank (and they are out there) will still be worse than a pally tank that knows what he's doing.
---
And last but not least: Haters gonna hate! Make friends and run with them regularly. If you did leveling dungeons with a pally tank you will most probably also be good at 60.
---
naxx gear has to be OP imo.
---
the more dedication the better gear!
---
Who would even dare to clear naxx for +20SP 😂
---
I'm still as skeptical now as I was when he said it.  I completely understand the reasoning, but we all also know blizz has problems with populations throughout the current version of wow, and I can only suspect that if those limits start becoming a problem (a raid on stormwind for example) then sharding will become a real issue.
---
This isn't the "slippery slope" discussion, this is simply me wanting reassurance that the current tech can handle standard classic wow gameplay without throwing the sharding switch.  
---
From what I've personally seen on videos and streams from the current version of WoW the servers simply can't handle a decent sized group of people in one location, and I think most of us on my side of the fence were just hoping that the pure increase in tech performance over the years would render stuff like that a non-issue.
---
Yup. No flowers left to sniff and I know the lore inside and out.
---
It IS fun regardless though.
---
You dont need to lvl resto
---
Most talents are only needed for raid healing
---
You should be fine with a typical ele build if you want to heal any dungeons and maybe safe somw healing equipment (I healed with an wnhancment shamy until 60 that way)
---
This sub reddits users are the kings and queens of taking shit out of context.
---
"blizz want sharing in vanilla! It is going to kill the game!!!!!" did these dumb shits even watch blizzcon? Its kinda ironic how the most autistic part of the community that are the no changes crowd (the part that are nochanges or i quit) are causing more harm then good to the game.
---
But again, playing on private severs and never on vanilla makes you a bit dumb in a sense. The glory days where 3000ms, lag when 100 players where in the same city and serves having random take downs because they needed to hot fix things.
---
So for the love of God, stop advocating for shit you have no clue about when you never even where there to see what it was like. Playing on unlisted servers with fucking scuffed ass code and mega structure 10k players don't make you a advocate for what is good for the actuall game. 
---
Yup, slows down considerably and the zones are much more spotty after that.
---
It blows me away as a semi casual that I can STILL pass up the everyday players.

Im german and played only on german servers,  for classic i plan to roll on a english realm for the international community, but also to improve my english speaking skills(heavy german accent). But only if none of my RL friends are playing, beacuse they wont roll on a non german server =(.
---
Many of the rumored hidden quests have popped up in later expansions. E.g. you can get Ashbringer in Legion. In an uncorrupted form. One of the hidden tints for it involves a quest chain that is an homage to the Vanilla era rumors about the hidden way to acquire ashbringer. 
---
As is. I kinda doubt it. Even if maybe there was one hidden somewhere, I can’t see it rewarding anything really important. There really weren’t a lot of unused mount or pet models in Vanilla, for example. It’s not like there’s a hidden raid tier gated behind a quest of that nature, etc.
---
So, even if there somehow is one. It’s like pointless. E.g. some dev popped an Easter egg quest that only spawns under extremely weird conditions.....but only rewards some money or something. 
---
But again, it’s doubtful. 
---
In order to advise you best, I want to ask if you feel like leveling as resto is a necessary thing, or if you're doing it because you just have a genuine interest in being a resto shaman while leveling, regardless of what's more optimal.  
---
Answer that and you can avoid a lot of misdirected answers in the comments.  
---
They literally run a 2006 private server in-house to compare their 2019 build to. And they specifically said stuff like debuff limits were initially only technical limitations that the vanilla programmers would have gotten rid of if they could, but they **aren't** for classic because that was part of vanilla
---
They are, and what's best for business isn't "filling up vanilla with infinity microtransactions or other things that sound good to retarded investors and instantly driving away the entire community"
---
They know that in order for classic to do well, it has to be authentic, and they're making it authentic
---
Any of those quests would have been out of the game by Cata. 
---
Kinda sounds like them trolling if they actually said “to this day”. I get private servers exist, but the fact that those quests were purged from the database like 9 years ago, makes a comment like that sound like either trolling or hyperbolic bragging. 
---
Nochanges is an ideal to strive for! Keep striving Vanilla is worth it.
---
Yeah. I totally want to just enjoy smoking my Canadian weed and heal. I get a lot of enjoyment from it. I enjoy asking warriors and rogues if they want a pocket healer for quests. It doesn't matter if I level slow. I just want to know what talents that will help me be the best resto I can.
---
Honestly, I wouldn't even mind. 
---
I plan to go 2H fury so I'd be the top choice for solo DPS with a Nightfall but not necessarily the wisest choice. Correct me if I'm wrong but that would be the offtank that has points in prot. Which may very well end up being me lol.
---
&gt;backported legion client
---
They explained their reasoning like this
---
If they go with a legion framework and put classic databases into it, the vast majority of bugs are going to be immediately recognisable, easily fixed, and have very little ill effect before they are.
---
If they go with a vanilla framework, the bugs are going to be backend, hard to find and fix, and some of them are going to be **major security holes** with **massive ill effects when exploited**
---
Please don't try to tell coders who know what they're on about that they're wrong about stuff you have no idea about.
---
Talents don't matter if you are leveling as resto. Just use a fast dagger with flametongue weapon and searing totem. Personally I wouldn't touch resto until 50ish and then I would spam dungeons, but whatever floats your boat. Talents don't mean all that much to shaman leveling until a lot later if you level sword and board. It's "slow" but efficient. Kargoz prob has a dagger list in his shaman leveling videos. Just keep that dagger updated with the fast ones in the list, have a shield on and have fun. 
---
I don't think it's ever a good idea to tell people to play WoW a certain way. Literally just.... play the way that is the most fun, and that is generally what everyone does anyway.
---
fuck yea
---
NO SHARDING
---
To be fair all those who play dwarf warriors are chads. 
---
Or the majority of players didn’t care about putting 40 man raids on farm and still had plenty of fun
---
It honestly doesn't. I never played retail vanilla back in 2005
---
Not simpler though. If anything the complexity of the game was the cause of this mess
---
Priest levels great. You go tailoring/chanting to make the initial wands (can drop both after if you want, but tailoring has a really nice priest robe at 60), spec in wands and spirit tap asap and you are set. Here is the wand progression. I did not make this. Kargoz did. He has a video on basically every class on youtube. There are only 3 classes that really suck to level. Warrior, Rogue and Paladin and if you follow good weapon progression like the wands, they aren't bad.

This is how I would do it personally if I was leveling as a resto shaman and marketing myself as a warrior/rogue pocket healer.

It's a slight modification of the normal 0/12/39 because I think Improved Ghost Wolf is lovely while questing, and I'm going down enhance to get the improved melee totems, which your rogue/warrior friends will love you for.

There’s a feral in my guild, he’s really good and well geared and seems to be a real asset. I don’t think many guilds would want more than one though.

Well, i was a lot more lucky, getting it after 60-odd runs, but at least you could reset the dungeon and do it over and over again. Unlike some heroic dungeons (once per day) or Raids (once per week). That midnight mount from KZ caused me a lot more anguish.
---
There’s also a quest in BfA that indicates we will go back to Grim Batol, and/or something sinister involving the Twilght Drakes that is going on there will develop into a greater problem. 
---
shaman quests sucked big ole balls my friend.
---
Fantastic thank you. 
---
Haha, Hunter currently at place 7 - i sort of think they will be much higher. Similar for warrior at place 1 - once people start leveling and see the loooong journey up to 40-ish they might just swap over to an easier class.

Lock(sm.ruin)/Hunter(marks)/Pally(holy) would probably be my pick for classes that can be good at pvp/pve without respeccing.
---
Or it's a red herring
---
You can totem blind and it's not that hard to anticipate when it's gonna happen.. You can trinket a stun and you can kite them while they can't kite you. Rogues also have no stun break on a trinket so certain things you can acquire or make are very strong vs them. The advantage is with the enhance if they are orc and tauren is not bad either. Stunned targets can't dodge. You can still beat them on a rogue. It's not 100 percent chance or anything. Now a troll shaman?  Yeah you are screwed. Most enhance shamans are just horrible like most ret paladins. They have a low initial skill ceiling to compete so they draw a lot of mediocre players, but like all classes they  have a high ceiling to be really good.
---
Rogues on the other hand draw a lot of good players just like mages. That doesn't mean the best rogue is better than the best of any other class. If anything I would say druid probably has the highest cap when you consider BG's. 
---
Shamans have the most spells in the game when you add downranking. Use them. You are more than autoswing and a few offensive abilities.
---
i'd love to see new raids that add alternative statted gear to allow for different classes to play alternative specs
---
I think there will be a waaaaaaaaaaaaay more than this. Warrior leveling is too hard, while the hunter is hard only until 10, after this it is easy and you are able to kill stuff solo.
---
I am playing a hunter (played it on every single version of the game, this is my main class since I play the game) and I think some people might be turned off because of a few things:
---
1. 8y deadzone (5 was ok, but 8 was a bit much)
---
2. No traps in combat
---
3. You have fewer bag slots because you always carry arrows and one of ur bags is an ammo bag. The best endgame ammo is made by engineers so you will waste a lot of gold or will have to farm a lot of thorium ores.
---
4. The rotation isn't 1 key spam, you can clip ur auto shots which will be less dmg done. Unlike any expansion.
---
5. Raid dmg is low compared to any pure dps class on equal gear. Most of the time you will be the guy with the trueshot/nature resist aura.
---
6. They will ask you to do tranq shots, traps and kiting, while the first two aren't that hard, not a lot of people are good in kiting.
---
7. Mend pet isn't a nonstop spamming skill like the current version, so your pet will die... a lot. Growl isn't really a taunt.
---
8. You have to level your pet and switching between new and old pet on 60 will be a pain. Also, you need to feed it, which req a food, that cost 45s per 5 at level 60 and will waste even more of ur bag slots.
---
9. Hard time on weapons, you need at least 3.0 speed and until BWL, you will struggle a bit, to get a good one.
---
10. You don't have any real burst cds and your dmg is pretty constant. But after 3-4 min you will run oom and unlike any other class that uses mana to do dps - you cannot restore your without potions
---
Water ripples are generated client side. Imagine a Hunter sends his stealthed pet into the water. He can see his cat's ripples in the water and you cannot because the cat is invisible.
---
If that Hunter jumps into the water along with his pet, you can see the water ripples behind him, he can see the ripples of his pet next to him, but you can't see his pet's ripples.
---
Now imagine a Rogue jumps into the water unstealthed. You can see the water ripples around him. If he stealths, the ripples disappear because he's no longer being rendered on your client.
---
The water only produces ripples when there is a model in the water.
---
I would like to play suppor,t mostly in PvP, but some PvE as well. I was going to main Holy Paladin, but I fear that the gameplay is too boring and that there will a a large influx of palas  and me being a special snowflake I prefer playing a hipster class in MMOs. Then I considered Priest, but I don't really want to play Dwarf, even though its great in PvP. So now I am wondering if Druid would be an interesting choice for someone like me with it not being played that much. 
---
So the question I have is whether is it true that there probably will be a lot of Paladins and Priests around on the Alliance side and that druids will be underplayed. I also heard that Druids in a hands of skilled player can do much more than just spam healz and roots.

Thx

1.  The answer to whether Regrowth  is used, or not used is widely up to situations/spec and role.  It is not a primary heal someone telling you otherwise is in my internet opinion wrong.  It is not a primary heal because of sniping, mana inefficiency, bad max heal value, and sustainability.   It does not mean that it does not have a place on your action bar even with a key-bind depending on your mouse button capacity.  Your quickest and most important spells and ranks should be in your 1-4  action bar, F, R,  mousewheel left, mousewheel right, mouse action button 1,2, and then if you use an MMO mouse following down the number of buttons you have.   A moba style mouse such as the Naga trinity is a real best friend to healers in Wow.  Of course you can use Ctrl castings to double up spells you can assign 1-4  but I don't like that method and would not suggest it one because CTRL is the perfect bind for Vent/Discord and two because I find it easier to muscle memory using 1-4 F R and then mouse action buttons.  Regrowth is fine to throw at a low mana lifetapping Warlock on a DPS race fight if your mana is above 40 percent. Regrowth is fine on a tank pre pull, Regrowth is perfect on something like Maxena assuming your using boss timers and can time the regrowth to land right before your webbed.  A few druids keeping max rank regrowth up on a tank and spank is perfectly ok. Regrowth can be really good in flag carrying scenarios say you had a small break in damage because you stunned someone you can hop out of bear regrowth/rejuv yourself then hop back in to bear even calling in the situation for a NS/Regrowth when I pvp I hotbar/bind my NS/Regrowth macro.  Regrowth can actually get someone killed in the wrong order on Patchwerk and that is a fight that you do not downrank on, you can cancel cast max rank HT only letting it hit when it needs to hit.  Understanding cancel casting and the 5 second rule is crucial to pairing with downranking.  Why is it such a bad spell which only has rare occasions for it to be used?  Even using max consumables, flask, zanza, mana Pots on cooldown, demonic runes on cooldown innervating yourself which is a very rare thing you ever should ever do, max rank regrowth spam will oom you in any fight thats not a cakewalk/farmstaus.  So lets compare a max rank regrowth to a max rank flash heal of a paladin same cast time, much different mana cost.  The palys flash heal hits for less with no dot for less mana, regrowth hits for more with a dot and costs far more mana.  The paly can spam flash heal all fight long whilst you cannot.   Now your playing at the speed of the raid palys/priests everyone with a 2 second cast time generally notices when someone takes damage and will be reacting close to the speed that you react, unless there is very specific heal targets assigned, assuming not generally you and 1-3 other healers will be targeting the same person if any healer is .2 seconds faster than you and you gotta consider lag and ping there going to snipe you.  Meaning there heal will get in before yours, rendering your heal which was already mana intensive to begin with just overheal.  Overheal is useless, and most of people who win on heal charts are doing so with Overheal which looks good on a chart but real raid leaders when determining the quality of a raider look at overheal percentage, mana efficiency, being alive and having mana for the last 4 percent of a crucial boss fight with half the healers dead on a first kill attempt.  Regrowth is just easy to get sniped on it generally heals for more then what kind of standard incoming raid dmg is ie a tick or 2 of an ground effect, shadowbolts, dots, etc.  Max rank HT even with the slower casting time has a better top end heal for topping of someone who took a big chunk of dmg the reason you down rank unless you have specific heal targets or tank targets like Patchwerk someone is gonna get a chain heal or a flash heal in before your max rank HT and your just going to end up Overhealing.  The way to get those big heals is in to NS Max rank HT.  When you talk eating your own innervate there are situations that call for it, say its a curse heavy fight all the healers and mages are oom or low, and raid dmg isnt a problem that is a good time to eat your own vate.  Vate works of spirit so when you do eat it you should at least be using spirit consumables and hotswap your weapon to a high spirit staff with a high spirit enchant on it for the duration of your vate then switch back to your primary.  But it any normal scenario if it is a heal heavy fight and there is any priest that is lower than 40 percent mana the vate is better in their hands.  If you want to end the a boss fight with a high heal efficiency, low overheal percentage, high healing numbers your primary should be HT rank 4, your second primary should be rejuv max rank, R5 HT is just to long of a heal the likelihood of being sniped is exponentially higher than a R4 HT.  Use swiftmend (if your spec took swiftmend)  NS/HT for emergency healing.  Your early-raid spec should be Moonglow until you build enough gear to support moving to something like a Heart of the Wild build.  I'm just speaking from my experience, there are some druids who build gear out for a IMP Regrowth build which is kind of like a glass cannon it has quick high heal output but generally less sustain then moonglow/HOTW builds.  
---
2. I never found occasion to use R3, R4 is the way to go but that was just my personal preference there are a ton of druids who used rank 3-5 depending but start with 4 and then as you learn the class more you can adjust and ask yourself did someone die because i went oom, or did someone die because i missed them by .5 seconds of cast time if the answer is generally no to those questions you do not need R3 or R5 in your rotation.  Rank 1 and 2 when OOM  honestly its better in that moment to let your Mp5 roll and stay out of 5 second rule because your never going to stabilize and get in to a state where you can continue to heal targets with a good coefficient if your preventing yourself from entering the 5 second rule and spending the little mana you build on low inefficient heals.  There are just better things to do, first off you should swap to your High Spirit weapon using a macro when you start getting 20 or lower  percent the extra spirit is more valuable at the time then the +heal you can afford to swap back to your high +heal weapon when you get back to 30 percent.  You should always have mana pots, Demonic Runes which share diff cooldowns like being oom is the perfect time to blow a rune, you should start eating those consumables on difficult content  at diff stages of mana like don't just wait till your oom then use a mana potion use a mana potion at 60 percent mana, then use mana pot on cooldown then say blow a rune on 30 percent mana, then adjust your casting take full use of cancel casting when you understand that its a mana burden start using Heavry Runecloth bandages instead of a heal to give yourself a little time out of combat and let that mana tick up. Don't heal just to heal like if there are other healers say one you had just given your vate and dmg output from the fight is manageable just let your mana tick up out of 5 second. If you are a tank healer and have gone oom communicate it over Discord so a raid healer who might have some mana left can take your assignment.   Being useful in the scenario where you are absolutely dry on mana is not that hard swap your spirit weapon, be OCD about cancel casting, use bandages, on anyone in your range and mostly understand the scenario, look at other healers mana if your oom and every other healer in the raid is oom and the boss is at 80 percent that's gonna probably be a wipe and maybe not the best use of your consumables.

What sort of pvp? Open world? Bg? Duels? 
---
The game's developmental disorganization caused it's charm. Notice the cover art still resembles a beta gameplay of sorts.
---
Literally SL/SL (already infeasible bc would be OP) plus conflagration, shadowburn, ruin.  Fuck I wanna main lock
---
Yeah fair enough, calling it a “mess” has a negative connotation to it and it may have been messy during launch week if there were a lot of connection issues, can’t remember. But yeah I was actually going to say that I liked the cover art because it seemed like a screenshot of alpha or beta gameplay.
---
[v] Auto-attack on 1
---
[v] Pummel on bar in Battle Stance for some reason
---
[v] Recklessness on bar in Battle Stance for some reason
---
[ ] All action bars available filled with absolutely useless things like every single Healing Potion
---
[v] Mousing over his items in combat
---
Looks about right, but can we talk about the warlock buffing Demon Armor during combat? So unprepared!
---
Unfinished zones and half finished ideas added mystery throughout
---
And it would give players too much control over their character so we can't have that!
---
/s
---
I would have loved that.
---
Open world and BG. Duels are fun but not a huge focus of mine .
---
I prefer the other to 2specs to play pvp as hunter. BM for the pet stun and surv for the high dodge/crit chance.
---
But shamans and warlocks have dispel too, right?
---
Its because horde were already all dead.
---
Progression guilds. Lock, Hunter Holy paladin and Fury Warrior as this. Arms is better but Fury is still good if you have cutting edge gear. You are a combat rogue that does more burst with mobility in plate.  Warriors are just broken in 1.12. I'm not even going to bother with arms until I get Ashkandi with 100 gold respecs.
---
[https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbhbZVVzmgxoVo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#LbhxbhbZVVzmgxoVo)
---
Slower guilds. Anything but Mage, Rogue and Arms warrior. Getting a spot as enhance or ret will be harder than others though. 
---
Mages, Rogues and Arms Warriors just have to spend 100 gold a week. You get used to it. Some warriors and rogues just make a mage alt to farm the gold.
---
Oh oh I made a nostalgia juice puddle
---
Having played SMRuin warlock for quite alot I think its a really good option for just this purpose. Even more than that, you can do the DME aoe farming with that spec aswell, so plenty of money and no need for respec. That being said, in world pvp if you die as a warlock, you need a good 1+ minute/s after revive to rebuff, summon pet, new healthstone, drinking to full, etc. So once you die you are out of the game for a while, where as classes like hunter, warrior, or rogue could go ham pretty much straight after revive and only be at half HP.
---
Private servers did it. I don't see why a billion dollar company wouldn't be able to do the same.
---
At that time it just felt so polished compared with other games around. I honestly almost cry when these things remind me of the first time I installed and played.
---
Blasphemer!!  The Horde were in hiding.  They were waiting for the moment to emerge and bring the great hero to challenge this Alliance dog!
---
Then just go lock sm/ruin and get tailoring and engineering
---
Also get yourself some pvp gear and you are mostly set
---
Now I want to play even more haha
---
lol
---
Saying nothing about his point the drop rate was dramatically increased. From 0.02% to 1% in 3.0.2. That's to 1 in 100 from 1 in 5000
---
I wonder if Classic will use the 8.1 Direct X 12 improvements as well. I saw performance skyrocket on my VEGA card. I doubt I will need it with a OC I7. but I bet it would help a lot on laptops in AV etc. Then again maybe just DX 11 multithreading is all Classic will really need even on less powerful hardware.
---
say goodbye to barrens chat if they implement that modern system
---
boo
---
Moonglow is used as a pre-raid/early-raid  spec because gear availability at that point in time even with a few tier 1 pieces and hide of the wild mana management is difficult even in early raid content. It is a hard and fast fact that druids should not eat their vates but give them to priests aside very unique conditions. To give the suggestion to spam max rank regrowth is probably the worst druid advice that could be given among a long list of bad druid advice.  Even if you did use it heavily you don't spam it because it overwrites the hot, moreso having several druids in a raid using regrowth has the same problem the hot being overwritten by whosever +heal is highest.    I'm sure there are many druids specced and built for a Imp Regrowth build who can top a heal chart on a individual fight but there are so many other variables, fights, considerations.  This is why determining best specs or spells is a difficult task because I could link several logs with druids topping heal charts using nothing but HTR4.  In later raids gear quality is better so you can move from moonglow to something like HOTW or Hybrid.  I looked at this heal chart and I can guarantee you he was not spamming regrowth, that individual was probably geared and spec for imp regrowth and using it as a primary heal instead of HT on a fight that arguably favors heavy regrowth use like Chromag.   Going OOM for any heal class is an absolute possibility during early or late content especially on learning pulls.  And assigning innervates is not just about need but about efficiency most innervates go to priests at 40/50  percent  before they get oom especially because your trying put that vate on cooldown timer so hopefully you get to use it 2-3 times per fight.  Giving yourself considerably less mana versus giving another healer a much more considerable amount of mana is bad raiding.  
---
What happens to all the playful trolling when silences are going to be rampant?
---
Are they really going to add the modern chat rules that come with right click reporting?
---
Is that the end of barrens chat?
---
What happens if you get silenced in vanilla? tough luck?
---
Dps- warlock
---
Healing- priest
---
Yeah and if I had the time for the game, I would roll a warrior and be an MT for a HC raid. But I know how much time and effort you need for that. 5mans is nothing compared to that.
---
No, he meant the risk of people building too many sheds in Azeroth. The murlocs would have so many hiding places.
---
I played a hunter 1-60 on a pserver recently and I 100% agree. 
---
Also, it can be hard to control which mobs will your pet aggro. And leatherworking doesn't really offer you a lot of useful gear, so the best profession choice is engineering+mining.
---
Super-easy to level, but a bit boring and the endgame isn't great, even though PvP can be fun.
---
Some ppl do.. Have you not watched SAO? I think it's the same thing but in the world of wow.. I recommend you to watch SAO and then talk to me again xD
---
SAO what's that?
---
it would be hilarious if they did a Part 2 episode once Classic comes out but as Horde characters
---
There must be software that can do that?
---
2016
---
They told us their plan and that is the truth as everyone here who read can agree that he did indeed tell us their plan. 
---
Next question 
---
They will play classic.
---
No one who cares about those kind of details enough to whine all over these forums is going to not play classic. 
---
They're just manufacturing artificial drama. If it wasn't 1 week worth of sharding that they are whining about they'd find something else. "My human's cheekbones are too tuned! I want more polygons! We demand real classic!"
---
I'm currently doing the AQ scepter chain post gates opening on a pvt server.  Due to the scale of it then I struggle to think how people figured out what they needed to back then.
---
Admittedly I already have a guide so it tells me where to go, what to kill, what to loot etc but there is a huge number of drops inside raid instances, outside raid instances but still requiring a 5-40 man group and some of the drop % chances are very low.
---
For people to figure all this out whilst the AQ war effort was going on is insane.
---
I don't get it. They've changed the direction of retail WoW from what it was 15 years ago, yes. This is a fuck up to some, but not to others. It's not like they've attempted to recreate classic WoW before and fucked it up. There is a very vocal group that is simply shitting on blizzard because they don't like retail WoW now, and assume classic WoW is going to be like retail - despite blizzard stating classic WoW is going to be as vanilla as possible. Where's the fuck up exactly? Isn't this what you wanted, and now you're complaining about it? Stop comparing retail WoW to classic; it's idiotic. 
---
Yes and no...
---
Yiu do have to go to the battle masters in the cities and queue up to the individual bg master who represents a bg. During a bg weekend, when npcs are around the city, you can talk to them and queue up as well.
---
Or you can go out into the world and find the battleground stronghold/fort/camp. In vanilla you'll need to go there if you want the rep items as that's where the vendor is. I think av had a vendor inside and outside the bg. Might be wrong, it a been 14yrs. Lol
---
Might be - but paid I’m guessing?
---
&gt; My guildmates do nothing but grind mythics, sim some gear, grind world q’s, sim some more gear, do island expedition for the god forsaken AP. And clear raid once a week. It’s so fucking tedious and it makes current wow a chore.
---
I recently converted to FF14. Even with the honeymoon phase aside, the atmosphere is much more relaxed there. There is more to the game than it's combat mechanics and the devs and players like that. You are allowed to do stupid non-combat stuff and still progress your character. In WoW, mechanics that do not inteface with the core combat loop seem to be stripped down with each expansion pack, particularly since late WotLK (but realistically, it started with TBC).
---
I finally realized this isn't enough for me. Maybe WoW changes in the future. They do have the resources. It's more of a question if they have the people and the internal structure to further this.
---
How do locks farm DME?
---
SM/Ruin Warlock is probably the best choice. Shadow Priest is great too but it's a lot more difficult to find a raid spot since you traditionally only bring one of those.
---
Here's the thing. It is sharding FOR LAUNCH and the STARTING ZONES only, to deal with the shitstorm of launches that often rendered servers unable to be played. Blizzard just laid off 800 GM/CMs, loot trading being a thing is hardly surprising. They're doing the best they can with the tools they have. Isn't that all you can ask for? I hardly doubt you expect them to run 15 year old hardware for authenticity? 
---
I need more pixels!!
---
Marks hunter can do it all. Just a minor sacrifice to one aspect (pve or pvp). 
---
Got mine on order!
---
The druid will just run away a bit until sheep breaks. 
---
A druid can stealth hide when getting ganked and ress you later.
---
Vurtne.
---
They kill the lashers, same as mages. If you want to see more just google "warlock dme farm" and you can see plenty of videos. 
---
EA is nice but frost mages will still beat you just a bit slower.
---
YES, so much yes!  They should also bring how classic wow, the original world, somehow is better, like a time travel episode.
---
The what now?
---
Wait, mediocrity on  blackrock? Holy shit! I was in the guild! What episode was this in? I was Louth, the Australian hunter. 
---
Would be interesting to see someone doing this poll on the official classic forum and how the spread would be then.
---
Before certain patch you can queue only at bgs portal. 
---
yo stop, they might change now STOP. But give me more info but FUCK MAN what DOES THIS MEANANNANAN
---
Lock column A to the left maybe so you can always see what item slot is next to which item 
---
If you vpvp, with all the macros and so on you vna never have only two bars. I don't know how he does either. 
---
When battlegrounds were initially introduced, you had to go to the portals. In patch 1.6, they added Battlemasters that allowed you to queue for each battleground via NPC in each major city.  
---
If the game is being based on 1.12 like they said, it's a 99% chance Battlemasters will be in Classic.  
---
It's also worth noting that running to the battleground portals was a highly hated concept and Battlemasters were an extremely welcomed addition to vanilla when they were released.  
---
When I first heard this, I was completely fine with it. The only reason im against it is because of how little I trust in Blizzard word from Blizzcon's.
---
Should it only be in the starting areas FOR A VERY LIMITED TIME, I'm fine with it. And I'm sure that Ion and the team knows that if its just limited there is no real point in bringing it up again since after that limited time is over noone will care.
---
However, if we start to hear them talk about how sharding solves alot of world event problems and similar things, THATS when we as a community **need** to come together and literally rise up.
---
When I say spam Regrowth it means you keep the hot constantly up on all of the tanks or anybody else taking noticeable damage, using the appropriate rank dependent on the persons incoming damage. The person I was responding to was saying that you never use Regrowth under any circumstance besides on Vael, which is wrong.  
---
The optimal set up for druid healing Pre-AQ40 is having one speced Regrowth and the other Swiftmend that is in charge of Rejuv. 
---
Innervate is on a 6 minute cooldown and there is not a single fight Pre-AQ40 that will last that long, so no you are not getting it off even 2 times in a single boss fight. Both Druids and Priests are spirit based healers so Priests do not get more mana from it, and Regrowth Druids are significantly more mana intensive than Priests. An Innervate shouldn't be going to a Priest just because they do not feel like using Mana Pots/Demonic Ruins. 
---
Yes, you know how it is! What are you going to be rolling in Classic?
---
Yeah i remember for horde there were nps in walley of honor in the green building to the right. 
---
And before that you couldn't leave the area either.
---
Sadly clear arguments and facts don’t matter when people want to scream and follow an agenda. I’ve given up on having any sort of discussion about classic with people because it just turns to shit talking blizzard within the first 5 minutes. 
---
Feral/resto druid is pretty good not just for pve/pvp but also for doing multiple pve roles.
---
&gt;!They also can kill the satyrs for the demonic runes which are a dps increase over life tapping.!&lt;
---
SM/Ruin is okay in PvP. It's not the standard PvP spec but it works. Every guild usually has one dedicated SM/R Warlock in the tank group for Blood Pact since you can't play DS/Ruin and have an Imp out. If you volunteer yourself as the guild's Imp Warlock and are close to 100% reliable so other people aren't forced to respec because you didn't show up the leadership will notice and likely want to keep you in that role.
---
Shaman, Paladin and Priest can all heal in their PvP specs just fine once raids are on farm status.  
---
1.5 sec casts (what you mainly rely on while raid healing) aren't too heavily impacted by PvE talents so PvP spec isn't a too big hit to efficiency.  
---
Druids are kind of off in their own corner since the raid doesn't rely on them to perform in the same way that other healers are relied upon. Usually there's only one or two Druids per raid and they're mainly there for Rebirth, Innervate and tank healing since that's the most predictable source of damage and is easily pre-casted which means your longer casts are less of a detriment.  
---
You can play basically play any variant of PvP specs in PvE as a Druid since most PvP specs take 5/5 Improved Healing Touch. The downside is that you'll most likely have 0/5 Improved Mark of the Wild which definitely impacts raid DPS. You could always bribe the other Druid by sending some Wild Thornroot and a couple of potions his way to keep his mouth shut ;)
---
I wouldn't really say that any of the other DPS classes other than Warlock can get away with PvP specs in PvE although most guilds are patient and understanding if you're ranking. A good leadership would never force a ranking Warrior to respec out of Arms while content is on farm since you're clearing everything without wipes anyway and it's only a minimal impact on clear speed if only a few DPS are PvP spec.
---
This. Having a few 35s and maxing their professions can net you a lot of gold in the long run. 
---
&gt;and druids can only DPS effectively because in the past thirteen years people discovered farming Manual Crowd Pummelers.
---
This is just silly. Druid's cat form is clearly aimed at DPSing. Sure they don't get good dps __in raids__ but they are clearly designed to be damage dealers. Heck the abilities are clones of rouge abilities!
---
It is because of this that my first ever character is a War Dwarf ... 
---
Yessss. I remember hearing rumors in vanilla that if you were lucky enough you could fish up ashbringer hahah
---
Don't categorize shaman tanking with druid tanking, please. Druids can easily tank 5man dungeons without any issues and it doesn't feel like anything is missing. At level 45 my guildmate who only tanks dungeons and plays a warr has 60% mitigation from, I'm at 55% but with __much__ bigger threat generation potential. I'm not arguing the fact that warrior is a better tank than druid, but at 5mans there is really no downside from bringing a druid to tank. Paladin and shaman are another topic.
---
There are no #nochanges private servers as far as I know. The popular ones arent that (bigger population being one big factor)
---
That would be equal of shooting yourself in the foot.
---
No amount of information availability will change the fact that many people will not bother to read it. 
---
If the information just being out there was the key to overcoming ignorance, then every western teenager would never fail a single exam ever. 
---
If he hates leveling a warlock... I can’t imagine the monotony of warrior leveling would interest him.
---
You can still find them on eBay and the like.
---
Avatar isn't anime.
---
I went mage because I like frost powers.

About 12 years ago I randomly stumbled upon the guy that started that rumor, on YouTube of all places. He was a really early vlogger back when videos all consisted of people talking into their 240p webcams from their office chairs.
---
Funny that you mentioned it, haven't thought about that guy in over a decade.
---
Yea, that's a natural progression though. They're putting in effort more worthy of &lt;Mediocre&gt; or &lt;Hardcore&gt; so they should find their natural fit.
---
My impression of &lt;Scrubs&gt; is that they never use consumables or world buffs. They just rock up and see what happens.
---
That's not sharding, it's been said a thousand times, that's fucking cross realm zones not sharding. Sharding is different instances of Valley of Trials on the same server to manage hundreds of new players on one server in the same area.
---
What a great legend of these horde guys all waiting until the storm is over... They will be known as the „wife‘s of all alliance warriors that held their backs by cooking and taking care of the kids“ 
---
:D For the alliance!
---
I was basically in a &lt;Scrubs&gt; guild in retail vanilla (MC/ZG/Ony clear but we also wiped a lot and didn't clear that often). I came back to the PServer scene and ended up clearing Naxx because I wanted to see what I'd missed way back when. 
---
I didn't spend any more time playing on PServers, probably less in fact but it was time much better spent since I knew wtf I was doing this time around.
---
I was banned for 3 days for defending classic and telling s troll to get lost. Yet this comment gets the mods approval
---
Thanks.  This'll be a good, solid post to link to people that somehow strongly think sharding won't be limited to starter zones, or, at the most, sub-20 zones.

Given that WoW Classic is using a 7.3.5 client (at least according to the demo) and WoW Vanilla used the 1.12.1 version, that's no question about the improved performance. 
---
Also, let's not make a confusion here, Vanilla never had a 64 fps cap, instead it had it's animations synced to 64 fps, meaning any other FPS that wasn't a multiple of 64, would've make the animations look choppy. However, the fps itself could've been much higher - many of us played on private servers with 128 hz refreshes.
---
More about it in our video guide of fixing the vanilla 1.12.1 stutter , available here - [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_Yk3kJnCcs4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Yk3kJnCcs4)
---
I liked having to travel to the portal, it just felt more immersive. I also hated it and liked that they added battlemasters. I also hated battlemasters, because I saw it as a first step towards Blizz removing immersion for the sake of convenience.
---
I'm a conflicted man. I don't even know what I am going to main. Hopefully there is a thread on here that can help me with that. 
---
Indeed everything outside of Alterac Valley was inside the instance at your base as well.
---
I got new buddies to play with, back in the days I was close to alone. 
---
Better than ever!!
---
Wow, this is really toothpicking... Yth is a great guy, but we should NEVER expect news from him anymore
---
Get's let go.
---
Still the best, main and only source of wow Classic Updates. 
---
Did you ever experienced it without being ahead? It's a shit show, not believable for a real company.
---
There was a, in my opinion legendary, forum thread back then where the first guild detailed their adventures doing it.  And back then, I truly honestly thought they were making it all up because, let's face, it sounds exactly like those stupid, fanmade theories about things that don't exist in video games.  For example, an urban legend about Final Fantasy VI back then was that you could recruit Leo and/or Kefka by flying around Kefka's Tower for 3 hours and other such absurdities.
---
My point is they play the exact same version of MC, ZG, AQ20 etc. There's no stigma of LFR or normal mode etc. &lt;Hardcore&gt; kills Raggy, &lt;Scrubs&gt; kill the same Raggy 3-4 months later.
---
It isn't silly. You're forgetting that DPS and Hybrid DPS are practically different roles in Vanilla.
---
If you really break it out, the roles in Vanilla were: DPS, Hybrid-DPS, Tank, Hybrid-Tank, and Healer.
---
Five distinct roles. Think of Paladin tanks, which were designed to be leveling tanks, not endgame tanks. Yeah, they're technically still “tanking,” but the role is time sensitive. Once you hit 60 the role disappears.
---
Without the quirk of Manual Crowd Pummelers, Ferals would have stayed where it was meant to be: A way for Resto Druids to level effectively.
---
No because you don't do the same encounters as &lt;Method&gt; or &lt;Limit&gt;. 
---
I think you think you are in the minority with how fast you might be leveling. Trust me, there are going to be plenty of people to do dungeons with. Even the prime who power level to 60 might make alts. You might group up with those. Or there are the busy people who can only play a couple hours a day, tops. Or there are the players that want to take their time on purpose to really enjoy every level and dungeon. Or there are people who wait until after the initial surge when Classic is released. There are going to be plenty of people to level with and do quests and dungeons with, regardless of your pace. Actually, the actual case may be opposite of what you are worried about. The people sprinting ahead would have problems finding groups for dungeons since there is nobody else their level.
---
Play the game how you want to play it, not how you think others are going to play it. 
---
Must’ve been just a few people that i interpreted as general opinion.
---
If the tank is good, it makes no difference.
---
Just pointing out that we have no idea about the percentage of tourist. I've seen any number, from 10% to 80%.
---
PVE:
---
favorite healer: priest ( best overall healer(wide variety of heals) less donwtime due to spirit, stam buff, can wand to do littlebit dps from safe distance)
---
favorite tank: druid ( MoW buff, best aoe meele tank, does threat thanks damage less downtime )
---
best dps: hunter ( basicly insane dps and no downtime, pet can offtank pesky elites)
---
Even if you only have a few minutes to play....
---
Of course instead after farming it forever I saw 2 Runeblade and no fricking mount :-(
---
Well, thats what they did in WC3 Reign of Chaos to begin with. Thrall went to Kalimdor to not get rekt by the Scourge.
---
separate definition that evolved over time to take on new meaning. same way it used to only mean happy
---
A hunter plays a slightly different role in a 5man than a rouge. Does not change the fact that both of them are there to primarily deal damage. Same goes for a feral (cat) druid. Just like a hunter can peel off a mob from the healer, a mage can cast nova, a druid can go bear and be offtank for that one pull. Or switch to healer, rez the priest while keeping the warrior tank alive.
---
Every class brings something different to a 5man. Does not change the fact that you primarily do one thing, your task is to do that.
---
It's fun, but not very relaxing. You notice that once you go dps in a 5-man for once, you don't need 100% focus on the game at all times, so much nicer. 
---
Im all for sharding in starterzones the problem lies with my trust in blizzard.  
---
I wont be schocked if they come out after a while with more sharding in more places.
---
&gt; Every class brings something different to a 5man. Does not change the fact that you primarily do one thing, your task is to do that.
---
That's... exactly what I said. You've reiterated what I said.
---
The fact that you're limiting the topic to only 5-mans now is exactly my point. A Hybrid-DPS role exists alongside DPS, as long as you're within a narrow slice of the game—usually leveling.
---
Hunters, for example, don't primarily deal damage in raids. The primary thing they're there to do is utility, either as kiters or Tranq-bots. To say that “this doesn't change the fact that they're there as DPS” is to either miss the point or play a semantic game.
---
I’m so fucking thrilled to play classic ! I’m gonna die 1000 times before I hit level 20 on my warrior 
---
Cata I think.
---
This reminded me of my very first raid ever which was in EQ(Lady Vox) and it indeed is always something special.  In reflection I was just a kid with no idea what was going on and ended up just being cannon fodder #78 or something for the raid leaders.  There was actually hours of waiting I think and I dont remember why it took so long.  My actual part in the fight would have been measured in seconds before I died after getting off a few spells.  I dont even remember if they killed her but it was definitely an interesting experience and it was the only raid I ever did on my first MMORPG character before starting fresh on the Sullon Zek server with many more raids in my future.
---
Find their citation yourself and read it carefully. I don't want to bother, but it was along the lines "Sharding is an useful tool to have, we will implement it and we are gonna use it at start". Nowhere did they say that it'll be limited to starter zones or it'll be disabled forever after a while.
---
&gt; Every single shred of evidence from Blizzard has already pointed to this.
---
Except blizzcon reveal about sharding and loot trading...
---
&gt; Classic is launching with less change than even the most dedicated "Bliz-like" private server has ever accomplished. 
---
It depends on what you qualify as blizzlike. For me, the absence of sharding has significantly more impact on gameplay, than some boss having 10% less armor than he should have.
---
invisible action bars. you don't need to see abilities that have no cooldown do you?
---
Tis a great story, mind you no Ork warrior would ever accept such a tale.  Everyone knows that a proper feast starts with a large well tended fire.  Then, after much tending, a fire of such wonderful heat is created.  Upon that you place your meat of choice, I choose boar, due to its fat content and flavor....Wait, why are there kids around me!!  Hey, get that camera away!!!!!!!
---
In reality it does not. GM's girlfriend gets to play a shadow priest, ret paladin or enh shaman regardless of the debuff slots. If they are allowed in raid in general then it's very unlikely that any sort of debuff management is going on in this group and you will see all kinds of stuff like all warlocks being SM/Ruin fighting for their corruption debuff slot.
---
That was very confusing when you said spam in the context of flash heal or any other heal when you refer to spam its constant cast with or without cancel-cast depending on the skill of the caster.  I think its more common to refer to  that style of usage of regrowth as keeping up.  I am glad that was just confusing wording.  
---
There is always room for interpretation my raiding group was far more then 2 druids we had 6 active druids at any given time and we definitely did not rock that mentality.  We were a top 50 guild and I can't recall theorycrafting with any druids that played at that level or above about desiring ImpRegrowth over Moonglow builds in early content.  
---
There are a few  boss fights Pre-AQ40 that will last longer than 6 minutes.  Onyxia in blues/greens could easily be a 25 min fight in poor gear.  In retail vanilla wow Nefarian 25 min kills were commonplace.  As we are theorycrafting here I am talking more about Post BWL not pre.  Unbuffed starting spirit values for a human priest and nelf druid are 115 to 130 in favor of the human priest.  And the human priest has a racial for 5% extra spirit which would mean 5 percent more spirit from itemization.  If you take the BIS pre-raid assuming an equal playing field a druid and priest both obtaining all pre-bis the druid gear would give an additional 51 spirit and the priest gear would give an additional 91 spirit 94.5 ish if human.  So thats 166 start raiding spirit for a druid and 221 start raiding spirit for a priest.  That is a considerable difference and the stat prioritization curves much the same throughout the lifecycle of raid tiers.  For example T2 druid set would give 103 spirit and priest would give 127. Priests also have the superior mana generation formula to druids.
---
Priests and mages: 13 + (spirit / 4) mana per tick
---
Druids, shamans, paladins, hunters: 15 + (spirit / 5) mana per tick
---
Its mathematically provable that not only do they get more from it, but considerably more.  
---
80%? Just not seeing it.  
---
just a question a bit off topic: where dark moon cards (esp. death) available in classic wow?
---
my first toon in 2005 was night elf rogue (lol, dont judge me, i was 14y.o.), but.....
---
when i first saw benediction on a priest - since then i play only priests in vanilla :)
---
That‘s a nice story. I got us some marshmellows and my guitar to this fire! Please, tell me more of these tales :O
---
Still, having more debuff slots from the start will vastly change the meta of the game. 
---
If they had limited debuff slots for an extended period back in vanilla, they also balanced the game around that. If you had infinite debuff slots from the start, they wouldn't have to buff classes with debuffs and things like that.
---
If private servers can change debuff slots depending on the patch, what is Blizzard's excuse?
---
It just comes across as them not fully understanding how important it can be, and making the judgement call that it doesn't matter.
---
Most likely the software would make mistakes, and while it makes your job easier, you would still have to watch the whole video while reading the transcript, checking for every word if it is correctly been transcribed by the software.  
---
sonix AI seems to be one of the more popular services, which has a subscription fee. Most of these transcription softwares are either subscriptions, or buy-to-use, none of the free apps really provide anything worthwhile from what I could have found.
---
&gt; and druids can only DPS effectively [...]
---
You wrote that. This is false. This is only true in min/max raids, but isn't true while doing dungeons, leveling, owPvP etc.
---
No, no changes to classes. Every class is already viable in every situation.  Vanilla isn’t like retail wow where you play a spec. You play a class and every class has its niche in each different type of content.
---
You really think people will be stuck in bwl when tbc gets announced? Lol. People will be pigging naxx when tbc is released two years later 
---
No, please no. 
---
This will keep me up for weeks.
---
When I started playing vanilla WoW it was a guild transfer from Sullon Zek in EQ so we had more than a normal raiding guild worth of players.  This time I will be starting classic alone as I have not played online games and have been out of touch with anyone WoW related for years (quit during TBC although played with guildies in other games probably until 2014ish).
---
I expect it to be just fine and plenty of people will be making new companions in their classic journey.
---
Good, they might actually do some work now 
---
&gt;Needless to say that, much like everyone in here, Classic occupies my thoughts at least a couple times a week. 
---
I wish it would occupy my thoughts on a weekly basis only instead of daily. 
---
I will concede that I have no background in any of the technical stuff involved in making games, it just doesn't seem realistic to think that they will actually make it feel 100% the same.
---
We already know they don't want to limit the debuff slots at the start, for example. Does this also mean that they don't think spell batching is a big enough deal?
---
It would be so easy for them to just think, well, it's just an inferior system that was necessary due to technical limitations back in the day, why would we want that now?
---
But it would shift the meta and feel of the gameplay, resulting in a non-authentic experience.
---
For people who have spent thousands of hours playing their characters in Vanilla or on private servers, it would be jarring for them to play Classic if things were different. If when they use charge while in the air it behaves differently for example.
---
It's possible that I overestimate how hard those things would be to fix, but there are thousands of these little details and interactions that need to be correct.
---
Why not just duel?
---
ahh in the days of yore
---
No but it will be much more authentic with pre bis gear and blowing through MC. 
---
I am not worried about keepit it 100% authentic, how much is authentic worth if dm + 1,12 + 16 slots = MC CLEAR IN ONE FUCKING DAY.
---
So no matter if its authentic or not I never once set foot in dm before clearing mc. While that might not be normal its how i experianced it. And if i wanted a 100% authentic game I would have been angry about the 1.12, non progressive items etc etc etc etc.
---
So who the fuck cares if DM was released 7 march and ragnaros first kill was in the end of april, I can hardle see it being authentic to be running dm tributes and getting a bis list ready.
---
Yeah, I played rogue in vanilla. It was nothing like the videos and with no cloak could be one of the most frustrating classes in open pvp. 
---
1 dot and you can’t stealth, your one decent advantage completely gone. 
---
I recently just made a new death knight and I spent about 15 minutes running around the section of old EPL that was available in the starting zone and I was just overcome with nostalgia. I know classic WoW won't be perfect but, honestly, I can't wait.
---
&gt; druids can only DPS effectively
---
If I'm choosing between a Mage and a Druid for a dungeon, I'm going to ask the Druid to heal 100% of the time, or if we have a healer, I'm taking the Mage.
---
That's the difference between the DPS role and  the Hybrid-DPS role.
---
A saucepan 
---
why so hostile? you really cant blame anyone for being negative for the shitshow activision-blizzard has been running the past year
---
Good. If my posts keeps away those players who approach the game with a complete I-dont-give-a-shit attitude and who think they have the right waste the time of everyone else because they cant be bothered to learn basic information about the game where they are playing with other people, I see that as a bonus..
---
Yeah one of the great things about it will be every spec and class already knows their place on the dps charts and there is no patch every 2-4 months changing how every class plays. 
---
You want to tank, you roll warrior.
---
Like an actual rpg.
---
its the whole mood in these pictures, also going through the blurb on vinalla cd box...
---
It would be suicide for the money they have spent building classic and they know it. They answer to money and shareholders these days and micro transactions are in the worst interest of the money and shareholders 
---
&gt;Hopefully there is a thread on here that can help me with that. 
---
Nope. Havent found a single one.
---
No changes
---
i will also play rogue and want to pvp as much as i can while leveling. i will go standard combat for leveling til lvl 30. as soon as i hit lvl 30 i will respecc in sub with hemo. (hemo is available at lvl 30) it still gives you a good mob killing speed while beeing really good for pvp.
---
In the city.
---
early on you had to queue up in ashenvale/ the barrens WSG portals. eventually you could queue up in capital cities at battlemasters though.  
---
&gt;Play what you are going to like, play the game for the enjoyment.
---
For a lot of us the enjoyment of games comes from playing well. We think the game is the most enjoyable when our guild manages to kill raid bosses, or when we manage to win in PvP. Deliberately playing in a sub-optimal way would just not be fun for us. And I think this applies to most players, some just choose to stay "blissfully ignorant" instead of figuring stuff out (no offense meant, that's a legitimate way to enjoy a game). 
---
The main difference between players is in how driven they are to get better at the game. If you are someone like me you want to figure out which piece of gear is best, and how to get it. You want to know how to utilise your abilities to maximum potential. You want to figure how to earn money in the best way. Etc. That's part of the fun of playing a game, figuring all this stuff out. 
---
If that content was in any acceptable condition to be released it would have been in BC or another expac 
---
Such stories are reserved for members of the Horde, however I have a feeling you have heard of some heroes of the Horde.  Does Thrall ring a bell, a great warchief, survived assassins of Gul'Dan, served as a gladiator, and finally served with Orgrim Doomhammer in freeing the Orks from reservations.
---
Or how about Grom Hellscream, savior of the Horde and the great Ork who freed his people from the servitude to Mannoroth.
---
I could go on, however such stories would make the Alliance feel shame when confronted with such honor.
---
I would be very surprised if it didn't make a profit, considering they only have a small team working on it. They'll make back any expenses with the first month of subs at launch.
---
Roughly half of vanillas final subscribers started playing after Q2 2005. 
---
How many of that first half do you think cleared mc without doing dm?
---
You're arguing to preserve an experience basically noone experienced. 
---
sorry to ask something that seems to be common knowledge, but what is SM?
---
&gt;Edit: Just re-read your last comment and I honestly feel bad for you. You seem to have some kind of pent-up anger or something. To be making these assumptions then to start calling me lazy... I hope you aren't like this in real life. I hope you can let go of your anger, brother.
---
Got to love how you resort to personal attacks right away when the going gets tough and act like you somehow dont understand why others might get upset when you choose to play a multiplayer mmo based around the acquisition of loot without bothering to look up even the basics about what kind of loot your character is actually supposed to be wearing. Your decisions in this game affects other people, and the irony is you see me as the big bad wolf when your own position is that you should be allowed to play the game as selfishly as possible without a care in the world for other people and the goals they are after.
---
And yes, you ARE lazy if you cannot be arsed looking up your BiS list. I dont know why that even have to be explained. When your class has a clear cut laid out progression path in terms of ranged weapons, and if you have any respect for your fellow players, you just dont roll on gear that they want when the gear is not even good for your own class.
---
I would think this would be an incredibly simple concept, and yet here we are.
---
I think most people on this sub can clear naxx without too much problem. The only question is how many will be sticking to the game for that long, and if their guilds will stay afloat long enough to progress that far. It's a time investment "check", not a skill-check. 
---
You can reach top dps if you go alliance, master the powershifting rotation and farm enough pumeller for each fight.
---
Even without the pumeller you can do decent dps as long as you powershift.
---
Also, you will most likely be asked to tank on some boss so gather a tank set if you want to go feral. You will also have to decurse and abolish poison, you might get asked to heal on a few fight too.  You are a hybrid and it will most likely you will be expected to play like one.
---
Classes were not unbalanced back in the day. Every class is wanted and needed for both pve and pvp.
---
explain the AV thing
---
Scarlet monestary
---
This is an amazing reply! Thanks a lot for the contribution, I learned a lot! 
---
yup its do able. did it with my 60 combat rogue, full shadowcraft set and dal rends swords. this was back in 05 so i dont remember the exact details, but ill try.
---
stealth to each ziggurat and kill the skeleton?
---
unlock pick the gate, solo each abom, solo the skeleton elite, the abom, then i think 4 elite ekeltons come out? stealth past and kill baron. i think i usually only popped a mongoose pot and major health pot. blade flurry when he summons the skellies and probably pop evasion as well? i remember dying 1-2 out of 5 times per encounter with baron rivendare. 
---
I can’t think of a single situation where GM interaction was needed.
---
Not sure if it is just nostalgic glasses on but with only world PvP and BGs hunters are really great in PvP in vanilla.  That being said I only played my hunter in vanilla until I think early AQ(switched to priest) and then picked it up again for BC so maybe I just hit the high points.  It basically felt like you were a turret in BGs and just melted anything wearing cloth that came into your range.  Can't imagine how it would feel with a Nerubian from KT.
---
That's very nice wow :d.
---
Q u o t e:
---
Wouldn't ghost quests show up during data mining? I'm not to clear on how that works.
---
"Not if they've been in game since launch. They'll already be on all the lists, so people won't have connected them to Ghost quests. Datamining would only turn them up as something odd if they were added in a new patch. " - Random pro dataengineer i guess.
---
From 2008
---
This gets my balls tingling atleast 
---
Shadow priest leveling especially as an undead is insanely easy and you smoke pretty much everyone in world PvP.   So yeah leveling isnt an issue.

lal. thank you. this was one of my favorite dungeons, but i srsly never heard the english term before. only know the german term "das scharlachrote kloster" :D
---
Well I first created an UD rogue as nearly every edgy 14 year old did at the time, played him for a few levels and then said this is cool and all but what if I could be a rogue, warrior, mage, healer all rolled into one, I was always seeing Lf1m tank or healer! I thought surely the game is balanced in such a way that you are at least viable in all of those things if you really put your mind to it! So I made a druid with the intent of being kitty dps, tanking dungeons as needed and healing myself while leveling. I made it all the way to lvl 59 before the raiding guild I had joined had an officer whisper me, We can't wait for you to hit 60, we really need somebody to innervate the priests (and of course back then innervate was a talent you weren't taking it and playing feral at the same time). That really shattered my world, because I had no concept of "meta" or anything remotely similar at the time. It sent me on a downward spiral into the world of min/maxing and I rerolled a warlock and hardly touched my druid until TBC.
---
Seriously, try questing or killing anything when the amount of players look like this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JScKXPXdqmg&amp;t=25m50s sharding is a neccessary evil at LAUNCH tbh. Removed afterwards, ofcourse, but at launch like... it's gonna be needed for the highest pop servers.
---
Yeah, check this: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JScKXPXdqmg&amp;t=25m50s not possible to actually quest and shit since, there's just so many people.
---
How can you say that. Of course the private servers have been turned inside out but there are bugs everywhere. Last time someone played vanilla was 2007 right? And that was only a window of 2 years experimenting. Are you saying that nothing new, ever, will be discovered in Classic? 
---
maybe, but definitely not killed by u/MwHighlander . He seems to really have a sore spot when it comes to pallies.
---
I'm so used to the speed of druids and being "immune" to roots/slows that I just can't play any other class. I like rogues too with the improved sprint spec but I feel like it's only good every 10 minutes when I have all my cooldowns up so I just stick with druid. Whenever I try another class I just rage quit every time I get slowed/cc'd and log back into my druid lol
---
thanks for believing me, i think i posted on this topic awhile back and people only downvoted it. they dont believe me and will probably downvote this as well. just trust me its do able, why would i lie about this? just try it yourself :)
---
What faction will you choose?
---
There is a big difference between dmg you deal in pvp and dmg you deal in PVE, just because you pull off some good numbers in raids it doesn't mean you'll be able to do it in PVP, feral druids if CCd in catform will get 2 shoted so pvp druids will play resto hybrid specs which does lower dmg but is also very hard to kill. You misunderstood what he was saying.
---
Enhance hybrids could probably be like a 3rd tank one that doesn't really have to do anything, like a Sulfuron add kill target tank, or possibly tank some trash. it was pretty garbage overall. but they had decent threat gen with rockbiter + earthshock. i suppose if you farmed the right stam gear / dodge gear you might be able to get away with possibly tanking one of the weaker bosses in a raid, don't really recommend it though.  
---
Their viability if you can even call it that, did sort of go up in later expansions ie TBC / WOTLK where with resil gear and such other things they could tank 10m's relatively easily.  
---
TL;DR Shamans have significantly less avoidance / damage mitigation compared to that of a warrior in Vanilla and it made them not worth using 
---
Shaman tanking has been extensively experimented with in the private server scene, and it's definitely viable for 5man tanking even at high level.  
---
Their single target threat is great: the threat they generate on pull using Chain Lightning is better than any traditional tank, max rank Earth Shock is lots of single target threat and Lightning Shield gives you another thorns effect for threat as well. As for avoidance and mitigation, Shamans can dodge, parry and block where a warrior could. In addition to their +10% armor value talents they can also use talents to increase the effectiveness of their stoneskin totem by 20% - while this won't bring them to the level of mitigation wearing plate or being in dire bear form gives you, it's still good enough for 5mans. Shaman tanks also get a 10% reduction in damage taken form Fire, Frost and Nature spells PLUS they get to use their grounding totem to reduce spelldamage even further.

Yes, you'll have to gear for it with not a lot of choice in your gear. Yes, you'll still take a bit more damage than a warrior or a druid would. No, you don't have a taunt, but neither do paladins. No, you won't ever be uncrushable or uncrittable, but neither will druids - not to mention even warriors won't reach def cap until they get their hands on T2. But none of the above means that you're not a viable tank for a 5man group bringing along greater 5man utility (totems, ress, wipe recovery through ankh) than a warrior tank ever could.
---
Dynamic spawns is far too exploitable.
---
Sharding won't affect a servers community in the long run, if it's contained to the starting zones.
---
Charge is 26yds, mages have 32-33yd range not 40, 40 is healing range,. Longest range is by hunters at 36yds
---
Boohoo, that's how resistance works
---
&gt; How many of that first half do you think cleared mc without doing dm?
---
I was in MC by January 2005 - I hit 60 on my first private server over Xmas and I have/had no memory of Dire Maul from my time playing retail.
---
Same with ZG, I think we did it once in retail, no memory of AQ20 either.  
---
I never considered Druids, Paladins and Shamans as proper tanks in  WoW Vanilla, and I still don't consider them to be proper tanks in Classic.
---
The key word being PROPER. They can tank, that is certain. However, compared to Warriors, they aren't even close in tanking abilities, survivability and control.
---
Now, on your point. Shamans actually CAN make a better tank than Paladins, in certain circumstances. Shamans threat is MILES above Paladins (and Warriors or Druids to be honest), but they absolutely suck in terms of survivability, health pool and even in mana pools compared to Paladins.
---
That make Shamans the 4th tank overall, bellow Paladins, well bellow Druids and ofc, not even comparable to a Warrior. Another thing that a Shaman can never do is offtanking in raids. Paladins and Druids can, even if they are bellow a Fury Warrior.
---
Shamans do however excel in offtanking anything bellow raids, like offtanking an add in a 5 men where there is no CC class in group, or offtanking 1-2 adds in UBRS. They have HUGE threat generation, and that is much more important in 5 and 10 men, compared to raids, where survivability always comes first.
---
Sure, a good threat is more than welcomed in raids, and once the raid is on farm, threat is more valuable than survivability (which is why a Druid can main tank raids once they are on farm status), but sadly, the Shaman doesn't have enough survivability for raids.
---
Shamans in Vanilla are the worst tank possible, but in certain scenarios, they are actually pretty damn good.
---
I fully agree. Resistance is badly implemented.
---
The big one that immediately springs to mind is the "Corrupted ashbringer" Quest. seeing as how the Corrupted version of ashbringer dropped from 4 horsemen in Naxx, as well as there being a RP trigger upon entering SM with the sword equipt people assumed there was a way to purify the sword in vanilla, there were all types of weird theories about it but it was all a dead end, Blizzard humored this by adding some of the fan theories into the artifact  hidden appearance questlines for the paladin artifact weapon ashbringer.   
---
there were also some rumors involving ateish greatstaff of the guardian if i remember correctly because no one could really figure out why the hell it would teleport you to karazhan (other than the obvious medivh/karazhan connection) so they thought there was maybe a questline to do with the medivh.
---
Problem gone :) I changed user rights for all folders in game path as you said and added .exe to DEP (Data Execution Prevention)  don't know which one fixed it but it works like a charm now!
---
Go on dear stranger, tell me the wise phrases of old stories. 
---
Did I just say alliance? No, no, you missunderstood me! I was just yelling the name of my co-worker, Allie Hanse! Sorry for interrupting you, I am sure this so called Thrall was a green one? Every strong orc is green. 
---
At least that‘s what a guy said to me at walmart last week...
---
4srs.  I get that people are making their voices heard because this is supposedly a malleable project that the devs are collaborating with us on, but holy shit the entitlement that I see in this community is still so off-putting to me.
---
This. People will abuse dynamic spawning like on private realms. It will also fk early economy since you can AOE pull everything with a group and have nearly instant respawn.
---
Why is Shaman tanking a thing?
---
Some people get enjoyment out of deliberately playing their class very differently from the usual.
---
Since Horde don't have Pallys, some times you could go hours trying to find a tank for a dungeon.
---
Eventually someone will be desperate or crazy enough to try it. See also: 40 priests vs Onyxia.
---
Pally tanking wasn't actually that bad in Vanilla, only in raids. They lack a taunt, but had great AOE threat. They really excelled in dungeons with lots of undead mobs.
---
Pros
---
* It's someone claiming to be a tank. After an hour and a half of unsuccessful searching for one, I'd be considering a voidwalker.
---
* Shamans are actually really good at holding aggro on a single target pre-60. Rockbiter Weapon adds a fairly large chunk of flat threat/sec to your auto attacks and that alone is enough to frequently pull aggro from the average Warrior tank in Defensive Stance. On top of that they've got Lighning Shield, and Earth Shock: a spell that hits hard and causes double threat. In typical shaman tanking max rank is used as a psuedo-taunt, and rank n-1 or n-2 is used to keep up threat due to mana concerns.
---
* In terms of mitigation Shamans can use mail which is fairly beefy (about 45% reduction, roughly equivalent to a warrior in plate without a shield), and Stoneskin Totem goes a long way to compensate for the extra mitigation that plate provides, at least pre-60. Throw in a Defence potion/Scroll of Protection and maybe a Stoneshield potion on especially hard hitting bosses, and there's no real issues, until you get to the end game dungeons. There's even a sweet spot at 40, where Shamans actually make better tanks than Warriors in terms of mitigation. They've just learnt how to use Mail (which the dungeons (SM:Cath &amp; RFD) are tailored for), and unlike Warriors with Plate there's no shortage of Mail tanking gear at that level.
---
* Decent ranged threat. Princess at the end of Mara is a fairly nasty fight for Warrior tanks.  Masses of knockback and your dps and healers will keep generating threat while you're bouncing away or waiting out of range with the occasional bow shot. A Shaman? Earth Shock, and Lightning Bolt, and self-healing makes keeping aggro a breeze.
---
Cons:
---
* No Taunt. Max rank Earth Shock sort of works as a pseudo taunt in most cases, and ideally a good tank shouldn't rely on Taunt to maintain aggro. But it's these exceptional circumstances when things start going wrong that Shaman's just can't respond to. The lack of a taunt means that while you can reincarnate / soulstone and get back into the fight, you won't be regaining aggro any time soon. There's also certain spells like Mind Control which generate absurd amounts of threat which you simply can't overcome before the mob dies.
---
* Earth Shock is Nature damage and can be resisted. Tanking WC, ST or Mara Orange which have a bunch of mobs with Nature resist would not be fun. Since Earth Shock also interrupts, there's no partial resists. If they've got a 25% chance to resist, that's a 25% chance for zero threat.
---
* Almost no AOE Threat. You can start a pull with Chain lightning which is great for setting up a bit of initial threat to safeguard the healer, but you don't have an equivalent to Warrior's shouts or cleave. If there's 4+ mobs and a mage in the party starts using blizzard they'll swiftly pull aggro and there's nothing you can do about it short of Engineering explosives. 
---
* Mana. This is the big one. Your spells cost a massive chunk of your mana pool, and you'll be drinking after nearly every pull. If a fight drags on too long, your threat output will drop massively.
---
* Rockbiter Weapon expires after 5 minutes. Without it, your threat output drops massively and you'll swiftly be overtaken by the dps. You need to keep an eye on that timer in the corner of the screen. Waiting for it to fall off an reapplying it won't work in SFK and Mara Princess, where there are chain AOE silences and you might be facing 30 seconds of massively reduced threat. You can prevent this by paying close attention.
---
* Silence is particularly awful. Warriors just lose taunt. You lose the equivalent of Shield Bash, Sunder Armor, Taunt, Heroic Strike. 
---
* No defensive cooldowns, unless you've specced 0/40/21, in which case you've got a single NS Heal, which you probably won't even have the mana for. I'd highly recommend going Tauren if you want to Shaman tank for the AOE stun.
---
In PVE other than dungeons orc stun resist is near useless because most stuns that matter are scripted and can't be resisted, immuned, or removed.
---
Agreed, I use it quite often. Didn't think about it somehow. 
---
Probably weapon skills or Ammo taking up bag slots
---
Pretty sure it was episode 75... but it's hard to say I blitzed a lot of the episodes
---
Blizzard is. They didn't want to do classic at first before the huge outcry after nost, and even now, they don't plan on selling it separately, they talk about it as a passion project and did not talk about it during the invertors call. I obviously hope they are underestimating the demand, but who knows. 
---
I'm honestly even starting to lean pro changes if it makes people like Tipsout and Alexensual go back to private servers. 
---
I think after the #nochanges push in SC:R launch 2 years ago they had only two majorish changes. 16:9 support and custom hotkeys. Both were welcome changes. Nothing in gameplay got changed at all and all of the HD art remake was spot on for everything. It was perfect to a BW player like me
---
If you choose a guild that's not suited to what you want to do in the game, you make a "wrong choice" for yourself.
---
Mistakes happen of course, but that doesn't make your choice "right" just because you made a mistake.
---
25% rogues incoming
---
Frost mage I think has a pretty similar PvE to PvP build, without min-maxing your arse off. Plus mages are hella fun in PvP and if you're skilled enough there isn't anyoe that you can't kill! They are fantastic in group PvP slightly more so than solo PvP (imo). 
---
&gt; So far "No Change" is the repeated emphasis by Blizzard, so I expect 8 slots upon launch.
---
Expect to be disappointed then, because it will 100% guaranteed have 16 debuff slots at launch.
---
the point of the thread is literally to complain about things you subhuman clown 
---
Nothing is impossible, especially with Blizzard possibly being unable to stop their fingers from changing the code. If they do keep it the way it was, I find it hard to believe yes.
---
Need this for my Tauren. Or the Zg Raptor.
---
I love how big the normal mounts get. Lol
---
I would actually take enhancement or elemental shamans for their hybrid role, not solely for DPS. I ask an enhancer what his rotation for the fight is. 
---
If his answer is not windfury totem -&gt; strenght of earth totem -&gt; mana totem, then he wont get invited.
---
I do not invite hybrid-DPS mainly for their DPS but really 50:50 for 50% buffing the group and 50% DPSing.
---
An enhancer who refuses to plant totems gets kicked and I invite someone who understands his hybrid DPS role.
---
Classic won't go anywhere any time soon and there's no such thing as new expacs coming out and making everything obsolete. As long as Classic lives there will be people running content.
---
If playing more chars at a time is how *you* have fun, just do it.
---
Maybe take advantage of rested XP and you'll end up with several lvl 60 before you know it.
---
i 100% agree. cant say much more. will do the same as you'll do.
---
What does sprinting even mean?
---
Most of us are adults with jobs. Most of the player base is going to lvl for 2-3 months.
---
I wouldn't call that a sprint by today's standards. 
---
Well people have pretty much covered it in the comments (they were originally planned to be functioning as lower tier tanks, the idea was scrapped, but some tanking talents and skills remained in the finished game) - so the only thing I'd add is that there's a really cool guide by a guy called Totemtank explaining how you can maximise the tanking potential of shamans, in case you just really wanna try to make it work (I can't enter the link because it's from a Pserver, so bot mods remove it)
---
I think his conclusion is that they can tank all 5-man and 10-man content, but aren't really useful for raids.
---
I like that about Vanilla - there are plenty of specs that are FAR from optimal, but that you can make work okay, if you put in the extra effort. I personally love when I get to group with people that don't have the traditional specs, it makes for a different, more interesting experience.
---
You can try but it is not worth. Every expansion always had the best classes for "that role". I was a paladin tank pugging +22 on legion just to face that the best tank was another tank and i could not have the same results as the other tank just becouse they designed the game like that. F that, just roll a warrior if you want to tank in vanilla.
---
TIL "beefy" means "mandatory" and 10k hp is required for tanking 5-man dungeons.
---
Certain quest zone droughts? Not as big as an issue with Alliance, but certain zones ie Arathi Highlands do feel like they are missing some content. 
---
This. They are able to tank all instances, but don't really perform in raids. 
---
i guess same could be said about tbc, but mounts taking up bag spaces, also keys pre 1.11, but if we're launching on 1.12 keyring should be in.
---
People whining about the game being too hard for them
---
I just mean many are going to work on one character. Sprinting is relative. 
---
Racials causing min/maxing with characters... which is where you can put in most of your personal preferences.
---
Especially weapon skills, stuff like WotF and Fear Ward.
---
Smaller stuff like the +5% doesn't matter all theat much.
---
I sort of agree with the resistance stuff, but only in ways like highers levels should resist the stuns. Not being able to fear a level 50 as a level 30 seems fair to me.
---
And oh yeah, ninja looters.
---
WC.frost is kinda good in pvp, / early stages of raiding, but fire is more fun to play imo. also sm ruin lock
---
The weapon skill racials are a bit too powerful imo. Almost every rogue/warrior goes human because of it. I don't see that many gnomes even though their racials are really good though. 
---
While i was playing in vanilla I didn't find anything annoying enough to mention it. Now if classic will be 100% vanilla then i would be annoyed by the loot everyting one by one and no mount untill 40 and even that is only 60%
---
I would honestly be OK with them just buying back one of the original server blades and running original software. Yes better hardware would be better experience (no laggs and such) but I would still be OK with it.
---
I picked and stuck with rogue entirely because of Serenity Now's funeral gank.

---
Gotta love the first time you go to Arathi. Wow new zone! Oh.. there's like 5 quests spread over 5 levels and a mega long chain. Back to STV I guess..
---
I don't like that any ammount of lvl 20 characters will never stand a chance against lvl 60. I wish you could group up and kill that horde rogue in redridge or at least try, knowing you might win.
---
Engineering being the only profession with exclusives that stay relevant no matter what your gear is. It's just a must-have.
---
same for me. but there are other things. like when my daughter is ill or something. life happens. wow is not the most important thing anymore (it kind of was, when i was 17, lol). although it will be a very important hobby to me.
---
Well....
---
There was the quest sharing exploit back in 2012, which uncovered a bunch of quests that never made it to the game. It allowed you to get any quest in your log (if you ever got a strange quest shared to you in a BG/dungeon, this exploit was the source), that was shareable.
---
Read through the [original thread](https://www.ownedcore.com/forums/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-exploits/elite-wow-exploits/344838-world-of-warcraft-exploit-quest-sharing-exploit.html), if you are a WoW fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy all the weird quests people discovered.
---
I have no reason to not believe you because I solod it too, just as a level 70. I know it's huge difference but I didn't particularly have a hard time on my warrior so I assumed that some lvl 60s must be able to pull it off. A rogue would have good chances since it can skip trash safely.
---
I will also experiment with it as a level 60 warrior when the time comes, worst case scenario I will be owned hard lol. (but I want to roll night elf and experiment with shadowmeld, invis pots and the engineering invis gadget)
---
I have to disagree! Our zones are so varied and amazing.

Starting with [Duskwood!](https://www.google.com/search?q=duskwood+vanilla&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS823US823&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjTtc_4g8vgAhVMyYMKHWKoDVoQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=H9RPo6S-7ssbAM:) Such an amazing zone, some of the best quests in the game (Remember, Alliance Quests were done first, and Horde Quests were hastily added) Then we have the beautiful snowy hills of [Dun Morogh](https://www.google.com/search?q=dun+morogh&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS823US823&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjKs_eFhsvgAhWGzIMKHbXUBrUQ_AUIDigB&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969#imgrc=XVHNNdbmgTnGuM:), constant heavy blizzards and snow fall really, really, pull you into the game unlike anything else. 
---
I'm a warrior of light. 
---
thats a pretty good word for it. i will also be looking for a dad guild :P
---
Yes, however some stuff did not break LoS in some areas.
---
14 years on, I never realised this.
---
short answer, it would make MC /BWL slightly easier because more dots = more damage = bosses dying faster ext.   
---
if they were to start with 16 slots which would probably trigger alot of people, they would also have to increase the health pools of bosses to keep the boss difficulty / progression feel authentic. having limited slots does slightly gimp certain classes damage, but overall i think it will make the most people happy.
---
expensive mounts at lvl 40. Running sucks
---
&gt; You're arguing to preserve an experience basically noone experienced on the grounds that it's more authentic.
---
Where do I do this? When I reread my comments all I see me advocating for a hard molten core, while I wont support more then 16 debuffs and I can see how that might have given you the idea I am asking for a non authentical experiance for a harder mc, like 8 debuffs + no dm. How that becomes "arguing to preserve an experience basically noone experienced on the grounds that it's more authentic" is beyond me
---
In same situation, have one.. will have two by the time classic comes.
---
Some old friends most likely to start play again but not any of those with children from what I've gathered so far.
---
Gonna be looking/are looking for like minded for classic :) 
---
Gonna try rush leveling in first few days but after that semi casual leveling/questing during night when family is asleep. have given my fiance the heads-up I might go zombie mode first 2 weeks of release 😅
---
Half these comments go into too much details. Maybe the concept was there but ultimately what WAS in the game was a couple of high threat moves which in no way would ever hold aggro in a dungeon group. However as a support class that had mail and could use a shield - the odd high threat spell was useful to take mobs away from other party members who’d likely die much quicker.
---
Shamans are a support class.
---
I
---
Ya some call that velcro
---
It definitely was a thing, maybe there were few exceptions. But LoS mechanics are one of the trickiest when it comes to private servers and even some of the most popular ones dont have it implemented correctly. So I wouldnt really use private servers as a reference point when it comes to LoS
---
Still you can PvP just fine as marks hunter. A warrior tank or combat rogue is simply shit and never gets shit done. A marks hunter does
---
Very true haha.
---
Yeah im looking forward to see what they do with it. Maybe i can win against a frost mage as a rogue now.
---
my friend trolled the fuck out of me and told me to go shaman. and to level ele. when i finally realized ele was not the OP class compared to other classes as he made it out to be it was to late and i wasn't about to reroll. dont regret it though have been playing shaman for like 14 years.
---
Go horde then.
---
I'd rather be among Liberals than their Right-Wing counterpart, literal Nazis. 
---
I always missed weapon skill after it was removed, and it does make sense. I couldn’t just pick up an Axe and master it with the first swing.
---
On a similar note, is failing to collect a resource still a thing?
---
Will have 3 kids come classic but I’ll likely be working 3 12s at that point so I might be able to play some while everyone else is at school or work. 
---
I haven’t read any other comments but if your actually thinking about leveling resto.... you need to find yourself a good hybrid spec. You’ll be bored in days with a rest leveling experience - to play and level as a healer you never use any offensive spells apart from totems, lightning by shield, flame tongue weapon and flame shock.
---
Searing totem, melee hit, lightning hit shield and 1 x flame shock per mob. You’ll never drink again 
---
Plenty of people that are considering taking a week or even 2 weeks of work. 
---
1st. Server maintenance which lasted a few hours.
---
2nd. Being a gnome in maraudon. (Swimming when everyone else can walk)
---
3rd. Range players who don't instantly attack watchers in strat.
---
I don’t disagree but why fast daggers? Flame tongue increases damage with slower weapons ?
---
We definitely should create one!
---
We will see. Do we have a worst in slot list aswell? I'll start on one.
---
May we meet in Classic! 
---
That noise humans make when aggroed. Hut!
---
Yea I don't believe this. How do you get past Baroness and her MC? How do you deal 46k damage to Baron while he's constantly AOEing you for shadow damage without dying? Evasion doesn't help you here.
---
Pretty sure the Ziggurat doors don't open until you kill the boss guarding them either
---
Yeah kinda blows because its so rich in lore. The humans first ever kingdom Stromgarde is there (That decrepit city, that I know think is rebuilt in Bfa? Someone confirm.) and Thoradins Wall, and ancient Dwarf relic forgotten by time. 
---
That may be true for a shaman, but a druid does not have such rotations. Putting HoTs on tank before pulling is most of the time actually a bad idea, putting them mid-pull takes time and mana which you could spend DPSing. Rest of the toolkit is situational oh-shit buttons, like innervating healer, rezzing the tank/healer or switching to those roles if needed. You obviously put thorns on the tank and MoTW on the party, but that's it.
---
The 50% of the 1-20 community you wont see the next week. I agree with your statement but ppl have to stick around and play for there to be a community. 
---
Haha I never knew that about gnomes! Didn't they also have problems with LoS on the Illidari Council in TBC?
---
What comes to mind would be Tailoring / Alchemy, Selling alt cd's or making the arcanite / mooncloth yourself and selling it is normally a good way to make gold.  
---
but i guess if you're real crazy and manage to get a axesmith + hammersmith both exalted with thorium brotherhood really early you could sell Nightfall / Sulfuron crafts which i would imagine you'd get tipped pretty well for.
---
APES guild on a private server are mostly all gnomes, apart from the dwarf priests and NE druids.

Favorite to play: Mage really like being range dps, and mage is pretty op.

Favorite class to have in a group would probably be rogue, solid dps pretty versatile sap stuns ext. + being able to open those locked lockboxes is always A+

The problem is that for Frost PvP you want Frostbite but your raid leader will moan at you for having Frostbite since it can freeze mobs near healers or w/e and then they get killed. This is more of a problem with the goblin packs in BWL than anywhere else though
---
Gotta love the rabids here downvoting simple annoyance posts. I still love these parts of the game in general, I’d never want them removed but they still give you a slight annoyance every now and then.
---
Totally agree though, it was weird after they took weapon skills out.

People still complain about racials on retail, lol. It really doesn't matter there though outside of very niche cases (like method race switching to troll for their world first Jaina kill, just to get a debuff to drop of quicker. 
---
As crazy as it sounds, we need to cherish everything that is happening for vanilla WoW. This relaunch for a game we love so much will probably only happen once in our lifetime. 
---
I can tell you there is a lot of people in the same boat. There will definitely be some Dad oriented Family First guilds that you should look for. Maybe you could get a dungeon done every now and then with some like minded parents :)
---
A lot of private servers has their own fixes for this as well, which in my opinion are more destructive to the experience. Like dynamically increasing respawn rates the more people there are in an area, causing almost instant respawns in starting zones for example. 
---
You will drink more often than your healer unless the healer is utter garbage. That's just the way of tank paladin. Too many abilities used for tanking block the natural mana regen completely.
---
warrior or rogue with a priest / other healer probably sham or paladin depending on faction/  
---
Warrior can kill mobs really fast especially with a healer only down time you'd have is when your healer eventually has to drink, and you can tank dungeons.  
---
Rogue same mob clear potential but cant tank. may be harder to start groups ext.   
---
as for healer priest is best overall healer in the game, pretty mana efficient, tank + healer combo = easy dungeon groups.   
---
shaman again easy dungeons, a little less mana efficient, but has totems that increase melee damage = faster mob kills.   
---
paladin good single targ healing haven't ever played one but i assume theyre decent   
---
With double mage though, yes there is a high kill potential / a lot of aoe potential but there is also quite a bit of downtime via mana consumption. it also may not be as easy to get into a group as double dps, but thats normally the case.  
---
Human rogue right here and the best thing about not getting 1 shot by a much higher level is the gouge, sprint stealth get out of jail (sometimes) card. Especially when too low for vanish
---
paladin not having a ranged pull. Id be happy if exorcism is castable on all enemy type, but maybe do 25% or something like that of the full damage on non undead. Maybe go a bit further and slap a taunt effect on that tomato, boom you solved all of the paladin problem.

I was 17 when I began playing wow, and am 30 now with a 3 year old son.  I've contemplated this myself.  I would love to dive in and play, but I do not know if I would be able to moderate the amount if time I'd want to invest into raiding.  
---
I began around a couple of months before Naxx release, so I never experienced Ahn Quiraj.  I've gone to private servers since and raided up to BWL.  All around, it's a tough call.

I guess if you want to be semantic about it but everyone knows what I'm talking about.

When he said hook and loop I actually assumed he meant those cardboard packages that loop back around.

Don’t sell anything to vendor and check AH first, use that bank ! It’s a long game not a short one

Haha nice topic. Became a dad too and already thinking how intense this classic wow time will/ should be for me. I am playing Dota 2 on a regular basis so I might just switch that one. Old friends will hopefully join too but they are all without kids.

Since I moved to China, do you know if there are any server restrictions or if I need to play with a vpn to connect to a European server?

I would love to do some raiding on the weekend or so but maybe it is more annoying then in my nostalgic memories :)

Some months to go.

Giving a couple gold to some dude suddenly makes it a master of something else entirely with little to no effort, that makes no sense whatsoever and has lost all of the RPG element that there should be in my opinion in terms of character specialisation choices and uniqueness.
---
- Full respecs should make your toon level 10 and you have to re-level to 60 again.
---
This would have the added effect of people picking more practically applicable builds for all areas of content they end up in rather than just some polarised simplistic one sided cookie cutter builds like a pure PvE dps role that is universally expected in raids nowadays to the point of being mocked, something that largely only Blizzard in their neverending non-wisdom of making things simpler and more "accessible" has made possible in the MMORPG genre.
---
Also having people releveling their toons sometimes makes all the low level content relevant again and brings new players companions in their leveling.
---
The question I ask you, why should someone be able to just change from ie. Shadow to Holy which are no less polar opposites of elements in Warcraft in mere seconds without procuring any of the experience needed to learn something new?
---
Blizzard making WOW too convenient, effortless and easy in some areas didn't start in TBC, Wrath or Cata, it began well before that in Vanilla design. Vanilla design is far from perfect.
---
Easy respecs are bullshit.
---
Queue "you think you want it, but you don't". The fact that people are so divided on *which* version of Vanilla to implement and how says volumes about what people thought they wanted.
---
Pet scaling, or the lack therof. They are nearly useless in raids and even in pvp they died to incidental damage enough to be highly annoying
---
Yeah in England we just refer to anything like that as Velcro, I've never in my entire life heard of hook and loop.
---
Rdruids are pretty good, like a shaman theyre cast as a support healer i guess would be the consensus, but they have their place. even in naxx in the best guilds you'll most likely see 1 - 2 r Druids. MOTW / Brez is pretty valuable. 
---
For min-maxing yeah. I really don't want to drop my herb/alch for engineering but since we go hardcore into Classic I guess I have to :(
---
no but I think the expection is that profits are gonna be very small, so activison won't try to optimize revenue past the subs.
---
Do you remember what patch weapon skill was removed?
---
Hi, /u/theothedogg
---
Selfish people who play meme specs.
---
I have a daughter (13) and a son (5), she was two years old when I started to play WoW in 2007. She eventually joined me on retail, in Mists of Pandaria, but we both quit about three months after BfA launch.
---
I don't intend to rush things, at first I don't think I'll be able to run Naxx, too much commitment to farm potions and gear to be able to go there, but surely I'll be 60 and maybe do some lower tiers raids and, of course, complete max level dungeons.
---
im sry but modern wow is not even close to 40% of old wow. i dont even think its 30%... they have removed everything and casualized the fuck out of this game. fuck personal loot, fuck trash class and race designs, fuck lfg/lfr, fuck this timegating and insane boring grind for everything, fuck sharding and shit, fuck all these new sounds and animations that make every class and race feel the same and fuck these boring characters and story. at least in legion despite everything else, the story was 10/10. the only things good left in this game are the music and art
---
Hi, Zamuru!
---
I wish you peace and prosperity in the new year! Take care!
---
-HappyFriendlyBot
---
What's an ork?
---
I probably agree with you OP. The spell miss chance curve in PvP is retarded.
---
A level 30 Rogue's odds of being able to gouge a level 50 are pretty high. But a level 30 Warlock is fucked because all of his spells are almost 100% guaranteed to be resisted.
---
I always felt like the oddly steep spell hit scaling in PvP was kinda foolish. But I guess it's to prevent a group of people from running an army of low level characters into an area and polymorphing everything.
---
The combat system was designed before DR was added to PvP. That's probably why spell resist scales exponentially vs. higher level characters in PvP.
---
What, why?
---
42 years old, here, and father of two.  
---
I started playing WoW in late TBC, not Vanilla, when I was 32, and back then I was single, working part-time, with lots of time between work and D&amp;D and going out.  
---
I've been on a hiatus since 2011, when I got married (we're not yet such, legally, but to me it's the same) and started working on adding new players to the party.  
---
I played on and off during the last years, much more since the "invention" of the starters' account, and I've "finally" come back in Legion, though I'm currently on a finance-forced hiatus that will end in summer (or earlier, hopefully).  
---
I see in your post all the "issues" surrounding my gaming activity.  
---
I tell people I play little, they tell me "I see you online all the time", and I have to explain how, while I am indeed online and **even** logged into a character, I'm actually not there, because I'm playing with Lego with my son and daughter, or preparing them food, or washing them, or whatever else is part of running a family.  
---
The only difference between me and you, is that I don't use audio at all. No headphones, no speakers, nothing.
---
Ah, whoops. Well, whatever, the numbers I said were wrong but the concepts are still the same.
---
I'd be more okay with it if the Horde Stromguard chain had worthwhile rewards, I mean like Warsong Supplies quality rewards. Chain of multiple elite quests requiring basically a full instance group and requiring you to run on foot back and forth over a large zone right by an enemy city. Oh and then to top it all off, one of the elite areas is alliance faction so they can gank you with near impunity. That quest needs to get the Seal of Wynn treatment.
---
So does starting 1.12 talente at level 1 on a fresh launch....???? What is the point you are making. 
---
4.0
---
QoL wise, quest items not sparkling is pretty annoying, it's easy to misso some items like the little flowers in WC.
---
How does a more responsive movement on a newer client affect you? Im not saying you are wrong or right, i genuinely want to know the pros and cons of this
---
Yes? That's just another issue.
---
I have higher expectations of Blizzard than some private server ran by a bunch of kids without any money. But from what we've heard from Blizz, it doesn't seem like Classic will be more authentic than those private servers.
---
I would of course want them to make it even more like vanilla was, with talent and item progression, if they can't even beat private servers in that sense however, it seems like a failure.
---
Solved with engineering! 
---
I guess it makes sense that a mage/lock can't just CC a much higher character with impunity. But it doesn't make sense that melee classes can. Both should have tremendous difficulties or neither. 
---
Hunters in general suffer a lot post BWL. Still amazing in PvP though.
---
Okay genius, what happens when everyone leaves the starting zones at the same time, welcome to the same problem at level 20 
---
Fuck sharding 
---
This is just crazy. What you forgetting is that some Talents &amp; specs depend on the Patch and Progression. 
---
I agree, it doesn't make a lot of sense. But I suppose melee also don't have CC which lasts for 30-60 seconds.
---
But they give good buffs and i think we do not want the Legion problem with pets ;)
---
Not exploitable if done correctly as a factor of population in each zone. But they'd need a lot of stress tests and trial runs to find the right balance.  Sharding is the easy way out 
---
&gt;its impossible to know what you don't know...
---
that is just factually wrong. Knowing what we dont know is essential in.. well, getting to know it by time. 
---
Lupos? 
---
Let me tell you, dimwit.
---
You won't have the same problem at 20, simply because people level at different speeds. There will be quite a large number of people around 20 at the same time, but you won't have everyone running for the same 6 quests.
---
Some will level in Westfall, some in Darkshore, some will grind, some will do dungeons, some will focus on professions, et cetera. You simply won't have the same number of people cramped in the same small starting area.
---
Oh yeah totally agree. I was just explaining his reply, I've never once used hook and loop in conversation. 
---
No, it wasn't. Look up Vurtne videos, trees would never break LoS. 
---
didn't have shadow damage in 1.12, I wasnt really, taking about their damage so much as their survivability anyway
---
it only takes 1 out of the 40 to infect the raid with knowledge 
---
Imbalanced racials for PvP
---
Orc Warrior racials gains in PvP: Bloodfury if you need it, 25% increased resistance to stun.
---
Human Warrior racials gains in PvP: Perception and 5% increased Spirit, 0.02% crit.
---
Or you just have a correctly working dynamic spawn system (not the private server shit) and you don't have any problems at all.
---
Sharding is the easy way out, and sadly it looks like they're taking it.
---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but classic is likely not the game for working parents. Retail is. 
---
Want tons of quests and open world content? Retail has orders of magnitudes more content for you. Want to see raids and content? LFG raids are quick and easy, you get all the story, some lower quality purples, and nobody cares if you have to leave in the middle. They have basically taken WoW and bent over backwards to cater to parents and casual players, this ruined the game for some, but it enabled folks who have a lot of other commitments to still jump on and have fun. 
---
The retail version of the game is literally designed to solve all the issues you bring up. Classic was lacking many of those qualities and if they stay true to the original these quality of life additions are not going to be there. Why play a more difficult version of WoW with none of the quality of life features when what you seem to want is already available in retail? 
---
What I would hate to see is folks who have kids and jobs and responsibilities jumping into classic wow, finding that the game is very limited if you are not able to commit the time, and then petition Blizz to nerf the game and add LFG so they can "see the whole game they paid for".    
---
Also solved with Magic Candle!
---
Hunters.
---
Love the difficulty though. Things like that make the game mysterious.
---
Yes they can
---
But are they gonna?!
---
lol filthy casual. thats not bullshit. thats being realistic in a game like world of warcraft. you annoyed for that? well too fkin bad go lvl up. world is not a friendly place. nor pvp should be. learn to lose. only then you're getting up.
---
How long it’s taking Blizzard to release it
---
yeah, getting a legendary item and great items along the way shouldn't be easy to obtain.  Just the initial rep grind to start would have deterred most people
---
The Pet feeding (because bag space) and that Raid pre quests are not really have good conection ingame (would be better when you have to go before MC  or Ony to get the quest 
---
Dear Blizzard: Pleeeease do this.
---
They should (but probably won't) I really want to avoid streamers.
---
You dropped this /s
---
Sharding in the starter zones is totally fine but one big problem will come and that is the AQ opening. I mean they could us just disconnect every 2 minutes like back then ;) 
---
It’s rebuilt but only for capped players... kinda sucks.
---
I solo'd it either in cata or mists, don't remember exactly. Got it after 20 runs or so. Also got Huntsman mount at 7th try ;)
---
No exciting weapons for casters. Weapons are just a boring stat stick.
---
Weapon damage? Doesn't matter.
---
Attack speed? Doesn't matter.
---
Weapon type? Doesn't matter.
---
And don't even get me started on off-hands. Would be cool if casters would've gotten "cool" weapons too.
---
I really hope that we do not have to walk to the bgs. 
---
Trees and many rocks did not break LoS, structures generally did.
---
It was originally planned to be a subclass. Not just cosmetic but with new mechanics and abilities. They didn’t leave it out due to concerns of control or customisation, but because they had deadlines and had nowhere near the resources to develop and balance new subclasses for every single race/class combination. I think they certainly made the right choice, as that would have been a nightmare, especially for race-locked content.
---
Well, they've stated sharding is a thing they plan to do in the early zones for a limited time on release. Presumably to cut down on the possibility of large numbers of dead servers as people come in and then leave before hitting 30. The speculation is that people for some reason assume they're lying and are going to keep it and use it across the board.
---
The only hard fact you stated is that they intend to do loot trading. Unfortunate, yeah. But I'm gonna listen to the guy who has infinitely more knowledge on the development of the game than any of us when he says it's going to be much more "no change" than "change". I never said I minded minor changes that don't have an impact on the game play and community. So far the only change I'm not big on is the loot trading. But it is only one change.
---
Stacking of certain items. 5 items per stack is bullshit.
---
Easy way to avoid streamers. Classic launches, wait literally 10 seconds to see what server they select, select a different one. Bam problem solved even if Activision Blizzard doesn't preannounce servers.
---
Thank you for the in depth reply!! Really great! What’s the 5 second rule and the cancel casting thing you mentioned?
---
They can, and they will.
---
But then again, a rogue is physically throwing blinding powder in your eyes, and a 50 rogue resisting a spell from a "weakling" level 30 warlock seems more likely to me :P But I agree, if a spell resists so much, maybe it's fair to have the blind miss as often too idk.
---
My pick for most annoying thing is probably running out of quests and having to grind the rest to 60.
---
Being able to attach only one item per mail
---
Confirming server types would be great as well. RP? RPPVP? Even if it's a very limited selection of those servers considering Classic's (possibly) limited player base, confirmation that they'll be options would be fantastic.
---
^This
---
As much as I agree with the sentiment, this has only ever gotten worse as the expansions rolled out. 
---
What's the problem with streamers? 
---
I doubt they will chose that fast lol. 
---
That has nothing to do with it being fair or about the levels. What he thinks is annoying how two different classes at the same Level have a highly different chance to hit their main CC spell.
---
He wants Rogues to also miss their CC on High Level targets like Warlocks do, not Warlocks hitting their Fear consistently.
---
For me, the streamers themselves are bearable...it's the following they bring/create I can't stand so I'd rather just avoid all of it.
---
Engineering is only a relevant profession if you're hardcore PvPing.  And by hardcore I mean 80% of your time or more.  Beyond that it's not that necessary.
---
Now if we are talking about TBC engineering, it got even better with BiS goggles and BiS Trinket (Goblin Rocket Launcher).  
---
But on the semantic side of things....it's not THAT necessary for any PvE encounters, and I'd argue that Alchemy (Flasks) or Enchanting (Transmute) would serve your PvE experience and your guild far better than Engineering would.
---
They said literally EXACTLY that so... read up. 
---
How is paladin tanking solved with engineering?
---
You could cast through any tree on the demo, I tested it myself.
---
Are intentionally ignoring /u/otearai1 's response to you ? Ions qoute there literally says that. 
---
It’s not, but the non-ranged attack he mentioned is solved with explosives. 
---
I get it. But there are only like 5 streamers tops, per region that pull thoise Numbers. So its not like you cant just easily see which realen they pick and then not pick that one?
---
I was probably 8 or 9 when I first played and I loved animals so hunter it was lol. Nowadays I play rogue so I can hide from a lot of the bullshit while leveling, and it makes farming a piece of cake.
---
Barrens chat will never be what it was anyway. Too many people who go there to "Be in barrens chat". On private servers it is a bunch of people who never experienced it trying to force it to be what they think it was. 
---
The other thing is many people coming from private servers might have a bit of a rude awakening when they have to deal with blizzard moderation in chat at all. The reporting system itself might be an issue depending on how they implement it, but the underlying rules will be a splash of cold water on some people.
---
1 viable shadow priest that will be healing most of the time. Doesn't make any other meme spec viable. 
---
&gt;Full respecs should make your toon level 10 and you have to re-level to 60 again.
---
And here I thought I was crazy.  You're just batshit insane if you think a respec should require releveling from 10-60 again.
---
Even Diablo 2 didn't require you to re-level when you re-spec'd your build.  Granted they only gave you a limited number of times to respec, but seriously dude sounds like you just are here to hate on WoW in general.  Maybe this forum isn't your cup of tea?
---
&gt; I can imagine that the first half of classic was much better than the second half
---
Lol - as someone that started on Day 1 USA and played until AQ, the limited release content and length of time between patches meant that I was mostly logging on just to raid by BWL.
---
Starting in November on a private server that launched August-ish and has an accelerated content timeline is a much different experience because there is so much more content available.
---
Just have to learn to balance your life. 
---
Ok, guess me the realms correctly and I'll avoid them.
---
I mean, bombs for helping maintain aggro seems fine, but I coulda sworn that the range to toss engineering bombs was closer than body pull aggro...
---
As i said. Look at which realen they roll and then you pick something else? Do you really need to roll the same second as they do?
---
There was a about a month long period right after the battlegrounds were added to the game where the battleground masters were physically located out in the game world together with the instance portal to their respective battlegrounds.
---
Horde's Warsong Gulch battlemaster and portal was placed in the north end of the barrens, by the wooden palisade. Alliance's battlemaster was located in a little Night Elf village just west of the Barrens/Ashenvale zone border. The Arathi Basin portals and battlemasters were placed in the Arathi Highlands.
---
The problem with this idea was that it turned out to be insanely terrible. The more numerous faction on the server would always start multiple raids and commit genocide at the other faction's battlemaster.
---
Imagine how amazingly shitty it would to lose a battleground against a premade in 5 minutes flat, exit the battleground and arrive straight into the arms of 120 people waiting to mop the floor with your face yet again.
---
Imagine what it was like playing the least populated faction on your server and not being able to queue into battlegrounds after the end of school hours until bedtime because there's multiple raids from the other faction just murdering everything within 200 yards of the battlemaster for hours and hours.
---
Not like you could team up and win the raid v raid either. If you were playing on the less populated faction you could maybe muster one raid of demoralized people who stood no chance of beating three raids full of people who are happily stomping everything that moves.
---
Ever since that first month when everything was total chaos Blizzard has always made sure to have multiple battlemasters in several locations scattered throughout the game world to avoid ever creating a conveyor belt effect where one faction exits battlegrounds and fall straight into the lap of several raids waiting for free honor.
---
Priest is the better healer. Shadow/Ele are both good in PVP
---
They are starting with 16 debuffs.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2144
---
I agree that they can be fun in PvP, even though they do have an annoying dead zone.
---
Anyway, I meant to say that their PvE endgame isn't great. Their pets don't scale with gear, which means that they don't have very good DPS for raiding.
---
I shouldn't have to wait just to be able to play in peace. Blizzard should announce the realms in advance close to launch.
---
Dander?
---
Some people don't like the community that streamers bring along with them. 
---
Happily married with a kid.  My wife accepts me playing WoW assuming i dont neglect any other responsibilities.  So, my gaming at this point is excusively after the kids in bed.  Sadly I probably wont get to relive naxx and AQ,  but hopefully i can pug some MC/BWL/ZG.  It will be different than my early 20s in college where i played like it was my job.
---
If you manage to get on good terms with GM/Officers a Shadow Priest is more likely to raid than an Enhancement Shaman due to the +shadow dmg debuff.
---
No option to remember account name.
---
This is the best comment I read in a while. Thanks for the chuckles.
---
What is learning?
---
I love these threads, it's so interesting to see how passionate people are about the game, and the creative ways of fitting it into a life that is different that it was back when you played it "for real". 
---
Well I basically have no clue what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna have my first kid about a month and a half before release (if the Mid July rumors hold up), so I have no clue what I'm in for. I had hoped for a spring release so I could have leveled up before and just do the occasional BG, etc when the baby is sleeping, but I honestly have no clue. 
---
I'm picking a druid because it's just an the class that I've wanted to try, but I can definitely see that class choice having some advantages in terms of being able to stealth if the kid wakes up all of the sudden, also it's not gonna suck as much not having optimal gear while leveling, or not being able to afford the mount at 40. 
---
It's really weird for me because I've always raided when I played WoW - it's kinda the main thing I play for - but now I need to find a completely different way of enjoying the game. I'll spend more time enjoying the leveling journey (which has always been a sour chore for me to rush through) - and probably I'd have an easier time "focusing" on PVP this time rather than raiding, since I guess it's both more realistic to find 10-30 minutes for a BG, and easier to leave, than to think you can schedule in a 3-hour raid without interruptions. 
---
I'm hoping that I will get the occasional chance to raid with my old gamer friends, and get some charity epics - we've all been playing Classic and TBC, and later various private servers, and I'm the only one becoming a dad (to my knowledge) - so if I can find the time once in a while, I have someone to carry me ;)   
---
As a horde player, it is my duty to complain endlessly about the other faction and paladins.
---
Do u even classic, brah?
---
And suddenly there were no tanks, healers, or raid specced DPs. Sounds awesome.
---
I mean. It will Take you 1 minute tops. 
---
OP's talking about vanilla, not Classic:)
---
Is that specific to Vanilla though? Works for pretty much any game with levels these days right.
---
Streamers will have overlay up though so you won’t know. As far as I know there are no big streamers in USA est besides Timthetatman and Lirik both of which won’t reach max level and don’t have big WoW audiences so USA est players are in a solid spot.
---
Rogues can get 50-100g/h pickpocketing im pretty sure
---
What's the problem with these divas? Just ignore them no matter what! 
---
Not a dad myself, but I've played and raided with many back in the WotLK days. Did we had to pause raid because our mommy top healer had kid emergency? You bet we had! 😉
---
I might not have gotten in until WOTLK but it meant my Battle Chest was just Vanilla and TBC and the battle chest guides were separate for each one, I have each individual game manual, and it's nice that way. My spouse has a battle chest that runs through Cata I think and it is all integrated in one guide. It feels... Wrong. It's nice that you can usually still find books from vanilla like the old Atlas or the BradyGames guide at Half  Price books, that's where I got my copies, for like $3 each. I almost bought a hard copy of the Atlas the other day. I wish I had started playing when it first dropped, but I was concerned about how much I would play and trying to keep my first marriage alive. Note, I say first. Lol. 
---
Tell me a thing you dont know exists?  You cant do it.  You might one day discover a thing but until that point you didnt know what you didnt know.  
---
I am a father of four. I have maintained some level of play for almost all of wow history. I have been in and off playing private’s for close to a decade. 
---
The key is wow/life balance. Manage your expectations about how much of the game you can see and how quickly. You can see every bit but be prepared for it to take years of your life. ALWAYS put family first but enjoy your downtime never an hour a night can yield a few quests. Be honest with yourself and your family and put them first. Wow is a hobby, it is not a race, you can never win so just play with your buddies when you can even if it’s just one night a week for a dungeon run
---
I just want a fun game. 
---
Haven't played vanilla on 10 years. First thing I thought was backpack space.
---
I have two daughters now, 5 and 2. I probably won’t be able to play much at all when they’re awake and moving around. They’re pretty attached to daddy, and if I’m on the computer, they’re looking over my shoulder, wanting to sit in my lap and see what I’m doing, etc. I am not the gamer I was when WoW released anyway, but kids pretty much killed it entirely for me. Now I get an hour or two after they’re in bed and before I go there myself. Even on weekends, I may not have to get up for work, but those kids don’t sleep late!
---
I figure to mainly level and quest for the most part, tinker with professions, explore. Hoping on the weekends to get in some dungeons. The voice comm is a concern. Like you, I don’t wear headphones much. Even with the kids asleep, I still need to hear the monitor for anyone fussing in their bedrooms. Although in the past I just explain that I can’t say much myself, but am listening, and hang the headphones around my neck with the volume up a little.  Can hear what is being said but am not cut off, nor is it loud through the main speakers.
---
Nightwing pulls from the entrance with that trinket :D
---
I would say Alliance is because the quests are better for Alliance and zone progression is better to. However the world record in speed leveling was done by Joana as an Orc Hunter.
---
Same here man, we need to start a guild for dads! 
---
I looked to my right and there was a white towel I didn't know existed. That's called learning. 
---
Troll Hunter\*
---
I'm not a dad or a mom but if anyone would like to make me one, hmu. 
---
You forgot the part where pets follow rogues on a restealth and that most rogues level as combat with one vanish and a slower stealth than you can imagine. One dot is all you need to kill them from max range if you outlevel them. Just follow the pet. Rogues have no cloak of shadows in vanilla. Rogues die absurdly easy to pet classes while leveling. You don't need to be level 50. You can kill every one you see and at past level 45 (when they will more likely start speccing sub) you just have some limited invulnerability pots on you as a caster. 
---
Locks level way faster than rogues will due to fronstabbing not working so I don't know why anyone would worry about this. If you REALLY want to kill higher levels as a low level player and level slow then get engineering and a deathray and a friend who has the same. **Rouges also have no trinket to remove stun**.  Each class trinket is different in Vanilla. Theirs removes fear and poly. Iron grenades are very big against them. So is tidal charm.
---
They went gnomes due to PVP. Which was ironic as guild attracted all experienced PVPers which meant horde was too weak and thus creating one sided uninteresting PVP.
---
To this day I get giddy when someone passes me some water
---
I mean neither is allowing a 50 to attack a 30 at all. 
---
I would guess Horde because of much faster travel between the main capitals and leveling zones. 
---
I plan on playing classic, and I have a little one as well.  I’ll be honest though, I don’t think it will be a huge issue.  Just set your expectations correctly.  I play retail now (and will drop it once classic launches).  On retail, I raid 4h/wk in a Heroic guild, and am in a M+ team that plays 4h/wk.  I also login and do dailies and such throughout the week periodically.
---
This works for me because my raid guild raids one night a week for 4h, so it’s easy to block off that time.  The M+ team runs well after the kid is asleep so I’m good there.  Also my SO plays WoW and will be playing classic as well, so it is a couples activity for us, just like retail is now.  Playing wow for us is like watching tv for other couples.
---
I definitely will be unable to play in a top guild but it will be easy enough to PVP and dungeon crawl.  I plan on rolling a priest so it will be easier for me to pug into groups too.
---
I will likely accomplish much less in classic than I can in retail but I’ll have fun doing it and that’s what matters.  :)
---
That every endgame group thing takes a total evening. Hell, doing Strat UD incl. Group forming can Take longer than a mythic farm raid clear.
---
Ah yeah, you're right of course. But Horde non the less...
---
Do you believe it is "crazy" that you have to to level another class toon to reach peak performance when class balance isn't perfect?
---
In contrast specs/talents are given nearly freely to change whereas classes demand you to level up, yet they are nearly identical elements. I am of the opinion that changing any of these things, classes and specs/talents should require leveling up. As in, making a radical change to your character should require one to make a radical effort as well.
---
I understand that some players find these kinds of more demanding RPG elements difficult and inconvenient. It's like comparing D3 to D2. I prefer D2 and personally can't stand the easy mode design of D3 to the point I don't even play it even if I have it. Vanilla WoW represents D2 2.5 for me, and I'd love to see some more demanding RPG elements implemented to it.

Balance issues are something you just can't design a game around and use as an excuse to keep the game simple. It is reasonably assumed that the intention is to balance a game in finality at some point, as opposed to have "rebalancing" as an ongoing "feature". Companies like Blizzard use "rebalancing" as a method to stir the pot(read: artificial life support) intentionally because their games are poorly designed in terms of longevity in a way that stagnates the game very quickly, as in themepark oriented games.
---
Why not play on the same server so you have a big group of people who are easily exploitable and predictable?
---
Well, you have Night Elf hunters with Darkshore and Tauren hunters with Mulgore. Mulgore is less of a bottleneck than Teldrassil, but Darkshore is just a great zone for leveling. Horde have the Barrens bottleneck. Unfortunately, I'm not super informed on horde leveling. 
---
On the past 2 servers I've played, more alliance were \~30 before some of the horde's fastest levelers were 26/27. From what I'm told, horde have a pretty good natural level progression from 30 onward.
---
Yea lets just ignore the zerg of spergs following them around yelling OMEGALUL and other shit like the minions they are
---
Asmongold is the big one for US players. His stream is dedicated to wow, so most people who watch him play the game. His streamers alone who are online when the game launches will be enough to fill a server. 
---
For PVE if you are min maxing Engineering is a must as well, since goblin sapper charges have no GCD resulting in much faster runs as well as some bosses being easier (like Ouro). Besides this there are other useful PVE stuff with engineering, while for Flasks and Enchanting you need 1 person to have in guild, and Flasks can be even done on an alt.
---
Warrior - Priest. Because you do not share armor types. And you got a healer and a tank right there. So you just need to find DPS for dungeons. Which is easy.
---
i don't disagree, but that's a pretty default rpg thing. and is that even different in retail or any other addon? i played up until cata and only remember the legendary mace and atiesh, which had anything unique to them. 
---
Or just pick another server ez. Its not like you cant go to twitch.tv and just check which server asmongold chose
---
 I am not against time and Zone limited sharding to improve experience in the beginning. But it's really hard to trust blizzard with their implementationand if they really are only Going to use it that way.
---
That is the thing. It does not matter at all the progression between 1-30, because it'll be like 30% of the true leveling time if I remember. 30-60 is like 60-70% of the leveling time.
---
With contempt for everything that has a red name i've camped lots of gnomes as a troll hunter and relished in it in sadistic pleasure before cooking them.
---
gnomes are quite nutritious btw.
---
So you're familiar with the standard raiding restoration build, and the advice people have given is good, but here's a few other options for you.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZxVbdVMZxcIt0co
---
A more melee focused build that gets you Imp Weapon Totems in the Enhance tree and NS and Healing Way over in Resto. There's 5 points left over to customize. You want to rush 2handed spec and Nature's Grace as fast as possible. NG is possibly the single best leveling talent in the game. Personally I'd go 5 in Imp Healing Wave, that makes instance healing much easier. Then back to Enhance, so you'll have 2H Weps just in time for a Corpsemaker. Once you have those two, go for NG. Everything after that is up to you.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hxfzVcZZxcIz0eo
---
The caster focused version. Better overlap in your gear between your healing role and damaging/solo role. Also you get extra value out of Tidal Mastery here to not only boost your Ancestral Healing procs, but with Call of Thunder you have 11% spell crit from talents. Again when leveling you would rush NG, then fill it out however you want. This build takes Eye of the Storm over Healing Focus. Ultimately I think a shaman is going to want at least one of those two talents. Here there's still 8 talent points left for customization. You could pick up faster shocks, more damage, or even push to Mana Tide.
---
Note that what allows these more hybrid builds is moving away from the notion that Mana Tide is a requirement. One of the biggest problems with speccing Mana Tide is you drop 5 points in Restorative Totems, which is a pretty shit talent. Depending on your guild and where you are in raid progression, you may not need Mana Tide. Particularly if you go the melee hybrid way, you'll get dumped into the Melee group and could compensate for your lack of Mana Tide with Dark Runes and whatnot.
---
What's the thing with gnomes in maraudon?
---
[This has been my "bathroom book" since vanilla. Still makes for good reading!](https://i.imgur.com/etPIZr7.jpg)
---
Hopefully in classic with the legion base game engine, trees actually block Los.
---
Okay... sorry for contributing?
---
Find a guild that raids 2 nights in a row. Last day before reset and first day after reset. You can have about 2 weeks of freedom/pvp spec.
---
I wonder if ganking and camping will be allowed in classic. Griefing is a bannable offense nowadays. 
---
The Bloodvine Goggles are pretty much BiS until Mish'undare or T2,5. Also things like the Shadow and Flame Deflectors, Sapper charges, Rocket Boots are extremely useful in raids. Doing Visc without enough sapper charges is a pain in the thrustbrick. 
---
But yes I'll agree it's definitely not required.
---
My god if Postal or CT_Mail doesn't work on Classic I'll break something.
---
Soulshards...
---
For better or worse, ganking was the reality in Vanilla, so we will see it in classic.
---
So I clicked this thinking it would be different content. See when I was probably 10 and Vanilla came out, my dad and I played all the time together. It was a great bonding opportunity, leveling two troll shamans together slowly but surely. We actually made several character pairs throughout our time in Vanilla. 
---
I just wanted to shout out to the WoW dads and moms who spent time bonding with their kids and making truly great memories. 
---
Last but not least, I appreciate your goal with Classic and I feel the exact same way. I'm looking forward to exploring and playing with my friends and dad once again. Not rushing to end game, and frankly I don't plan on raiding at all. Just to enjoy the journey again and take my time.
---
I'm hoping to gank the fuck out of azermong.
---
And joana is consider ally this time because it shows that NE is better on a high pop fresh.
---
Yes, and until you discovered it you didnt know what you didnt know.  Try to grasp this simple concept.
---
AFAIK there's *ONE* interesting weapon with a proc and that's a rare epic dagger from Maraudon that procs some damage and mana return. Pretty dull really..
---
I have played shaman quite a lot during various expansions (mainly as resto), and was strongly considering changing to a priest this time.   
---
IMO the priest in Vanilla is the "full" healer, like any healing class you will have your one or two spells in a certain rank that will be your bread and butter heal, and it will be cast 90% of the time. But I do like the extra options you have as a priest - you have a shield for big incoming boss dmg, you have a HoT, you even have different AoE heals that might make sense in a few specific scenarios. As a shaman you will basically either be spamming a downranked chail heal for raid healing, or a downranked healing wave on a tank - and you don't have many other options than that. 
---
Both of the classes have interesting off-specs, however none of them have a "raiding DPS" spec that is used in an optimal raid setup. Not to say that you can't raid as DPS with these classes, just that it's something you'd get to do because your guild likes you, not because you can top DPS charts. 
---
Additionally, both classes have interesting hybrid specs that can allow you to heal in raids and destroy in PVP (in the case of the shaman it's a healer / burst dmg monster, as priest it's a healer / CC monster). 
---
I'm personally going druid this time - the healing itself isn't as interesting as the priest healing, I'd say it's more interesting than shaman healing (but that's coming from someone that spent the majority of his WoW game time spamming chain heal) - but to me the rest of the class gameplay, including fantasy, is more appealing. And I probably won't have much time for raiding this time anyways. 
---
Leveling fast is about being ahead of the curve, being ridiculessly fast 1-30 is gonna make your entire leveling super easy.
---
He’ll 99% surely be on a pve server. Because of this hahaha
---
Well, you're pretty much stuck in the Barrens till level 22 and then you have to go into Stone Talon mountains. And due to it's layout it's a pretty stupid zone. Also Alliance have quests there as well but in the high 20's instead of low 20's like Horde. So you will get ganked. And the same is true for Hillsbrad. You can go there at level 20 as horde. But Alliance only go there at level 30.
---
While Alliance can go Elwynn - Westfall &amp; Loch Modan - Redridge - Duskwood &amp; Wetlands. All off those zone's are pretty much Alliance only.  
---
Same boat here. Would love a casual Dad guild to join. Stoked about Classic.
---
Or roll on a PvP server, streamers will avoid them. 
---
Yeah LBRS is what worked well in real vanilla. Warriors have jump runs where they can make decent money to Or they can tank 5's 10's as dps spec and sell carries to people who need things like Dal'Rends. Parking a mage in DM with a hearth at the nearest faction town is just easier though . Can also teleport and make food/water for the alt and just have someone hold it for you in return for making them food/water. Mage alts are just really good to have in vanilla, which is why a lot of people level them with just rest xp and aoeing. Can level them with minimal play a few hours every week and eventually have a goldfarmer/vending machine.
---
Sodapoppin is planning on going on the opposite faction (Alliance) of the realm in which Tim and Lirik play, and is trying to get his friends to join him.
---
I think Tim and Lirik will reach max level, they've commented a few times on how they are prepared for their streams to die (as a half-joke over how many viewers are going to leave them once the wow streams start)
---
Asmongold is going to likely be off on his own as he wants to play a PvE server.
---
You do realise that a lot of the "quirky" things that are on private servers arent neccessary things that were in real vanilla? Like the example of warlocks where if you had an active pet and started summoning a new the pet would instantly dewspawn and not despawn at the end of the cast. There are so much people are remembering wrong probably because of their exposure to private servers so, yes it will be jarring for people to play
---
Do not misunderstand me, I am not trying to say that your contribution is bad, on the contrary. Sorry for my bad english.
---
Which faction is the guild intending to roll?
---
Of course, but ridiculessly 1-30 would be like when any faction reach 30, the other is 15 or so in my opinion.
---
What do you think?
---
Thanks.
---
&gt; (Respecs were added to Diablo 2 in the v1.13 patch.) 
---
&gt; Patch 1.13 was released on 23 March 2010
---
We actually have a prot paladin tanking right now. He's usually tanking trash and healing on bosses, but sometimes he tanks the bosses as well and to my amazement it actually works. I'm assigned to healing his holy arse and it's actually not a problem. 
---
In a similar position myself, so glad to see a fellow gamer dad.
---
What works in my favour is that I brought my children up as gamers. They had their first console controllers (those specially adapted mini ones) aged 3 as if it was a birth rite.
---
They are not playing as we would have, with no time limits or age restrictions, instead I carefully select what games are available depending on their age, maturity, and the game content. They get half hour a day for being good in school, and doing homework and they get two hours a day at weekends for being good all week and helping with the chores.
---
Things like Microsoft Family settings and Nintendo Parental Controls have helped with this.
---
It hasn't had any negative effect on their behaviour or schooling, if anything it has helped provide a structured reward system and been a great help. They don't go to bed late, and they don't kick up a stink if they don't get a reward because it's been this way since day one. They were quicker to learn to read than their peers for example, which is in part due to the efforts we put in as parents but also part due to some games needing reading skills to advance in.
---
It has been really fascinating to see them grow in their own free choice of preferred genres. One of them almost exclusively enjoys non combat games, simulators, realistic racing, etc. The others are closer to the tree and enjoy RPGs and action RPGs.
---
They all know and enjoy the Warcraft series and have enjoyed sampling WoW, both BfA and classic. For sure at least one of them will play at launch (dps warrior) and the others may follow later.
---
My fondest memory so far of introducing them to WoW was when one of them got the newbie classic human quest to kill wolves and after reading it carefully said, "Um. No thank you. I am going to find kitties to pet. Why would I kill harmless little animals," and then clicked the decline button.
---
You make a game what you want it to be. For us, warcraft is yet another family experience that helps define who we are and gives us something to talk about for years to come.
---
The only caveat is voice chat.. Yeah. That's not happening until they've gone to bed.
---
I recently tried Duskwallow Marsh as a Horde character. I had like 5 quests, half of which were in a very densely packed Elite zone.
---
No audio? I prefer the music in Teldrassil over my childrens voices any day of the week! :)
---
I know pickpocket in BRD was good. And pickpocket in SM was really good at 40
---
My entire goal in classic is to get BIS gear from raiding and be this presence on my server that just non stop Ganks and kills people trying to quest or raid or whatever they do. If it’s red it’s dead.  I’m probably gonna grief redridge mountains 12 hours a day at some point 
---
Utilise your wealth of experience to save time.
---
I played wow on Kel'thuzad "Asmongolds server" for all of Legion so 2-3 years? I never really noticed any obnoxious fans, even while I was raiding in Indestructible. Keep in mind this was retail wow where servers mean far less but I really don't think this is remotely as much of an issue as people think it is. 
---
It's pretty funny, I mained warlock and priest throughout all of wow. Warlock in vanilla/bc, priest at the end of bc/wotlk/cata/mop, I mainly pvp healed as well.
---
I gotta say, priests level pretty quickly compared to every class that isnt a hunter/lock/druid. Spend gold on wands, its worth every copper and there isn't really any downtime, and you can netflix and chill at the same time lol no joke. If you plan on doing premades alliance is way better imo than horde as a lock (I mained lock in vanilla and continue to do so in private servers), I'd take having to deal with a few WOTF any day over the pally dispel spam in coordinated play. In terms of solo, you can't beat orc warlocks :).
---
I have a 16 month-old child and playing on a P-server right now. 
---
I can confirm that dungeons and raiding are completely off the table when he is awake. I do enjoy dungeons, however, and have one day a week where my wife puts the little one to bed and I start up a dungeon (sometimes even two if they're quick) to run with my brothers.
---
It really does just need to be a different set of expectations. The guild that I'm in is doing some raiding, but are happy to have casuals that can fill groups here or there and whatnot. They know I'm not going to probably make even 10% of the raids  and are all good with that being the case :)
---
same here. i played bc and wotlk when i was around 17-21 i guess. now i am 30, married and have a 4 year old daughter. but i am very hyped about classic. currently i dont play any games, but i really miss it. currently there is nothing out there that interests me and wow classic just fits perfect for me.
---
i am going into summer with the same approach as you. have fun, dont rush it. raiding is not necessary but i guess at some point i will do it a bit for my real passion: pvp. my main play times will be in the evening, when my daughter is asleep and in the morning on the weekend, cause i am always awake pretty early. i am already dreaming of a nice saturday morning, 7 am, i am making a nice cup of coffee, go to my pc, start wow and just have lots of fun.
---
regarding voice communication i dont see the problem for me. when i would raid or group with real life friends (dont know if they will play yet, but my brother will start with me 100%) i would use my headset cause i want to have a microphone. and normally my daughter would not be around when i play. 
---
Then dont play and stick to private servers bc you seem to favor them. Personally i find pservers to be complete trash. What they might make up for with better content release dates or item progression they lose in dog shit scripts, wonky procs, exploits,  cheats,  custom values, low population. 
---
Theyre much short than everyone else, so in many areas where humans/orcs etc can just walk through the water, gnome have to swim which throws them off their mount and slows you down.
---
I really only think people will notice during the initial leveling 
---
I was older when I started playing, in my 30s by the time Vanilla rolled out. Had my daughter whilst raiding in TBC.
---
I frequently see a misconception on this sub that *most* people raided or attained high ranks of PVP in the vanilla days. A *majority* of the population played pretty much like I did (based on the friends I had who were raiders, and the friends I had who just did random things). I had several hundred friends and my guild was quite large, although not a progression guild.
---
Most of the players in the game just goofed off, or farmed stuff the raiders wanted and then purchased from us. We'd do dungeon runs with lowbies and farm winterspring rep (although most of us didn't get exalted). We'd mess around in Tarren Mill, go after gankers in STV, and otherwise have fun with WPVP.
---
Occasionally, on the weekends, we'd all raid Org with hundreds of naked level 1 gnomes.
---
Dungeons were generally pretty easygoing, leveling took 5-6 months, and we had plenty of ret pallies and boomkins running with us, and some hybrid specs that were funny as hell.
---
We'd raid a bit, downing a beginning boss, and then wipe horribly and laugh and log off for the night.
---
We might run a BG or two, looking to get enough honor for some PVP blues, but that would be a several week endeavor, and we'd just have fun with it. We expected to lose, but won or racked up some amazingly funny anecdotes for later. 
---
This was the "average" WOW life back in the day - I had two epics, Boots of Avoidance (random world drop, sold it for mad bank) and Staff of Jordan (again, another world drop, kept it to "look cool"). And I was the "lucky" friend back in the day.
---
35 and dad of one 4 year girl. 
---
Im playing on ps at the moment, not even hard to mix in wow. My girl doesn't need me 100% of the time, most of the time when she is playing (with her toys) she does not want me to ruin her plays.. I believe that kids should figure out how to entertain themselfs, instead of be entertained 24/7 by their parents.  
---
When she needs something, i can just tell everyone to wait a two mins and sort out whatever she needs. Also there is the wife around.
---
Emergencies dont happen nearly often to be worried about dropping your dungeon group. 
---
For raiding i have two times 3 hour's a week to play in peace where the wife takes care of our daughter, plenty of time for semi HC raids. I always say that semi HC is better than casual for dads, sure prepping for raid takes longer, but the actual raids take closer to 1h than those 6 hours a casual run may take. On the other hand, when the wife is out of house in gym or something, then im not playing. But she knows that my raid times are on thursday and sunday evenings, so those two days she wont go out (without taking our kid with her).
---
Also, get a headset, but one that does not block outside noise.
---
I’m glad you have included “mom” in your post, yes I am a mother to two boys.  I played wow in 2005 when I was in university.  I have tried private server few months back,  it took me 3 months to level to lvl 40, could not buy a mount because I didn’t have the time to grind gold.  My gear sucked because I didn’t have 2 or 3 of uninterrupted hours to run dungeons.  
---
That being said I am still looking forward to classic wow.
---
I'm a mom. Played classic back in my early 20's and now I have 3 kids.  I think I am kinda lucky as my husband and I played WoW together back in the day and we plan to play Classic together too. My eldest is 9 and we plan to have him play with us. We tell our other kids once they know how to read, they can play too. 
---
We've played on some pservers to introduce the game to our eldest and let him explore the different classes. This way he won't get half way through leveling a character during classic and want to switch classes. We will have to take a casual approach to the game, but we want to be 60 within a reasonable amount of time.
---
Because honestly, it is hard to game with younger children about. My other 2 kids are 3 and 5, and they see you doing something (even if they should be sleeping) and they immediately want your attention on them. We play about 2-3 hours at night about 2 to 4 times a week once we have engaged "bed time mode" in our house - and some nights we are unable to really play because the youngest keeps getting out of his bed because he wants to watch us play - or eat - or get a hug - or got potty - or say i love you - or get a drink - or tell us he's cold - or tell us he's warm - or . . . . .
---
He's talking about the pendant in the souls borne aeries that players speculated did something. It did not.
---
.wmo models broke LOS, M2 models did not. 
---
I have to agree with you.  I have tried private sever, I just couldn’t even run a full dungeon, I didn’t have 3 or 4 dedicated hours for gaming
---
Different strokes.  
---
I prefer being able to interact with my children, which is why I'm not playing even if I'm logged in (and how many times I died just for being idle!)  
---
To me, personally, nothing is better than interacting with them, even when they make me angry with their antics.
---
It's not. I joined a pug ZG run often that had a tank who pulled all groups with dense dynamite. It's like 25-30yards range 
---
But thats is the reason why WoW was / is so popular. It is simple and the only thing you need is some social skills to be a part of something bigger like a guild a group for PvP farm.
---
The Problem with balance and Talents is that when some items bug or a talent scales way to much the game will brake in minutes. So when people pick those talents and blizz change them and the only way to respec is to level again most people will quit.
---
I mean leveling in WoW takes some time and even with leveling times like in Retail people would quit. 
---
There was never a better MMORPG then wow. Everquest was just to grindy and not really fun. DAoC was PvP only (mostly) and Warband vs warband. Lineage 2 was the pinnacle of grind and punishment. ESO was good story RPG with multiplayer. Guild wars was the Arena Shooter of the MMORPGs and so on and on (All from release versions of the game, i know that a lot got better in thoose)
---
WoW was just playable by everyone, if he only had 2 hours a day or if he was a FPS player i did not matter becouse it was just simple and fun.
---
Same could be said about streamers announcing where they roll...
---
PVE : Shamans only dps option in raids is as a nightfall buffer as enhance which has different gear than Healing. Priest has shadow. So both basically have one spot per raid. The reason Elemental is not raid viable is there is no class debuff for nature damage and they offer nothing as a buff that other specs can't.
---
PVP : Enhance, Elemental and Shadow are all very viable. They have different strengths but all classes do.  Shadow is kind of unique in that you are often better off healing in a group/ranking, but it's also one of the strongest 1v1 open world classes and 1 v 2 classes for that matter. Just avoid night elf if you like pvp. Cases can be made for the other races on priest.
---
The same as in Wetlands. All other races are tall enough to run around but a gnome is too small so when you hug the wall on the left on the way to the cenarius druid boss for the scepter quest, the gnome swims. 
---
I'm vegan.
---
I'm a father of two. I plan on leveling 1-2 hrs a few nights a week after the kids are sleeping. On the weekend I'll run a dungeon or two. I've found a casual guild with the motto to take it slow, explore, have fun etc. So there is no pressure to reach lvl 60 in a month. We plan on starting to raid 6 months after release, most should be 60 by then.
---
Another philospohy of the guild is to not worry too much about min/max, so I won't have to spend too much time (if any at all) farming consumables for raids.
---
We're EU alliance, gonna roll pve server. I would love more parents in the guild so please PM if you're interested!
---
Some RPGs like Dark Souls don't have dramatic scaling, but the side effect is that skilled players can beat the game at level 1 which wouldn't really work in an MMO.
---
out of curiosity I went back and watch some of the old videos I have saved. You can clearly see Curse using this strategy on their saphirrron kill. It's the one from Fura's point of view. This is significant because Fura was one of the first people to release kill videos back in the day. Lots of guilds that weren't attempting world-first would copy their strategies for killing bosses. The fact that is it is in his video pretty much guarantees that it would have been widespread knowledge (amongst serious raiders) at the time.
---
Here is a link to that video on YouTube: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=qkpP2GFhfyY
---
I'll be awaiting your apology...
---
I have 4 kids and I'll be out camping people left and right like I'm in highschool again, kids be damned (jk not actually damned, theyll probably climb on me and pull my beard like they do now)
---
being level 30 when the highest horde is 27 is so big because levels will be normally distributed, for ever 1 alliance at 30 there will be 5 at 29, 10 at 28, and 50+ at 27, so the best horde will need to compete vs slower alliance players when the mutifaction zones are being used.
---
  being ahead is such a massive difference even if 30-60 is slightly horde favored it doesn't matter.
---
very very very unpopular opinion and definetally wrong in my case!
---
That's mostly due to gear and lack of abilities. A group of 5 level 30s will be able to fight a 60. I fondly remember taking a Rank10 mage down in STV as a group of lvl 3x.
---
&gt;  is failing to collect a resource still a thing?
---
In retail? No, that was removed ages ago.
---
Yeah but the tidal charm is in arathi! 3s stun trinket was preeettyy goood!
---
&gt; Want to see raids and content? LFG raids are quick and easy, you get all the story, some lower quality purples, and nobody cares if you have to leave in the middle.
---
You do know that a majority of the players in Vanilla never managed to raid? The game was far from limited. There were so many things to do, even after a long leveling period, that I never even thought about raiding until AQ opened. 
---
And I (and the people I knew) had *plenty* of content to keep us busy.
---
Is it really?? That’s Halarious, when did grieving become an offence? Pretty sure you okay a game with two teams you need to expect danger from the other team
---
Naw that spec misses a few great talents for leveling(even as resto). Try to aim for this around 40: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hZV0bZx0etV0o I like early Imp Ghost Wolf because you'll be using that spell often between 20-40. I'd put enough points into Enh to get 2/2 at lvl 20. You'll also want the hit % talent. 
---
He will be on a PvE server he’s not retarded
---
Your alt would need to be lvl 50 to be able to enter Scholo/BWL, does he not? Genuinely interested, dont want to be pedantic.
---
Don't forget how thick the manual was.
---
Hand her a tablet with YouTube or Netflix kids and you can go raiding as long as you like. You just need to make sure to pick her up from the place where she fell asleep while watching. Just make sure your wife isn't home.
---
Source: 6 and 3 year old. ;) 
---
It probably won't. But a new one should be created rather soon. 
---
Although whatever it will be right at launch or some time later, depends on whatever beta will exist.
---
Still I image that during the leveling period after launch, there won't be any/many addons at all.
---
How does it impact you ?
---
If just seeing a group of players running around makes you mad it’s possible you’re the sperg.
---
Okey, I didn't think it that way. Thanks for your explained answer.
---
People desperately want to be angry. And let's be real, we all rose colored glasses for the community back then. The forums were as much of a shit show then and they are now, if not worse.
---
Not really, they dont whine about you. They are just playing regulary, they dont encourage ppl to Swarm them.
---
warlocks do not suck in pve or pvp early, but yes they do scale great.
---
if curse of elements, curse of shadows and curse of recklessness awarded the warlock the damage back for his own spell nobody would say this.
---
It's not the streamers. It's the people who live vicariously through them and who need to realize they have a life and can play a game, make friends and have fun on their own. That will never happen though as twitch chat and it's fake community is their life and those people are better off in modern WoW anyways, where they can listen to the streamer while they queue and partake in minigames and dailies that you repeat like a zombie.
---
The problem will take care of itself eventually. The zombies will be rude to people and get blacklisted and never get invited to dungeons, get kicked out of guilds and there is a delay on BG's. Smartest decision Blizzard ever made. The toxic community will simply quit because they will have nothing to do/solo queue for.
---
The reason there’s no guide is there is zero reason to do it
---
I started playing when I was 21 (2005), and played retail for a major part of last 14 years. I took breaks over this time, with longest one being 2 years between WoD and Legion. Came back late Legion, unsubbed last October, since BfA.. Well, let's not go there.
---
I'm definitely coming back for Classic. Most of the problems you describe are not really relevant for me, since I always play with headset and usually after kid and wife went to sleep. I'm a night owl though, so it's pretty common for me to go to bed at around 3am or even later. I'll mostly be playing for BGs and WPvP, haven't made up my mind about raiding yet. On one hand it'd be cool to relive that experience again, but on the other one - it's probably my one of my least favourite parts of Vanilla. Now, if sometimes in the future Blizz would add TBC servers - that'll be something completely different.
---
You no take candle!

In Diablo2 not you got cool abilities by some rune worded gear. Enigma chest giving teleports to all classes, Beast (I think it was) for your trusty merc. [https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Runewords](https://diablo2.diablowiki.net/Runewords)
---
Even in WoW there are a select few items such as Green Whelp Armor giving you a chance on sleeping the enemy upon being hit by him.
---
Stuff like this couldve been made for caster items/weapons.
---
Honestly I’m debating on running a prot orc warrior or a undead mage 
---
I had the idea recently to see if some of my old guildlies and friends wanted to get back into Classic and treat it like we would a D&amp;D campaign. None of us have the time we had back then so we could schedule sessions where we only play these characters together and explore and battle through Azeroth together. 
---
I haven't gotten the group together yet but I think it's a pretty neat idea as an approach to playing Classic while having more IRL responsibilities.
---
fun is subjective and some people really enjoy min maxing. stop telling people how to have fun.
---
Leveling takes too long and is tedious as hell
---
To be fair, the chat community doesent have to be fake. Have you ever been part in one? Pretty bold statements in this post
---
&gt;will have two by the time classic comes
---
/grats !!
---
We know what you're trying to say. It just doesn't matter.
---
Didn’t you also have to individually mine each ore, now it opens up in 1 loot box?
---
learn to totem twist (it's easy) and scoop loot quick as shaman. you can essentially play ele and resto at the same time in pvp and it's glorious 
---
&gt; They had no problem merging in the past.
---
Merging two entirely different server communities together would be infinitely more disruptive to a classic community than simply sharding the early zones and then winding up with a reasonable server population once half the players quit by 30. You aren't thinking this through.
---
As a dad of three myself and working 5 days of the week will leave me with around 8 hours a week to play if I am lucky. So I will enjoy a slow leveling experience and hopefully find a nice friendly casual guild to be social with. Pvp raids and instance runs will be off the table realistically.
---
horde: shaman , alliance: priest
---
Alliance doesnt have shamans so they need more aoe healing becouse paladins r singletarget, horde is the opposite they dont need so many priests becouse shamans r great at aoe and totems r amazing, 8 shamans in raid no problem, 8 priest not happening :)
---
If someone higher level than what I’m playing, but lower level than my main, kills me I’ll happily go full sperg mode and corpse camp them for hours until they spirit ress or log out.
---
Yeah you are right. BRD was the best one. Up to the Barman/Plugger area and reset. As undead you could also solo the boss that could drop the fiery enchant by cannibalizing the one mob. Could do it with other races when geared. I can't remember how resets worked back then though. I vaguely remember that at one point I had to invite someone and then enter and then they would leave the group. It was so long ago. Who knows if that will all be the same with resets per hour or if we can just right click and reset like in modern WoW. In Naxx there was also a really good gold making trick but I don't know if they will repeat that. It was kind of absurd and they might consider it breaking the economy.
---
I can agree on this.. Have one in our guild and he is killing it.. but two would be too much
---
shaman is the single class that i believe orc isn't clearly the best race for.
---
the stun works with shaman's kit very, very well.
---
Gnome the other other white meat! We are undead after all, and we love brains!
---
That hole in the ground between the graveyard in Searing Gorge and Blackrock Mountain.
---
lol.. hotfix going live today.. that debuff reduced by 20% duration and da voodoo shuffle no longer works on it.

34inch 1440 120hz ultrawide changed my wow life lol

Streamers ruin the server. You want to avoid these servers unless you’re one of the no lifers that will just follow him around with the other 100 idiots that will be constantly following them around. 
---
If Classic can achieve the same level of quality as the private servers have, I would be pleased. I just don't think they will, judging by what they've said and the Classic Demo.
---
This is not your personal blog
---
The large streamers community is completely fake. It's memes scrolling by at a 100 miles a hour. Again I am not attacking the streamers and it's not their fault they got big. They also have to make the money while they can. Twitch could dry up at any time and streams rise and fall all the time.
---
I've played a warrior forever on retail. So I want to continue the trend but are there too many? 
---
Then why are you going out of your way to say things that are so wrong?  
---
Ha, I actually love that
---
Dad giving you 'the talk' there.
---
Thank you for your consideration with the dungeons. The amount of times I’ve had to wait in a group because the tank/dps (I heal) had to put their kid to bed or feed them or whatnot is overwhelming. The consideration for others is appreciated in our time (:
---
The problem is if they use it for this they will say in a year we'll the AQ gates will be very busy so we need to share them
---
I know about naxx. I think it was 5 resets per hour
---
I was going to start out as mage but decided on warlock.
---
mages have great quality of life spells like conjuring and teleporting. they are also S-tier in pvp/pve for the entirety of the game.
---
i ended up chosing warlock for a few reasons. aesthetic, more interesting spell interactions i.e. controlling fear with curse of recklessness, PvE gear works great as PvP gear compared to mage who would prefer to rank which is terrible to do, more specs as warlock that are powerful and interesting, SM Ruin is good everywhere
---
I look forward to juggle my son turning 10 months this summer, his 2 years old sister and my 15 years old vanilla character reborn. So many kids in the house and I thought we were going to stop at two.. 
---
The drums of war thunder once again! 
---
I hated faking sick to stay home from school on Tuesdays, just to remember it was a Tuesday and the servers were down until school was over anyway. 
---
MMORPG's can be more refined and accessible without going all the way into extreme levels of simplicity and themepark elements like WoW did, there is a middle ground to be found somewhere inbetween.
---
It is not too much to demand that people specialise their own characters and work their way into other roles in my opinion, it simply adds mode value as uniqueness. There is no need for hand-holding that guarantees that nobody makes mistakes like Blizzard has designed their games more and more. WoW is a bit too simplistic in my opinion and that is my lasting impression since beta, but good enough to enjoy at least up to Wrath after which it went too far to be playable or fun anymore.
---
I loved some parts of the character systems in SWG for example which allowed flexibility but demanded effort to change, a game far from perfect no less but with superior elements in some areas for sure, not to mention the sandbox.
---
As a whole I might agree that WoW may be the best "overall" MMORPG in its more classic stages, but it is not perfect and it could afford to add a lot of RPG and sandbox elements to improve remarkably.
---
Western weeb
---
The investmant/reward ratio for Professions isn't as good as it is in BC and even Wrath. It's really hard to make solid money with most professions, and you're better off learning to game the AH.
---
..or my next point, you could just make a hunter and farm DM. I've heard part of what makes the DM farming as profitable as it is, is an abuse of the mangos system, that makes the farm possible, such as maybe wall jumping? Either way, if the best way to get money is to separate yourself from the world and grind in a single player game, that's annoying. 
---
Also op, i agree about how impossible it is to get a spellcast off on a ?? is obnoxious. Although it is so satisfying being a 20's rogue and getting saps off on level 60s coming after me, it works almost every time.
---
The only times I'd gank people (and you "real" gankers probably wouldn't even consider it ganking) is when people have been doing the "standing-around-while-I'm-fighting-a-mob-only-to-come-in-when-I'm-low-and-kill-me" - then I'm happy to return the favour, and sometimes even camping them a bit. Or when we're fighting about valuable nodes.
---
Otherwise I try to stick to "honorable" world PVP - I'd happily attack someone if they are running by and have above half health, especially while leveling, as it's a nice break from the constant farming. 
---
until you come across a warlock with a VW out and he sacrifices it right away so you can't generate rage
---
Dad here, interested in classic but might just stick on Private server scene at first to see how it plays out.  Definitely love WOW though.
---
Regarding speakers- I play headphones but leave one headphone completely off my ear.  It still allows me to hear in-game audio and my voice comms with friends but also keeps an ear open to teh rest of the house.  Kind of a happy medium between getting what you need from game audio while still being available and not distracting the environment around you. 
---
Oh man, and once in the slag pits you might as well afk and hope for a ress...
---
I’m what you call a graveyard dad. I work 10 hours a night 6 nights a week. I never see people because of the nature of my job so I’m looking forward to classic helping with loneliness 
---
as someone playing orc warlock, rogues are scary as destruction.
---
nobody is scary as SL
---
I dont remember, ive gone with Herbalism for years instead of Mining. 
---
I really loved playing a Cleric in EQ, so I naturally chose Priest for WoW. 
---
Ironically, I really don't enjoy the healing roll that much these days . . .
---
Dad of 3. You just have to do it whenever they are asleep. My kids will watch me here and there, and play dress up with armors but that is about it,
---
I really hope that addons like Questie won't work. Addons like Aux are extremely useful though and I can't imagine using the AH without it. Maybe I should prepare for release by learning to code haha.
---
There will more than likely be server restrictions for just china -I’m a china expat too, been playing via a ShadowSocksR proxy/vpn/“thing” (search up wannaflix) on a private server for awhile now, getting 300ish ping to that server from the south china coast. I’ve heard the higher ping makes playing melee more difficult, but I havent really noticed it myself. The biggest thing really is having to accommodate to NA/EU times if you wanna raid, which usually involves just waking up really early to play on an off day.
---
Personally, although I’m fluent in chinese now I find playing in it very jarring, since item and mob names are completely different and all that, which you’d all have to relearn if you wanted to play the game on chinese servers.
---
Indeed, things got significantly less crowded for me as I got past Fargodeep mine in Elwynn during the original launch (IIRC). People talking about this tech expanding into Westfall and The Barrens, I don't think it will be necessary. This clumping up of players isn't going to be as bad as some expansion launches (TBC, Hellfire Peninsula). We'll already be split by racial starting areas. A high concentration will of course be in Durotar and Elwynn, but people will split off early and often. I personally took some time off from the human zones to go quest in Loch Modan.
---
Shaman to play (WF-procs) and paladin (so many great buffs) in group. Too bad I can't have them both at the same time :( 
---
I honestly don't know where people got the impression that sharding would extend to the Barrens/Westfall and similar zones. The statement from Ion is *very* conservative only mentioning Northshire and The Valley of Honor. 
---
As someone who's completed every soulsborne game and rlc how has this eluded me?? How was it disproven?
---
Your liberal over use of quotation marks is confusing... I think you sometimes are using it as quotes, and sometimes for emphasis. For emphasis use *s in stead. 
---
Personally, I prefer to be on a server where Horde and Alliance populations are as even as possible. I think a popular streamer will result in his faction being overpopulated on the server.
---
Have 1~2 mains and then twink the rest (19 or 29). It'll be sufficient to meet your needs and won't take too much time.
---
Their communities are raging morons that hate women and spew the n-word at any possibility they can to be "le  edgy."
---
Haha I ended up macroing my username and pw to one of the g keys on my keyboard. I'd load the game. Hit g1. It would type it all in and push enter.
---
Sharding is the easy least intrusive way out.  Yeah lets just do something more complicated and complex that will be less beneficial.  Dynamic respawns would be so much worse than sharding it's hard to even fathom that you think it's a good idea.
---
You can just play at a slower pace, Vanilla's not a race, but the progression you get does feel meaningful, even if it's only hitting 40. As a parent, sure I found BFA convenient but really unsatisfying. I want RPG and social elements in my mmo, not random welfare purples that feel less significant than greens in vanilla.
---
I like vanilla ice cream 40% more than chocolate ice cream. However if they added vanilla to the chocolate ice cream I would like it 80% compared to vanilla ice cream. However if it wasn't a dark rich chocolate but rather a cheap milky one, I would only like it 69% compared to vanilla ice cream. 
---
If the above sentences makes any sense in your head, then I would question your critical thinking.
---
Anyways, I completely agree with him and I am 110% excited for Classic too!
---
Or they could have done it, but just added a few extra abilities and not worry too much about balance. That way there won't really be a "correct combination".
---
Ragnarok online has several combinations of classes gained by advancing and such, and it works very well. 
---
I think my approach will be to play in the evenings after bedtime. I think I’m going to try to focus on questing, rep grinding and trying to acquire as many formulas/recipes for Enchanting/Alchemy. I think most of this I could do on my own time but I may need to run some dungeons in the evenings for certain factions rep. 
---
You do realise every1 will just find the"best spec" and lvl with it like following a guide removing 99% of the variability while leveling?
---
* hammerfall
---
A guildie of mine turned off the profanity filter then complained when his kids saw swear words in chat. What a moron. 
---
Less beneficial, fuck me you're dumb. Bye retard, enjoy you're sharding, fucking retail babies.
---
But ut would not help to achieve what Blizzard had in mind. Making a MMORPG that is easy to get in and can be played by everyone.
---
It would really damage the game with heavy RPG elements. I mean i never looked for such features but is there no alternative for you then WoW?
---
because retail is shaded af
---
I'm just a little pregnant.  I'm just a little dead.
---
Dynamic spawns have far more problems. They wreck the economy, and they make some quests near impossible for a solo or small group due to respawn speeds. Sharding in beginner areas solves these issues with a minimum of problem. It's not ideal, but as long as it is gone by the level 20+ zones it is fine. At that point people spread in a number of directions and there is space enough for those who got there first to all have room to level.
---
I am pretty sure bloodvine goggles come out after BWL Mish'undare, together with the other bloodvine piece in ZG.
---
Dynamic respawns literally breaks the game.  Sharding just allows a larger population of people in the same server at higher levels.  Hmm I wonder which is worse.
---
Same here! I would be looking for a late night casual raiding guild so I can raid after the family goes to bed. We will see how long that lasts before I turn into a zombie, but then again I'm already used to lack of sleep from having the kiddo!
---
Miyazaki said it did nothing.
---
Just go look up on youtube, or the fact in Ds3 one of the ash's you collect (The dreamchaser's ashes) is clutching a pendant, and the shrine maiden basically tells you in a unique dialogue "Yeah this idiot never stopped trying, looking for nothing"
---
Mail wasn’t instant in vanilla either. 
---
I am quite fine with this if by “starting areas” he means temporary sharding in Northshire Abbey or Valley of Trials. But not if he means Elwynn Forest and Durotar.
---
A priest with maxed out spirit and an up-to-date wand is about one of the fastest levellers out there.
---
Only beaten by Hunters, Mages and maybe Ferals. 
---
"Hey guys we might want to worry about this, as it seems like we have a negative trend of things"

One good thing happens

"HAHA FUCK YOU FOR BEING SO NEGATIVE!!!"
---
Our top raid healer had to drive his wife to the hospital because she started contractions during Lady Deathwhisper. She insisted on finishing the boss before they went...
---
God I loved those folks
---
I mean this quote doesn't even talk about "zone sharding" but in fact sub-zone sharding. Like what they did at Legion launch with Dalaran. They didn't shard Deadwind pass (where Dalaran was for the launch event), they sharded Dalaran floating above it. They can break it down to only shard Northshire Abbey, which is what Ion is referencing here. 
---
Dad here. 2 kids. Try a headset with just 1 ear speaker. Personally the wife lets me set aside 2 nights a week for raiding. All other nights family stuff comes first.  Ive been toying around with the idea of going pve server instead of pvp just because of the constant need to afk while out in the world. No interest in getting afk ganked repeatedly.
---
If you are running dungeons with your mates i think its totally reasonable to afk. I roll with some more mature gaming communitites in other games and family afks are the norm.
---
Its the Valentines event I think.
---
When I was playing on pservers recently, I would set up a make shift cot behind my desk in the office and have bottles ready to go.   It was incredibly difficult for me to raid with young ones though.  I had to shape my entire day around it.  If you do not have the dedication, do not roll melee unless your in a casual guild.    
---
I also tend to avoid any group stuff during the day.  It's gonna be great when they're old enough to fish and pick herbs.  
---
I love wizards in fantasy. They are so mysterious and cool. I loved playing the Archmage in warcraft3. The human mage fighting the infernals was also cool in the trailer. So I made a human mage with black hair. If there was a demon hunter class in vanilla, I would've picked that probably.
---
I am in my 30s, have two kids, and currently play retail and have since early beta. I plan to play Classic along side retail, so I would assume that my play times will remain identical to what they are now, and I will split time between the two games.
---
In retail, I raid two nights a week for three hours, and it works out perfectly for my family situation. I don't know what I'll do for the raiding piece of Classic yet, but I think I'm just going to roll with things and see how they go. It's really all you can do to not break what works.
---
I'm very much looking forward to Classic, while still enjoying retail for what it is.
---
Some things will probably change just because of the engine. As I'm not playing a mage I'm perfectly fine with them fixing the walljumping or /camping in DM.
---
28 y/o married dad reporting in. I’ll def be there for classic. 
---
Ya I never understood how merges and all that were a better solution to having a cohesive community with a specific identity. Every time you have to merge you are taking a sledgehammer to that server's community, and replacing it with a new one generated by the two-three servers being merged. I'm on Maelstrom-Lightnininghoof-VentureCo on live, and I certainly don't feel like my original server community was saved by that merger.
---
Got two little fellas running around the house, and sure do plan on playing Classic !  
---
I sincerely think that the unavoidable restriction children put on your free time can be heavily mitigated by being in a healthy relationship with an understanding lover. Even though I am a father of two, and work 40 hours a week, I still manage to find the time to currently raid 3x a week on FFXIV and play many other games, without sacrificing an inch on my parental duties. The secret is in the relationship with your wife/husband. My girlfriend knows gaming, for me, is more than a hobby but a true passion. She understands that raiding brings me a lot of joy. So, when we finish putting the kids to sleep and my raid starts, she volonteers to take care of the children whenever one of them wakes up while I'm busy raiding. And then I repay her back on other evenings whenever she, in turn, has activities planned out.  
---
Basically, my gaming "me time" is always happening whenever my kids are either asleep for the night, or out of the house for X reasons. But those two scenarios occur often enough for me to get some reliable gaming time on a weekly basis. And I'm talking, probably 20-25 hours a week (I get a daily 3 hours every week evening and usually a scattered 8-10 hours on saturday-sunday).  
---
Get your ass in a relationship with an understanding and caring person. Best way to combine family and gaming time in an healthy manner.
---
You’ll go postal?
---
Hi,
---
really undecided what i should play. I played a Pala Ret back then and really liked it but never got the chance to raid but got to PvP rank 9. I really want to Raid this time but i do not want to heal in a stupid dress!
---
I played also a dwarf Hunter for mainly AV and had really fun playing him. 
---
Now the big question, Hunter or Ret Pala?
---
I heard that pala ret is mostly a meme specc and with p server more then ever.
---
It doesn't break the game if done correctly as a factor of population per zone. Particularly if It stops at a certain point.
---
It is legitimately the best solution, but it's more work so it'll be ignored.
---
I mean their warriors are still on same dps as the rest of the server.
---
We don't care about speed because we are taking our time and smelling the roses, but lets say that the average "WoW Dad" has 2 hours a week to play. World record leveling to 60 in classic is somewhere around 4 days 20 hours and I have heard on average it is more like 30 days play time. Lets say for some reason the hypothetical leveler is able to do it in 5 days or 120 hours. At two hours a week it is going to take at minimum 60 weeks to level a character, more than a year. Many folks are not going to be happy with this glacial progression no matter what they say now.
---
On the other hand in retail there are so many bonuses to leveling I have seen videos of folks go from level 1-100 in TWO HOURS. My point is that if you want to see the most of the game, have the most content available to you, and have more like minded folks playing along side you, RETAIL WOW already has your ideal setup. 
---
Coming into classic with limited play time, the OP complains that he is not going to get to do dungeons because he will have too many interruptions, can't do raids because of the long time commitment and cant farm materials, which leaves us with leveling. 
---
Why would you want to play the oldest and most primitive quests? Do you like mindless grinding for 20 boar stomachs that don't drop? So many quests were vastly improved in the later retail version of the game. There are so many more stories in TBC, WotLK, Cata, Panadas, etc. Sure the classic story is good, but are you still going to be trilled to level up a new character through the same content again and again forever? 
---
What is a compelling argument for playing classic when they have literally made an ideal solution for you in retail?  
---
The reason that I, also someone who is short on time and heavy on commitments, am going to play classic is that I am looking for elements of an MMO that are not included anymore, frustration, grinding, farming materials, and a focus on the hardcore player, all the things that MMOs have moved away from to keep casuals engaged and paying.  
---
If you don't have the time, play the game that they made for you, if you do have the time, or truly don't mind the grind, then play classic. But please don't come back and complain that classic is "too hard" or "too much of a time sink" when there were better options that you would have had more fun playing. 
---
Wow all streamer communities huh
---
Ye rogues really lack that cc dont they
---
FYI, it changed with WoLK
---
Rockbiter is static threat added to every attack. They also don't have a threat multiplier like def stance or bear form.
---
Just based on that, I don't think shamans scale as hard as a druid when it comes to threat. Especially a druid with crowd pummelers.
---
I avoid PvP if possible (though I have no problem with it and would never roll a pve server).
---
Can usually escape being camped because people are dumb and easy to juke.
---
It does, but as a warlock I will forego the Mish for tear and Bloodvine instead. Especially since T2,5 comes right after and is arguably better than Mish for warlocks, but not for mages. They carry that ugly pope hat into Naxx.
---
&gt; I play with my speakers instead of headphones because I find my headset tends to cut me off too much from my family, isolating me in a little zone where they can't talk to me. 
---
Are you aware of open-back headphones? My wife and I are still working at the child part, but open-back headphones makes hearing/talking to people around you a lot easier. 
---
here are a couple of cheap examples if you'd be interested in trying them out [first](https://www.amazon.com/Superlux-681-Dynamic-Semi-Open-Headphones/dp/B002GHIPYI/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=Superlux+HD681&amp;qid=1550761227&amp;s=gateway&amp;sr=8-3) and [second](https://www.amazon.com/Superlux-HD681EVO-HD-681-EVO-Black/dp/B00CAG1ZAQ)
---
Are there guilds that don't have a 'Dad Belter' rank? 
---
One of them is really slow, one is not. I can't remember which though.
---
If it's per zone and most of the people are over here farming raptors and I want to clear my way through this cave or other area to loot a chest or get an quest item where nobody else is, the task will literally be impossible as I'll be getting respawned on.  Dynamic respawns really breaks the pacing of the game and it's impossible to get right.  Also in areas where there is quest mob competition it reduces the need to party up and work together with other players on your server.
---
Sharding has its own issues but it really seems like the lesser evil here.
---
This guy fucks
---
There’s a pretty in-depth guide here: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lBUm58le8UU
---
However he does not think the talent order is particularly important, except that you want Restorative Totems and Mana Tide Totem as soon as possible.
---
I have been ganked on privates. It's the thing I'm looking for most in Classic vs. private: Well-populated PVE-servers. I like to quest and play the game. Being killed with zero chance to do something about it and having to corpse-run is simply not fun. If someone my level attacks me and it's done "faily" and not repeatedly that's OK. While I won't attack first if I have a fighting chance I will fight. Ganking, though - no thanks.
---
Call me a wallflower, but it's more fun for me to make a positive difference in someone's experience than being the reason they have a bad time. It's so much more fun to see a "red" player react nervously when I charge in, only to help them kill their prey (if I see them struggling). 
---
Faction pride is often bunk anyway. Most people I know choose a faction in a semi-random way for silly reason like optics or emotes or ambient music in faction areas. After all, we're all players trying to have fun.
---
Sounds like fun
---
Stuff that comes from animal fur and causes allergic reactions.
---
I think it was fun the first few times, but got stale rather quick. I think there was a lot more to love in the other raid dungeons.
---
I bought wow the day it released,
---
I ran TONS of SM leveling up, my group of friends and I would spend entire days running cath because we all wanted the hat.  A Shaman tank (level 40 or above so they had mail) was actually better at holding threat by far then warriors.
---
I also had a shaman tank my LBRS run for my warlords command quest in vanilla, as well as DM:W  (Prince hit him like a truck though).
---
Can be done, once you start getting decent gear on a warrior though the damage reduction difference is very very noticeable. 
---
&gt;First off, the demo is kind of a special case, because it's not an organic world where everyone is spread out. It's literally every single character using a template, being created at the exact same point in the world, in The Barrens or Westfall.
---
&gt;We leverage that tech to make the demo experience run more smoothly.
---
This makes be believe that if there is to even be sharding in Classic, it will be only for the initial starting area, not even the whole zone.
---
With my total lack of trust in Blizzard as a whole, I'm trying to shape my expectations to there being a potential for sharding in these 8 initial starting areas, but the larger zone like durotar, won't have it.
---
Sharding starting zones essentially allows for and guarantees less servers total each with a higher long term population.  Lets be real and admit that a lot of people won't make it to 60, if we want people to play with at the end game we need to cram these servers full of level 1 characters at the start and sharding those zones is the best way to make that happen.
---
That's not what I said at all.
---
Reminder that all CC lasted for the full PvE duration in PvP. As long as sap lasts, it's not a 60 second Polymorph.
---
Having fun in video games in 2019 xD
---
LOL never even thought about this til now.
---
All your abilities would be resisted. 
---
Press X to doubt.
---
HOOAGH
---
Sap
---
I'm fine with sharding for the first month or so until the contested zones.  If pvp is going to happen sharding can not.
---
Was on the German PvE Server Rexxar.
---
For the horde! 
---
[Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19289) is the classic version of the damage trinket.
---
Cc in vanilla didnt last the max duration in pvp, it was based on a heartbeat system where it had a higher chance to break every 2 sec. So the chance a poly or sap lasted the full duration was very low. Also sap and poly both last 50 seconds at max rank
---
Basically just looking to do a lot of world PvP. I will usually be doing solo world PvP but sometimes playing with my brother / friends whenever they end up hitting 60. Right now thinking Rogue, Mage, or Warlock because I've played a Hunter before and want to play a dps class for raiding to gear for world PvP. Any suggestions for solo world PvP / ganking lowbies / invading cities etc.?
---
As someone who watches twitch and has played video games, including WoW, for 17 years - Yes. I'm not saying every individual gamer or community member is a sexist, racist, xenophobe, but a hell of a lot of them are. If not for Twitch TOS every single popular streamer's stream would just be idiots spamming the N word. They already try to even when they know they get banned. It's simply a fact and anyone who watches Twitch knows this. Unless they're one of the "Well, I don't see what's so bad about saying the N-word anyway" people who, invariably, are also one of the people who makes accounts to spam the N-word. If you want to use the downvote as a "disagree" button then feel free.
---
But that does not change that fact that a large portion, maybe even a plurality or majority, of the gaming community are keyboard warriors who feel entitled to ruin other people's gaming experience because behind a computer screen is the only place they get to say their forbidden word without getting punched in the face. 
---
Now, do I think that the puritan SJWs are any better? Well, firstly, at least the majority are just normal people who want to see less bigotry in their online forums and those SJWs are at least coming from the right place. But there definitely are raging SJWs who are vitriolic and trying to push their bubbled existence on gamers, which is childish. I definitely understand the appeal of creating a community where you can say whatever you want, but freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence. And I think there should still be consequences even in the most free of speech communities. One of those consequences is that people who want to be hateful, from either side, should be silenced. Yet, that isn't what streamer communities want. They want full uninhibited capacity to yell their favorite word on every stream chat and every game chat and it is annoying as fuck. 
---
ah cool. ty!
---
Plus that server has dynamic respawns enabled in that zone so they were able to camp specific spawn locations of mobs and items.
---
Man did I not type beta in large enough letters or what?
---
I am familiar with all of the things you're talking about but they weren't implemented in the beta.
---
If you could put Joana’s brain into a 2006 Dwarf Hunter with modern knowledge, the old world record would get beaten pretty bad
---
RIP. Same, lol.
---
The reason to shard the starting area is antithetical to the AQ gates.  You shard starting zones to get higher population servers.  You don't need to shard AQ gates because there is no mob competition.
---
He's rekt you already then by going pve.
---
There can't really be too many. They're pretty much the only tank in the game and the best dps for the majority of the raids. There's a lot of warriors, but a lot are needed. 
---
Frostbolt is 30 yard range according to classicdb, which would be 36 with talents. Fireball is 35 yards, and 42 with talents. Not that you'd be using fireball to get a mounted warrior into combat.
---
the mentality that will carry over from live
---
How many servers do you think we'll end up with total?
---
Username does not check out.
---
We were warrior, rogue, hunter, shaman and one other. 4 of these classes dont suffer from being underleveled. The rogue just used his cheap + kidney repetoire, the warrior (me) had WW axe with windfury from the shaman, the hunter was just pewpewing and the shaman was healing us. The mage had rocket helm and blue PvP shoulders, so he certainly was no PvP full noob. 
---
Granted, we had a nigh perfect group composition to take down the ganking 60, but we did it. We were all lvl 30-34.
---
I was wondering the same thing
---
"Would you like to know more"  Yes...
---
Especially if he gets help with taming Lupos immediately lol. It would actually destroy the record.
---
Yeah, I'm with you.  I loved how many people were outside WSG portal dueling.. it was really a good way to stay fresh while in queue.
---
You really need to chill out with the name calling. 
---
It is less beneficial, at least in every single way private servers have done it. 
---
Stop being so incredibly sensitive and add something of value next time. How is dynamic spawns better? Contribute to the conversation or be quiet. You're embarassing yourself by being such an ass.
---
I play current WoW with plans to play Classic when it launches, and as a dad of 2 elementary aged kids I can empathize with all your concerns.  My goals with gaming have certainly changed since I played in Vanilla during my college days.  I know I will not be able to devote the time to classic raiding so there's no rush to level.  Thus my approach will be to immerse myself in the lore of each zone, read the quest texts and otherwise just explore the vast world.
---
As for time, I've found I can usually give 2-3 hours of uninterrupted gaming most evenings once they're in bed, so my current plan is to just see what I can accomplish with Classic during that time.  I plan to play a healer as it's my favorite role in MMOs, and it comes with the added benefit that I can more easily find a group to run a dungeon or 2 during any given evening without 30-60 minutes of searching, which would waste my ever-so-limited gaming time.
---
For voice comms once thing I've found that works very well is a headset with a single earpiece and microphone.  Mine came with an old VOIP phone (looks similar to [this](https://i.ebayimg.com/images/g/oeMAAOSwJtdaJoyE/s-l640.jpg)), but anything similar would function just as well.  I only have my voice comms app (discord/steam/TS/whatever) come through that single speaker, while all other game and PC sounds go through my regular speakers.  I can't tell you how much I enjoy this setup.  Voices can be turned down quiet because they're right in my ear and I still have full awareness of the kids.  My PC setup is in the living room where my wife watches TV or reads in the evenings, and this lets me feel like I'm connected to her as well as the game.
---
Hope this perspective helps, and maybe we'll run across each other in game!
---
Polymorph was added the same patch they added diminishing returns
---
Wmo models are wow map models. These are model files that are composed of an interior and may also have m2s or other wmos in them. For example, Stormwind City is a wmo. Goldshire Inn is a wmo.
---
M2 files are generic wow era model files. They are used for everything else. The player character is an M2. Illidan is an M2. Elwynn trees are m2s. Campfires are m2s. 
---
Based on fresh private servers races to 60, alliance is fastest by quite a margin. 
---
Joana said he picked horde just because, cos historically he was more familiar with horde quests, not like he researched what is fastests. back in the day there werent much competition at all on his level.
---
take it easy. for the most part.
---
since I can't promise I'll be able to stay online for several hours and since I probably won't adjust my rl schedule to fit my wow times I wont raid much if at all.  
---
and that not a problem for me.
---
I will focus on the stuff that is fun to me and ignore all the chores.  
---
I'll probably be queing with an undergeared mage (possibly rogue or priest) for BG most of the times.  
---
Watch out, it's [froggencoppin](https://i.imgur.com/OuMQwM9.jpg)
---
How can this be?  You have the option to turn off pvp...
---
If you are corpse camped you have done something you should blame yourself for (e.g. attack someone when they were fighting mobs or had low hp). Nobody just starts corpse camping a random person for no reason. You could be in some kill-on-sight list for something you did months ago and only now get punished for it. So avoid doing things to end up in people's KoS lists.
---
For someone that doesn't use Twitch, what would be the best way for me to figure out which server they'll be on?
---
You started the personal attacks when you called me lazy. Not everyone who plays wow even knows what BIS means. Some people just play for fun and don't care about progression. If we are in a dungeon and a wand drops and it is better than my current wand I an rolling on it. Pretty simple stuff yet here we are.
---
I find it less responsive.
---
I'm not sure the actual movement is slower, its just the animation that turns the character FEELS less responsive, because the character doesn't just swap vectors with minimal animation- the torso turns slower and so it just feels OFF.
---
Not a super big deal though, but it for sure feels offputting from a personal point of view.
---
Xd
---
If any of your are interested we have a horde NA guild, Working Adults. Check out our subreddit, r/workingadults. All of us have varying degrees of end game raid experience and competitive pvp experience.We will be raiding twice a week max 3 hours per raid night, organized pvp, leveling etc. Laid back atmosphere but completing content. First raid group is almost filled out but if some ppl can’t make it for raid because of life, we will just sub people as needed. 
---
Looking forward to hearing from you all.
---
We also have a discord server up usually about 25-40 ppl on a night, come check us out!
---
I have no issue with gankers and world PVP, even if I have gotten ganked by 5 different players within an hour. Part of the fun is in the world being dangerous. That being said, I don't agree with corpse camping. If someone kills me, runs around the map and then stumbles onto me again, I consider that fair play.
---
Thanks for your answer.
---
What do you think about NE and Human 1-30 leveling also? Is Dwarf the fastest alliance race?
---
All these popular streamers will be forced onto PVE servers.  I don't care how big their following is, if they were on a PVP server they would never get anywhere. People would make entire guilds to gank and camp these guys. It just wouldn't work in classic. Plus yes they might have many followers but with the followers giving them (the streamer) all the mobs and such for quest how would they keep up with staying the streamers level ? He would leave them all behind and thus be ganked into oblivion 
---
ok.
---
I care
---
This chimes with me on so many levels, father of two here. I'm currently messing around on ND pserver so send me a whisper sometime (Darkrevolt or Zerroric).
---
Would be keen on forming some kind of community/guild in classic release too!
---
Cheers.

For me it always was that they never did PvP right. I was always a fan of the Warcraft Universe since I played WC2 as a child. It was always disappointing, that PvP was some side thing they tried to keep out of the main thing (PvE). Not only that but the gear appearance. I find it very uncool that top end gear (tier sets) looked the same for both factions.
---
This was not as advertised. If you look at the first WoW trailer it clearly emphasizes the faction conflict. And at first this was also the case. In the early days of Vanilla people would gather for open PvP, fight for the dominance over a region or even do huge city raids.
---
First the introduction of BGs looked fun, until I realized what it meant. A sanitized instanced ("World" of Warcraft my ass!) PvP experience, that had no tension and no impact on the World itself. Arena made this even worse, as it was an even more dumbed down PvP experience over BGs and now you didn't even fight the other faction.
---
Another big failure in regards to PvP: The rewards were purely time gated. As in time spent during the week. You just had to be the guy who plays the most to get the best rewards. This is highly anti-competitive. Most premades even queue dodged eachother so they can just stomp randoms and get more "honor"/time. They should either have made it a flat grind (achievable by everyone) or an actual competitive mode where winning and losing matters and where you need to win against other premades. But this abomination of a reward system was just very disappointing. I was never impressed by someone who got rank 14 because I played in premades and I knew what it actually meant. It was a mix of gaming the system and being a complete no-lifer.
---
What I hoped they do with WoW was that the open world PvP aspect, the Faction War was at the center and the dungeons and raids were things you could do on the side, basically to farm materials. Instead they put the static, predictable content in the center and made PvP this weird side thing. Even worse, you also had to farm like crazy to do raids. That was another big failure of WoW. Raids and dungeons should have been something that allows you to \*avoid\* solo grinding, but instead solo grinding became a prerequsite for group content, what a terrible, terrible design.
---
&gt;I definitely understand the appeal of creating a community where you can say whatever you want, but freedom of speech does not mean freedom from consequence
---
Ah, yes, the favored NPC line. What does that even mean? Can you even substantiate such a stupid fucking statement with as many paragraphs as you replied to this poor guy with? 
---
How does Ninja looting work in Vanilla? Is it just the leader of the raid with ML takes everything at the last boss?
---
It depends on their gear, run a lot of 5 mans with your guild and you’ll learn what you can get away with. I try and outfit myself with a full +healing set while leveling, so I can down-rank rejuvenation on say, a mage with ease. You only really need max rank hots on tanks 95% of the time.
---
Unfortunately, it's still mostly single-threaded, so performance in raids or highly populated zones will still be bad.
---
Thanks for the answers guys.
---
Not on PVP servers.
---
damn
---
There were  a lot of "hidden" quests, in the mean they were HARD to find for a noob or long chains that people never did. I found a lot of quests i never did while playing on private server, for example.
---
That's going to be a small population in comparison to the overall numbers.
---
Is your daughter going to join for classic? 
---
Not a dad but maybe if you aren’t looking into joining your old guild or a specific guild you could make a recruitment google doc or something on this reddit and get a family guild set up where a lot of this wouldn’t be an issue for you.
---
If you make one now and get everyone set up in a group chat or discord server you’d have a full guild right off the bat when classic comes out.
---
Considering players like me spend less than 10 minutes in the starter zone, and are used to seeing over 8k+ players in say durotar from massive private servers, it really doesn't bother me if only the starting area is affected by sharding.  
---
As long as sharding does not make its way out into the "real" part of the world, its fine imo.
---
/$0.02
---
Yep it was amazing. That was the first time in any game I felt like one of the "popular uber" people lol. Had offers for thousands of dollars on my account and never took them. So dumb... I was 14 and thousands of dollars would have been amazing =)
---
Gilneas was pretty cool in Cata.
---
&gt; By far the biggest difference for me when it comes to having a child and playing multiplayer games is voice coms. I play with my speakers instead of headphones because I find my headset tends to cut me off too much from my family, isolating me in a little zone where they can't talk to me.
---
I put game sound on the speaker and have a one ear headset for voice com. You just need an additional USB sound device or a USB headset.
---
Father of two, played WoW on and off since Beta.  I suspect there are an awful lot of us in the same boat.   
---
I hear you 100% on voice comms.   If we got organized, we could put a group together that has a healthy schedule and is able to accommodate timeouts for kids.    (I also can't do 8 hour runs thru MC!)
---
Mine is definitely Vashj'ir!! *^((sarcasm))*
---
 &lt;**KRONAN**\&gt; - **Horde** | **EU-PvP** | Semi-Hardcore  
---
 **Introduction**: A built from the ground up scandinavian guild (sweden/norway/if you can speak/understand swedish) you will develop the guild with us as we progress to get together a core for, guild recruitments,discord handling and ingame PvE content.   Lootrules will be lootcouncil with DKP  
---
**What we are looking for**: aged 24 or older dedicated experienced or willing and able to learn, scandinavian player. 
---
**What we are aiming for**: Raiding as little as possible while clearing all content, what this mean is we will start at 3 raids a week and as we farm the content we will push for fewer raid days by being able to fit raids like MC,Onyxia,BWL into a single raid day, at every major 40man release we will bump up that to 3 days again and work our way down to as few mandatory raid days as possible (basicly being hardcore enough so we can be casual).   
---
**What We Expect Of Members**: Expecting our core to be able to get 60 in 2-3 weeks from launch. Attend to raids.  Our Raid Schedule: as we grow we will keep discussing what suits most ppl the best, but you should expect something like 18:00-22:00 or 19:00-23:00 monday,tuesday,wednesday or tuesday,wednesday/thursday with extra 20man and alt raids in the weekends (for players that can and want, never mandatory) TBD  Final note: This is a great opportunity for you to help shape a guild from the start into what will be one of the top guilds on the server, if you feel you cant raid as much as required we are still interested as we will need backup raiders, i will answer any question you got on our discord so dont hesitate to join!  [https://discord.gg/x2xwehJ](https://discord.gg/x2xwehJ) 
---
You're worried about a status more than gameplay? Doesn't make any sense. Sure Naxxrammas is the "Legendary Raid" that only a handful of people got to, but in classic... People are going to get to it lol. It will lose its Legendary status after half the server clears it.  
---
Making more catch up mechanics like in retail is pushing us back in the direction that we dont want to go as classic fans. If you're going to push out content, push out horizontal content at the end of era, not release catch up mechanics that will make other things obsolete. 
---
Sir your logic is flawed. 
---
First troll of the history xd.
---
Yeah also people in the game were totally different from today. Not this facebook 2.0 that wow is today.
---
Sure, if we're talking percentage based. It's going to be small. But I still expect a lot of people to go for this. I've been reading here on this sub and it seems quite a lot of people are considering this. 
---
ORKS?
---
PURGE THE XENOS! FOR THE EMPEROR!
---
This is my biggest gripe about Classic. In vanilla i was fully t1/t2 geared which allowed me to do what i like the most, pvp.
---
And pvp is still my goal with Classic. But i dont know if thats possible anymore considering the limited time i have as a dad. I probably wont be so geared and get stomped in pvp.
---
I actually had success in world pvp as a combat rogue, and tanks might be viable as FC. Once it took me 10m to kill T3 prot war as a hunter.
---
Father of a 7mo daughter. Definitely going to play Classic, but super casually. All of the issues you mention are things I deal with now. No comms, limited time for dungeons/raids, etc. Not sure how it will all work out, but I want to give it a shot because I’ve been waiting for this day for a long long time.
---
I do play FFXIV now, but only in short bursts, usually solo. MMOs are not for us fathers/mothers with a SO that is not interested in games.
---
Mine was helm of narv, I bought it off the AH for 100G which in retrospect was a massive waste of gold but hey...I was a little kid attracted by the purple.
---
Zargarmarsh
---
At least you didn't go Holy..
---
................. :I
---
For me its having to manually dismount before using spells. Picking herbs. Or using a FP. So many times recently I get picked off by an ally cause I'm sitting there riding around them trying to gouge cause I'm a noob and forget I have to dismount first 
---
I never got an epic ;( I'm still trash at video games
---
Not counting my epic mount, my first was Breast Plate of the Chromatic flight. I got super lucky and won the roll on the carapace. Rolled a 100 I’m pretty sure. I remember soloing the elites that’s spawn in EPL. It was a pain in the ass but worth it in the end. 
---
You know you can find vanillas database right? with Private servers etc etc
---
All the unfinished stuff that there was evidence of, or that we had to use wallwalking to reach. Old Ironforge, Airstrip, Hyjal, Gilneas, Karazhan, north-of-EPL (later became Ghostlands), etc.
---
Mine were [Earthfury Bracers](http://classicdb.ch/?item=16840). Bought them on the AH for super cheap during the BC pre-patch. The guild was doing ZG and 4-5 bosses into MC at the time.
---
It changed my mental state about as much as it contributed to my heals...
---
Staff of Jordan on my gnome mage, my friend bought it for me.
---
I spent a lot of time standing around Ironforge that week thinking I was the dog's bollocks.
---
Yeah wtf how have I missed this? I'm subbed to all the games subreddits as a multideddit too!
---
None of us are trying to have fun here OKAY?
---
With my work schedule and my wife's work and school schedules I won't be able to play as much as I would like. My son's (3) bedtime is between 7:00 and 8:00, so I plan to play as much as possible after he goes to bed. However, I find myself pretty tired and going to bed around 9:00 or 10:00, which doesn't leave much time to play.
---
Maybe once my wife graduates I will have more energy as she will be able to help out around the house more. I am also remodeling my kitchen, so when that's done hopefully I can squeeze in a couple hours leveling here and there while my son is awake.
---
I just wish I could play with my buddy from college who I leveled up with in Vanilla. He is single and no kids though, so he will out-level me pretty quickly. That's ok though, it is what it is.
---
I'm just going to take my time and play at my own pace. I just hope that Classic is still classic years from now when my son can join me and play with me. I might let him stay up past his bedtime then 😂
---
Like if you only enjoy an extremely specific version of vanilla under your exact perfect specific set of circumstances, do you even actually like the game?  That is some extremely fragile passion.
---
&gt;NPC
---
Wow, it only took 2 replies to find the overlap in the gaming community and Breibart talking points. Might be a new record. 
---
I actually hadn't seen/heard his exact quote and it's reassuring to hear. I don't envy them having to figure out how to balance the need to have servers stable on launch while avoiding the pitfall of dwindling server populations months down the line. The more you think about it, the more complex it seems.
---
I just *really, really, really* hope they don't flip that switch and neglect, for whatever reason, to turn it back off. His wording here is comforting but the paranoia in me still sees vagueness. I would like to see Blizzard continue to be very transparent about this. Nothing will be airtight since they've gone back on assurances before (like flying in WoD) but it would give us more to work with *if* we should need to hold them accountable (and I hope we don't). 
---
I'm &gt;95% confident Blizzard is going to do right by us with Classic. There's just a couple nagging fears.. 
---
The Hurricane on a troll hunter is actually a pretty solid bow, especially on a troll with zerking, rapid fire and aspect of the hawk proc.
---
I think all three (because IAS stacks multiplicatively in Vanilla) you have an attack speed of like 0.4.  Rip your arrow quiver tho.  Fun as hell to go "full auto", your dps is actually really high with all those.
---
For 39, [Bow of Searing Arrows](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2825) and the [Shadowforge Bushmaster ](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9422)are much better for pvp, due to the relatively high base damage and slow RoF -- better aimed shots and more shot weaving. Just be aware its much harder to farm [Precision Arrows](https://classicdb.ch/?item=9399) from Uldaman if you plan on making a twink @ 39, compared to engineergs just making [Mithril Slugs](https://classicdb.ch/?item=10512)
---
On my vanilla druid, my first epic I think was ... oh geez I don't even remember what it was.  I think it may have been something lame like the [Lifestone](https://classicdb.ch/?item=833) which I may have bought from the AH.
---
Before raiding, i do remember getting the [Mark of the Dragonlord](http://classicdb.ch/?item=13143) from LBRS last boss.  I thought I was so cool running around with a shield on as a druid.  Proved to be pretty useful in MC for that extra mana regen.  I made a little mini-game out of trying not to take any damage at all to keep the buff up.
---
If you specced into BM this was a different story though. BM or BM/MM Hunter was probably the least gear dependand class in Vanilla that had good impact in PvP against better geared players.
---
I imagine that's that July 16th speculation date?
---
I think it was something really lame like bracersfor my priest. Ended up going hunter for the majority of tbc though.
---
Melee weren't as affected as casters by this. My 29 twink guild used to run around ganking 60s in groups!
---
No idea. I'm European so I see it that way: 4 pve 4 pvp 1 rp pve 1 rp pvp for each language. That's quite a lot of servers already, but nothing compared to what retail use to be. I might be way off base, but I'd expect them to open new realms further down the road if their estimated tourist number is lower than expected. 
---
I hear ya. Getting 5 resists in a row as a warlock is no fun 
---
all of Northrend (except icecrown) is amazing without flying mount
---
Breitbart? See, you truly are an NPC, because I'm a leftie. Doesn't change the fact you're an NPC spouting nonsense about how he wants others to lose their rights for exercising basic rights. But I guess a fascist dog like you wouldn't care much about the well-being of others, let alone the letter of the law (which most certainly isn't by your side, mind you). So is this going to be it? A shitty strawman as you try to dodge the question? Or are you going to explain exactly what you meant by what you said above? You know, what the difference is between the two, and how this could be applicable by law.
---
My damn soul shards not stacking
---
I never asked you about Twitch's rules. I asked you what you meant by the phrase you stated. You're changing the topic because you're a disingenuous asshole that doesn't even know what he's saying. 
---
Can Blizz release a server list to avoid this guy?
---
It isn't my fault that you lack the critical thinking and reading comprehension skills necessary to see how Twitch TOS obviously relates to what I said. 
---
This was always a two-fold problem. First the spec balance just wasn't there. It was much, much better in TBC. Secondly the whole idea of specs were IMO problematic, as almost every spec (especially those of "hybrid" classes) dumbed down the class instead of adding to it. A huge design mistake that has been repeated in many multiplayer RPGs. It would have been much more compelling when for example Druids were actually hybrids that can tank/heal/damage depending on the situation, instead you had to dumb down your class with specific gearing and talent specs and then just do 1 thing. This was one of the, if not the biggest design mistake of WoW.
---
Need a safe space?
---
Lol I remember this bow hunters would complain because it would go through their arrows real quick
---
I hope they re-release the original server names again.
---
Magtheridon (US-East PVP) all day.
---
I feel like because you played on a private server this isn't 100% accurate, or true so to speak.
---
Little off-topic: I love the "Equip: Chance to strike your target with a Frost Arrow"  
---
I miss those items, nowadays is just level appropriate prescribed stats... But wait! There's titanforge! (sarcastic) Yay!
---
Do you to run dungeons with OMEGALUL ZULUL spergs? Do you want a dead server once a streamer quits? Do you want the whole server to be about the streamer only? Use your brain and you would be able to figure it out
---
I remember being 14 and flipping through this thing every time I took a poo break from the game.
---
Let's say one of the big time WoW streamers like Sodapoppin goes to Darkspear v2.0. Or whatever server.
---
That server will have thousands of Sodapoppin fanboys on both factions who roll on his server and have gigantic wars in STV between stream snipers and sniper repellers.
---
Everywhere you go, that server will belong to Sodapoppin and his viewers. Trade chat will be Sodapoppin. Forums will be Sodapoppin.
---
Nothing wrong with enjoying or participating in that, but damn it I want a server where my celebrities are made after the servers launch, not before.
---
From what you're selling? Think we all do
---
As a Darkspear main I can relate
---
I will NEVERRRRR forget the rush I felt when I played the trial and I ran out of time back in 2005. I rushed to EB to get a physical copy and opened the cover for the first time and saw this artwork. I was truly excited beyond anything I had even experienced in the real world at that time. Which looking back seemed kind of sad, but that was the beauty of the art form. It took real life and stretched it into this fantasy realm that gave you a sense of escapism beyond anything I’ve ever experienced. 
---
So you have no answer and you're just a dimwit repeating what he's heard others say. Just as I thought. 
---
SeemsGood thanks that was very informative!

I actually think talent specs were one of the biggest design flaws of WoW and many other RPGs. Or at least in the sense how those are usually implemented. A talent spec actually dumbs down your class into a specific role. It would have been much more interesting for the game if you could, and had to, switch between the roles that the class kit allowed you to fulfill. Gear stats and talent specs should have been something that adds flavor and emphasizes a play-stile (for example mobility vs. CC, or sustained damage vs. burst) and not something that shoehorns your class into a role.
---
Wait, Gnones have to swim in the shallows on inner Mara?
---
Omg that is hilarious.
---
I got a level 42 ring.  Can't remember the name off-hand, but if I saw it I'd know it.
---
Kept trying to sell it on the AH for what WoWHead said it was worth.  Ended up making like 1/10th what I thought I should've.
---
They won't and they didn't.
---
I don't know how I feel about tree LoS. It would make life a complete nightmare for Hunters. I mean the class functions decently well in melee but I think a lot of people will get upset over the fact that they never get to shoot their bow in world PvP.
---
Void elf in my classic video?! 1/10
---
One point for that classic logo tho. Good quality. 1 hour in photoshop? :D
---
Played in my teenage years, I'm late 20's with my first child imminent. I'm planning on coming back to classic and wondering these exact same things. I'm realistically telling myself it will take months to get to 60. With no illusions of this and not bothered. leveling is the part I'm looking forward to the most to be honest, quite glad it's not just me.
---
Being able to drop an improved fire nova totem and a goblin sapper is amazing for elem shamans.
---
Its like an easy 1.5-2k damage (if crit) aoe.
---
I wonder if in Classic the Spell Crit talent node will boost the sapper's crit damage?
---
My first epic item was an [Underworld Band] which i'm pretty sure dropped from a Rock Elemental in Badlands
---
It's sale managed to fund *3* epic purchases for my leveling Paladin and really helped push those last few levels with ease
---
Joanna has his guild timing warlock summoning and mage portals for him to save hearthstone cycles. I assume they're also going to farm reagents and materials for hand in quests asap and do everything else necessary to boost him.
---
The line is getting kinda blurry. There are methods where a group of four can powerlevel a character who does nothing from 10-40 in four hours, which means the time to 40 would be like maybe 5 hours? Probably under 4 if you really optimized what everyone was doing (or scaled it up so more people are involved).
---
Then you can continue to powerlevel post-40. It wouldn't shock me at all if you could get 1-60 in 12 hours with a very large and coordinated team presetting instances to powerlevel, and follow-tagging.
---
But that doesn't seem like they're playing the same game as someone solo leveling to 60.
---
Twinking is where I put my min/maxing back then. I didn't have time to truly "complete" level 60, I never got past BWL! But I did put in the exact effort you describe in my 19s, 29 and 39. The right class, the right race, the best professions, multiple 100% BiS gear sets and enchants, consumables and fun items. And that was fun. It was great. I have absolutely no grudges against people who go 100% all in on their 60s. 
---
I played a rogue in a vanilla but this time around I want to try a feral druid.
---
How do the PvE and PvP specs differ? Any resources would be amazing.
---
Thanks!
---
Same here dude.
---
Spring 2005 I saw a Hurricane on the AH. The purple and 30 DPS made me visualize turning into a damage lord so I was super thirsty to win it. I kept refreshing the AH to see exactly when the auction would go from Very Long to Long time remaining and then based on that calculated that the auction would end around 3 AM. So I set my alarm for 3 AM to place a bid and won the bow.
---
Eventually I learned the bow was a dps decrease and that slow weapon attack speed was a bigger deal for aimed shots and multishots. This was before damage meters (for the most part) and theorycrafting. So at least the bow taught something.
---
Later I had the idea to "accidentally" vendor Hurricane and submit a GM ticket to replace it, thinking I would receive a BOE and I could sell it. The GM gave me the Hurricane and said ,"Now equip it." Then he waited while I pretended to be confused. "Equip the bow." Then he watched as I reluctantly equipped it. Now I had the same bow minus the scope.
---
That was a great vanilla memory for me haha.
---
If you're speedleveling then this is the data you want to look at.
---
If you're going to take your time and experience the game, I think Horde is far superior to Alliance.  Horde gets better travel hubs, gets The Barrens for PvP-free leveling up to the mid-20s if you want.  While leveling, you have much better access to SFK and Scarlet Monastery, and the three dungeons in the Barrens are open to you.  It's easier for Tauren to meet up with the rest of the horde than it is for Night Elves to meet up with the rest of the Alliance.
---
Playing as horde and then going Alliance, there's a lot that I miss.  Going back to horde, there's not much that I miss.
---
And in Vanilla I was Alliance.
---
Hahaha I put a little disclaimer in the first few seconds on the video where I'm walking around saying it's all I've got for footage! Sorry. ;)
---
Spent some time figuring out the thumbnail yeah. Gimp instead of Photoshop because I am poor.
---
&gt;I thought
---
Doubt.
---
Yeah, I just mean it was so inconsistent in vanilla for which objects actually blocked LoS (i,e. some rocks did, but other didn't. most trees did not, a few walls with transparency also did not block shots)
---
I'm in the opinion that Hunters should learn better positioning and that for general consistency 3D objects that block movement should also block LoS.
---
But I'm not developing WoW, and I'm just stating my opinion. I expect Hunters for their personal interest to want to keep broken LoS the way it was.
---
I wonder if any of that stuff could potentially make its way to the future of Classic after launch.
---
Even if he's on a PvP server, he'll probably have swarms around him.
---
There may be more when Classic launches.
---
This might sound ridiculous to some people but if language is a concern to you. It might be a good idea to look for a christian guild. I know its a meme but they are kid friendly lol.
---
I have 2 daughters and exactly the same mindset and goals than you. However I don't have any speaker and will use my headset just like with any other game. I never ever play while my kids are awake therefore this is less necessary.
---
Or an RP server.
---
I'm actually a huge fan of the effect that racial abilities had on  the prevalence of certain race/class combinations. For instance, the Tauren warriors with the +% health being common as raid tanks was very iconic to me. The other positive side of it was that when you saw someone who was *not* the race/class you'd expect based on either min/max or even cliches (like undead rogues), it made it all the cooler to me.     
---
       
---
I feel like modern retail WoW loses a lot of that character by having a bazillion races and no real underlying drive for anyone to choose a specific race/class. More individual freedom, but less world  cohesiveness...if that makes sense.
---
Keep making your pointless replies, you absolute zero. You were called out on saying something nonsensical and instead of explaining what you meant you're shifting the blame. Even if I were stupid, that's no reason for you not to be able to give a detailed explanation of what you meant. But of course you're incapable of doing that because what you said means absolutely **nothing**.
---
Any other popular named USA est pvp servers from vanilla? I feel like those big names servers like Illidan or Sargeras are always high pop
---
My guild back in classic was already like this lol
---
LazyPig ftw, *if* it even works on Classic that is.
---
I saved up all my DKP for Giantstalker's Epaulets. 
---
You are a 3 month old account.
---
Yeah but he is in Texas, and he’s rolling pve like a noob. 
---
I think they tried that with Priest Racials. I assumed there would have been more race-based racial skills for other classes but time-restraints happened and only Priest was ready to be shipped in some capacity.
---
Mine was Boots of Avoidance. While they are actually good, everybody thought they were terrible back then, so I got almost nothing out of selling them on the AH.
---
Does soda live in Texas too? Does retail wow have their USA realms divided between the time zones? If so I should be fine when picking a server without the fear of rolling on sodas server
---
Karazhan is in azeroth and one of the best sones ever made.
---
There are no new models in Classic. There are new shaders and foliage but the models and textures are the old ones.
---
I think the only reason you could be missing Fears with a 20 level gap is Will of the Forsaken and such.
---
Spell "weapon skill" automatically goes up by 5 each level even if the actual "skill" is hidden. So you should not be suffering resists without any external force present.
---
My first epic was a BoE ring which dropped in STV off of a Panther, which I sold for around 100g. First epic I actually equipped was probably some armor from ZG that I continued to use until the mid-60's in TBC, for the 2-piece bonus.
---
Did you not read the question from OP?  
---
I like hitting things with big weapons.  Warrior for me 
---
I started playing when I was 16. I stopped in Wotlk. 
---
I'm super duper stoked about the Classic release!
---
I'm now 31 and I have a girlfriend and a 15 months old daughter and a big house and huge garden and some animals to tend to, but I CANNOT miss out on classic. I will dedicate 1 evening a week after my daughter is sleeping to play with my brother, who only played vanilla a tiny but as he was just 10 years old back then. 
---
It will take us about a year to reach 60, but we WILL do it!!!! 
---
Well crz and all that doesn’t exist in vanilla.
---
Wow, and this is supposed to mean something? Are you fucking brainless, dude? I could've made an account just now to reply to you. How would it make the slightest difference in the fact that you are wrong and a total coward that isn't even able to stand by his own words? It doesn't. But the fact that this is a thing you legitimately thought should be brought up as meaningful just proves what a dumb bitch you are. All you know is how to prey on the weak with your meaningless drivel, and when you're called to answer for doing so your only defense is to blame the other person for not understanding you (supposedly) while also refusing to go into detail about what you said. The trademark tactic of a shallow swindler trying to escape scrutiny by changing the topic. 
---
But it’s the least cost efficient spell however... therefore it’s more for the heal meter when you’re on farming, else, quite complicated to spam it
---
I play now with a 4 year old and our second is due in about a month.
---
Right now I don't use voice chat.  I just type. I don't want to have headphones on in case my son wakes up crying or something, I'd never hear him.
---
I do raids and dungeons now but that's a far cry from what's coming in classic.  I do WANT to later in some evenings once the second kid is sleeping through the night but there will always be that chance I gotta bail or for afk a bit.  But I remember that happening quite a bit back then and people were more understanding since it was an hours long trip.
---
Most ninjalooting happens in dungeons, especially low-level dungeons where you just roll need on an item you don't need. 
---
The ML ninjaing can happen in raids but usually it's just the loot rules not being declared clear enough. During vanilla some raids were just left at free for all to make trash looting easier. This is the case with the famous OH MY GOD I'M GONNA KILL MYSELF RIGHT NOW! video. This probably won't happen on Classic.
---
Lastly, if the DKP or loot system isn't clear enough mistakes can happen. Once I didn't get the memo that Knights didn't get prio on MC loot anymore and gave myself the Choker from Ragnaros. Oops. 
---
Like how people ask for a Band-Aid when they actually just mean a standard bandage.
---
No mount until level 40, also good luck affording it lol 
---
I played  a warrior (keyboard turning, and ability mouse-clicking) and did not enjoy being easily dispatched by anyone who chose to make the attempt.   I got killed regularly by rogues.  I developed a hatred for rogues.  I leveled a rogue.  I then used that rogue to gank in STV.  Eventually, I would only attack players that were at least my level.  I also would only kill them once if they hadn't done anything to me.  If they had started it though, I'd keep at it until they quit (or I was outplayed).  
---
Being a rogue is playing cheap.  If you don't like it, you should try it - it's quite fun.
---
Father of 2. This is such a non-issue for me, but seeing it be a problem for others has made me feel pretty lucky.
---
It's very simple:
---
Kids go to bed between 7:30 and 8:00. Two nights a week, from 8-12, is WoW time, while wife pursues her own interests and hobbies.
---
I hate the endless running due to quests being all over the place. Especially in later stages when you have cleared most content in the zone.
---
Go to location X on the other side of the map, kill something, run all the  way back, get a follow up in the same part.
---
Sure, you can skip it, but if you're a quest completionist...woops, there goes another 5 minutes of doing nothing but auto-running along the path or zigzagging the shortcut route through bunches of mobs hoping you don't die.
---
Just on the BG front, it does seem like they won't be in at launch. So we'll hopefully have some good world PvP for a while. 
---
My first epic were the pvp shoulders on my hunter, but this was just before BC came out so it wasn't that difficult to get at the time.
---
What if they hide what server they are on with an overlay so they can quest in peace for as long as they can?
---
Doing the quest means going out of your way from earning MORE GOLD QUICKER.
---
Screw the party I'm not getting smashed with an axe to my face repeatedly I gotta save cash! /s
---
They don't have that shield boomarang thing?
---
My issue is I want to be on a high-pop realm for easier dungeon queues, but I won't know which realms are truly high-pop until a few weeks in.
---
This
---
I remember pouring over that box when I first got it, read the manual front to back over and over while my game downloaded and installed, took a couple days with shitty internet and a terrible computer.
---
And man, this isn't vanilla related but back when transmog was announced I immediately went to the auction house and bought every. single. cool looking blue and epic I could. I saw the flip potential well before everyone else on my server. Ended up with dozens upon dozens of weapons and hats. Atleast a dozen teebu swords. One for me, many for everyone else at a  ridiculous price. 
---
I flipped all that and made something like half a million gold (back when that was a lot), a lot of that thanks to the teebu swords!
---
Man, good times.
---
The question of deciding between Dwarf and any other race is the easiest question to answer in the world.
---
Dwarf master race.
---
IMO, hopefully far, *far* down the road.
---
Build upon classic rather than just replace all the content with TBC.
---
Once you get aq/naxx gear marks is miles ahead as it scales with gear better. I was 31 marks/surv hunter in retail. 
---
I want to expirenent in classic with a spec I have in mind. 27 in marks to get most of the scaling dmg talents and 23 in beast to get pet stun and spirit bond.
---
I camped a friendly.  He upset me by attacking beasts I was trying to tame on my 60 hunter in the starting zone.  So I followed him around with Aspect of the Cheetah and killed everything he was in range of so he couldn't get any XP.
---
I totally agree with this, and imo. there is no need to min max until naxx anyway. My raiding in vanilla stopped at C'thun, but getting there was easy. Have gear. Enchant it. Be on time for raid. We did rag with two son phases, and every ranged standing on top of a ledge, because our dps was so bad. lol
---
What's funny is that the fact that everyone knowing what's waiting at 60 seems to be the main argument against rolling anything but dwarf. When vanilla was this brave new world, you (at least I did) picked what seemed cool - and everyone just ran with that. 
---
Judging by some of these comments, people may reject a non-dwarf priest based solely on that fact, without ever giving the player the chance to prove themselves. Because fear ward is convenient - apparently convenient enough to bring a dwarf, even if he sucks at healing.
---
Hunter all the way.
---
Why? Hunter is one of the very few classes (if not the only one), where, for each content patch, the full Tier Set is BiS.
---
All other classes wear thrown together pieces that don't look as good as a full set.
---
In addition T1 set looks huge on an Orc, T2 looks good on anyone except Tauren and T3 still looks good-ish enough.
---
Dude, same here! My friend got them as a drop and sold them to me for cheap to use on my warrior. They're actually not great for leveling though.
---
Mine was Icemail Jerkins. And since I knew nothing about stats I was sooooo happy about that +24 in spirit had to be good! So I kept it like for 20 levels...
---
Trying to find a party as a damage dealer.  
---
Not having lfd is a necessary evil, but trying to find a group when none of the usual suspects are online is the most boring thing in the game.
---
Defias hang outs too. 
---
Arthas-US ftw!
---
Pretty much my tactic. Tho I have other hobbies and duties so it's 1 night for me 
---
You mad, comrade?
---
The only guy I kept in touch with from back then is not interested in going back. A good RL friend of mine also used to play though, and is pumped about going back, so we are going to level together along with a few of his friends.
---
That said, I’ve leveled alone plenty of times in the past, and it’s really not that bad as long as you enjoy your class playstyle and can get immersed in the world. I’d recommend picking a dps class, or at least something that can level as dps like shaman so you can actually kill mobs solo at decent rate though, and you may want to consider a PvE server unless you don’t mind getting ganked a lot. Otherwise, vanilla being what it was, you will meet people doing dungeons and elite quests, and make new friends. That was the whole point of old WoW and it will be again.
---
Oh, yes, definitely. I wasn't even thinking about anything related to TBC, I hope we don't ever get anything as traumatic as that with green items suddenly replacing your tiered sets. Just a few new zones for the sake of bringing Vanilla closer to how it was intended prior to release. 
---
I think its because Classic/Vanilla was sort of everywhere with the plot. It's adventure first, figure out/solve problems later. I love this system a lot, which is why I love reading quest text in general.
---
Starting from Burning Crusade, an external force pressures us to leave Azeroth to solve X problem, this repeats henceforth. It can be done WELL (Wrath did an excellent job establishing older lore and inventing new lore with Loken's forces, Yogg'Saron, reinforcing the threat of the Scourge and why we're there), but its not the same as wandering into the Searing Gorge wondering what the hell is going on.
---
I equipped one of those, had regrets, vendored it, then submitted a ticket saying I accidentally sold it, and voila! An unbound Hurricane appeared in my mailbox!
---
The inconsistencies in breadcrumb quests:
---
* Some quests will unlock a follow-up.  So you miss 1/3 of the quests in a zone because you haven't done a breadcrumb.
---
* Then you get a breadcrumb that is simply that.  So you've done all the quests in a zone, and then get a breadcrumb to go there.  You think "sure, I'll do one more chain there."  Travel all the way there and get your 125 XP and that's it.
---
* Some quests eliminate a breadcrumb or make you ineligible for the breadcrumb when you complete the quest.  So if you don't do the quest first, you can squeeze a little more XP out of the effort.
---
My friends don’t play anymore. I’m by myself. I’ll be making new friends as I level.
---
They are using 1.12 data but they still need to "massage" it to fit into Retail, since some of it doesn't quite "fit" into the Retail pieces.  Per that german interview site.    So knowing blizzard, god knows what we're going to get.
---
Because you can’t do 2v2, 3v3
---
Because Dwarves make the most badass of dudes. You weren't wrong!
---
While subhumans like you will keep on living and shitting up the world - definitely. 
---
Yeah, I can think of three encounters where it might matter, of which two are very entry level. So for the vast majority of the game, it won't really matter. 
---
I love the fact that you haven't had problems finding a raid as a human. I do however, based on some of the comments here, and my experience puging low m+ keys in retail, that the try hards that try, but don't really achieve much, will be the gatekeepers into a casual guild, if none of my friends wanna play classic. 
---
Your post gives me hope though. Thx!
---
As long as its isolated to the starter areas and eventually is removed completely when we do hit that plateau/drop in activity. 
---
Should I care who these 2 people are?
---
Viewers dont just appear
---
As others have said it's more about the People they bring with them. My worry is that most of these streamers fans will inflate the server making it high pop for the first few weeks. Then as they get tired of the "grind" they'll leave, leaving us with a much smaller server. 
---
Also there are a lot of other big streamers that will be playing Classic. Summit1G/TimtheTatMan/Lirik/Sodapoppin. Are just four big names that will be playing. I'm more worried about the above streamers than I would be of Asmons. As the ones above are hype streamers and will jump to whatever the newest hottest game is. Then the server dies because it was made up of mostly their fans or people wanting to gank them.
---
Once they've rolled all you need to do is create a level 1 anything and use the /who command to see if they're on the server.  You might get a false positive but you'll never get a false negative.
---
I understand this, i will Also avoid this easily by checking their stream just as Classic drops. Then pick another server. Case closed?
---
Maybe get those anger issues checked out, my friend. 
---
In the meantime, thanks for showcasing just how vitriolic the gaming community can be to everyone in this thread. 
---
PvP is encouraged but when it turns into ganking and camping it becomes a whole different thing.
---
I did the same thing but they just sent it to my
---
Mailbox.
---
And yes, it was all about the castable shots. 2.9 speed weapons could kill a cloth wearer almost instantly (Aimed, auto, multi), could top 3k burst.
---
God I miss vanilla hunters. They were so complex with the melee buttons, array of traps, scare beast(!), pet variety, and good old utility. Loved fighting melee, getting em to like 1K, and going in and Raptor Striking with Lok’Delar for 1K. All crit and health gear for PvP. Had about 5600 health and felt like I could beat anyone except maybe a REALLY good rogue or warlock.
---
I do miss it.
---
😆 That GM knows all the tricks. Give that man a raise!
---
Qiraji Sacrificial Dagger.  I was dumb and didn't understand builds so I used it offhand with a hemo spec in raids. Yikes.
---
Warrior + Priest or
---
Warrior + Shaman
---
What Warrior wouldn't love a personal windfury totem plus heals.
---
I would strongly recommend against a Druid, simply because he can only rez once every 30 min, so dungeons can be a real problem with only a Druid as healer.
---
That's actually a really good idea. Just make exorcism half damage and make it double damage for undead. Then make it a taunt
---
Gloves of Holy Power. Sold them for 105g at lvl 43 for my first mount.
---
I AM playing a mage, and I hope alot of those exploits are fixed, personally.
---
10-40 in four hours on a fresh realm? How lol wtf, I could see like 1-25 or so in that time frame, but even then I dunno o.o
---
This sub is an echochamber of semi hard cores to hard core gamers. Most of the casuals aren't really here is my guess. 
---
Scholozar Basin is kinda what i imagine in goro is supposed to be. And that blizz finally got to make it once they had the technology in wotlk
---
No kids here, but limited time due to commitments.  I plan on playing on a pvp server and just playing and leveling.  Hoping to join or start a guild with people in the same boat. Hopefully large enough that there are people on at all times.
---
First, what is your goal?
---
* To be super survivable in solo?
---
* To be able to heal through ganks in PvP?
---
* To group up as much as possible on quests and have good synergy with whoever you group with?
---
* To focus on Group areas?
---
* To focus on dungeons?
---
From there, you should hopefully get an idea of what to do.
---
Personally, I'm planning on levelling mine resto, and mostly doing dungeons.  That means I'm basically building into a dungeon healing build.  Because I don't have a lot of gear, or especially a lot of crit, talents that are based on your crit are things I'm going to avoid early on.
---
Personally I'd start with talents that give bigger boosts and fill in the lot later.  I'll start with Improved Healing Wave, because I value 20% haste on HW as more valuable than 5% mana cost reduction.  But that 5% mana cost reduction is next, because there isn't anything in Tier 2 that screams at me.
---
Down the line you'll get choices like a stacking 6% boost to healing wave for 3 points or 5% crit for 5 points.  That's a huge boost to HW and I wouldn't pass it up.
---
I can give you more detail later (if I remember this post) but for now, just look at things and if it seems like one talent offers a lot more for a leveling shaman, go for it.
---
Nagrand &lt;3

The man that wants others silenced because of vague nonsense complains about vitriol. Oh, dear. I am glad the gaming community is vitriolic. People like you deserve the guillotine and nothing less, "friend." 
---
[Destiny](https://www.wowhead.com/item=647/destiny), baby!
---
I plan to have at least 16 characters.  I think you'll be fine.
---
Played pally back then. I entered MC in full mail/plate "of the eagle" gear (and thus did pretty well). Got helm of the lifegiver for minimum DKP because no other pally wanted any icky int mail.
---
The Uldum chain just ending abruptly, the burned inn never getting resolved on Alliance.
---
So many other quests that just end with "We'll speak again another time after we find something".
---
Actually what slowed down "casual" guilds the most (almost every fucking guild), was just people not playing well, and that will be less of a problem now. Back in the day you had raiding hunters who couldn't kite for shit so you wiped at razorgore and so on.
---
There were also tons of lackluster healers for some reason, well it was a high demand role so it was easier for a healer to be invited into a raiding guild than it was for most other roles/classes. For the most part healers and tanks were your "carries" in grouped content and raids, so if those were lazy/bad you had a harder time to progress. Good DPS? Didn't matter nearly as much, also it was by far the least challenging role when it came to raiding so getting more DPS/DPM was mostly a matter of farming and gearing up over time. But they mattered as well, and there were DPS players who straight up did objectively wrong rotations because "don't tell me how to play"...
---
These issues will likely remain to some extend but won't nearly be as bad as they were, so a lot more players will be clearing high end content such as AQ and Naxx I'am sure of it.
---
Don't forget that back in the day we actually didn't fucking know how to beat raids... There were still Guilds that did shit differently. I don't exactly know how pserver raiding looks but I assume it is much more streamlined. We just tried it how that other guild was doing it.
---
More streamers.  More of a market now that it's "classic" instead of "illegal private server".
---
And there are certain types of streamers that can get a large amount of viewers fast.

Ore stacks in 10s, but bars stack in 20s.

100 percent agree. The music tho!

[Sul'thraze the Lasher](https://www.wowhead.com/item=9372/sulthraze-the-lasher). I pretty much leveled in ZF as a tank from 41-51 for two reasons: I love tanking, meeting people, and running dungeons, and I was goddam intent on getting that sword.
---
I’ll second Negrand.  My favorite zone for a decade until MoP revolutionized how well zones can be designed.
---
&gt;Id be happy if exorcism is castable on all enemy type, but maybe do 25% or something like that of the full damage on non undead.
---
so the TBC(Or was it wrath?) version where it was useable on any enemy, but would always crit when used on undead/demon.
---
&gt;Jaina kill
---
Don't play retail, is she really dead now?
---
I've never been able to confirm the origin of July 16. I have always assumed Classic to launch the third week of August given Summer is only for 1 week in June and July contains a U.S. holiday.
---
I'm probably going for an RP server. Safe bet that it won't be massively dominated by a single faction, relatively safe bet that streamers won't come, safe from gank squads, and probably safe from 5-night hardcore teams so with my limited schedule I might be able to get into a guild that can contend for the top spot.
---
You won't know even then--it'll probably take at least half a year for the population to stabilize.
---
Red = dead
---
staff of  jordan, my wow buddy from back than GIFTED it to me. dont have contact anymore. thanks kind stranger. will love you forever
---
Same here. I was obsessed with the model and a guildie spotted me about 75g to buy it
---
What? I was able to set my account name to be remembered just fine.
---
It's from some speculatory stuff in this thread on the classic wow subreddit: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic\_release\_date\_july\_16th\_2019/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/9u755q/classic_release_date_july_16th_2019/)  
---
But it does seem very reasonable.
---
I agree with most of the things you say in your video.  
---
Wow Vanilla was perfectly designed for people to interact and make friends online, but if the game came out today, I don't think things would work out the same. I know for sure that I wouldn't act the same.   
---
When I started playing WoW, I just had an Internet connection for the first time in my life and was so happy to talk to strangers online and to play with them. Now, too much online made me more inclined to even avoid talking to people (probably because I got older too). Not saying I consider myself to be a reference, but I'm afraid there won't be the same cohesion in WoW Classic than in WoW Vanilla because the overall online community has changed. 
---
The Lobotomiser, 125g very well spent since upgrades were from the likes of Hakkar, Ragnaros or higher content.
---
The first epic I looted was T1 shoulders on my rogue. I would have been a lot more excited had it not given my human shoulder-tits.
---
I PVPed just fine as Prot Warrior. Join a premade. Tank the AV boss. Or stun/silence/fear their casters. 
---
If you have raid gear, especially early on, it doesn't much matter what your spec is, you can find a role in PVP. The concept that you have to spec for PVP is probably only needed if you're going for a higher title etc or that is your primary focus. Even as prot I could 1v1 rogues, and sometimes locks. (they often had too much HP for me to kill) BUT if I am supported by DPS i can certainly ruin their day. Taunt a hunter pet, have it follow you around and give you rage and go smash a clothie. 
---
Glowing Brightwood Staff was the first Epic I saw drop (and win!)
---
I was in Sunken Temple, in Ventrilo with my buddy, and it dropped.  It was the first time some of us had seen an Epic.
---
We had two melee, a paladin healer, a mage and myself (warlock).
---
I took a deep breath, clicked the roll button, and saw a 16 come up.  My heart sank so quickly.  There was no way I was going to win that roll.  Then the mage rolled...    13!!!
---
The Glowing Brightwood Staff was mine!  I immediately equipped it.  From that day forward, it has been my favorite item in the game.
---
I was thinking about how now I have two kids now, how am I going to progress in this game? It dawned on me that when I played back in 2004/5 I was in my early 20s, in college (and taking it seriously) and working part-time. I rarely ever played before 9pm EST. Even then, I still managed to be raid leader of 40 man raid party. After 9pm, my kids are in bed, so hoping on a vent server will be no probs!
---
So it's doable, I would recommend not playing anything serious while the kids are awake (raids, dungeons etc) if that's possible.
---
The entirety of Outland
---
I always pick assassin type characters in RPG’s so rogue. It’s really nice to be able to stealth around, distract and sap mobs, and generally feel like you can pick fights on your own terms.
---
Of course, back in Classic, stealth was slow as molasses without a sub talent to speed it up, and and sap unstealthed you (again, without a sub talent that at 3/3 gave you a 90% chance to stay in stealth) but it still felt like you had a lot more control over setting up engagements than a lot of classes did.
---
Maybe, but probably not. I mean, I think she'll try it for a month at least, but eventually she'll be bored. She loves transmogs, mounts, battle pets and all those fancy stuff that retail has. I can't imagine her not being bored with the slowness of Classic, but we'll see. Our guild friends will play Classic too, it might make her keep playing with us.
---
Lots of people are going to pull viewership to classic.
---
People like Shroud, Sodapoppin, Reckful, Asmongold, Swifty, Kungen are just a few names off the top of my head that will draw an audience.
---
There's a few private server celebrities too who've built a lasting following on twitch like Esfand and Staysafe.
---
Then there's a few ex League pros who've said they'll come back to WoW for sure. Speaking of MOBAs I know of at least n0tail among the Dota is probably playing classic again. We have a couple of Dota streamers who've said they'll play Classic when it releases.
---
Then there's the variety streamer crowd. TimTheTatman, Lirik, Cohh, Dan, Forsen, MoonMoon, possibly XQC...
---
I know of a handful of famous writers, stand up comedians and youtubers who live stream on twitch. There are a couple of UFC fighters who live stream, like Demetrious Johnson. All of whom told their chat will probably play classic.
---
Gotta remember the old WoW appealed to a wide audience. Celebrities like Vin Diesel, Mila Kunis, Robin Williams, Cameron Diaz, Ben Affleck, Dave Chappelle, Trey Parker &amp; Matt Stone, oh yeah and Macaulay Culkin confirmed on his AMA he's going to play classic...
---
I honestly think classic will have a lot of streamers on launch day.
---
Same here.  I ran out of quests and did 58-60 grinding Moonbeasts in Winterspring.  Helm of Narv dropped, I sold it for 600-700g, which gave me enough to get epic riding.  
---
I think you'll have a good idea in a few weeks.  People will be drawn to certain servers at that point.
---
I played a shadow priest, so there was not only opportunity, but a shitload of means, and I fucking loved getting under other players skin.
---
while leveling, my favorite game was finding similarly leveled alliance players, mind controlling/fearing them to a group of mobs, then watching the chaos unfold. enjoy your repair bill, bitch.
---
after a while, I got really good at reverse ganking... priests might be made out of wet paper, but if you know what you're doing, you're *really* hard to catch with your pants down, and even if someone managed to kill me, I'd do my best to take them with me... then the fun began.
---
against most classes, you just got back to your corpse, waited until they resurrected, then pressed the button yourself and surprised them before they could do shit. against rogues, however... 
---
I had a pretty basic macro, /target [rogue's name] /cast shadow word: pain, bound to the mouse wheel. if I managed to resurrect before the rogue, I'd do whatever, dutifully scrolling my mouse, so the moment the rogue resurrected... surprise, motherfucker, now there's a DoT on you, so you can't hide, and don't worry, and the rest will soon follow. 
---
I had a few friends on the alliance side with similar dispositions, so after a few kills, the victim often got a message along the lines of "now the score is 1-6. when will you realize you're useless, that you can't even against such a weak target? this is why your mother is thinks you're a failure." their tears were like honey for the soul.
---
but all good things must come to an end, because stuff like this is how I've managed to make it to several guilds' "kill on sight and call in high level guys if you see that fucker" list, often getting corpsecamped to shit the moment I left town, but... it was more than worth it in my opinion.
---
tl;dr: don't fuck with priests, most of use are griefing psychopaths.
---
Everything “runs away in fear” at like 15% health or whatever.
---
I think you mean severance...
---
Just for the fun of it, I know there are a TON of zones that are present on the world map, but are entirely absent in the game.
---
Not to mention the huge list of both cut content and potential Raids that just never got put in Vanilla -- but are present in the Vanilla world.
---
To name a few...
---
Azshera BG &amp; questlines
---
Hyjal
---
The zone south of Silverpine
---
Half of the areas in the souther part of Eastern Kingdoms
---
Dragon Isles
---
The Ghostlands north of Stratholm
---
Grim Batol
---
Uldum
---
Caverns of Time
---
Karazhan &amp; Crypts
---
Original concept of Outlands as a raid/zone
---
etc...
---
There is so much room for additional or Horizontal content that could be filled in for Vanilla/Classic without ever needing to move on to TBC.
---
TBH I don't quite get the players who don't want to farm consumables for progression content. When gear drops they will be just as entitled as everyone else, as everyone here knows who raided back then. It is just natural that you lose your important players if you never do the unfun stuff yourself.
---
This is me, just I will look to try and get into a guild that will try and raid in a way that is amenable to people coming and going.
---
Mine was the Krol Blade from Araj the Summoner. It was then that I realized the power of the auction house...
---
Hyjal. It was obviously under construction when they shipped the original game.
---
Quest dialog and references are set client-side. It is extremely unlikely for there to be a quest that has dialog that we don't know about.
---
However, there exists an opcode to send an npc talk dialog to the players. It is theoretically entirely possible for Blizzard to have made a quest that's completely server-side. Whether they did it is... I find that unlikely.
---
That's great man. I'm looking forward for your guild. Only thing to discuss is raid schedule, i'm Italian so maybe i have different times to raid than you:D
---
In fairness he really does go out of his way to reiterate that they understand the concerns and they only want to use it in a very limited fashion. As long as they stick to it. 
---
Loot trading is the bigger issue though.
---
Googling to find discord fan servers and watching for it there. Otherwise twitch is free probably worth tuning in for the first half hour or so. Otherwise trade chat will probably tell you on whatever server you roll on.
---
I really digged Uldum with its tiger people. I was not very fond of the whole Indiana Jones vibe, but I did like the egyptian art style.
---
I always liked the egyptian missions in Age of Mythology.
---
What does that even mean? In our Guild our leadership was pretty hands off, but that actually lead to people not putting in the effort, while reaping the rewards. The people that did lost interest in the guild over time. Granted I also lost interest in the game as a whole, but this was a factor.
---
I really, really liked it, but I found it incredibly creepy first time playing through it.
---
Oh my bad. 
---
I didn't know what to main either. Your best chance to decide on a main is to go practice and try out a class on retro-wow the private serv- I mean on your local host of course! It helped me decide to go rogue and I'm so happy I decided to do it.
---
I was hardcore progress raiding in vanilla in a top eu guild and absolutely loved it. There is no way that would work with a family now :(. So ill probably play a bit casual until i get bored. Same as any expansion nowadays. But damn do i wish i had the time.
---
I am a dad of 3 but im divocred. I was married in Vanilla WOW up till wrath of the lich king when i quit. It was my ex wife we got me into WOW in the first place. At the time my hobbie was PC/gaming/tech etc etc. And i was a counter-strike person, FPS shooter. I would play on that weekly when i had time. Anyway i lost a bet at one point and my punishment lol was to play vanilla wow for one hour. I do remember saying to my wife at the time. This game is going to be SHIT LOL. After 15 minutes of Vanilla ive not looked back since and to this day ive not played counter-strike since.
---
I will be returning to [classic.](https://classic.Im)
---
[I](https://classic.Im) am 45 year old now but if you think thats old for WPW my mum which is 62 plays wow since BC with her friend which he is 55 and they continue to play wow up till this date 3 to 6 times per week. 
---
I tanked a run where both halves dropped and I’d let the rogue have the first one and then he and I ended up submitting a ticket so I could get an epic 2h. It was a trash weapon though. No stats, poor proc and too fast.
---
I have 3 kids now (6 and under).  Luckily they go to bed easily so I plan on getting an hour or two in before bed during the week.  Weekends will depend on what activities (softball, music, dance) they have at the time but I hope to get a in a weekend oriented guild to raid a bit
---
Comms won’t be an issue since I only wear one earpiece anyways because I like to listen to the ingame music.   
---
Thank you for this. I plan on having to find a partner for quests and mostly focus on dungeons. I really want to learn the Shaman class and spend as much time healing and not worrying about rushing to 60. 
---
I really appreciate these insights. I understand what you are saying about filling out both tier 1.
---
I never got an epic in vanilla. Think my first epic piece of gear in BC was Earthsoul Leggings off of Opera in Karazhan.
---
Hunters and Druids generally compete for the top spot.
---
Same for me. I watched my brother playing his Human Mage back then and i fell in love with the class.....even though this time i'm gonna roll an Undead Mage:D
---
Yeah but try to picture how world PvP would play out as a Hunter in well, half the game. Zones like STV, Duskwood, Felwood, Wetlands, Dustwallow Marsh, Elwynn Forest, Hillsbrad, Western Plaguelands...
---
A lot of engagements would consist of people beelining for the trees so they can kill the Hunter's pet without them being able to do anything. It would be like in the days before the deadzone removal where every arena match vs. Hunters was a pillar hump fest.
---
Like the whole reason why they eventually had to take out the deadzone was because it was at times impossible to play Hunter in arena.
---
Hunters already suffer enough in classic.
---
Oh it'll definitely be different this time around. Times have changed, but it's mostly just fun for me to reminisce about why it did so well at the time. Let's say I'm optimistic about how well it will do this time around too though, even if it's a little different.
---
If any MMO is going to succeed, it's probably WoW.
---
I'm with you, have a 1 year old and f2f has an 8 year old and we all live together. Jokingly was thinking of making a guild named &lt;Dad Bod&gt; and trying to get like minded people aboard. 
---
My problem is that I want to raid more than casually but not hardcore. Time wise I'm not entirely sure that will be possible but it would be nice to have a guild that isn't on me because some family matter came up, or if I just wasn't into playing that evening. It's going to be interesting to see how that pans out, but here's hoping it works out in the end.
---
Just play a pvp server easy.
---
Also I feel like these kind of posts really paint a negative picture of streamers in general. It's first of all not the streamers fault that there's some very dedicated fans that evolve their gaming hours to following their every move. 2nd. This all is only true for either very big streamers, or streamer with very dedicated fan bases. You are really not talking about a lot of servers here. 
---
Lastly, the realmlists will be announced in advance, it would be retarded for blizzard just to launch the game without giving people any kind of chance to plan what realm they and their friends go on. We'll prolly have some sort of megathread about big streamers and what servers they are going on. We're talking about just a few here, like shroud, asmon, soda and then a bunch of "smaller" streamers that seems to want to play on the same server. That's it. 
---
It is, **but** the client (for some reason) also registers packets that don't give an ID, but the raw information as well. So for example dialog is usually contained in the DBC files, but there is a perfectly viable handle that can receive customized NPC dialog / quest text directly from the server.
---
I can't wait for gold to mean something again, tfw a buyer has been found for your auction and you have a small fortune sitting in your mailbox.
---
That's BS. In both Vanilla and TBC 5mans were a huge part of the gearing process. You didn't require a guild for those but it was certainly smoother if you had internal groups. Also people would specifically run 5mans to gear up classes/roles that the main roster lacked.
---
We actually found our TBC main tank in a 5man. So that content was \*definitely\* relevant.
---
Thanks for this
---
Starting zones don't matter a lot. What matters most is the amount of quests available at level 43 (the mathematical halfway point to 60) and beyond.
---
Horde has the better questing QoL in classic. AFAIK Joana played Horde because it was faster.
---
There was only 3 battlegrounds and Alterac Valley was one of them. Alliance has always done better in that BG on average. So if you like AV and you like winning AV go alliance.
---
Yeah, vanilla WoW had a much more Diablo II approach to epics. The item may not be best in slot, but it would do something unique.
---
Definitely not bis, but still one of the best looking weapons in the game.
---
I'm not disagreeing with you. Just explaining why some would be worried. 
---
Reading your post thinking me too, me too, me too, except mage. Also UK 👌🏻
---
way ahead of ya : ) still haven't made up my mind
---
Yeah, I want to like Uldum, on paper I should, but they went way too meme-y with the main questline there.
---
I don't necessarily agree with the other guy but sounds like you haven't played a good private server, they're really fun.
---
If that P server happens to begin with a N and you are Horde, I'll send you the gold to get it if you plan on playing some more. I'm mostly playing the AH to try and figure out some strats once classic launches
---
Hand of Edward the Odd, I believe! Still my favorite item (chance on hit for next spell to be instant). Still impossible to make good. 
---
literally almost every raid mob is immune to roots and you aren't exactly spamming frostbolts on mobs where the tank lost aggro. 
---
i love how you described my comment as "BS" and then agreed with it.  
---
i would suggest thinking before posting
---
Never did BT as a Gnome but we had to swim in the black morass. The wave was down by the time you got there as a melee class. 
---
Yes as it uses legion client not vanilla.
---
16 month old here too, it's an interesting dynamic, and he loves to mash that keyboard if he's awake and I walk away. Come back to my character saying random gibberish
---
It was always possible to attack through terrain such as hills, trees etc. It defied common sense, but that was the way it was.
---
Kara
---
Hand of Edward the Odd was my first - it dropped from some trash near the start of ZG. Probably late 2005. Crazy how we remember these things.
---
LOL right? Didnt take long for that side to rear its head
---
I mean, there's plenty of unsolved mysteries in RL. Maybe it's more realistic that way!
---
I loved engineering as a PvE hunter. Feign death + rezzing trinket was an incredible combo in raids. 
---
Man this made me so happy to read. :)
---
I'm only in my mid twenties myself, but I hope I'll be able to do stuff like this with my mates throughout life as well.
---
Sort of like a new take on poker night with the lads.
---
Hunters don't suffer in classic at all imo, maybe at 60 when everyone is geared, but in BG's and open world they perform fine.
---
Players already use LoS to gap close on any ranged class, or to deal with pets.  It would affect the gameplay, but its a 2 way street.
---
I don't get how I did it so consistently, like I knew Tuesdays were maintenance day lol yet it happened multiple times
---
This is how I played all through vanilla -not allowing anyone to dictate my own enjoyment &amp; immersion in a video game. 
---
Terokkar
---
Mine was Destiny. It dropped on my grind to 60 in Andorhal western plaguelands from a fiery ghul. I was baffled at first and then realized what happend. Never saw an epic before and than sold it for crazy 150gs to a paladin.
---
Yeah but the problem is population decline. A lot, and I mean a lot (probably &gt;50%?) of the population are going to quit within the first half a year, little doubt about it as most are, as Blizz called them, tourists.
---
It's completely up in the air--there's a very good chance plenty of High population servers are going to drop to Medium. But yeah, after a few weeks, any server that's still High is unlikely to drop past Medium that year at least.
---
Honestly, the best advertisement for Horde is just the sheer volume of cringy material based on Alliance Races.
---
But, people see human or night elf booty -- or the idea of rolling a paladin and being able to RP in a medival city pretty much seals the deal. 
---
Best reason to roll as Horde for a fresh player is just the fact you're not the alliance.
---
Being a mage through and through.  Finally rolling an alt and realizing how bad it sucks to worry about food and water.  Haha.
---
Same here left ear on (the side with Mic) right side off (side closer to door/where people are)
---
I have two kids, they are both in bed by like 8pm, so i just wait to play til then, gives me a modest 3hours til i go to sleep at 11pm. 
---
Guess its individual, but this way i can be gaming with no effect on my childrens day at all tbh. The only thing then is to find a balance with the misses 😅
---
Like others have said, you can do a lot of this with leveling Ele or Enh. 
---
You're not going to miss too much in the playstyle until you get to Healing Way.
---
The thing is, you'll have the tourists leaving, but you'll have more players coming in.  It might not be the same number, but that will offset the losses some.
---
Kang the decapitator dropped of some random slime in hinterlands. I chose to equip it instead of selling it, which I thoroughly regretted as I didn't get epic riding until TBC.
---
Not a Dad yet but will be in a few days time with any luck! 
---
But i'm really looking forward to Classic myself. I first started playing in November 2005 and i've been excited ever since the announcement. I was a Mythic Guild Leader on Retail but called it quits shortly after Uldir. I won't be able to play anywhere near as much as back in 2005 but i'm just glad to be able to play Classic at all and that it's actually happening. I think it's primarily about managing expectations as life and family always comes first. However, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't excited to Raid through MC, BWL and the rest again though! 
---
Yes, I agree with all of that. 
---
I care for my mom &amp; dad. I can't dedicate any time to a dungeon, and raids are out. 
---
I play a NE Druid. It helps that I can stealth when I need to leave and go care for them or check on them when I hear something. 
---
My speakers are low, I'm just running around questing or helping out. 
---
I don't PVP. I think it's fun to help the other faction. It's not what they are expecting. I'll stealth and watch some horde getting swarmed. I'll stealth up and start to save them. Sometimes they see me and instantly start to attack me, even though they are getting swarmed. Not interested in fighting them so i just run or stall until the mobs kill them. But the good ones, they will thank or cheer. Then I'll stick around and help them more. Makes for a fun night. 
---
imo, what class you pick has a much greater impact on your leveling speed, Some classes are just time sinks because of the amount of downtime and slow travel speed before level 40.
---
Tried to check that subreddit out, and it gave me a message saying I couldn't access it. 
---
Blizzard is such a dumpster fire that I doubt Classic will even come out anymore
---
You've got a point there--people probably jumping ship a month in from their Low pop server trying to quit while they're ahead and moving to the High pop server.
---
Probably how bad the balance and itemization were.
---
Take a break private server veteran...sounding psycho 
---
The only reason they are brought to raid early is utility from curses / stones, very low dps.  Locks are good, but not for the reason you would want to play them.  In pvp early they are very squishy and have low damage / burst so they get eaten alive.
---
It was on wotlk, I crafted the 2 handed mace on my palaret for my first raid ever (Naxx) where I got the T7 shoulders. Was so happy. 
---
I can't imagine how much happy you gotta be when you get epic loot in Vanilla, where it's 10 times rarer... Can't wait for the release.
---
To me it feels more snappy and responsive. I have never noticed what you are talking about bc i only use my mouse to turn which also feels better bc dx12 and newer client has less tearing and better fps 
---
Vash'jir for me. It's honestly my favorite zone in the entire game. The beautiful sea life and the music and everything &lt;3.
---
Ally or Horde? Have a toons I'm leveling both sides
---
Nah, she teleported away. She was hurt though, always something. 
---
Alliance killed the Zandalari king at least. 
---
Surv scale way better with any naxx gear, the agility gain from it with BoK buff is slightly above 25%. And 1 agi = 2 AP, more crit chance and for PVP more dodge. But since we talk about PVP - deterrence, 10% more hp, surefooted, savage strike (I used to crit for 2k with raptor on clothers with eye of the nerub).
---
Sodapoppin sodapoppin
---
You could set up your audio to have game sounds come out the speakers and then voice coms through an earbud that you put in one ear or something.
---
that utility is exactly why it's silly to say that they suck early pve
---
3 month account that spews alt right talking points and claims to be a leftist. It is clearly just a fake account that exists to drive a wedge in sensible discussions. 
---
Probably an unpopular opinion, but I loved Vashj'ir in Cataclysm. Thought it was beautiful and an interesting concept.
---
I also had the flip side happen. Being actually sick on a Tuesday was like..."Might as well just go to school, I can't play WoW at home."
---
I got that 2h sword from a Baron run.
---
Bro, if you are EU im in for that Guild! 34 with a kid ahahah
---
Oof
---
I'm 40 with a 9 year old daughter. We've been playing together since she was about 3 1/2. Obviously, the first year or two was just open world stuff like questing and exploring. Now, she has a bunch of max level characters and she is a heroic raider. Luckily, we're in a great, family friendly, "hardcore casual" guild. 
---
I recommend playing WITH your kid, instead of AROUND your kid, if you'd be in to it. It's been a blast.
---
I just found out the staff of Jordan was named after one of the Devs who was largely in charge of class creation and balancing
---
&gt;Activision Blizzard 
---
Activision-Blizzard would have no involvement in how they're going to announce the servers. That would be Blizzard alone.
---
Interesting topic but I disagree -- I think thats fine for mobs, but I wish players were treated differently. Just because someone is higher level doesnt mean they should auto win like that. In fact it would be hilarious to see people get outplayed by someone 20 levels lower than them.
---
I think its already fair enough that they have more spells, higher levels, do more damage, have 3 times the health, can wear better gear, higher dps weapons bla bla bla.
---
No reason for spells to also just Resist Resist Resist. If the higher level player is bad and gets kicked/counterspelled/juked 20 times in a row they should be punished for it in my opinion haha by slowly getting whittled down by the guy doing 5 dmg per hit to hit. This would also make world pvp better since you could have low levels group up to outnumber a higher level and actually be able to punish them instead of just watching everything auto-resist as the higher player keyboard turns and clicks spells lol
---
This is the episode that had me start playing WoW. I loved it.
---
Ganker at 11:35 . I though it was nelf at first but I forgot allied races are now a thing.
---

FTFY
---
Totems, ress, wipe recovery is greater utility than Concussion Blow, Disarm, AoE Fear, Fear Immunity, Intercept Mobility, Taunt, AoE Taunt, Mocking Blow, Disarm, Demo Shout, Thunder Clap, Hamstring and Shield Bash?   
---
Seems pretty questionable if you ask me

When I was playing on a PvE server, it was kind of RPing. If you were Alliance and close to a Horde zone, with PvP on, you deserved to be put down. It backfired a few times though haha
---
On PvP server I got camped a few times because I was too stupid to not go in dangerous places (Nesingwary camp in STV for one...).
---
I spent hours as a middle schooler trying to figure out this 
---
First was a [Nightblade.](http://classicdb.ch/?item=1982) Dropped off the rock elementals in southern badlands. I was estatic when looted it and had dreams of buying something for my mage. I don't remember how much I sold it for, but I remember being very disappointed that it wasn't worth more. My only other drop was a [Taran Icebreaker,](http://classicdb.ch/?item=2915) which was equally disappointing. 
---
hey barcode. Not sure if you've ever been laid but I doubt it. take your negativity somewhere else
---
Yes but having berserker stance will save you more gold quicker than you'd ever lose going out of your way. Like it'll save you drastic amounts
---
One theory about casting Regrowth is that it was too mana intensive for use in raids. But most Druids I have seen on pservers use it anyway, since everyone knows what gear to use, and it's more difficult to actually run out of mana once you get some decent pre-BiS gear.
---
Man I am grateful for the experience Nostalrius gave me ( my first time back in classic ) but I never again want to play on a box where there are 10 people in every area doing every quest. I hope they find some way to make sure at the end of the day each server has a healthy population with no sharding activated, whatever non classic change they need to do for the first few weeks to assure that is fine by me. 
---
Vale of Eternal Blossom.
---
[The Kroll Blade](https://www.wowhead.com/item=2244/krol-blade) was my first epic. Dropped off the big guy that would patrol in Corins Crossing.
---
I started in TBC and my first epic was an alchemy trinket. 54 defense rating if I remember correctly. 
---
My wife is due in about 3 weeks, so I'm in a similar situation as you.
---
I started vanilla shortly after launch when I was a young teen, so a bit younger than others in this thread. So when classic launches, my priorities with the game will be different this time around. The game will still be amazing, just a different play style. I hope I'll have time for an hour or two of playing a few nights a week. :)
---
I hope you and your wife have a a healthy birth! 
---
I really hope that we do have to walk to the bgs.
---
&gt; Or you just have a correctly working dynamic spawn system (not the private server shit) and you don't have any problems at all.
---
You dont want dynamic respawns of any kind. Let me explain... It introduces more resources into the world than originally planned/set when you do this. Sharding does this somewhat also. Thats why sharding and dynamic spawns have to be limited to either just the starting area, or not used at ALL. 
---
If either of them make it into the game in all zones, then theres more wool, linen, leather and anything else mobs can drop or produce entered into the economy and thats a bad thing. There should be a single server worth of limited supplies to keep the economy working properly as intended.
---
Most of us would rather deal with a crowd than to artificially inflate materials.
---
Mine was gutripper on my rogue, and one day I disenchanted it while trying to apply poison. it was horrible.
---
Hunters and Warlocks in my humble opinion.
---
Why only alliance though? Is it because you do not benefit from Windfury?
---
Fiery War Axe dropped off some trash in Uldaman. I begged my group to let me have it and they did. Yes I was a hunter lmao.
---
You see most healers have a ton of mana regen in their gear. Most tanks have a ton of defense so the healers doesn't have to heal as much. A geared holy paladin might never need to drink for an entire dungeon.   
---
Pally tanks have to either wear mana regen, or wear defense. Either way, they end up slowing the raid down due to mana issues for them or their healer.
---
Holy shit I forgot about ultima online. Oh the hours I spent playing this.
---
Is this still played today?
---
Deep Resto is for healing dungeons &amp; early raids. Moonglow is the spec of choice further in the endgame (like AQ40 &amp; Naxx.)
---
Usually it's the top guilds who demand that the Priest is innervated because their Heals/Mana coefficient is greater. For most guilds, it really doesn't make a difference but a lot of players think they will be more successful by emulating the top progression guilds in as many ways as possible.
---
Warlocks get eaten alive by melee until they get reasonably geared.
---
Made this mistake at least 3-5x
---
&gt; No but it will be much more authentic with pre bis gear and blowing through MC in 1 night?
---
People will blow through MC in one night with or without dm gear / 16 debuff limit. 
---
Lmao pally does more dmg than warriors. That is cute
---
Precisely calibrated boomstick for my hunter, I had a bunch of gold saved up after farming iron and mithril ores endlessly to auction off and spent the whole wad on it, probably a waste of time in retrospect but I felt like a boss after I got that gun. 
---
Once the 'harder' raids come out. I.e. AQ40 and Naxx, will we see a kind of barrier hit where the people who aren't putting that time and gold in will largely not see that content?
---
The ideal circumstance is where AQ and Naxx can still be cleared well enough without much consumables, albeit over a much longer duration than if everyone was decked out in them.
---
The other factor is trinkets such as the Darkmoon Card that are very helpful for conserving mana. They become even more valuable as you begin to stack +HP gear.
---
Maybe in some bottom barrel ass guilds that goes on but not in many...
---
Like I've raided with some real casual guilds but even then if you put up a shadow word pain or a mortal strike you're going to get told to stop being a scrub and to cut it out assuming your leadership isn't absolutely terrible.
---
Ofc not this isn't Shadow bane although i wish it was! 
---
No, and no.
---
The only death penalties are durability loss if you die to a mob (none in PvP), and a weakness debuff+major durability loss if you spirit rez at a GY
---
By definition it is, also it was made in korea.
---
There's zero chance these have the same names as other existing servers.
---
Nothing happens to a player when player killed. When killed by NPC's or against nature you lose 10% durability on your gear.
---
I would love it if 10% durability was lost even against players, and the value of that durability was at least in part given in money as loot.
---
I like your comment 40% less than the comment you are replying to.
---
In battlegrounds u can get a small amount of money by right clicking corpses and in av they drop stuff that you can use for av objectives. 
---
AV quests aren't like they were on previous pservers because those used TBC values.
---
It's a decent chunk though.
---
The quests iirc:
---
4quests to loot a opposite faction race, these are repeatables but only the first 2 turn ins give exp.
---
Win a game
---
Get towers/bunkers
---
Get a graveyard
---
Kill the explosive guy, this one can be hard to do though
---
Capture the flag inside a cave, this is really hard because of elite yeti's inside it. You can actually complete it by corpserunning a lot just make sure you avoid getting ressed at the graveyard.
---
Find the 3 dudes quest, 2 of them are in towers, one is kinda randomly located.
---
Kill korrak 
---
I am a dad. My Daughter is 12. She is going to be right beside me exploring Azeroth. Her grades are good and she keeps up on her schoolwork and friends well. We are going to dive in. I am definitely going to run/join a family friendly guild. One that raids later in the night after kids are in bed and things like this. It is how i have always done WoW. 
---
Good way to double the money spent on ammo
---
I feel you, was one of the few Orc Rogues in the raiding scene on my server during vanilla! 
---
And I know exactly what you mean, racials that actually go with the lore like the Tauren tanks. Without the weapon skills there would be many more NE rogues (I think they had increased stealth due to shadowmeld?), would fit lorewise as well!
---
&gt;I think all three (because IAS stacks multiplicatively in Vanilla) you have an attack speed of like 0.4.  Rip your arrow quiver tho.  Fun as hell to go "full auto", your dps is actually really high with all those.
---
The problem is you will keep clipping a ton of autoshots any time you used Aimed Shot, where a slower weapon would hardly ever clip. That means slower weapons can take nearly full advantage of your auto attack damage on top of your aimed damage. As long as the total white DPS remain roughly the same, the slower weapon will always win.
---
I’m not sure but there are a handful of quests. I know on a private server, that the quest to turn in a head of each race of the opposing faction gave a ton of xp 
---
It was my first epic too, it dropped in Azshara off a naga.  Sold for 85g, which was huge deal for my broke ass priest.
---
Cat dad checking in, does this count?  There absolutely needs to be a guild with this premise.  These are the types of people we all want to play with!  
---
On the subject of voice comms, couldn't you just keep the speakers at a low-ish but reasonable volume and keep the volume knob nearby for if/when your daughter comes near?
---
I’m with you. My son is 8mo now. I’ll probably be doing more pvp than pve. Night raiding will be my only option for pve and progression. 
---
Any advice to get my non-gaming wife interested in at least leveling with me? I can play as anything, and she will need something easy &amp; fun to roll as (if we can get that far!). 
---
Hey there, before getting into the topic I'd like to signal I'm very new to Reddit and if there's some etiquette I'm missing on in my replies, I apologize in advance.  
---
Quickly getting your first point out of the way, I wouldn't consider Vanilla WoW to be "hardcore" by the standards of it's release period, given it was very much aimed towards a casual audience compared to others big MMO's of that era.  
---
Other than that, I'm pretty much agreeing with you, to a certain point.
---
I started playing WoW near the release of TBC, maybe 5 or 6 months prior. I didn't get to experience much of it, as it was my big brother's account and he would play most of the time, but I did manage to get a human (yeah I know, not very original) warlock to level 30. I still look back fondly on these days and that whole experience, as it was such a magical journey. I'd watch my brother evolve through the game with his night-elf hunter, exploring the beautiful forests of north-west Kalimdor and then engaging in more exotic places as he got up to about level 50 before TBC.
---
Meanwhile, I'd explore the eastern kingdoms, protect my nation's mines against nasty kobolds, our forests from gnolls, free Westfall from the Defias threat, Protect Redridge Mountains from the mighty Black Rock orc clan, and start exploring the dark, damned forests of Duskwood.  
---
During this entire journey, I loved how social the game was. People would talk to each-others, give their allies a hand. Every item I'd pick up felt like a reward, even the grey murloc scale I'd sell to a merchant for that sweet 12 coppers a piece.
---
I made friends just trying to do quests. I met players who made it their **mission** to avenge low-level players getting ganked.
---
I joined a guild just by looking for a dungeon group! They helped me clean Deadmines so quickly, I was so amazed by how good they were, I asked if I could add them. They just asked their guild-leader to invite me and I still smile when I think of the silly talks in /g.
---
I think certain changes would ruin this fundamental aspect of this.
---
I'm hoping that Activision won't push for in-game cash-shops for mounts/pets, as well as I hope they won't push for level-cap passes.  
---
Ingame shops make certain things trivial. Why would anyone indulge in the world's economy by selling things in the auction house or farming for their mount, when they can just buy a mount for real money, having only to pay for the riding skill in gold?
---
Max-level passes would pretty much just have a heavy impact on the leveling process and social aspect it brings, in my opinion. I guess it's easy to see some players will just want to skip to level 60 and get down in MC, with possibly parties of players all buying level 60 and getting a pretty unfair head-start at cleaning raids before everyone else.
---
I know nothing tells us that this will happen for now, but with the spectre of Activision looming behind Blizzard, I'm very worried that it could be a thing.
---
Sorry if I got a little off-topic, but I just wanted to explain the whys of my point of view.
---
Cheers, OP.
---
i miss numbers like these because they actually meant something, unlike *next xpack* 586,863,206,284 DPS,  *nexp xpack* 953,290,479,128 DPS. I was in the WTF mindset starting with WotLK when crappy greens had better dps than the epics I worked all of BC for. 
---
I think my first epic drop was the [Dwarven Hand Cannon](https://www.wowhead.com/item=2099/dwarven-hand-cannon) from Live Strat during vanilla.
---
iirc i sold it on the AH for a couple hundred gold.
---
Idk but whenever I first started playing this game I was in 4th grade, so this was 2007. I remember staying up too late at night before school to run around the barrens and killing mobs to skin them for Light Leather. I’d do this all night and then fly from the Crossroads to Orgrimmar and sell the stacks on the auction house.
---
I didn’t make a lot of gold but I was 10 and it was a blast
---
You don't benefit from windfury and paladin buffs are just superior for feral (king, might, wisdom)
---
Aw damn, I JUST bought this new pitchfork
---
Being able to beat most grand marshals 1v1 despite only being r8... Those were the days
---
I thought the majority of vanilla players were like this lol 
---
"Thank you next questions please"
---
Wow, give credit to the best speech a dev has ever held
---
Warlocks can AOE grind well with Hellfire. Takes a bit to learn how to manage Voidwalker aggro and a bit dependent on gear, but you basically build aggro with your void for a moment and then Hellfire, the mobs pull aggro towards you like 4/5 of the way through their hp and both you and VW should live through it.
---
Happened for the first time after playing retail vanilla and several vanilla private servers from 2014. It was last year on K3 which was pretty fresh at the time only a month in maybe less. I got stockade pauldrons from the ruins of andorhal and sold them for I think 300g. It was a shame that server died Bc I had epic riding and rank 8 gear very early. I had so much fun tho 
---
it's the staging ground for the first warfront (kind of like a pve battleground) 
---
Most shaman run a hybrid, 30/00/21 spec for serious pvp, haven't seen any pure restos putting out vids
---
I'd like realm forums before release, so I can look for a guild on the specific realm I choose.
---
Wasn’t it in reference to the Stone or Jordan in Diablo II? It was one of the most iconic items in Blizzard’s early history
---
It's beautiful to look at, but I despised playing there. If I wanted to play an underwater game I would play subnortica. 
---
PvP servers while leveling. I’m cool with em while capped but it almost doesn’t justify playing them it so bad
---
He wasn’t the one being negative?
---
Flurry axe. Felt bad ass till i met a hunter the next day dual wielding it....
---
Crafted Lionheart Executioner (iirc, the highest level, 3rd iteration of the weapon) in summer of 2007 after I hit level 70 on my human warrior (main). Didn't start playing until that summer, of course, most leveling content in vanilla was unchanged at that point until level 58 or so.
---
Can’t remember the name. But it was a sword out of sunken temple. Yanked with it all the way through mc I believe 
---
I got the Precisely Calibrated Boomstick, I'm pretty sure from Maraudon, on my Hunter while leveling in Vanilla. 
---
tfw a buyer has been found for your auction and you have a letter confirming your sale while you impatiently wait an hour for your gold to arrive
---
Not to mention there will be 1/10th (or less) the amount of Classic servers as there were original WoW servers. 
---
You can clear Scholo on a main, then invite your alt to the empty dungeon. Not sure if there is an actual lower limit for entering the dungeon though. 
---
Yes that too maybe the Dev was just wanted to puff his chest a little. It was on this countdown to classic
---
https://youtu.be/Rd-Zt8bueFk
---
EQUIP IT! ಠ_ಠ
---
In a hardcore guild I get ur point, but if you don’t wanna raid with them then don’t? They can join a meme spec guild. Nothing selfish about that at all
---
More like sprints away in fear
---
Link to podcast for anyone interested
---
Mine was stockade pauldrons followed by the immovable object.  I hit 60 and was trying to slap together a tank set.
---
You could remember the account name on the 1.12 client
---
Similar to what most of you already said, played vanilla when I was 20ish and now Im married and have a toddler, my play time has been limited to his bedtime.
---
So this time around I'll be focusing on, leveling and pvp for the most part, will try to get into a dung every now and then though.
---
Really hyped because unlike retail I can play classic at my own pace and eventually catch up.
---
Ps: always interested in dads guild if there's any. 
---
I’ve always been able to see those flowers but there’s never enough for the whole group. The warrior quest where you need the iron bar took me like an hour kuz the box was so non descriptive 
---
I glued my copy back together. It took forever to scan that.
---
Archive.org/details/WoWDungeonCompanion
---
Also btw
---
lol lets just throw every abillity in their kit and act like its good. i main a warr and thunder clap, demo shout, hamstring are all pretty much useless in 5 mans 
---
Vanilla orc rogue checking in as well. 
---
Married with child. I hope to get some play time, but doubt I can squeeze more than an hour or two a week in.
---
&gt; busy people who can only play a couple hours a day
---
Yeah, I think alot of OG Retail Vanilla players are going to come back for Classic nostalgia...except now they have a spouse and kids and jobs lol.  I think alot of the Classic population will not have as much time for the game as the first time around and there will be alot of slow levelers.
---
I know, ~~nostalgia~~, but getting a mount at 40 is really a pain in the ass for low mobility classes. No much of questing is just running. Getting one at 20 in wotlk (like a filthy casual) makes the experience so much smoother
---
I have a bad feeling there will be heavy sharding so the server you choose won't matter for months until all the tourists leave or you hit max level.
---
I wish that was a thing, on PvP loot [Gnome Meat] and a recipe for [Gnome Burgers].
---
you clearly havent read what blizzard has said about pvp back in vanilla. every pvp situation has a solution 
---
It is now legit for twinks in bfa bc the proc scales with intellect. Nice that some of the old epics are being used again. 
---
They more than likely will once it gets closer.  I’m assuming they may be on the fence for exactly how many server they are going to use.  Honestly with how unknown the population will be before and after the tourist wave I would guess they need SOME way of finding out how many people will play their game.  Idk how but if the population is astronomically higher than what they plan for they can have issues similar to the really vanilla launch and if the number is astronomically lower than what they plan then they will have dead servers.  Honestly I would love to be a fly on the wall hearing them discuss how they will approach this. 
---
I just noticed the flowers in WC because I saw another player picking them. I also remember missing the mushrooms in Uldaman. TBH I'm very distracted, probably the non sparkling quest items are no big deal for people in general.
---
Trees were more suited for rezzing under cover, mounting up and B-lining it as fast as you can away.
---
If you're referring to the layoffs, you do realize they actually intend on adding developers to multiple games, Warcraft titles included. The number was a 20percent increase.
---
You can hate the business decisions of Activision-Blizzard all you want, but the reality is that there is already a sunk cost with Classic. They stand to gain more by finishing the game than scrapping it 4-5 months before release.
---
Actually a very good pvp helm, 1000x better than a hurricane
---
...I might do that.
---
Itemization can be stupid at times - like +spell shoulders with physical +crit on them, etc. Or cloth items with +Str
---
Farming consumes for 6 hours before each raid. You can play in a casual guild that doesn't require them but then you end up stuck in 4 hour MC/BWL runs and your odds of killing cthun+ plummets. It's like, if I play with good players who won't waste my time I end up wasting my time for hours farming gold bored out of my mind, and if I play with mediocre players I end up stuck wasting time playing extremely inefficiently. It's a lose-lose and it's the communities perception of consumable usage at the top end causing this coupled with a few bad apples who abuse the trust system within guilds.
---
Yup. That's why I don't like to play frost as ally in PvP. I prefer to go elemental for the extra dmg and instants, since your barrier is getting spam dispelled anyway.
---
There were plenty of parents back in the vanilla days. My guild had a couple who were parents with kids not yet old enough to have their own accounts(or even play.)  I think you're wrong about dungeons. The fact that you have three others wanting to play already puts you at the perfect spot to run dungeons at your own pace.  All of you would have an understanding with each other that things might require your attention outside of the game, so if one of you suddenly stops moving in the middle of a dungeon, each of you would get what's going on and there would be no hard feeling if it resulted in a wipe.[This could also be alleviated if you have a Warlock and Hunter that could pick up aggro with their pet or a healer that could off heal, etc.]
---
The couple I played with had no issue running dungeons every night with the rest of us while having 3 kids. The husband was a Warrior and the wife was a Warlock. The rest of us had no problem waiting on them to handle thing if need be. If all of you choose classes that compliment each other and go in with the understanding that things can happen it should be fine.  Plus, what's stopping you from getting your daughter involved? Have her sitting with you watching. It could be a fun bonding time.
---
It really just comes down to proper time management. Don't shirk other responsibilities in favor of WoW and you'll be fine.
---
9 years old, hard core runescape player. My older cousin and his friend were both gnome mages with the  names alakazah and alakazizzle. So of course I wanted to be one with them. They said with 3 pyroblasts on one target would bring anyone down. I would watch them pvp in stv for hours. So I decided to go gnome mage too with the name alakazaa. We had so much fun and yes, 3 Pyros from on a hill would decimate the horde. 
---
Hi, /u/coffeegaze
---
Agree. So cool
---
I agree with you that we are extremely lucky that we are getting a Classic version of World of Warcraft back, and we should definitely all be grateful. However, I tend to disagree with you about "changes". There may be very minor Quality of Life changes that could be made within the game that would still make the game feel just as good as it did back in the day, but if Blizzard was to start implementing major or even somewhat significant changes, this is where I can see problems arise. 
---
One of Blizzard's goals with Classic WoW is to not only keep their current (very small) player-base that they have now, but their main goal I'm assuming is to revive their old player-base. Obviously there is no going back in time and enjoying World of Warcraft how it was to the exact way that we felt in 2004-2007, but there is a way to make Classic WoW feel very, very similar game-wise. 
---
Overall, I feel it is very necessary for Blizzard to make the least amount of changes possible. Creating major/significant changes will most definitely erase the chance that the old player-base will come back. You are right, we should all be happy about WoW's return, but changing the game in certain ways will definitely have negative consequences.
---
Higher **average** damage per hit, not top end damage. Weapon with 90-**100** dmg would be better than 20-**120**.
---
It ended. And we've had to wait 12+ years for it to come back.
---
That's bullshit.
---
Mine was a Fiery war axe https://classicdb.ch/?item=870 , dropped on my hunter from a raptor in stranglethorn vale, i ofcouse equiped it, not knowing it was pretty useless for a hunter :)
---
I didn't throw every ability, I threw every ability that could be construed as a utility ability. There are lots of totems that are equally useless in 5 mans.  Saying a Shaman brings "more utility than a warrior ever could" doesn't seem right to me. Do you disagree?  
---
I think Thunderclap and Demo shout are useful on some pulls. If you charge and aren't going to reach Battle Shout on your whole group, they are good for AoE threat and reducing healing aggro if nothing else.  
---
The spells aren't useless in 5 mans, if you ever needed to reduce damage you could use them. But, its just that they are unnecessary since you tank right through all the damage anyways. A bunch of shaman totems basically do the same thing, reduce damage. 
---
This is my experience as well... hoping I can find something similar this time around as it was a great experience the first time.
---
Still better than nothing.
---
Great idea! Now on top of wasting your time, gankers would also eventually break all your gear for 200% more fun!
---
Joanna played Horde because he didn’t know Alliance was faster. There was very little competition for him in the speedrunning department back then. Starting zones matter tremendously, as was already said getting ahead is a huge deal if you want to push server first or one of the first to finish. Never mind that Hunter’s are very efficient grinders so you can make up for any deficiency in questing post 30.
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=19356
---
Getting this staff was the highlight of my wow career.
---
8 months I sat waiting for it to drop. Eight months. I didn't miss a single raid night out of fear. The next best weapon, has literally HALF the stats. That's right. You go from roughly 40 spell damage and 1% crit in your weapon/offhand slot to double that. It's a massive dps upgrade and pretty much the best item you can get as a caster until AQ is released (again roughly 8+ months between BWL and AQ)
---
If that's not an exciting weapon I don't know what is. You can literally feel your character grow in strength when you equip it.
---
Earning this weapon from your lootcouncil is a right of passage. It shows how dedicated you are to your guild and the game. When you see someone walking around town wearing it you know they're a badass and you know they'd kick your ass in a 1v1.
---
Stat sticks can be interesting if done right.
---
Your ideas for play are pretty spot on with how I’ll be approaching Classic, OP. My little one is still a newborn and I don’t intend to, nor do I currently, play while she’s awake, which makes my play time reserved for odd hours and unpredictable. 
---
Still super excited to adventure through the old world again but I probably won’t see the inside of Molten Core or Blackwing Lair, but that’s totally okay with me!
---
Hopefully I bump in to some other fellow parents with a similar mindset once Classic launches
---
I sincerely hope they have an RPPVP server. I played on an RP PVE server during retail vanilla, but that's only because the game launched without RPPVP servers. I really missed out on a lot by not being able to experience PVP in the same way.
---
I hated the idea of sharing until I played a pserv recently.
---
Even if it was up to level twenty, my god, it’s an all-out struggle and battle royale to get your westfall quest collectibles (much less monster kills, which hopefully they accept your group invite for).
---
Colluded with a Horde Warlock (Human Warlock myself) through emotes to lock down Jadefire Run for the two of us for most of a week. Splitting it north/south gave both of us enough demons to clear with little downtime. If someone tried to butt in, whichever of us was hostile would jump them after the other played Banish tricks to make them over aggro. I can only assume it got him as much of his Felcloth gear as it did me.
---
Yea there are PvP gloves that prevent you from getting your Searing Pain casts pushed back when you get hit.
---
Zappyboi the human female paladin for the /r/mildlyinfuriating element.
---
What kind of leveling strategies exist for low levels outside of the starter areas? On a pserver it took me nearly an hour to finish the quests in the Valley of Trials because mobs were all camped.
---
Vanilla had a 60fps cap, not 64.
---
some sort of quel'thalas.  it was weird how high/blood elves were the focus of half the UD campaign and received a dedicated campaign in TFT yet were basically absent from wow.  even if they weren't a playable race the zone would have been an amazing max level only place with silvermoon city/sunwell grove replacing naxx as the undead raid for the final tier. 
---
The only way that would work is if they didn't stream at all. People will identify streamer servers immediately by simply armory searching the names of all the players they see on the twitch stream.
---
&gt; Easy way to avoid streamers. Classic launches, wait literally 10 seconds to see what server they select, select a different one. Bam problem solved
---
Exactly. I can't understand why people are acting like these streamers are difficult to avoid boogeymen. Those guys are going to broadcast what server they are rolling on instantly. It won't be hard to avoid them.
---
Hunters can always solo maraudon. Unless they change how aggro radius and mob pats work. No glitch abuse involved.
---
I agree completely.  This is important for allowing people to coordinate, etc.
---
Dungeon queues are gonna be in classic?
---
&gt; For someone that doesn't use Twitch, what would be the best way for me to figure out which server they'll be on?
---
Someone will post a list on this subreddit, guaranteed.
---
As I said in another response, an overlay will do jack shit to hide their server, streamer servers can be easily identified right away by a simple armory search on the names of all the players you'll see on their twitch stream.
---
In a sense, yes.  In a sense that a queue is the line you are in while waiting for something.
---
[I think you're going to like this guide I wrote a while back.](https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903)
---
For reference, it was actually [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GAq6dDKwb0&amp;t=59s). 
---
or just armory search all the names you see on their stream.
---
That's really impressive, I didn't expect to hear a story about the opposing factions working together to accomplish something, but that adds a nice twist!
---
They should at least release names and time zones 
---
My first epic was the T1 Lawbringer helm on my dwarf pally from MC. I rolled a 92 and beat the other two pallys in the raid. I don’t remember my first epic from any other expansion, but I remember winning that helm like it was yesterday. 
---
Ah, I thought you meant group finder queues, not "/2 LF2M Healer/CC" queues. Semantics, 'ey?
---
My own first name. Have it on retail and most games, even had it during the Xbox 360 days of Xbox live. Helps that my name is obscure and not like a 'James' or something. 
---
The fact that it turned into TBC. 
---
The reason why MMORPG's began to die off is because WoW was such a massive success it took most of the players because of its refined and high quality fantasy platform and software, leaving little left for others. Do not confuse that with good game design, because it certainly wasn't perfect in that department, just higher quality, robust even with a heavy popular lore package coupled with it.
---
Then when every other even remotely visionary developer of MMORPG's packed their bags unwilling to fight against WoW, WoW went and fought itself to more or less death as it sits now by eroding even its own simplistic core mechanics and designs from before, into something that now resembles a mobile game or MOBA.
---
The scraps of proto-MMORPG's that we have left now are WoW, SWTOR and GW2 more or less, all of which offer the same faceroll barbie focused gameplay nowadays. There is zero challenge, zero character development, zero compromises required or consequences for decisions made. You are handed everything at every turn, then you throw money at the game to look pretty and play some linear casual often solo story over some hours pressing a button or two and you're suddenly the king of the world, the master of the universe or emperor.
---
I doubt this will be the last good MMO we will see, it just takes someone to realise the market is massively desaturated currently of games that offer meaningful free form RPG/sandbox oriented gameplay. Players are more and more craving the RPG/sandbox elements, which is something that Blizzard decapitated with their overly simplistic approach to MMORPG's while offering other elements of higher quality.
---
I'll likely be happy with classic for a long while, but I sincerely hope there will be a new surge of MMORPG's similar to the more classic era of them, giving deeper character development, freedom and choices with consequences.
---
I sure would. Nothing can make vanilla boring except being on a dead server, lol.
---
"Anyone want to run UBRS or Tribute?"
---
*crickets*

You said "not relevat" which is BS. There is a logical difference between X not being relevant to Y and Y not being required for X.

Same here.

I thought about this yesterday while grinding on my Druid in Un'goro - they can't, but it would be so cool if they did, imo - so much more immersion if that was visible.
---
No cause I never got one. Was still working towards my first mount lol.
---
It was based on both, and Penelope's rose is named after his daughter. So are 1 or 2 other items -- he wasnt the item designer but his coworkers did it for him as a tribute iirc

Karazhan in Vanilla would be best. I also really enjoyed the Ghostlands and Grizzly Hills.
---
Cant warriors just also wear mail? How is a shaman better than a warrior for mitigation at 40? Warriors can wear plate and mail. Sure you have stoneskin. Warriors have shield block, shield wall, Thunderclap and Demo Shout.
---
There's way too many demons in Jadefire to kill before respawns when you're still getting geared, and it's a hell of a lot easier to farm them when you aren't constantly fighting someone else. Think he just came to the same conclusion I did.  
---
Also Warlocks are usually petty bastards and we both knew any non Warlock or Priest who showed up was mostly likely there just to farm gold instead of grinding out early BiS gear.
---
No dual spec. I might get hate for it but I played a druid for part of BC and Wrath and just wanted to be able to tank or DPS and not have to level a completely new character. 
---
That GM was trolling you. He could of given you the bow "soulbound". He gave you one unbound to force you to soulbind it yourself. If you refused, he would of just removed it and left (or given you one that was soulbound, unsure). 
---
That GM has a fine taste of sadism.
---
They lose time. Time is money.
---
So you think you can check what servers all dozens of streamers will choose in "literally 10 seconds"?
---

---
My daughter is 12 now. So I can play a lot more than parents who have younger ones.
---
My biggest issue is that now days I can't sit in front of a computer for more than a few hours at a time. So I will be pretty casual about it this time around.
---
During vanilla I have a huge ashtray full of cig butts, two cases of empty beer cans and empty pizza boxes everywhere. I practically lived in that game. I won't be doing that this time around
---
That makes sense actually. Ores are unrefined (which means there are other minerals than the one you're interested in) and literally cannot be "stacked" efficiently. Bars are "pure" and can be stacked neatly.
---
Did you make this? This was done really well! It brought back a lot of memories for me. Hillsbrad Foothills is definitely the zone where I have most of my World PvP memories. 
---
The editing on the video was done very well! Especially timing the different announcements from Sylvanas and Grand Apothecary Putress. Hillsbrad World PvP is so iconic. Great job!
---
Seriously. Raiding isn't actually hard or that demanding when it comes to actually stats. So-called casual guilds having "hardcore" expectations is annoying.
---
Thats so weird. Why would the only tanking spell for a caster dps class be viable only if you had a piece of pvp gear?
---
Grizzly Hills.   The Landscape!  The Music!  THE MUSIC!!!!
---
I'm maining Hunter myself. It actually wasn't that hard to come to that conclusion. I knew I wanted either a hybrid class or a pet class. That limited me to Shaman, Priest, Warlock, Hunter, Paladin. Hunter was second most viable (next to Warlock), but also wasn't a Rogues bitch. I also have very fond memories of the 1-10 experience in Teldrassil as a Night Elf. 
---
Yes I have a name in mind and am going to try and claim it on as many pvp NA servers I can as soon as launch happens. 
---
Make a macro.
---
//cancelaura mount name
---
//cast gouge
---
No, you can’t....
---
No clue. Each class pvp gloves have some interesting effect like that. Warriors reduces hamstring rage which kinda makes sense for PvP. In practice its used to spam hamstring for Nightfall procs
---
I loved Vashj’ir!   I know many didn’t like the swimming in 3D aspect, but it didn’t bother me.  Gorgeous zone. 
---
fel heart gloves from our guild's first lucifron kill.  Oh man I felt like the big man on the server.. sitting waiting for the zepplin I'd get /w OMG YOUR GLOVES ARE PURPLE!!.. ahh the good old days when stuff meant stuff.

All i can give to you is the hybrid ele/resto spec.

yes, skipping trash was the easy part. i remember the only part that was a small problem was killing baron.  i promise you though my failure rate at most was 2 out of 5.  it was a small enough failure rate that i was not discouraged from farming him. And i was only like 15years old at the time so I probably did not even think of the best ways of doing it. My rogue was my main in vanilla and once I hit 60 with full dungeon set and dal rends, all I did was run around and see what I could do around the world. I experimented a lot with him haha.
---
wow, never thought about using potions and gadgets to stealth by. that sounds very smart :) i hope it works out! 
---
Dont have to play it, if you dont like it. Im still going to have as much fun as the first time i played Vanilla. The grind long leveling, actually having to read the quests lol. 
---
People these days entitled and want the easy route out. Give me wow tokens,give me level boost. I want mount shop so i dont want to do my lvl40 and lvl60 mount quests. Jesus they all sound like little kiddies wanting there dummies all the time. 
---
I want to make a dad guild that raids early sunday morning before everyone else wakes up
---
Respec costs.
---
I hope so. Sounds like a good idea.
---
Yes of course me too :)
---
How can it possible be when you can see everything the game have even GM items etc...
---
Guess u never seen the pserver world...
---
Thanks a ton bro
---
I'm wrong? You're the one being semantic.
---
My hope is that they create new expansions, instead of basically remastering the old ones - or at least stop at Wrath if they do pursue that path. Whatever they do, I would like to see a maintained level cap at 60 with progression being determined some other way. For example, instead of replacing high quality 60 gear with low quality 70 gear, they could create gear that allows for more specs to be viable or that provide the player with some sort of bonus to a particular raid. Like the gear could provide bonuses against fire elementals, old ones, trolls, etc. depending on the raid. 
---
Since PvE is so easy in vanilla you can clear all content with PvP spec.
---
Okay this was amazing! The way you guys hid until they got close and then ambushed them was hilarious - and the amount of skeletons! These are the moments I'm looking forward to having again - even if it wasn't on this type of level in the video. This is the type of stuff that is missing from current WoW - community!
---
My first epic was a Dragon's Call. I was a rogue somewhere in the 50s and a lvl 60 guild fury warrior was running us through ST. 
---
I loved that sword and thought it was the coolest thing ever summoning a whelp to assist you. Sadly the whelp had the ability to target mobs you aren't in combat with which can have disastrous results in dungeons and raids. 
---
lol you want to force tanks to level in tank spec and healers to level in healing spec? That's infinitely worse design than what you're suggesting.
---
Dire Mail: the letters you don’t want.. du du duuuuuu!
---
In December I was 11 trying to get to 12 that same December.
---
Wasn’t playing WoW since I didn’t have a really good Computer.
---
Watched a lot of Yu-Gi-Oh back then and Dragon Ball Z. 
---
Was also good at sports then. Now not so much since I broke my foot twice. Same bone.
---
Now I work in IT which I love. I play a lot of WoW. But get interrupted a lot by my girlfriend. So I hardly do raids and dungeons.
---
I currently started leveling up a Dwarf Priest. I also love my Mage, Warlock and the Hunter. I honestly can’t choose which class I love more.
---
Even better if she plays WOW with you. It dont take much for one of you to stop playing and sort out the kids for 5 to 10 minutes if one of them wakes up etc. 
---
In Vanilla I had young kids i still got in my raid hours, spent time with the kids, went to work, Now saying that there was some really late gaming raiding sessions like lol 330am finish like but it was worth it. 
---
Yeah I’m not a dad but I used to play WOW with my dad all the time when growing up. It was super fun and no problem at all. Rather I’d say it’s a great bonding experience (as many has said already). 
---
- 7,600xp from 4 "kill an enemy" quests (Wanted: ORCS!)
---
- 7,600xp from 4 "kill an enemy" followup quests (Wanted: MORE ORCS!)
---
- 39,600xp from 6 main quests (towers, graveyard, etc)
---
- 9,500 boss quest
---
Roughly 64K xp from collect / capture types
---
An additional 48,000 from rep gated / win quests (6600 - 9950)
---
The first 64k should be somewhat easy to do at ~59, but rep gating means only ~15k of the others can be had in a reasonable amount of time.
---
59-60 takes 172,000xp, so you can AV about 40% of the level.
---
Back whene I made my first tauren warrior the biggest issue I had was playing muted so my parents don't wake up at 1AM.
---
Now I have 2 kids and the least of my problems is going to be playing muted so they don't wake up at 9PM.
---
Mine was the Ardent Hammer. Dropped while leveling in the Hinterlands...originally tried to sell it, but no luck. When I hit 060 on my warrior though, I used it as a tanking weapon until I got the Bloodlord's Defender from ZG. 
---
I loved that stupid little mace... :'(
---
Father of four here, i will definitly invest alot of time in classic if its good. Been playing on private scene 3-4 years now and still play. My wife is gonna kill me but thats ok.
---
Im 35 now and my kids are far away from toddlers. So planning ahead might get me alot of game time action 😊😊
---
BONEMAN 100% wish i could do all caps
---
For the jump down, you can also do this (which I find easier):
---
Stand on the southern lip of the jump down near the corner, and jump diagonally toward the western lip of the jump down such that you scrape the western wall of the lip as you fall. You will agro nothing at level 60, and don't have to wait on the mobs below to be in any particular position.
---
Many streamers are primarily PvP players.. doubt they will avoid PvP servers lol
---
I don't remember my first epic but what I will never ever forget was the moment I got the Quel'Thalas I think it was called? The sword that you need Onyxia to breathe on. 
---
Lunawolf the hunter on Eldre'Thalas in Plundercats, that was my weird online friend that managed to get me into one of their main raids somehow ever though I was just a random non guildie. 
---
I also died so many times and had to be brezzed was so funny and scary at the same time lol.
---
Thanks Lunawolf you made a kid at the time so happy!
---
You should if you don’t want to be on their realm 
---
Easily avoided by prepending the server names with something like "classic-"
---
The jungle zone from WotLK was probably my favorite zone ever. Can’t remember what it was called...
---
Dont forget the mums 😂
---
Which one is baroness and her MC? Sorry it was a long time and I dont remember the MC part. Soloing all bosses up to baron with my human combat rogue were no problem. And i really dont know what else to tell you except to go try it for yourself instead of theory crafting. You can reread my first post to know pretty much exactly what I did to kill baron and you can just try it. Im sure theres some lvl 60 emulator server you can jump on and experiment? Idk, if you dont believe me then fine. I dont write posts for internet points and theres no reason for me to lie. If you just want to run numbers and never actually try, then I guess you will never know. 
---
I tried out retail wow a month back for 1 day. Was given a 1 day pass. I went running around stormwind naked on ULTRA settings and it was BUSY on screen in the main square. I had between 50 to 80fps on 1440p.
---
In the wildness i was getting up till 144fps which hit my limit on my monitor which is 1440p 144hz.
---
I no Classic will be easier to run than retail. Should have no problems running Classic :)
---
I’m only ever in shimmering flats to get the mount speed trinket, or to get honor from the horde there on my way to Tanaris.
---
The same name I use on my pserver, since my guild will move to classic as a unit.
---
Yes but they changed since then. Today if anyone has a negative experience they aim to remove that experience. You can't lift Blizzard values from 2004 and put them into 2019.
---
Aggro Range is gonna fuck me up for the first few days 
---
I wrote that guide, I didn't shoot the video though - that feat belonged to a mage who was in my guild at the time. He was really good with video editing! He made [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aaesJrLyzq0) too, when we went into SW with 2-3 level 60s and a whole bunch of level 30s and 40s to camp the flight master for half an hour lol. 
---
Me and 4 of my longtime IRL Friends are thinking of attempting to name all our characters our actual names. Problem is 4 of us (including myself) have relatively common white person names. So it may not work 😅
---
I'm thinking of rolling mage so if the above doesn't work I'll probably name him after my old retail mage from WotLK: FrostdFlakes (Frostedflakes is 1 character too long T_T)
---
I leveled a horde mage to level 60 and a alliance mage to 50 on nostalrius, and I can say with the highest amount of certainty that horde is faster and much less of a headache. 
---
That actually sounds really cool, like allout war trying to protect/kill the queen.
---
For string matching, yes.
---
Exactly the same boat.
---
Played back in the day now almost 30 married with kids.
---
I will get a few hours a week to play, if I'm lucky. Just levelling and exploring the world again will be what I am looking forward to most.
---
For this reason I am thinking of nelf druid.
---
In December 2004...
---
* I had just turned 8 years old
---
* I was playing WoW on my dad's account, oblivious to anything that I was supposed to be doing. I just ran around aimlessly on my Undead mage. I honestly did not get good at the game (PvP-wise) until WotLK, however in Vanilla/TBC I was able to learn game mechanics fairly well and quest at a consistent pace.
---
Now...
---
* I'm 22 years old and in college - I currently don't play any games as I am excited for Classic to launch and other games are unappealing because of that
---
* I plan to reroll an Undead mage and play it with the skills that I now have from playing WoW for so long - like I said I did not get good at PvP until WotLK, so my experience was different than many since I was so young in Vanilla, but I am looking forward to the nostalgia hitting me, but also having the capability of living through Vanilla again, but as a much better player in general
---
[Zul'Drak](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sc5Oj1WgwwI)?
---
Mine was Taran Icebreaker. It was a 2-handed mace I used with my ret paladin. The dps was good and it had a proc that hurled fireballs at the mob. I enchanted it with firey weapon. Good times 😊😊😊
---
Hurry up Classic!!!
---
yea in high school and college we had all the time in the world to invest in WoW. Now with being a parent things are different, I understand completely on the voice communication problem because I'm a very important aspect of my family and need to be available at anytime. Times change.
---
This is the correct answer.
---
As soon as I read "First Epic" I swear my only thought was also that hurricane!!!! It was mine too!! 
---
saving the gold you earn for your mount at 40, unable to buy the skills you need while leveling.
---
And that staff is broken
---
You too! Good luck with everything, and I hope you can find joy in the game when it comes out - and maybe even have some paternity leave time. 
---
Nerd
---
Yet another dad here! I hope there are enough European daddies around so we can form a guild or something
---
The fact that it would stagger the population is nice, but I think putting a price for early access will leave a bad taste in people's mouths. It really is a one-time pay to win offer considering how far ahead you can get not only in levels, but economically as well.
---
Major difference.
---
- Take a class in English, you mong!
---
&gt;So who the fuck cares if DM was released 7 march and ragnaros first kill was in the end of april, I can hardle see it being authentic to be running dm tributes and getting a bis list ready.
---
Hills don't block LoS either. I actually prefer trees blocking LoS, but I've only seen this on a specific private server. I have no idea if the newer Wow engine used for Classic offers this or not as I haven't played post-Cata for a very, very long time. If something that can be turned off or on then perhaps it's off to emulate Classic even more.
---
Don't think it's the majority until I see it. I did it in 2 Weeks during Winter-break.
---
But we are talking about a summer release and most raids die during summer break for a reason.
---
My best raiding years were from 3.x through 5.x, when my kids were babies.  I don't think anything really changes.  They are in bed by 8:30, so a couple of later-than-8 raid nights isn't going to affect anything.
---
My biggest concern isn't the mechanics of raiding, it's just the personalities.  I don't want to be in  a guild full of people closer in age to my children than to me.   At this point I just can't tolerate the company of a bunch of early-20 somethings.  WoW is social, and we'd be at such drastically different stages of life that it will be too hard to mesh.
---
That, and I don't want my kids reading and hearing a bunch of sexually suggestive, racist, or otherwise profane joking in /g or on discord if they happen to be around me while I'm playing.
---
But if join a raiding guild, I'll either commit to the hours or quit.  I can't stand how many older adults treat the game.  "Sure, I'll raid on Saturday at 8... as long as something better doesn't come up.  I won't tell you in advance and I will patronize you aftterwords for questioning my real-life-first bullshit."
---
"Fresh realm" is ambiguous. The record is based on /played and not calendar time, so Joanna uses tricks like logging off to wait for a hearthstone charge to save his /played.
---
I don't know what the "rules" are, but if the record is based on getting constant warlock summons on demand, that's not different from someone just powerleveling you.
---
And if someone can powerlevel you, then the record should be like 12 hours to 60.
---
Same. I’m literally waiting until I know where the big streamers are going so I can fucking avoid them.
---
I would guess highly unlikely and don't think they should. Not sure why anyone would pay $60 for something we already purchased as well.
---
no doubt fam
---
I think it was either Arlokk's or Thekal's Grasp on my first ZG raid, noone cared for those weapons in my guild and I'd been in love with the idea of playing a fist weapon Rogue when I made the character. After a few more raids the other claw dropped and I could finally (not that it took very long) turn into a badass tiger-person.
---
Hmm... sad because I wanted to grind it on my shadow priest..
---
This is mostly true, because leveling Resto is for those who want to level at the slowest possible rate with no added benefit.
---
You can level as Elemental, even prior to wrath greens, and level far easier than Resto and still heal every single dungeon in the game with ease. Just carry a couple + healing pieces if in game or your Int as Elemental is enough alone.
---
If you want to level as Resto, feel free to do so. It defies all logic however. Just respec later if you want for 1 whole gold.
---
Staff of Jordan, dropped off a buzzard in desolace. I sold it since i wasn't a caster, but it paid for my mount and then some.
---
As for an epic that i actually used, i think that was some dungeon set 2 piece.
---
I'll start. 
---
I was 16. I got the game in December, so not quite at launch. 
---
My first character was a Human Paladin. I leveled him as a Ret pally. I chose the RP server Silver Hand. I wasn't aware what a RP server really meant, so I was very confused on why people were talking the way they did. I got to level 25 or so and decided to make the switch to a PvP server. Played a mage until level 40, then I switched to rogue. I level him to 60, and for some reason wasn't satisfied, so I went human warrior. I was super happy with that and played warrior through the end of Vanilla. I ended up being a guild officer and Off tank for a top guild on my server. Never had any server firsts, but we got close. We were always in second place. I always blamed it on windfury totem, haha. 
---
I was in high school. I played the game way too much. I remember having to wake up for school at 7am to make the bus, but it never stopped me from playing until 5am every night. At the beginning of TBC I added up my /played at it was about 300 days played. 
---
Right now, I only play PoE and pservers. I have never liked or been immersed in a game as much as I was with Vanilla WoW. Pservers are cool and all, but they still aren't the same as vanilla.
---
When classic servers launch, I'm going to play Paladin or Warrior. My main goal in Vanilla was always to get either Sulfuras or Thunderfury. Both of which my guild got, but both went to the MT and guild leader. I thought it was kind of scummy. I am going to continue that goal and attempt to get one of those this time around. (I always wanted Ashkandi too, but after the several runs it never dropped from my guild.)
---
Nah, just did some googling and I was definitely thinking of Scholozar Basin
---
Ragnaros is serious business.
---
I answered this comment 
---
&gt;
---
You do realise that mc was never cleared prior to dm being released. And if I'm not mistaken EU servers were released when dm was out.
---
&gt;Waiting until mc is cleared before releasing dm wouldn't actually be an authentic vanilla experience.
---
I was still not talking about a authentic experiance, you started talking about it and saying i advocate.
---
&gt;I am not worried about keepit it 100% authentic, 
---
This is me saying i am not worried about keeping it 100% authentic. Not sure how me answering you about not keeping it authentic is advocating for keeping it authentic.
---
In 2004...
---
* 19
---
* Yup, picked the game up the week of release.  Played on a PvP server (Blackrock initially, I think).  I did a brief stint as an Undead Warrior (got to about level 15 I think) before switching to a Human Paladin, which was my first 60.
---
* I was about a year out of high school.  Working full time, living at home - worked at a fire alarm company doing building inspections.  We usually started early, so I was typically home by 2 or so.  About 6 months later, I started working an office job at a new company and would get home around 4:30.  WoW was basically my only hobby at the time.  Came home, loaded WoW, and played until bed - every day.  It was epic.  Those were the days of downloading music, movies and...other things...off Kazaa, etc.
---
* 34 years old.  Married for 11 years, still working at the same company, no kids.  Dabbling a bit in various games (Overwatch, HotS, Rust, Civilization 5/6, etc.), but nothing's consumed me like WoW did, which is probably a good thing.  Aside from WoW, hobbies mainly consist of traveling and eating out.  Big time foody with a great friend circle that loves doing the same thing (three other couples - only one kid between us all).  I'm ridiculously stoked for WoW.  Planning to take a week off at release and level up a Gnome Mage.  Also considering a Paladin or Warlock, but I think it'll be a Mage.  My true love is a Warrior MT, but I just don't have the life circumstances for the time commitment that I feel like a raiding MT requires/deserves.
---
It depends on server capability, if your choices are a sharded AQ event or servers that are constantly crashing, they're probably going to pick the sharding. Hopefully modern server technology won't require sharding for the AQ event.
---
Clearly the only option is ditch the wife and kids . They will only hinder you in getting r14 ! 
---
**In 2004...**
---
* **How old were you? old**
---
* **Were you playing WoW? If so, what race/class? yes originally a gnome mage**
---
* **What was going on in your life?** college life for IT, out of a long relationship, music anime, lotr soundtrack, wow's OST, Ultima Online midi's... lot's of lan party's at my friends appartment... lots of $5 dollar domino's pizza... dnL (7UP - surge like drink)
---
**Now...**
---
* **What are you doing now?** IT, married w/ kids... kids game wife doesn't , lately been playing Battle Royales, Magic:arena, LoL .... waiting for classic...same music with some pink floyd, 90s rap, smashing pumpkins added in. Going back to my favorite character i had in vanilla... Troll Shaman as a main. Tons of ALTs too
---
The only hard facts I’ve stated are - by your concession - loot trading and sharding. Regardless of sharding being limited to starting zones, it’s still coming in some aspect. 
---
So that’s two hard facts. Which is more than enough to suggest that we’re only relying on baseless speculation. Funnily enough, it’s the exact opposite of baseless speculation.
---
Wouldn’t you agree?
---
Epics were hard to come by for me. I think I had an epic bow drop in Tyres Hand, and sold it for mount money. But I ended up grinding out rep for The Unstoppable Force from AV. Didn't help tho I still sucked lol
---
Would be against ToS for sure. 
---
Np
---
Ya other than the progression patch plan (never seen originally or on private servers). Other than being built on a completely different engine. Other than being patch 1.12 the entire duration of it's existence. Other than sharding to be used in noob zones at launch.
---
Ya ... NO CHANGE !1!
---
It's a f'ing fps cap limit due to tech limitations of the time. NOT a game play design element. Classic is on a completely different engine which means what ever fps cap is in place (if any) is 100% independent of the original issue. This means a 100% chance of change.
---
Mine was the Lawbringer helm from MC. 
---
I was currently wearing the usual mismatch of assorted colored healing gear of every armor type and that bright yellow helm looked hideous, but you bet your ass I had that helm on display because I was so proud of having an epic. 
---
I actually don't remember the official launch date.
---
I had already been playing Wow beta for nearly 6 months and it's all a blur.
---
As Lobster said, this sub does not represent the entire population of people interested in Classic.  Most of the people on this sub are probably dedicated fans/hardcore players.  Don't let the (seemingly) majority opinion of people who will be using leveling guides to reach 60 in 1-2 weeks discourage you or make you think you have to reach 60 within 2-4 weeks or you'll be "left out".  Far from it.  Find people who enjoy the same leveling process you do.  Enjoy playing 1, 2, or even 3 alts.  Figure out what you want to make your experience out to be and have fun with it! :)
---
"pushing their late 30s" ---
---
Try pushing late 40s, amigo. 
---
Good luck finding a guild - I think you'll find plenty of folks that will fit the bill just fine.
---
Grizzly hills is my favorite zone of all time. Music really sealed it for me
---
The Green Tower! Got it from a mob in stranglethorn and I was so blown away I thought I was made for life.
---
Don't level as elemental. Enhancement is far more effective for leveling.
---
Hopefully others have good examples of resto sham pvp videos per your request, but I just hoped to mention this and save you a lot of time down the line.
---
Ayy, was looking for a fellow Kang user!  That was my first as well.  Except, I bought it because I didn’t know about itemizing better and leveling optimally.
---
Thanks for the thought but I'm not choosing spec for what is most effective, but for what I want :) 
---
Has Blizzard ever offered early access?
---
There’s your answer. 
---
Avenger's Shield is the BC 41 point protection talent. And it is the Best Ability Ever.
---
Sounds like my experience leveling!
---
Honestly, I don't remember. I'm 99% sure I never got one while leveling, so I think my first one was from MC. Some piece of Earthfury probably.
---
Someone leaving a dungeon group mid-clear. If you didn't have a lock you're just fucked
---
Mine was ardent custodian. It's a tanking mace around level 35 it dropped in ulduman and my holy priest friend rolled on it and won because he needed that armor.
---
Yeah are you ME? Haha. This is my gaming life now. And I have no regrets ! 
---
oh I would love to level before everyone else without having to deal with the masses, then have a lvl 60 character to gank all the newbs with while they try to level....yeah that'll never happen.
---
One of us! One of us!
---
I fully intend to play at least one character of every class. What's more, I have a weakness for meme specs. I'ma have an arcane mage, elemental shaman, ret and/or prot pally, survival hunter and, last but certainly not least, [THUNDER CHICKEN!] (http://www.wallpapermania.eu/images/data/2013-03/4601_The-world-is-mine-the-powerful-bird.jpg)
---
...except, y'know, mine will have awesome horns instead of stupid antlers and freakin' pointy ears. Sadly, I couldn't find any suitably epic artwork of a tauren boomkin to link.
---
Ill be a dad by the time Classic releases, and the best part is that since my Fiance is a nurse and the cost of living here is prettype.. we have thrown the idea around of me working only part time and mostly being a stay at home. Raiding would be on the table as well since I can do that when they're asleep/the lady is home. 
---
Super stoked!
---
The classes I've seen hit 60 fastest on several vanilla servers were most often (as is nearly always):
---
Mage, Hunter and Feral.
---
Warlock levels very easily, but there leveling dps is about half that of the 3 classes I listed (mage being unique due to aoe grinding). If warlock hit 60 1st it would mean that the server, very oddly didn't have any hardcore mage players. An extremely rare occurrence considering the number of mage players.
---
they've also never re-released a WoW game before.
---
Certain classes benefit from 39 and 49 twinking as well.  (Shaman and Druid I believe)
---
So then you won’t be able to as there are no changes being made 
---
I've thought of something similar that would leave the gear at level 60 but would remove the level cap entirely and allow you to very slowly earn additional levels that would give diminishing stat returns.  It could really open up the RPG aspect of the game if explored properly.
---
Yes, it is coming in some form. My point is that the baseless speculation is that they're going to expand it when they have, in fact, stated the exact opposite of that.
---
The point I'm making is that we can be cynical and assume Blizzard is going to fuck it all up (such as the original person I responded to was getting at) or we can listen to the guy who has actually been in the same room as the people who are working on this. Unlike us. And who no longer works there and so has no incentive to tell us it's going to be largely "no changes" when it isn't.
---
It would be silly to expect absolutely no changes. But as long as the changes are very minor and non-impactful to the gameplay then it isn't a big deal. Loot trading is the only described change that could be impactful, and I've already conceded that.
---
Yes this is exactly what I’m doing. It’s going to suck not rolling and knowing every second that passes people are getting further ahead and you’re further behind (at least that’s my mindset).
---
I never went to wintersprings 
---
In stranglethorn valley, as I was playing Alliance, a Horde hunter gave me direction to taim a rare mob without me asking for anything (obvisouly we couldn’t talk to each other). Everytime I was going in the wrong direction he would attack me. Turns out by the time we arrived to the mob, it got killed. 
---
Late Wotlk, I switch to Horde side and joined his guild were I got a few realm first and top 5 FR
---
I'd have to see what quest lines are in Classic earlier than expected. It seems that if an alliance player knows their quest very well, they can level very fast.
---
It's a hard time predicting who is faster as it depends nearly entirely on the player BUT horde does have far more convenient hub and FP locations. This is a huge deal for non-travel power classes.
---
It's a minor thing, but access to crafting mats by faction.  If you're leveling cooking for instance, there are plenty of locations alliance side to farm crawler meat or boar ribs to get you above 125, but if you're horde, you have to venture deep into alliance territory to get them.  Same for access to other mats like iridescent pearls.  It's not that the two sides should be mirrors in respect to what they have access to, but they could have at least attempted some amount of balance.
---
Yikes
---
 My understanding was that they were Horde on the previous private server, but all went Alliance this time because they wanted to.
---
Hey OP, can you provide a link to said site/area?
---
Like artifact weapons, basically? 
---
This could be a way to let people who really like (just making random shit up here) enhancement but elemental is at base 60 better. They could "overlevel" their enhancement spec so that it would eventually be on par with a regular 60 elemental. This way, while an over leveled ele would still be better, the over leveled enhance would be better than a standard 60 ele. There are definitely other options to explore, but this could help. 
---
There's a lot fo be said for developing a "feel" for your spec. The timing on an Improved Healing Wave is going to be very different than the timing for an untalented one. Totem placement without Totemic Mastery will be different. Managing your threat properly is different with and without Healing Grace is a thing. It's easy to forget about panic buttons like Nature's Swiftness so you want to incorporate that into your play style ASAP so you get used to it.
---
And then there's the whole notion that not everybody plans on rushing to 60. If I roll a healer, it's because I want to fill that role. I don't want to wait for 60 for my game to start, my game IS leveling up 1-60.
---
I am not even a dad (possibly next year), but my lifestyle is the same. 
---
Recently married, I fit in time on a private server to scratch the itch when I can to play without snubbing my wife too much.  
---
I would love to connect with a group of individuals with a similar lifestyle so I can run dungeons and level with a chill group.   With it being a classic server, the slow pace could even open up to a raid here without caring of falling behind due to new content.   Raiding won’t be a huge expectation but would be cool.
---
This might be one of the top three dumbest posts I’ve ever read. 
---
Sorry not sorry
---
Zach - Tauren Shaman  
---
Lanky - Troll Mage  
---
Zarrtek - Orc Warrior  
---
Munch - Undead Rogue  
---
Aside the impacts a head start would have on the server, there's zero chance it'd be a $60 price tag even if they did offer. Way too much.
---
Any form of preorder is anti-consumer cancer. Don't fall into this garbage. Don't try to rationalize why it would be good. It's used to get money before someone figures out the game is trash.  Early access is a way for devs/publishers to defend themselves from any kind of criticism because "it's not a final version bruh, they'll fix everything wrong with it!".
---
 It's all lies and paper shields but at least it'll get some white knights to buy into it. This company sold a mount for 6-month subscription and now is spitting out cash shop mounts every month. If you don't hold them tight they will treat you like garbage.
---
One method people will use is leveling via exploration. You can use this to boost to 6, then pick up your skills and be on your way.
---
I believe it was [Alanna's Embrace](https://www.wowhead.com/item=13314/alannas-embrace) if I'm not mistaken.
---
I was apparently 21 In december 2004, and I was playing WoW having swapped to it straight from FF11 at it's launch.  Was a night elf hunter.  
---
I was in the US Army at that time, stationed in Fort Bragg, NC, having came back from a deployment in Kuwait for 9 months and was ultimately waiting for my getting out of the Army around May 2005.  Had no other relevant hobbies at that time.  I do recall ordering pizzas periodically during both WoW and FF11 binging.
---
Now I work in IT, I'm not much of a regular gamer but I do like playing racing simulators with a full sim setup.  Also like some Splatoon 2 from time to time.  I apparently quit WoW back in 2005 after getting both my hunter and also a human mage to level 60 and went back to FF11.  Haven't touched WoW since.  While I'd love a proper fresh FF11 do-over that's not happening in any official capacity, but since it is happening with WoW seems like an exciting historical moment to relive the birth of a brand new server of a game from the old school era.  Currently planning on Playing as a Tauren Shaman, both being a faction I haven't really leveled on before and a job I know basically nothing about.  
---
I got a mail hand.... On my druid and I rolled for it as need... Didnt get kicked from the dungeon group
---
There’s no option to turn off pvp in pvp zones dude. Yes you can turn it off, but thats only works in specific places/zones
---
Too many to list, considering I've played on pvp private servers for 3 years. Many great fights back in original Classic too ... fun, but at a FAR lower skill level than I obtained on private servers.
---
I have a blast playing an Alliance hunter around Hillsbrad and the zones in that area once they can train prowl for cat. Playing a stealth hunter is one of my open world pvp classes.
---
My all time favorite pvp fun was BGs as my warlock with my rl friend's shadow priest. We had about t2 level gear at the time (a pvp friendly mix) and in some WSG games just the 2 of us often camped nearly the entire Alliance team at their graveyard.
---
They could even touch us. It was a fear bombing, shadow laden massacre.
---
I was going to say Fiery War Axe!... but remembered my Dad had mailed it to me and I used it on my hunter lol
---
My first drop would be the Eye of Flame epic monocle that dropped off one of the pirates outside Booty Bay. My old Mage looked badass
---
In retail, which is what im referring to.  If you dont want pvp, you can turn it off
---
Im going to be at parent leave around when classic drops. Hopefully my one year old will have adapted to a sleeping redgiment by then so i can play after she fallen asleep. I also have my son to worry bout tho. But Perhaps he can play with me, he Will be 6 aroun then
---
That’s all fine, but my only issue with what you said narrows in on your statement that cynical people are relying on ‘baseless speculation’.
---
Let’s focus on just that, considering it’s all I’m going back and forth about here. Just to summarise where we’re at:
---
I’ve said that’s not so, as North said we’ve received tangible evidence that suggests changes are incoming. This where you said nay, we have nothing but baseless speculation.
---
I backed that up by suggesting that the chats about Sharding and Loot trading are the opposite of baseless speculation and would bolster North’s argument that we’ve received tangible evidence that changes are coming.
---
You agreed that, yes, sharding very much so appears to be coming in some way and Loot trading is definitely coming after what we’ve heard.
---
I then basically asked would that not then remove the term baseless speculation that you used. 
---
However, now you’re saying effectively that the baseless speculation you were referring to initially was actually the thoughts among people that sharding would be expanded in use beyond starting zones.
---
But that was never talked about or mentioned by North or yourself before I jumped in with the query over the use of the term baseless speculation.
---
I feel like the goal posts have been moved a bit to suit an argument after the fact.
---
Got it from this thread https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/7zvvx3/classic_wow_discords/?st=JSF0ZFID&amp;sh=0aeec581
---
Hell with those no-lifers. They formed a "mafia" with the mods of that latest unnamed server and it make the whole realm trash.
---
Kind of a weak argument. I would take the mage in a 5 man over any dps class bc of their utility. But like a warlock or hunter vs a kitty, not really a big deal to take the druid. Battle res is nice in a pinch.
---
I remember my first blue dagger that i bought for my 18 rogue for 2g (all i had), because i thought id be a sick twink. Unfortunately it had intellect and spirit but i was still happy AF
---
This would just simply not work. It is literally the equivielent to buying some version of BFA, but those people get to get to play earlier than the rest. How does that work for server firsts and such? It completely erases that aspect. 
---
As one post said previously, one of the dumbest posts i've seen here.
---
We visited Mount Hyjal basically as it was in vanilla (apart for the big crater that became the horde encampment where you fight Kaz'rogal and Azgalor) during TBC in the Hyjal Summit raid, way before Cata.
---
Cata introduced a pretty different Hyjal. The map's layout looks the same but the biomes are completely different and it didn't gave me that vanilla Hyjal feeling at all, mostly because half the zone is devastated and burning because of some Ragnaros shenanigans.
---
It was quite the bummer since wall jumping my way into Hyjal is one of my fondest memories of vanilla WoW when I was a teenager, just like I have vivid memories of Hyjal Summit and my very first Archimonde kill.
---
It aint Blizzard anymore though...
---
because they initially designed the game as a whole, expecting players would take part in the entire game.
---
having 'bis' items from 5-mans, or a raid, or crafting, or pvp, made sense.  if you didnt participate in all of it in some way, you would never get all the best stuff.
---
but people complained they didnt want to have to do raids for top shelf pvp stuff, didnt want to have to pvp for a strong item, etc,...so changes were made.
---
Aqua form will be an excellent choice for dodging unwanted pvp, especially if you’re a Nelf :)
---
No.
---
Not really. Even most turn based RPGs where the player's options to outright avoid damage are limited can be beaten at extremely low levels. Check out some low level challenge runs on youtube.
---
MMOs are generally much more tightly balanced so they are an exception, but even then in some MMOs low level vs high level fights are more reasonable, like what a physical DPS experiences in PvP in WoW. Crushing blows, glancing blows, and high spell resist make fighting higher level mobs suicide unless you're a hunter that can just kite indefinitely and aren't affected by glancing blows. And it's pretty unfair that casters have to deal with the same high spell resist in PvP while physical DPS don't have glancing blows.
---
Maelstrom deck.  I used that through level 70.
---
most annoying thing is probably lack of dual spec, at least for me. i don’t like being bound to 1 spec for long 
---
For the 20 minutes we got to spend in it
---
That last paragraph exhausted me. Mine is 10 months right now, and I thought he was a handful
---
.02 percent to crit so imbalanced. 
---
Ah the picture that led my brother to play pick hunter at first, thinking they shoot huge fireballs. Only later did we notice the tiny gnome mage in the background.
---
Couldn't you use it as an insta-hearth?
---
There really is everything on the Internet 
---
Bow of Searing Arrows for me, on my warrior back in 2005.  Dropped off the Naga in STV, in the jungle near the beach, north of Booty Bay.  I was so god damned happy to get an epic!
---
Then on Nost, on my hunter - same area of STV and same mobs, Bow of Searing Arrows AGAIN!  Not as amazing as the first time it dropped 12-13 years prior, but a nice callback to those days.  What are the chances of that?  Both were good days.  
---
Dragon’s Call, I think
---
&gt; Battle res is nice in a pinch.
---
In Vanilla? Not at all. Battle Rez is really weak for leveling / 5-man content. The problem with Battle Rez in those cases is that when a tank or healer dies it's because of overpulling, which results in a full party wipe no matter what.
---
Rezing the tank just to have the whole party wipe anyway is pointless.
---
Warlocks give you summons and cookies. Hunters are okay, but at least they're ranged and not melee like Ferals.
---
Really, Ferals are not DPS. They're Hybrid DPS. 
---
This falls under #4, no cheats/exploits. The answer is that it's almost assuredly against the ToS, and rightfully so. On top of that, it's subjectively a jerk-move to take a name purely to sell it, IMO.
---
Awesome! I love Hillsbrad for World PvP. Everyone seems to enjoy it there. 
---
I forgot about GY camping! It's a great feeling when you're dominating a team so bad that you can just GY camp them the rest of the game.
---
Mine was a warden staff on my druid. I think I was given it by a friend who knew how good it was. Never left my bag through Vanilla :)
---
Lei of Lilies from Ungoro Crater for first world epic. It wasn't very good.
---
Ohh okay sorry, I misunderstood it.
---
The cinematic and the start with the dwarf hunter made me roll one, I got to Kharanos then I saw a druid and I thought bear form was so cool, it was then I decided I was going to main one.
---
Early on in Vanilla we had a Shaman tank up until SM.  That's when he started to struggle.  That was 1.1.  Not sure how it was 1.12.  I'd imagine since the dps is higher, it'd be more feasible to go beyond that.
---
I sense the formation of a new guild!
---
I forget if that's considered a "spell" in vanilla. I think you could. I'm not sure I'd call that a good build, but sure, heh.
---
So correct. Hopefully, the vocal pserver folks will cry and whine and go back to their cesspools when classic is vanilla, and not their broken recreation.
---
Overpulling doesn't mean a wipe no matter what. Maybe if you are bad it does. Battle res on healer or tank from a kitty has saved a wipe for me in the past.  Summons and cookies vs Battle Res, Mark of The Wild and innervate. Idk man kitty druids arent as bad as you are saying.
---
You're in luck bc you can play a druid again and tank or dps with the same spec.  Just have to have two sets of gear. 
---
From a lore standpoint, totally! Probably also from a practicality standpoint, like you said :)
---
Hey, me too! I loved that dungeon. I was playing a hunter though. I like to think that no one needed the swords but I honestly cannot remember that far back. I still have it. 
---
Even back then I knew it was not very great especially for a ranged class, but it was still a purple. 
---
1. I see dungeons being a challenge for leveling, once there is a core mass of endgame players, you will be knocking out Strat Baron runs in no time. 
---
2. I know some guys that were in one time zone, but would raid on a work off day with ppl in a diff part of the world that raided at a time that worked for them. That or you find a late night raid and hit it up once a month. For a while I ran BWL and ZG with my guilds alt raid with my main, so you had a solid group of ppl that new the fight mechanics, and there was a good bit less purple envy because they were gearing alts. 
---
I think the 10 man raids and ZG are totally do able for the working man/woman with a family. In fact, I am willing to bet a lot of ppl will be in our situation, and will be running 2 hr raids a few nights a week. Maybe not full clears, but down some bosses, have some fun, and get some gear. 
---
3. Microphone. When I started NP school, I got a single bluetooth earbud. That way I could listen to lectures (or stream twitch) and still have an ear open for mom and kiddo. Id recommend a step up and get a bluetooth headset for one ear with a solid mic. Truck drivers are the key market for these products. They all use them and swear by them. 
---
Im gonna spend most of my time in end game dungeons with 2 hour clears, and org pvp, till the good endgame stuff is on farm status and ppl are confident in their roles and strats. Even then, im thinking mostly Ony, ZG, and some MC for a long while.
---
Somehow i hate this idea but would absolutely pay if there was esrly acceess. 
---
But record profits
---
&gt; Battle Res, Mark of The Wild and innervate.
---
Which is why that Feral is going to be the healer.
---
&gt; Idk man kitty druids arent as bad as you are saying.
---
Yeah, and Shaman tanks pre-30 dungeons aren't as bad as everyone is saying. That's the point. Their effectiveness is within very, very narrow applications.
---
Ferals are great... for Restos who want to level effectively.
---

I will never forget the first time I saw an epic drop and likely my wife won't let me forget the story either. I believe this took place in very late Vanilla/Early TBC. Her and I were questing in Tanaris and I recall riding our mounts to a quest and nearly being there one of us got knocked off our mount by a mob. We both dismount and ended up killing 2 or 3 mobs that had aggro'd. I start mounting up again and she was running over to one of the mobs to loot it. I remember telling her to just leave it, let's get going and finish this quest. The loot ended up being, I believe, the epic Freezing Band ring (that had a chance to freeze enemies attacking you). I could not believe the luck. Me telling her to just leave that one corpse and getting a world drop epic. I don't think I'll ever live down being that wrong.
---
Maybe it's a dumb idea that popped into my head and I wanted to see what everyone thought but...
---
Server firsts? You think a few days early access will affect server first MC? Nef? The AQ gates? Relax. Besides there won't be Achievements to keep track of.
---
I'm not moving goal posts, and you're being oddly honed in here.
---
North expressed dismissal of Ythisen's comments. I pointed out that all sorts of baseless speculation is being made, and I'm more apt to side with Ythisens. At no point was I contending the confirmed changes that are coming. Apparently I should have been more clear that I was referring to a larger sentiment, then you'd be more happy?
---
Are they for sure linking the armory? I figured they would but haven’t heard a confirmation.
---
Yes, preach it.
---
Horizontal content to fill out gear that is missing to enable more specs to be "viable"
---
Oh is that what it was? Thought it was a weird looking Draenie or something.
---
Sounds like Project 1999 is right up your alley. 
---
Not being able to play it, currently. 
---
This is true, but aimed shot isn't really that valuble when leveling.
---
Most hunters just go BM spec to have their pet do the lion share of damage while they just need to focus on keeping a relevant bow, quiver and ammo.
---
Ok, Magtheridon-Classic (NA PVP) instead of the retail Magtheridon (NA - PVP) or Magtheridon (EU - PVP)
---
They will all have a unique server ID in which the actual name is irrelevant.
---
170-190 Damage 1.5 attack speed
---
.... 120 dps. Math checks out.
---
I would say that Ferals are more on par with other DPS than a Shaman is on par with other tanks. I could care less about pre-30 dungeons. 
---
?
---
December 2004 I was 14 (almost 15), in high school, and got WoW on Christmas eve. Boy did I not realize what I would be in for.
---
I actually agree with your comment on Blizzard balancing.  The rotation of nerfs and buffs in Overwatch is intentionally designed to generate continued discussion about the game.
---
"Hey man have you seen the new Mercy, so OP?"
---
two months later...
---
"OH Mercy got nerfed she sucks now how about that new junkrat?"
---
Has Blizz ever offered classic servers before? No. They were against having characters on the same PvP &amp; PvE servers until they weren't. Same with PvE to PvP transfers. Point is there is no telling what they might do to maximize profits in this current climate.
---
I think most everyone falls behind rank 14 pvp gear once it's upgraded and you are a full tier or 2 below it.
---
At all tiers, I have seen hunters WRECK people in pvp (yes they are heavily mitigated by high armor classes but they wreck clothies). The PRIMARY issue with hunters isn't the class, it's the player.
---
Hunter is a very high skill pvp class. There is a reason why a server can be flooded with hunters, but only a small handful per faction side will ever gain any real recognition in pvp. Druid is somewhat similar too.
---
Hunter can be incredibly fun, but this includes the hefty learning curve vs every class. Hunter game play in pvp must be perfect or they may come across to many as a weaker pvp class when this is entirely not true.
---
Amazing fun in open world pvp, AV and AB. Not my fav in WSG but could just be me.
---
&gt; I would say that Ferals are more on par with other DPS than a Shaman is on par with other tanks.
---
Yeah, it still doesn't make Feral Druid *not* a Hybrid-DPS with limited effectiveness outside of leveling and PvP.
---
Yes and no. If I remember correctly there were cat and bear talents separate on the tree. 
---
And I believe cat damage was pretty bad. 
---
World record is held by a Troll Hunter. 
---
Supposedly Horde is better due to better questing hubs and FAR less overall traveling since all the horde leveling zones are connected to each other up to level 40. Thousand needles, Barrens, Mulgore, Ashenvale, Stonetalon, Durotar, &lt;&lt;Zepplin&gt;&gt; STV &lt;&lt;Zepplin&gt;&gt; Tirisfal, Silverpin, Tarren Mill, &amp; Arathi are all conencted.  Aside the level 30 zones being contested, not once does Horde ever have to travel outside mostly horde controller territory to get to any town.
---
The exchange seems stilted because it was a very simple one from the beginning that you’ve expanded on, and I’ve had to get more detailed to explain what the issue was. The goal posts are moved when you say ‘Oh I meant more than that’ and para phrase the initial comments.
---
I feel like I'm pressing a lot of buttons with my lock......

AV is expecte to be released in Content "Stage 2" for Classic along side the other BG's, PvP system, BWL, and ZG.

Honestly man I really don't care if you believe me in what I was trying to say. I'm not sure if you're here looking for an argument or debate or what. I've pretty clearly explained my views and what I think, so feel free to agree or disagree with them. I'm not really interested in discussing semantics anymore.
---
Smh as a warlock main, yall like free water and forget what those 20 minute walks to your dungeons are like without summons or a SS on your healer for a quick ress. 
---
I can say mine enough people starting stealing it I don't care at this point. I normally use "Stiehl". I got it from Terry Brooks Scions of Shannara series. It's pronounced like Steel but everyone thinks it's Style. Used to use it because I thought it looked cool and was obscure so no one else used it. Let me keep continuity across games. 
---
Now I am not sure if people just saw my name and have just been stealing it making it slower more popular across time. Or maybe Terry is becoming a more popular author. Either way its super annoying. Name stealing is bad kids lol.
---
Hence the /s.
---
I know its better to get your stances haha.
---
Yeah, and Horde gets access to a pretty good fishing rod that you need to fish in the bay of storms and ZG.
---
Elemental Mage seems so fun. I mained Mage in OG vanilla and raided deep into Naxx, got quite well-geared, but never played elemental mage! Did did Frost pve, deep Frost pvp, AP Frost, PomPyro, Fire pve, all of it! I don't think many knew about the Blastwave-Shatter elemental spec. I really want to try a new character, and I still might main someone else (thinking lock, warrior, rogue, or Hunter. I need help), but I'll definitely be getting a mage to 60 for PvP.
---
Do you know how geared you need to be for elemental mage spec? I'm wondering if I can get geared enough for it without raiding hardcore or getting Rank 13.
---
I looted a Hurricane and then sold it to a guildie for half of what it was worth with the promise to receive installments.  
---
Never saw any more money from him. It was a learning experience. 
---
*Woah!* It's your **4th Cakeday** TurianTauren! ^(hug)
---
50 each time so 100 to change back and forth a week if you are hardcore raiding/pvp on classes like rogue, mage, arms warrior. Every month it reduces I think by 10 gold if you don't respec in that time. If you raid as resto though, you might as well go elemental for PvP. Gear is the same. If you are enhance and want to be enhance raid as enhance. Just means a slower progression guild and or crafting Nightfall to give a raid a buff ASAP. 
---
Bosses yes, trash no. The goblin packs in BWL aren't tanked either.
---
Eranikus!! Man I wish that one got finished
---
I don't know, but bear tanks are great!
---
Came here for The Lobotomizer! 
---
Look, you can tap out if you like, I’m not here for an argument, I’m here to backup my point, isn’t that what we Reddit for? 
---
I’ll wind it all the way back and go step by step to make sure we’re on the same page, but won’t bother if you’re exiting stage left at this point. You let me know.
---
"OKAY THANKS MAN" /logoff
---
It did, as part of the Scepter of the Shifting Sands chain.
---
Sounds like fun. I tried playing a hunter many years ago and the mage thing you said rings so true. A mage to me always felt like a ranged class with training wheels. They can just keep dipping deeper into the well of back up plans if their first attempt at kiting you failed lol.
---
Im aware, I didn't /s cause phone, but I was playing along
---
How much is classic going to cost per month? I already have the classic client on my laptop, will I be able to just change the realmlist? Also, will I have to buy BFA? My laptop can take classic but not BFA
---
This will be my life against the horde rogues who spawn camp low level zones for no reason
---
Priest it is 
---
The entire second half of Classic. The only content is AQ and Naxx. These raids judt introduced OP gear. They also added dishonorable kills and cross realm battlegrounds.
---
Almost all the discussion on this server is about the first year of Classic, and players seem to ignore how vapid the second year was.
---
Kang the Decapitator on my orc hunter. I had Ctrl clicked that bad boy from the AH every time it was up just in awe at how cool it looked.
---
Dropped from a random world mob while I was levelling and I insta equipped. My friend protested that it was useless for a hunter and I could have made a fortune... But I never regretted it.
---
My hunter never looked more like an orc! 
---
My favorite is my Golden Bow of Quel'Thalas , Sunfury hawk phoenix bow, and Sunfury hawk bow ( looks wise) 
---
Very similar story for me. The AH listing’s buyout was way more gold than I had (I’m pretty sure I was around level 50 at the time) but the bid price was low enough that I actually stood a chance. Set an alarm, woke up around 3-4 AM, and had a few mini-heart attacks as I was outbid a couple of times. This was close to TBC too but this was on my first character ever (dwarf hunter) and I didn’t care if it was going to be shit later. I remember using it during TBC in Karazhan on a guild run (we were goofing off) with Rapid Fire for some machine gun action. First ever epic, I never vendored it - pretty sure it’s in my hunter’s bank still if not in his inventory.
---
Some people dont want to miss a second and probably want a specific IGN or something that requires no dilly-dallying
---
Thank you for that explanation! Appreciate it very much. 
---
Hmm, are you saying that if I have kids it will impact my free time?
---
Having played on several private servers their population always take a nosedive when AQ and especially Naxx is released. Your offensive stats go off the roof while defensives (except tanks) stay the same. So you just run around one-shotting people and it's no fun.
---
Ok, I read reddit all the time, but rarely post. I started playing right after the BC xpac, hardcore raided during WotLK(Single digit ranking world wide Malygos Kill). Now I'm a 33 almost 34 young professional with a Wife and little one on the way. My wife knew I was a closet nerd from the vary beginning of our relationship some 8 years ago. That being said I've tried to prep her for the up coming Re-release of Classic. Of course I'm not going to choose the game over family time, but I believe there is a niche market for WoW playing parents.
---
Who cares if it takes forever to lvl, who cares if I don't raid until my kid turns 18.I believe if someone was to create a like minded community(guild) it could really take off. If you advertised as being "adults adulting with potential child interruption" and people sign up to join you then they know what they are getting into. I guess what I'm really saying is who is going to create the guild known as "Dad Bod" where we'd like to see content but we're not going to ignore our children.
---
\#WoWDadBod!
---
&gt;I have been ganked on privates
---
That must hurt
---
Are they not the most viable "Hybrid DPS" for raiding though? I see a feral as a decent flex slot that can off tank or dps pretty easily and reduces competition for tank gear overall. 
---
I guess he gets redeemed in Moonglade in that questline but hardly anyone gets to do that.
---
You can get a follow up from Ictharus? in Swamp of Sorrows where you can turn in the trinket .... for nothing in Winterspring.
---
It's massively disjointed at best
---
I think it was a mallet from a blacksmithing quest, but I cannot find the name right now.
---
For anyone who clicks Play Quiz and then stares at the map in confusion expecting it to do something,
---
You're meant to type in the name of every zone and city into text box at the top.
---
I guess someone took about ten minutes to put this together; I wonder how much ad money they've earned in that time.
---
Krangs was my first as well. And I also bought it. It replaced my whirlwind axe haha
---
My 2 most played classes (BY FAR) on private servers is Druid and Hunter. Either alliance pure feral or HotW hybrid and a nelf hunter with cat. 
---
Both stealth classes. 
---
I was a ganking nightmare. I absolutely know I've made other players quit, but this happens anyway on private pvp servers because many pve players can't find an active vanilla pve server. They hit 30+ and get very frustrated with pvp.
---
This is why I say private pvp vanilla servers have their own meta. They exist for pvp. They have a solid hardcore audience who are there to play the meta of THAT server. Many vanilla Wow dreams become shattered when they jump on a 10k+ servers.
---
Real Classic Wow's major bonus will be it's ability to attract and support many more Wow play styles. I played the private server game for what it was ... it doesn't mean I want to play that way in Classic. I want a more chill crowd.
---
you clearly havent played much end game vanilla wow.
---
It was always nice to have an area named after your character, Aeris Landing.
---
Ah gotcha. No harm done.
---
Yes Hunters are awesome in BG's, Classic isn't private. BG's are being delayed until people clear some raids and so that people can re experience Tarren Mill vs Southshore. Rank 14 is a complete waste of time on a hunter because their raid sets are awesome especially when you start to get in Tier 2. You also get a incredible bow in the very first tier that hits like a freakin truck. Tier 1 and 2 raids are also heavily nerfed past real Vanilla. You don't have to be a hardcore raider to clear them.
---
Don't worry about rank 14. A lot of tier 2 sets are as good or so close it doesn't matter. It's more about prestige.                           
---
If you want to discuss whether the community is engaging in baseless speculation then sure, I can tell you they definitely are. I don't care if you want a substance based discussion. Anything beyond what has already been confirmed is baseless speculation. Especially on the part of those wildly speculating about sharding becoming a full time thing, and not just a short term thing in early zones (which is what Blizzard has stated).
---
If you want to try and continue to debate me about what was in my own head when I originally posted, then nah I'll pass. I know what I was trying to say, and if you want to believe I'm lying to you and trying to shift the goal post then knock yourself out.
---
So basically, you let me know. Substance or nah?
---
During retail Vanilla, if you reported someone for ganking and camping you, a GM would tell you to hearth, log out for a while, or call friends/guild to help you.
---
That's it
---
It effects the ecosystem of a server. It isn't a few days. In the post you mentioned 1-2 weeks. 
---
I started in BC and I can't remember if it was the crafted Frozen Shadowweave shoulders, Ruby Slippers from Opera or T4 Warlock Gloves
---
Hunters have 8y dead range and you have to kite a lot in pvp. If this isn't ur thing - you have to learn it. I think they are fun, we made 10ppl premade hunters only. And if you outgear people you can one-shot clothers.
---
Mine was the Icemail Jerkin. I saw it for cheap on the AH and, while it wasn’t great, it was a decent upgrade and I had the gold.
---
Dad here, guess I'll be making (or joining) a "Family first" guild. My oldest is 17 and remembers playing with me at the time vanilla was it (and by playing with me, I mean he would hit the space bar to make my mount jump, hours of fun), and he's got his own retail account now. He may end up playing classic with me. I also now have a 11 month old. So my gaming life is close to non-existent currently.
---
I haven't subbed since WoD, but classic gives me that addicts itch. It's really dangerous for someone like me that was truly addicted back then. But I honestly believe I am older/wiser now, and can manage play time without alienating my family. Time will tell, and I've already taken precautions by informing my wife and giving her personal authority to veto my gaming decisions (yea, it may result in that, addiction is a bitch).
---
Anyhow, I'm happy to see all the classic WoW parents here. Great discussion!
---
FOR KHAZ'MODAN!
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE! 
---
As someone that is a bit of a headphone enthusiast (I only own 5 sets of cans) I must say this is realy good advice and the first recommendation is a VERY good value set of headphones.
---
Thunderfury should go to the MT.
---
Hunter Night Elf named: Huntlee
---
If you're into retail Sul is bis for twink warriors sub 60.   So are alot of the old purple's, fun to use them again. 
---
Classic is included with the current wow subscription.
---
We’re clearly looking at very different things here, I’ll do you one better. Call in to my show about this, I’ve come back at you politely and have no intention of swearing at you or anything like that. But I would love the chance to play this out for you verbally so maybe you’ll see where I’m coming from and we can get to the root of the issue. That’s up to you. 
---
nagrand or fjord
---
Emerald Dream (RP-PvP)
---
I'm so there if they make this realm available. Please no streamers take it!
---
My first epic item ever was Nightslayer Gloves back in the day.
---
As far as world epics go I never saw ONE in the entirety of vanilla. It wasn't till I played on a pserver for like 14 days played that I got an elemental mage staff off of one of the cultists in Silithus.
---
Yeah that took me too long to figure out and when I did I walked away lol
---
**Shadowblade!**
---
Got it while grinding the BE's in Azshara. I think it was a Blood Elf Surveyor to be exact.
---
I mean the exact days are flexible, if Classic releases on Tuesday, early access can start the Friday before. Would the days affect your decision? Like 1 week is bad but 3 days is ok?
---
There will be a toggle for new models.
---
Pass, because you're still focused in on my use of "baseless speculation" in response to a specific post that you don't feel warranted that. I've already conceded that I was responding to a larger point, and have tried to steer the conversation in that direction. You're just relentlessly sticking to this idea that the phrase did not fit with the post I responded to. I really don't care to keep discussing that. This is exhausting so I guess I'm done at this point.
---
https://www.dkpminus.com/wow/guides/taladrils-treatise-on-druid-tanking-in-vanilla/
---
You might find this helpful, explains it better than I can. What I gathered is that ferals are a great flex role in raids.  They are a much better off tank than a dps warrior and much much better flex dps than a prot warrior.  And bring innervate, heals, and perhaps most importantly  don't siphon off warrior gear. 
---
Mum here, started playing when Wrath dropped (my daughters 5th birthday) and I have always played games with one ear uncovered.
---
My old guild had a tank/healer husband/wide combo and it wasn't uncommon for them to have to AFK for kid duties, you just need to be in a group who have no issues with a quick "Oh god, a kids thrown up brb" issues during an instance.
---
Voice comms was only used in guild so it was a chilled bunch of people to chat with, if you're playing with other parents a no excessive swearing rule wouldn't be too hard to get people to agree with.
---
Thankfully my now 15yr old daughter won't give a toss but I'll be more than happy to play with people who need to do stuff for their kids during raids, gives me time to get another cuppa in.
---
I farmed turtles in Hinterlands constantly just for a chance of this dropping.
---
even an equally geared paladin? that would be a surprise, even with viper sting
---
I would pay $39.99 CDN without hesitation for a digital version of the old collectors edition, and more if they had a way for me to get the physicals. I do not support any form of early access as it will cause serious issues to the early game balance unless it was only on specific servers, and fresh ones were available for those who wait. And even then it is shady as fuck. Sell me a mount and a pet, maybe some hearthstone packs and call it a day in regards to bonuses
---
Yeah, but then it would be too much time invested
---
All I asked is to focus what was written in front of me. Maybe that was asking too much. You have a good one.
---
My first epic was the aurastone hammer!
---
You know that Mark Hamill is being just being used for his expression, and we are all talking about the head of Activision Blizzard?
---
agreed. I too have a small collection, with my daily drivers being DT990s, and my wife's being HD 599s
---
Epic rating in honesty though
---
Lol that's good
---
Probably cheating to put in a raid instance rather than a world zone, but I'd love a lvl 60 version of Karazhan to turn up in classic.
---
The most annoying thing about Vanilla is that I can't play on the current WoW content with Vanilla mechanics, stats, social structure, no flying and no group finder.
---
Eye of Flame!
---
Glowing Brightwood Staff dropped for me in Felwood while on my Dwarf Hunter. Immediately mailed that sucker to my mage that was not leveled enough to equip yet. Leveled said mage, about to equip, then decided to look at going rate on AH for it. Yea, mount money was more important to me at the time. It sold high in a normal length offer. Had my mount an hour later. Worth it, lol. 
---
Nope, supposed to be fun and innocuous but becomes another item people have to obtain. Enough natural achievements in the game, we don’t need to make arbitrary ones.
---
I have a screenshot on an old harddrive from a bg I did when I started PvPing seriously. I was r4, dwarf fury warrior in dungeon blues dual wielding the rend swords, my team was a random AB group. Horde team was a premade, mostly r10+ and some BWL epics. Me and a paladin decided to stick together and we shredded that premade. I topped HKs, KBs and was 2nd in capping bases. We won the bg even though it was very very close and I have never reached that peak of nerd pride in myself again. 
---
Kang's Decapitator 😎
---
Not like the ones we have today but the ones in wrath were fun I thought 
---
Love the Beyer sound, I own both dt770 and dt880, I have yet to find the money to complete the set :) 
---
In theory, yes, they can.
---
The problem is how many realms will they have up for launch day? 10 ? 20? 50? 
---
Another "issue" is that if they release the number of realms and that number sums up MORE players compared to retail...well, they won't do that. A typical realm for Classic will have, on launch, a capacity of at least 20k players, simply because a concurrent cap of 2,500-3,000 means 10-12k overall players / realm.
---
Since about 50% (could be 40%, could be 60% or more) would probably quit in the first couple weeks, a realm on launch must have around 20k player capacity. What does this mean? Well, if Blizzard expects 2 million players on launch, that means around 100 realms.
---
After release, they could launch more realms...but, are they expecting 2 million players on launch? Are they expecting 1 million? Less ?
---
The problem is that Blizzard is TOTALLY UNPREPARED for Classic. They most likely expect maximum 500k players, and that means 25 realms, and they expect the number to drop at least half, to 250k, after launch.
---
They could release Classic with only 25 realms, and if they are doing it so, they can easily also release the name of those 25 realms.
---
However, this won't help you AT ALL, because anyone with 2 neurons understands that at least 2 million players (conservative number) will play Classic on launch, and this means 100 realms. Hence, 100 realm names, of which we will only know 25 of the names.
---
So, you can be 100% SURE that there won't be any realm names released before launch.
---
Mount Hyjal, simply because it looked like all of the assets were there for a very long time, they just never released it during Vanilla.
---
Nope
---
No
---
Unstoppable Force on my ret paladin if I remember correctly. Loved that weapon  
---
But there are being changes made. If you watched the panel they don’t want to change things that effect the game but they are adjusting debuff limits from 8 to 16, adding in sharding, adding loot trading. 
---
They are updating the coding and limiting what mods can do even though they were different in classic wow. Dueling would still be in durotar but it would give players an option for arena.
---
I can see both sides of the argument but sometimes saying #nochanges without thinking through the pros and cons of these changes are short sighted. 
---
If they truly wanted no changes, why not just release wow 1.0 and release the patches as they came out at the same pace?
---
That was my favourite zone from Cata. Even though most quests post-WotLK were very forgettable, I still remember the story quest from there.
---
As an alchemist I hand out mana pots to all the good boys and girls in dungeons :(
---
See, if they just put the music of Grizzly Hills everywhere I'd be good with that.
---
Objectively not a good bow for hunters, way to fast, no stats and you can get Bloodseeker from AV 3 levels later which is much better. 
---
It probably won't be worth it in classic, the 1.12 client somewhat fixed that issue (you still want a slow bow but 2.9 and slower are all usable in that patch)
---
Also it was 2.95ish after your quiver, 3.4 base speed
---
When we were leveling in ZF, there was 4 of us, shaman, warlock, warrior, and druid. The warrior was so frustrated that none of the pieces ever dropped so he didn't bother to join all runs.
---
Then, when we were about to move off to the next dungeon, both the warlock and the druid opened trade with the warrior, and placed the combined weapon in the enchanting slot.
---
He didn't speak to us for a week.
---
Good times.
---
I lost myself for a second there guys. No changes 
---
I was 19 and spent my time between school, friends, and wow with some work. Most of my friends played so that helped fill more wow into my life. Food was whatever, but manwhiches are still a joke my friends and I share.
---
Now I have a kid and another in September, 10 years into a real job and busy all the time grading or prepping, but still game on my systems or with tabletop stuff. I'm taking a leave from work next year as I need a break from teaching and want to be around my newborn, so will be getting some serious WoW time in. Dabble in private servers now but I just don't have the time to really get into it
---
Doesnt matter. 
---
Even if it takes someone a few hours or a day to identify which server the streamer is on (likely will be way less than that even without armory).
---
I cant think of anyway they could do to hide what server they are on. 
---
I liked IQD from the perspective of being a nice daily quest hub and whatnot but it wasn't super interesting otherwise.  To each his/her own. 
---
I would love if after Naxx starts getting old and stale for the majority of servers, they release new level 60 content to keep Classic fresh. It would be new content without making everything players have worked for up until that point obsolete.
---
Flurry axe from an ogre in Tanaris. Equipped it on my honger and went raptor strike spec lol
---
Sul'Thraze
---
The Lasher
---
Dwarf pally
---
f-in LUL
---
Technically my first drop was a BoE Burning Crusade item, but I can't remember if I used it or sold it. If I didn't equip it, my first epic would have probably been the Shatari Skyguard rep trinket, as I spent a lot of 2.1 days farming daily's for the Red Riding Nether Ray. 
---
Later in the expansion the welfare epics started coming in and I started to give raiding a try. I was very purple by the time Wrath came. 
---
you won't regret the 990s whenever you get around to them. i've never had a complaint aside from the cable. comfy af, breathes, and great sound. all you can ask for
---
While tanking ? yes. Sunder does 0 dmg heroic strike has static +dmg attached to your white swing and tclap only hits 4 targets. consecration hits all targets holy shield and ret aura and blessing of sanc adds up to alot of reflect dmg.   
---
When you main ability does 0 dmg while tanking it's easy for both other tanks to out dmg warriors. 
---
Shadowmeld was essentially like an extra point in Master of Deception. It's not nothing, but it's not that noticeable either. At the end of the day, the kings of rogue pvp racials are dwarves. Escape Artist is neat as well, but Stoneform is just the best.
---
Debuff limit was always 16 in 1.12.
---
Also sharding and loot trading are on for logistical reasons not gameplay reasons.
---
The no changes is always relating to gameplay.
---
With Azerite traits every class has a heal now. I know it is not the same, but just shows how the game changed drastically.
---
I had the druid staff with I think dodge or defense and armor on it. And I was a warlock lol. Thought it was the shit with my epic staff.  Still hadnt figured out stats by then apparently.
---
I'm becoming more and more aware that Orc is the right choice for warlock, but they just look so bulky and round for what should be a physically frail caster. 
---
This sub undervalues the leveling experience. Yes you only have to do it once (assuming it’s a set permanent server). That aside, it is still a significant amount of your time to invest.
---
Glowing brightwood staff, first epic as priest. Second was T1 shoulders from MC. Those were the days :). 
---
I still listen to the soundtrack when I'm studying.
---
It's all a blur. I was in 10th grade (15), but I don't remember anything about school. I spent the next several months sleeping, going to school, and playing wow. I remember having to go to a Christmas lunch at a neighbor's and scarfing the food down in 10 minutes just to run back home and hop on WoW. Those really were the best of times; not sure how I passed the 10th grade because I spent a lot of time sleeping in class to recover from those long gaming nights.
---
Now I'm IT professional who doesn't do a whole lot of gaming anymore, mainly just the occasional bursts of Diablo II mods and messing around on private servers on occasion. I've been theorycrafting vanilla WoW for a long time and have practiced leveling my starter class (can beat Joana's time 1-30 on a different class, haven't done the later levels). I'm going to take at least a week off work and go for my class' realm first 60 on classic launch.
---
Has Blizzard under Activision ever offered early access?
---
Big difference between what you mentioned and paid early access. 
---
Okay. Tanking isnt just spamming sunder armor and heroic strike. Shield Slam is your main ability as prot. It does damage. As a fury tank, which is actually quite common, your main ability is Bloodthirst. It does damage. Cleave does damage and will be used constantly over heroic strike on AoE pulls. Execute does damage although mainly only used on bosses in 5 mans. Recklessness does tons of damage. Attacking a mob that has 5 sunder armor stacks on it does damage.
---
Many tanks nowadays will even dual wield in fury spec for even more damage and threat.
---
Warrior damage scales up hard as they get gear in vanilla. Paladins, less so. Maybe a prot pally does more damage than a prot warrior with no gear in aoe situations only. MAYBE.
---
Tanks do more damage in prot spec than a geared ret pally in raid. Its not going to be different in 5 mans with a prot pally. 
---
It's to make up for how ridiculous hunter pets are for pve/pvp while leveling and before people get geared from raids.
---
Cata was good until LFR patch
---
I was eight.
---
In the middle of 3rd grade; i met a knew friend. A week later  i went to his house for a playdate. We played naruto on the ps2, and talked about ninjas and shit. The next time i was planning on going to his house; he left school for his house immediately after it ended. No problem, it was just two block down, whilst my house was six block away. I find his house on the corner, and his father(a larger man with a very husky, jolly, and soft voice) i turn the corner of the hallway and see my friend of his computer. While his dad starts telling him it wasnt very nice to leave without his friend when they had plans (and is getting ignored except for the occasional 'uh huh') i am mesmerized, i enter a trance of wonder and amazement as i see the exuberant colors and characters, flying across the screen with multiple flashes of color; i hear the flashes and sparkles of his palidins holy light, the heavy hitting thunk of his great two handed mace, and the inexplicable grand trunpet and array of other musical instruments as he "dings" to the next level. I was hooked; i sat there for 5 hours, declining his multiple offers to let me play, before i knew it my parents picked me up, and i was hooked. I spent weeks over at his house just watching him play before wanting to join in myself. At that point im not sure which happened first; I made a Tauren Druid and got to lvl 16 (18?) And trained for my water form. I swam and jumped around camp turanjo (sic) for a good 30 minutes enjoying the quick swim speed and amazing sound effects and animations of turning into this beastly seal; as well as the character fantasy of being a giant bull who could trnsform into other magnificent creatures. My other first experience was making a troll hunter, and dreaming of getting a raptor pet at level 10, to eventually match my raptor mount at level 40. Neither of those character made it past 20. I didnt get my own account until well into TBC, and my own computer until well into WotLK.
---
Now im working on my degree, attempting to enter a masters program; tirelessly waiting for the classic experience i was unable to have due to my parents discriminatory view of gaming, and their low SES.
---
This is it chief
---
most trash is nova immune too, sure goblin packs aren't. And what the fuck do you mean with they "aren't tanked"?
---
If they're smart they will be on pvp servers for world pvp content 
---
bear druids not having a real chance to go crit immune
---
:(
---
Mine was also Hurricane! A Warlock friend of mine got it and gave it to me because I was a hunter. The same day I also got the Dragon Whelpling pet in Badlands, which I also gifted to someone else. Good times.
---
That would make my life easier.
---
Except that, as time continues forward after 60, the % of your total time spent leveling decreases. Eventually you're going to reach a point where the time you spent leveling your character is going to be under 5% of your total experience.  
---
Add in the fact that some classes change dramatically after hitting 60, I don't see how 5% of your experience should influence your total class choice. Warriors are the best example of this in my opinion. Levels 1 through 60 are hard on a warrior, really not that enjoyable if we're being honest. After 60 though? Warriors only get massively better as time goes on, and eventually they outstrip most other classes in their total range of abilities and uses.  
---
So I again implore anyone reading, don't allow the leveling experience influence the class you want to play, if you believe you truly want to play it.  
---
I mean that in both directions as well. Playing a druid to 60 is a blast, they're a tier 1 leveling class. At 60? Have fun being resto, tank if you're very lucky.  
---
I really think that a lot of people are underestimating this point. 
---
Blizzards only new content was raids, which if you couldn't meet a guilds raid schedule meant you were SOL on stuff to do. 
---
Cataclsym was bitter sweet for me. It "completed" Azeroth. Well, sort of. Battle for Azeroth has really completed it because it added the last of the missing human kingdoms: Kul Tiras. But the expansion that filled out the map also destroyed the original one.
---
I wish we could have seen a completed Azeroth in vanilla.
---
I'm a dad and I'm in 100% it will be different for me this time around. I will log when I can, take my time, and ENJOY. No need for me to be real first, best gear, top raiding guild...etc. I'm so happy to be playing the game for what it is, an experience that I'll enjoy while I can. 
---
This was my first epic. I sold it for 250g and then turned around and bought the Krol Blade for my rogue, bad idea by me lol.
---
The first BOE epic I ever looted, I can literally take you to the exact spot in the badlands between kargath and angor fortress just killing mobs and I got a BOE Staff of Jordan. I was on TS with a group of friends and freaked out because I didn't know what it meant. I was a warrior though so I just sold it. 
---
In 2004  
---
I was 5, thats right 5.  
---
I had my own account (thanks to my dad) :) I played A rogue human of course me being 5 I made my character after me with my FULL name Lol I did a lot well I was a kid. I've cleared Ony lair and zg. my account still has the achievements. but wow was more then just a game to me. As a young boy I had difficulties in language courses eg I couldn't read nor write but playing wow made me learn as well also helping with my social life. to this day classic/vanilla wow has changed my life in a very positive way.  
---
also CLASSIC WOW HYPE!    
---
Mine was a piece of giantstalker that had strength on it.
---
I remember wondering why it had strength on it and asking if I was missing something.
---
Random question - can you make ally and horde characters on the same pvp server? For some reason I remember you NOT being able to...
---
warlocks can also do something similar and might have better chances for taking their attackers with them, though priests are the kings of dickery in the game, that's for sure.
---
I'm torn between the ud male aesthetics which feel right, and the femorc for racials. Male orc warlock just too bulky
---
Storm Peaks is my all time favorite zone, but it would have to go through a lot of changes in order for it to work in vanilla haha
---
Assuming you're leveling with her the whole time then how easy her class is shouldn't be a factor as you can make her leveling experience easy regardless. Finding her a race/class fantasy that appeals to her is the most important thing. Is she at least into fantasy? Maybe have her make a character based on a favorite character from fiction.
---
i might end up rp-pvp. Feel like most people gonna avoid those.
---
You can los most mobs using fence posts which I never remember doing in vanilla 
---
Shield slam does negible damage compared to the aoe that druids and paladins are going to do. Yes if you tank as a dps spec and push your dps rotation you will do more damage but if I can keep a dual wield fury warrior up tanking the mobs I can keep almost any dps class alive while they do so.  
---
And yeah ret pallies dmg is ass but I don't think they get out damage by a prot warrior in tank gear however, but regardless I never even mentioned ret paladins lol. I think you are underestimating reflect damage especially while leveling up when raid gear isn't even part of the equation.
---
I can't really argue with this assessment.  I prefer TBC myself but only because it allowed me to truly enjoy my hybrid classes (druid, shaman, paladin).
---
Skullflame Shield. Doesn't get more badass than that.
---
Yup, this is correct.  Thunderfury goes to MT first.
---
Sulfuras going to him was garbage though.  The only reasonable explanation would be if you guys gave him the Eye out of ignorance (not knowing what it would lead to), and then just never had another one drop.  In that case, just bad luck.
---
You could get a decent "call centre" styled headset?
---
1 ear and just have Discord sound coming from that and game sound coming from your speakers. 
---
Might take a bit of getting used to but definitely wouldn't take you out the zone. 
---
Which brings us back to my point that started it all.
---
Ever since the Manual Crowd Pummeler option was theorycrafted, there's an argument for Ferals being allowed to raid under certain conditions.
---
Are they the ideal Hybrid-DPS? In terms of most impact on a raid, I'd say that an Enhancement Shaman with Nightfall Axe has the most impact on a raid. 
---
So within a narrow set of circumstances, then yes a Feral can raid. Just keep in mind that most guilds are going to use the ideal raiding comp as their compass:
---
8 Warriors (3 tank / 5 DPS)
---
6 Rogues
---
6 Mages
---
5 Priests (4 Heal / 1 Shadow)
---
5 Warlocks
---
3 Hunters
---
3 Druids (All healers)
---
4 Paladins
---
Arcanist Boots baby! Though I got Talisman of Ephemeral Power on the very next boss, and I feel more nostalgic love for that trinket because I didn't replace that baby for a while, and it was glorious for PoM Pyroing for the rest of vanilla
---
Creating all the top streamers names on all servers.
---
Tbf, the current pack has the most content. However many things are so easy that this great potential is blazed through and makes it feel cheap and promotes the gimme gimme gimme feeling just to have something new. If they had balanced it better, and listened to players on other issues like azurite for example, then this xpack had potential to be the best since BC.
---
I bought a lifestone and found out why it was ~30g...
---
I grinded ZF for that sword on my warrior too! It was immediately outclassed by the Ice-Barbed Spear the moment I got it, but I didn't care. That felt like an accomplishment and I kept it in my bank as a symbol of perseverance. 
---
I was 17. Playing wow with friends from school. They were major geeks, and I was more of a "cool kid". But we got along very good, and ended up being extremely good friends.  Everyone at school was playing at this stage.
---
I was paladin.
---
I was in high school.
---
Now. I am a serial entrepreneur, currently at a very succesful company that I founded.  
---
I love my computer, and playing video games. I play Rust mostly. I play Fortnite, CS and the likes with my online buddies.  
---
I just love business, tech, games.   
---
And I love kids. I love their joy for life. I learn from them every day, to never be too serious about life. Dont get me wrong I am a very serious person in my business life. But privately, I am a 7 year old kid lol. I just love playing and having fun.
---
* **How old were you?** 20
---
* **Were you playing WoW? If so, what race/class?** Yes, Played Horde Tauren Shaman
---
* **What was going on in your life?** I had just failed out of my first year of college due to having a very introverted lifestyle in High School so when I went to college I went completely crazy (drank, went to parties, skipped class, etc)  Because of this I had to move back home with my parents.  Went to a community college, but was playing WoW and only going to school part time.
---
* **What are you doing now?** I work in IT, have been for the last 12 years.  I still play games as a hobby in the spare time.  About to be engaged this year, and my GF has a daughter from a previous relationship so technically I'm a parent already!
---
While leveling up paladins will have more damage I will give you that.   
---
Fury warriors still have plate armor, armor bonus from early prot tree, and high defense from gear. They still have Last Stand. They can get away with using recklessness and still take less damage than most dps classes. Deathwish too. They don't have to itemize weirdly for mana and spell damage like a prot pally does.   
---
But yea sure on fat AoE pulls you do more damage than ungeared warriors. Amazing!
---
Alliance have better access to valuable grinds which are integrated in the most common speedleveling routes without any issues. If Horde were 15% faster than Alliance then that in turn means that they would hit 60 in 67,15hours and need to average 1006,9744XP/min or 60418,5XP/h from 1-60, whereas the current record is at 855,92827XP/min or 51355,7XP/h. In contrast getting below 72 hours is considered a distant dream and that is with the ability to play when you are not fatigued from sitting/standing for 36 hours straight.    
---
Now, after level 42-44 you more or less have access to the same questlines regardless of faction with obvious exception of hubs in Feralas, Hinterlands, Felwood, and Swamp of Sorrows. During many of these last levels you would lose more XP/h travelling than you would to straight up grind at a good spot. As such there is honestly not enough difference in that phase to differentiate the factions by a huge margin. So what's the difference then? Most likely somewhere around 5-7,5% which would largely be decided prior to level \~45, amounting to between 3,5 to 5,5 hours. Classic speedrunning is basically an \~80 hour in-game marathon, then the realm competition decides whether or not you get to be happy or pissed off when crossing the finish line.
---
Holy shit I didnt know about this. Is it hard to get?
---
Im 45 i cant remember from back in Vanilla. But i can remember i felt EPIC lol
---
Trolling 10/10 :P
---
Good luck with that.  race after him icing him and seeing as you have IQ 60 you're shapeshift and run out of mana.  Go back and kill the warrior. and LOL wank it on your screen.
---
oops...wrong game :)
---
Only two mmorpgs im looking forward too and ive played many other ones all lacking. Is Classic and Lost Ark. Maybe Ashes of Creation but that need ALOT of work atm. I played Vanilla and loved it im hoping Classic is the same. 
---
It's good for some things. Like farming grey drops from mobs. Those jaguar furs in SoS would be super easy by comparison to farm for your lvl 40 mount -- they're already a fast farm for 100g.
---
We understand, and technically elemental has the fastest kill times on mobs, but has higher downtime (from drinking).  Leveling as elemental can be fun, of course, but can feel very sluggish in that your rotation/farming pattern won't feel smooth or as fast.
---
You do you.  Just other people who have played shamans are warning you that Leveling=Enchancement, then respec to your desired role.
---
Married with kids here too. Playing EQ1 TLPs and will probably get on classic when it launches.
---
Totally understand the headphone cutoff thing. I end up using in ear headset with one ear out.
---
I try to carve out "dad personal time" from 10 to 1130pm EST. So though my time will be limited looking forward to rolling with like minded players.
---
Kara would have been the perfect raid in classic. I don't know how to describe it, but even while running the dungeon in TBC it felt like it belonged in classic. Maybe because most of Outland felt so foreign from Azeroth.
---
Agree overall. But if a feral dps can compete with the top DPS on private servers, then they will be good enough for the average guild imo.
---
&gt;IQ 60
---
It's impolite to drone on about yourself.
---
Frost mages are trash at killing druids. Travel form cost is basically 0. 
---
DISMOUNTING WHEN YOU JUMP OVER A TINY PORTION OF WATER AND LAND JUST BELOW THE DAMN WATER LINE.

---
All my friends are playing horde this time around so Horde lol.
---
Rolling Shaman.
---
Blinkstrike
---
Epic 1h sword that had no stats but a chance to proc an additional attack.
---
My first character was a level 66 Combat Sword spec’d Rogue.
---
I almost quit, but a friend urged me to keep going because I would get Cloak of Shadows at 67 and Warlocks would actually die after I got that spell.
---
Then Blinkstrike dropped in the same buddies dungeon, he rolled need as a Shadow Priest and promised to give it to me if I got to 70. I think it went for 1000g or so at the time, maybe more (was a lot of gold back then).
---
Then I proceeded to not get an OH sword until S2 Arenas.
---
Early access for any mmo is completely out of the question. Not going to happen. 
---
Sincerly doubt you were tanking ZF at 41.
---
Exactly. Its honestly a matter of minutes before someone figures it out. 
---
SOL, I agree with your overall message here more or less...but something you said made me realize that the "old school" MMO you are referring to actually diverged after WoW took over.
---
I'd also actually argue that before WoW, SWG actually started the slow decline of 'hardcore sandbox' mode MMO's by adding the NGE expansion.
---
Now the only sandbox games are truly...sandbox games.  Games like Ark, Atlas, Minecraft, etc all fill the "sandbox" mode that people need.  But they aren't the same.  I'd argue that after SWG and WoW....MMORPG's diverged into Theme Park MMOS (Which WoW is part of) and Sandbox Games (Ark or Minecraft).
---
Just figured I'd add that in.
---
You know there’s a war goin on right?
---
Freedom of speech: you can use slurs
---
Freedom from consequence: nobody retaliates
---
How can you claim a statement is stupid if you dont know what it means?  
---
Man, what I'd give for my kids to go to bed at 7:30 again.  Now it's closer to like 9pm due to swim and soccer practice etc.  I also go to the gym every day.  So by the time I get back, I have like an hour if I'm lucky.  But I'm perfectly cool with that.  It's about time I look around and smell the roses the second time around.
---
But unfortunately, no one I know really wants to come back.  They're still burnt out.  Or the ones that still play, play retail because it fits their busy schedule better.
---
Dog, got my first last week. Flurry Axe
---
tbh, if i were forced to pick between a RP-PvP (read: sex chat central) realm and a realm infested with some narcissistic persona who wants to let people watch him play videogames as a job, i'd go with plan C and fucking kill myself
---
Woop woop!
---
Removed per rule 1
---
So general consensus is early access is bad; it ruins server economy and is just evil business practices.
---
Thanks for voicing your thoughts everyone, it wasn't meant to ruffle anyone's feathers just curious about the possibility.
---
It drops off a rare that has a 5hr spawn time. Drop rate is 75% chance I think? So it’s... not THAT hard to get. A lot of people will just log out right by his spawn location and log in to check a few times per day while they level other toons.
---
if only blizzard moved all these personae to the same realm, so the idiocy is contained...
---
Sorry man Druids are delish and easy kills.  Too bad you don't know how to play mage.  I literally get hard when I see a druid and I wank it until I bleed.
---
I'm just assuming, Armory is just the fastest way though. Even if there isn't an armory it's going to be very easy for the community to use the names of players on a server seen on a streamers server to figure out what server their on as well as just making characters on servers and /who the streamer.
---
My point is that there's really no way a streamer is going to be able to hide what server their on for more than a few hours at most (Assuming they don't stop streaming)
---
Sounds like that's what I'll be doing too
---
So vanilla with an entire world of content is less than the tiny island of BFa? This cannot be true. 
---
Or are you speaking in terms of endgame? Because by my count after the first major content patch bfa has 3 raids. TBC released with 6...not counting the many that came later or the enormous amount of dungeons.
---
That wasn't possible, no.
---
I played shaman in vanilla. It was tough but satisfying.
---
No, I don't mean to make vanilla seem not important. Map size aside, there is just more stuff to do currently. Vanilla had more to explore and it was new then so we didn't just inhale it and move on, each location was appreciated.
---
Or even having said that
---
Lok Tar brother
---
They attract swarms of weirdos who follow around their toon and try to suck them off.
---
The patch was very early in catas lifespan tho, no?
---
Don't even need the armory, assuming there's not a lot of servers people can just make a level 1 on every server and /who the streamers' character names until they find everyone. 
---
It's almost guaranteed some stream snipers will do it and once it's out there, it's out there. 
---
And damn, downvoting me for trying to be helpful too. :/
---
Definitely 
---
So what are all these things to do in this game that everyone complains about?
---
Mine was Destiny on my paladin. I felt like a good damn rockstar 
---
Lfr patch was the last content patch, I think for dragonsoul. Early cata was quality tbh  Firelands remains in my top 10 raids. 
---
While WoW has always been about PvE, I remember world PvP to be quite present, even in post-BGs Vanilla. Not only capitals were raided, but also little villages like, for example, Astranaar were raided just for the fun of it. Also, in contested zones I remember having frequent solo or group ganking. God, how can I forget the fun in STV? :) 
---
This is something that mostly died in later expansions. 
---
However, I get your point, because BGs created a separate world for PvP, maybe starting a decline which, in my opinion, was completed by flying mounts and cross-server.
---
Also, I totally agree on the Honor system. It sucked.
---
sure jan
---
He does live in Texas, not sure about the realm location thing for NA, there may be east coast and west coast servers but I don't think it'll have much impact.
---
You don't have to fear anything, as soon as they pick their servers you can pick yours, we'll know the realms at least an hour+ beforehand so you can communicate with your friends, though I bet they'll release realm lists ahead of time.
---
WotLK - Best narrative and best arena balance. Phasing really worked well in this expansion, since it was able to leverage all of the narrative buildup from War3 and Frozen Throne. The story behind the IC 5mans were awesome. Good diversity of arena builds, druids and SL/SL locks were far less bullshit than they had been in TBC.
---
Cata - Best 5man mechanics before they nerfed the shit out of them. WotLK basically removed threat as a mechanic but didn't give us anything in return. Cata 5mans were designed for the post-threat world.
---
I cannot lie, I always found it stupid that I could shoot through trees. It benefits my class, but yea it's retarded. I still wouldn't change it though, it's part of Classic.
---
The armory won't update until people reach level 10 (or 20?). The realm will leak before then anyway.
---
Darkmoon Deck: Blue Dragon
---
It's hard to remember. I probably spent 41-45 as dps, but I was also we'll geared because I ran SM before that practically 100 times
---
There's the island expeditions, the global dailies or whatever they're called now, the war resource thing with those special upgraded bgs, the azurite necklace system, and these are in addition to the 'new zone, new quests, new story' that we get standard with each pack.
---
I'm not saying vanilla is less,.I'm just saying as far as 'stuff to do', there was an asstonne of potential here that just didn't pan out.
---
I did not know about this, but I'll be checking them out! Cheers mate!
---
To fuck you mommy
---
&gt;He could HAVE given you the bow "soulbound". 
---
I've decided on tauren shaman because I miss the old tauren models. And I imagine most shamans will go orc because of racials, but that aoe stun is pretty beast.
---
likewise!
---
God I hope so.  Classic doesn't need any more content.
---
I feel like it would actually be decent for Pally tanks for self-heals.
---
For me it was the Precisely Calibrated Boomstick. Dropped from the turtles along the coast in the Hinterlands. I was playing a troll hunter at the time, but, me being a 12 year old at the time, I decided bows were much cooler than guns and so I only would use bows. However, I was very curious to how the weapon looked like and thus I equiped it and ran around with it for a few minutes. Later that day I tried to put it on the Auction House, and it was then that I learned what Soulbound/Bind on Pickup meant... 
---
I was such a massive noob. 
---
https://classicdb.ch/?item=2100
---
I've never done a BWL where those goblins are fully tanked. Sure, someone uses a shout but they always get loose as a result of the aoe.
---
There's definitely other trash in BWL you can nova - all of the Razorgore adds can be. And in MC there's def some. Pretty much all trash in ZG can be frozen, and lots in AQ20.
---
Besides, the point is, if you're in a serious guild, you won't be speccing Frostbite.  
---
Not sure if you are replying to me directly, but I was agreeing with you (hence the we) and I didn't downvote you...
---
[This guide was helpful to me on the subject :)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lBUm58le8UU)
---
 Check out Failz videos. They use it on their ele shaman to pretty good effect. 
---
1 - The game worked better as an open WORLD simulator than as a single narrative. I see what your saying but the cutscened never seemed like they made sense to me for a mmo. This made for the beginning of the "on the rails" gameplay wow still continues.
---
2- using a qualifier in your statement makes my point for me. Vanilla had best designed 5 mans in respect to the dungeon itself, TBC had best and most 5 mans in respect to difficulty a d quality.
---
Edgemaster Handguards from a Princess Run. This was way before anyone knew the advantages of weapon skills and melee tables. Tried to AH them multiple times before they eventually sold for a meager 50g. 
---
To be honest, I would like more content in the form of the next iteration of WoW. Whether it be the next expansion, has not only a stat squish but a level squish (I feel this is what each expansion should have been doing to REALLY keep numbers in check), as well as a revamped gameplay system to mimic that of Vanilla. The other possibility would be a sequel to WoW (although I highly doubt this). However, the reality would most likely be, classic is a low maintenance project for them which does not cost a lot to keep up.
---
Oh man, flashbacks.
---
This was mine as well, from Strat too, but I didn't win the roll and a mage guildie got it. I was also that annoying 13 year old who wasn't initially exactly well liked... but I guess I was okay enough to have a regular raiding slot. 
---
Fast forward to that night when we're working through ZG and had just wiped. A bunch of us needed repairs and my gun was broken, we had almost given up. The mage just opens trade and hands me that thing for no cost. Think we ended up making progression after that too. Solid dude, won't forget him.
---
Paladins are the best 5 man tanks for every dungeon.  And they are the best UBRS tank as well
---
Aaaaand new wallpaper time.
---
Thank you!
---
Lol. So your saying having a tiny island which is like a lesser version of a dungeon is more content? 
---
Daily's are more content? No, that's a small amount of repetitive content, not a large amount of actual content. This is a huge difference.
---
Very likely, not ok with it.
---
Mine was Sul'Thraze The Lasher. Once I got both swords to make it I thought it would be a blue and leapt off my chair and got my brother so I could brag...he got lucky 2 hours later and got Gutripper lol   l:
---
I'll have to go with Karazhan as many, because I loved it.
---
However I also wish many zones, like Mount Hyjal, Quel'Thalas, Outland and Northrend were present, since they were already a big part of Warcraft lore.
---
This actually made me laugh out loud haha
---
This is the tricky part. I personally think they will just leave classic WoW post-naxx as it is and launch classic TBC.
---
My first epic loot drop was Hurricane (lvl 36) world drop running (and getting ganked) down the path in STV. Decided to take my rogue off the path and Gorilla mob attacked. Nearly shit myself when it dropped. Sold it on the AH for 500ish gold and was able to get my riding training and mount as soon as I hit 40.  So many great friends and memories in this game.
---
[Krol Blade](https://classicdb.ch/?item=2244) for 5g on the AH!
---
The vanilla client you're running for pservers won't work for Classic, they're using a version of the WoD client I think - so be prepared to lower those settings ;-)
---
Nah. There's more fun in making name for yourself as your own retardian.
---
I still have it stored in the bank on a few characters.
---
https://i.imgur.com/55MWqhs.png
---
It’s not about the server hardware is about the client updates.
---
The problem is how much data you need to send to the client to update it.
---
The server backend is irrelevant sharding is used to ensure that the clients don’t get overloaded the tick rate of WoW has increased significantly over the years so is the tick content.
---
You can’t send an update for 1000 characters to a 1000 different clients and 30 times a second and expect them to live through it.
---
I just want 1 addition to classic - A selfie stick, so that #nochangesdrones would die from heart attack.
---
"That name is unavailable"
---
I lol at Alliance players. Why would you choose to play the game on easy?
---
Hell yes. Wait, we're not going to get this in Classic, are we? I SAID NO CHANGES REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE
---
Wasnt on the demo, where'd we hear this?
---
That is another reasonable thing to consider. Again, low cost for them as well as low maintenance.
---
I think you're misunderstanding what I'm saying.
---
An xpack will never have zones as large as the main world. The map isn't something I've even mentioned but you keep circling back to.
---
And it doesn't matter if the content is repetitive because a large majority of all content had repetition. Remember how long mc took at the start? You keep doing it over and over, but you don't have to if you don't want to. That's why these new additions to the game are good because people can pick and choose what they'd like to do each day. Had the difficulty been balanced better than it wouldn't have felt as repetitive.
---
The talents will be 1.12, but it's not like they're going to release AQ and Naxx off the bat. It will likely work similar to private servers where they release the dragons/AV/raids in patches.
---
Well...cata still holds the unique distinction of ruining the old world,  so I dont think its fair to say it was "good" until a certain patch.
---
Oh huh, that's a good point
---
A TURTLE MADE IT TO THE CAVERNS
---
I meant for end game content. Vanilla will always be my favorite in terms of leveling and zone immersion. It was just so perfect. 
---
I did the same. Not even a week later i got t2 helm from ony. 
---
I still remember getting my first BoE blue item. It was The Silencer. I used it all the way until 60. The feels.
---
Dude I'm with you on Grizzly Hills. Incredible zone! 
---
* **How old were you?** 16
---
* **Were you playing WoW? If so, what race/class?** Human Paladin, rolled him day 1 of WoW, November 23, and I actually had made a version of him in the last open beta.
---
* **What was going on in your life?** I was in high school, and I was a pretty good student, mostly because I happened to be good at the kind of work public school assigned. I actually never had a job throughout high school, until my last summer before college. My parents assumed I would get a job to have money and buy a car, like my sister. Unfortunately for them, I was content to fuel my hobbies on a $5 weekly allowance and careful management of birthday/holiday money. This gave me time to play. I quit off and on throughout Classic, but always came back to the same character. Dinged 60 in October 2005, and did some minor raiding but never really got that far. My hobbies were martial arts, Super Smash Bros., and RTS games.
---
* **What are you doing now?** Just finished my Ph.D. I'm a visiting professor, and I teach/research Chinese history. Thinking of leaving academia, though, given how awful the tenure-track job market is for historians currently, and teaching at a fancy private high school (surprisingly, that would mean more money and less stress/fewer hours). I married two years ago, and my wife absolutely understands that gaming is my hobby. We also both hate kids and have no plans to have any. So even though I still do work in the summer (research, prepping classes, conference travel), I've got a lot of personal and professional flexibility to sink my teeth into Classic, as long as it drops early/mid summer.
---
* Oh, been playing WoW off and on through Legion. Quit before BFA.
---
Much appreciated m8!
---
I'm planning on joining a new guild with new friends who all have the same interests and goals in mind. Unfortunately after 13-14 years, my original friends either no longer play or no longer have the same interests as me. Times change. 
---
16
---
Troll Rogue! I loathed how ugly my character was compared to the UD Rogue. I rolled Troll because I figured there was a great benefit to min/maxing my stats
---
* **What was going on in your life?**  (Age, school/job, other hobbies, foods/drinks you binged while playing, music, etc.)
---
Highschool, Highschool parties, Highschool sports, TONS of diablo 2 right before I started WoW. I think I was just starting to get into metal music at the time.
---
* **What are you doing now?** Career, games you play, other hobbies, what class/race do you plan to play in Classic, etc.
---
I do Instrumentation as a career, have a wife and kids and live on an acreage. Looking back, I pretty much exclusively played Blizzard games and now I play none of their games. It saddens me how all their IP's turned out. 
---
I will be rolling a Paladin, pretty much because as a classic Rogue they were complete shit against plate armor. I also want to do some healing and prefer to play low pop classes. I hope to roll onto a non-streamer server.
---
How much gold does this give you in an hour? It is safe to farm inside the dungeon but it did seem a bit lackluster G/hour wise. 
---
I did the same as a warlock for the voodoo mask. Had the vw tank if we couldnt find one lol
---
It sounds like they are set with sharding at this point. There's really no point in trying to convince them otherwise. 
---
I think what most players are concerned about is to the extent of Wow will they shard. I am personally hoping it's limited to the first 1-20 levels at most. 
---
The issue arises with contested maps like STV. If those new players think your starting zone is bad wait until you hit a contested map that's packed with players like STV. I can imagine there will be a lot of complaints from unseasoned players. My point is you just simply cannot please all groups of players.
---
I looted this bow with my pally of a mob. Had no idea about pricing and sold it for 65G on the AH. I thought I was wealthy beyond imagination. now im pretty sure i sold it too cheap.
---
This is the crux of the issue tho. You are using a qualifier "if the content would have been better it would be the most content ever!"
---
Basically makes my point for me.
---
You mentioned three things to back up the absurd statement that bfa has the most content.
---
Islands, daily's, and a necklace. 
---
From my perspective, islands are just bad dungeons, daily quests just mask not enough real quests and content, and a necklace isn't content at all it's a grind system.
---
If you compare the amount of genuine content, which includes the overworld, ,overall quests, dungeons, raids, and actual things to do, both vanilla and TBC far out  do anything BFA has.
---
Shamans can tank. Ive done it. They can hold group aggro with rockbiter attacks and earth shocks used as taunts.
---
They are the worst tanks but they can fill the roll in dungeons if done right.
---
1b - As far as arena balance... you remember this expac released death knighs, right?
---
Some shots are really good! Thanks for providing the unprocessed originals, I prefer them without the logo. 
---
Cant remember my first but I remember selling it for 100g, which at the time was a fortune.
---
I was 17, was not playing WoW. We didn't own a PC. All my time was spent working on my project car or riding bmx bikes. 
---
Now I'm 31, work in a garage, married with 2 kids and play some mobile battle royal games. Havnt been hyped about a game since I quit wow about 2 weeks after legion started. Waiting for classic is my hype, it's been enough hype I'm finally building a gaming PC too replace the one i built in 06 when i started playing.
---
My first max level toon was a hunter because I was struggling to level my warrior. Eventually leveled the warrior after tbc dropped. The goal this time is level something new. That leaves me with rogue, lock or ret pally. 
---
Azshara is totally empty (5-7q total) while its rly beautiful...
---
vanilla itemization is like the best part of vanilla? O_o
---
Shoot I want it for the same reason, I would never stop laughing. That being said, the camera isn't compatible with old character models so it's not gonna happen :P
---
I thought it was a great video! As a druid I have been wondering for a while if I was going to be able to do this farm. I like how you explain the mana, the spells needed why they are needed, etc etc. 
---
Perhaps another short video on the path/kill order of lasher packs once you jump down?
---
I would also very much like to see what your armor was while in bearform. Not that it should matter too much, I saw, as you said you ended with around half HP, so even with a little less geared Druid should be fine
---
Loved Howling Fjord.  Such a cool zone
---
Kang the Decapitator dropped for my hunter in Un'Goro Crater. Sold that bad boy to help pay for my mount.
---
No I’m pretty sure it’s the same graphics from 2004 lol. Either way, will I have to download BFA or cal I just download classic? 
---
Fighting 8 other massive guilds for World Bosses was a true sight to behold. I haven't found an experience like that in WoW ever again. It was beautiful in terms of MMO history and yet a pain in the ass when you sit there for hours and nobody gets the world boss.
---
If someone says "I'm leveling in this spec", your help concerning a different spec is probably not wanted and is more likely condescending. OP obviously knows enough about the specs to have an idea of what they want, in which case they're also aware Enhancement is generally recommended for leveling efficiency. 
---
I played some retail recently after non having played since BC. Took my 70 druid through the expansion I had missed and got to WoD and was like "fuck yeah, nagrand, that place is awesome, oh it's a level 98+ zone, guess I'll have to wait".
---
I get to level 96 and head there any way, do like 3 quests and hit level 98 then get summoned back to azeroth to fight the legion. 
---
So I quit even though I had like half a month of subscription left. 
---
Yea I wasn't planing on farming R14. It's one of the reasons I have no interest in warriors. I wanted to play a class that main specced one thing. I was thinking of Rogue, Mage and, Hunter for this reason. Rogue is just too cheesy for me. I just feel gross playing one. Mage seems okay but to be honest I don't like casting without a 2hander. Pure caster seem lame to me. So now I am snooping around hunter. They seem real fun but it seem like it's going to take some getting used to.
---
Leveling engineering without a guide... Just the knowledge that you could've saved like 10g when 10g was all the money in the world!
---
agree. theres so much unimplemented or unfinished stuff...
---
wtb karazhan crypt raid!
---
would it be weird to have twilight highlands as a part of the vanilla map?
---
mine was GUTRIPPER. It dropped for my gnome rogue who was such a clicking noob at the time !
---
I am hoping that Northrend, Outland, and the Cataclysm (no rework of classic) zones get added to the game as horizontal improvements to classic instead of vertical. That along with real balance. 
---
Cause horde is sooo much more difficult ._.
---
If I could have TBC spec design in the Vanilla worldscape, I'd be happy. Hell, all I really want is a protection paladin that's effective for raiding. No flying mounts, arena, dailies or badges.
---
Mine was Ring of Saviors off of a Lava spider in Searing Gorge
---
It's perfectly compatible for spicy clipping textures hot selfie action.
---
You are thinking too much into it OP. 
---
In pvp the hunter class is one of the most versatile group orientated classes in the game. 
---
Stratholme - Wailing Banshee -  KANG THE DECAPITATOR
---
i recently watched something that claimed the lad who designed BRD was also responsible for karazhan, which would be easy enough to believe as BRD is, i think, the best example of dungeon design in any game ever
---
its its own city. it has a billion quests corroborated by lore. its a capital of a faction that ended up becoming a playable thing in game. it has god knows how many routes to the point where you have to specify what youre going there for. its accessible to 1/5th of all levels in game. the quality of item within ranges from absolutely disposable junk to MULTIPLE types of quest-related enchants to literal best in slot items to ultra meme items like ironfoe or the circle of flame...
---
The first Epic world drop I found was Nightblade, a level 39 epic 2H sword that randomly dropped for my level 39 Hunter, I used it :)
---
STV music is the best music
---
Knowing this, one of the funniest "PvP" videos I remember was a 19 twink guild trying to take a guild photo in the gurubashi arena. A level 60 approaches and they sound a bit worried on vent, then when it gets within range of the hunters it dies in about 5 seconds :DD
---
So much this! Playing on Light's Hope atm and I can say that I fear this "must be efficient mentality" and "meta" and BIS/PREBIS whatever other fotm words the kids use today are going to gouge a lot of the fun out of classic! And don't get me started on reserving itesm! jeez! all these pugs I see spamming /2 saying Orbs, dagger and mount on reserve blah blah blah! Can't we just play the game and have FUN like we did when we were noobs?
---
I would be ecstatic if Blizzard actually considers this years down the road because that would mean Classic was a huge success.  
---
Why would I change that which is correct...or mostly correct. Wrath seemed still okay, but Cata was just too much.
---
aesthetically speaking, uldum is my favorite zone of all time. the quest chain always annoyed me for the same reason, so i ignored it. but good god, its gorgeous
---
What do you mean with "no changes"?
---
They are going to use 1.12.1 talents AND start the game off with 16 debuff slots. For all we know they will launch with 1.12.1 itemisation (which makes the game significantially easier btw)and probably all the comeback gear as well (like the dungeon2 sets, and sunken temple quests etc.
---
They have already fundamentally changed the game, and made it much easier than it would otherwise have been. 
---
But yeah, I would like as few changes as possible for a long while after nax has been out, but I would rather them stay on Azeroth, pretend like Outland was never made in the firstplace and then try to keep new content in line with the old philosophy of WoW.
---
Hire that Kaplan dude to work on it, and fuck Overwatch.
---
youtube.com
---
TBC is after vanilla. No changes.
---
Use a turtle, still can die fast but it's gratifying having it "shield shell" when they try and be unkillable. Aside from that it's just a slow pet that doesn't hit hard, still like it best though.
---
Cheers for the video, my druid will be looking to spend a fair bit of time in DM it looks like!
---
One question I had was that was why exactly is timing the jump down so crucial when we're doing it on Cat Form with stealth active? Do the mobs below see through stealth? Because otherwise it would seem that we could drop down anywhere not directly on top of a mob and we'd be fine. 
---
TBC is poison
---
keep the game pure
---
Couldn't remember Moonglade, Felwood, The Hinterlands or Dustwallow Marsh for the life of me
---
I would honestly love to know more about it as it seems totally impossible. You can powerlevel people with aoe farming but even traveling between the powerlevel spots would take half of that time. You can cut down your leveling speed to like a half if you get boosted by a lvl 60, but 12 hours seem pretty out of place
---
Ain't there a much more significant +hit advantage from the +5 weapon skill?
---
I can see the relation. Kara isn't a city but it has a similar feeling of complexity. You begin in the stables, make your way to the dining room, then to a theater, slowly ascending through the craziness. Its a linear path but does an excellent job at maintaining a sense of exploration. You never know what's going to be around the next corner. It's similar to shadowfang keep in this respect.
---
Journeying through a magical tower just feels so quintessential fantasy as well. Definitely one of my favorite dungeons.
---
Horde cities suck ass, those savages dont know how to lay out a city, your gonna spend just as much time runnin back an forth trying to get to a npc you need, as you will actually leveling.
---
Vanilla - Long Grindy leveling process, long grinds for reps, raiding was casual at most difficult. PvP was definitely the star of enough so they force fed you PvE without any equivalent PvP items, the PvP grind was rewarding. PvE was semi rewarding if you got TFury, sinew, or anathema/benediction. Really an EQ alternative. Questing/grouping was infinitely more meaningful. 
---
TBC - Introduced smaller group PvP/esport, raids were still a little bland but the story behind it was decent. Class synergy/balance was more defined in PvE content while mechanics were still “fresh”. Many didn’t understand certain classes and some were gimmicky (hunter steady shot scripts). Questing was very predictable with not many options, rep grinding was well implemented and zones were absolutely gorgeous. 
---
WotLK - info about class/spec became more prevalent and pve mechanic became more in depth. Naxx remake was ok at best - and some achievements (plagued proto / immortal) made it worthwhile investment (it’s like bliss knew we ran that simplistic shit 5000 times in vanilla). PvP was similar to TBC although I believe some small group PvP comps were a little broken (WLS/beastcleave). The story in Wrath was really solid, revived dalaran, decent cutscenes etc. the real MVP was ulduar. That raid was probably the best blizzard has designed in the sense that there was a lot of options on how to tackle a boss. Freya + 3, yog - 0 light, Hell even XT hard mode. Open world PvP started losing its shimmer as we moved away from the original content with some content trying to revive it. 
---
Cata - space aids
---
MOP - Panda flu
---
WOD - had some new nice raid mechanics (high maul was fun, end game raids were very fun) PvP was almost non existent as arena values were inflated.  
---
Legion - fucking super aids, class/spec specific weapons sound great on paper. Grinding them out was hell, daily’s were ok, the way they implemented them was awesome but most were just reappearing and it became a chore. One thing legion brought that was amazing was Mythic+. I still thing mythic+ is one of blizzards better content that should’ve made its way into the game much earlier. 
---
BFA - undead aids
---
1 - I share your preferences, but IF you're going to build a narrative-driven MMO, WotLK did a great job of it.
---
2 - I would divide (Vanilla, TBC) and (WotLK, Cata) instances into two different categories of gameplay, where the former is more emergent gameplay driven, and the later is more top-down designed gameplay. Threat is a simple mechanic that worked in dungeons. Your group would take on a bunch of mobs, eventually thanks to threat the tank wouldn't be able to lock down all of those mobs all the time, so everybody would be called upon to leverage their variety of niche skills to deal with the situations that arose. Simple mechanic + large toolbox = interesting emergent gameplay.
---
The problem with threat was that it was a shit raid mechanic. When the tank loses threat in a dungeon, fun things happen. When a tank loses threat in a raid, it's a wipe. With TBC pushing the focus of the game to raid content and WotLK running with it, rather then keeping this odd world where threat was important in dungeons and irrelevant in raids, they just ripped threat out in WotLK all together. Upside, this made the mechanics more consistent. Downside, this is how WotLK became famous for its AoE-all-the-things speed run gameplay. Cata shoved a wide variety of mechanics into 5mans, replacing threat as the driver of emergent content to how to deal with a wide variety of boss abilities. This was fun, but it also streamlined the experience since often there were more clear single ways to work with a mechanic, and with the nerfing the correct answer more often than not was to just power through the mechanics.
---
As the saying goes.. Don't make me get on my main Lol.
---
When it comes to being camped, just wait a little bit until they get bored and leave. The worst thing you can go is to keep trying to res and do a quest only to be ganked again.
---
I got the flurry axe as a drop in Feralas for my protection warrior while leveling. It felt amazing. 
---
I got 40. Could have gotten Redridge mountains if it took redridge.
---
Yeah, DKs definitely suffered from the common problem of making the new-thing way too powerful to sell the expansion, but towards the end of WotLK they were in a much more balanced place. And even then I'd still take DKs over some of the bullshit 2v2 comps from TBC.
---
... Ben? 
---
you guys should freeze exp at level 24 and go to duskwood. made a 24 druid for duskwood for this very reason before. that 30% movespeed is GNARLY, imp stealth lets you get around the town safely, and feral charge lets you stick onto everything. rogues are gnarly too. ambush/ghostly lets you yeet on openers but combat is strong too
---
theres also some critical breakpoints to level 24. http://classicdb.ch/?item=1976 is a huge stat stick with tremendous top-end that lets you flat out melee people to death if you get stuck out of form with no mana
---
If I remember correctly, mine was a [Core Marksman Rifle](https://www.wowhead.com/item=18282/core-marksman-rifle)
---
Loved that thing on my Dwarf Hunter. 12 year old me was thrilled to have the Supersoaker!
---
Enchanting trainer being in Ulda.
---
that being said, ....
---
DKs in high level arena lol. 
---
I raided Karazhan crypt once, in 2.0 I think. The mobs there were higher than lv63 (70 maybe? All I know is glancing blows and resists were through the roof) and dropped Netherweave Cloth (which otherwise didn't exist yet). Kinda pointless, but something different to do while waiting on TBC.
---
Finally! We need more content on why vanilla was so good, Ive maybe seen that 1 or 2 times before !
---
More like a playable cinematic considering it's literally impossible to lose unless every person on your team is AFK.
---
i still wouldnt call karazhan linear. the lower third or so of the dungeon itself is a bit of a labyrinth. hell, lets not forget karazhan has a basement (not the crypts)
---
&gt; Anyone else remember being excited
---
Looks at flair... Nope only more nerfs. At least we got a new Mage Armor icon.
---
You shouldn’t be at level 21 long enough for it to really matter...
---
Thinking about it is all I can do. I don't even own a PC atm. I am buying one just so I can play classic this summer. Or I would already be on private doing a "dry run" lol
---
Yeah, it was fine for that. It was not fine in PvP. 
---
being a gnome and getting stuck in bone ornaments on the ground in BWL
---
Thanks for this. 
---
I think you're right, level 24 opens up wetlands and duskwood plus shred takes level 22 to get and feral charge sounds like a must have.
---
Thank you for your advice!
---
looks like someone paid attention to the rule of thirds!
---
also: ?????????????? what is that angle from loch modan? i have only levleed one dwarf ever and otherwise have always leveled elsewhere. i am going to have to visit it when the time comes
---
No. If the difficulty scale would have been better then it would give more options for enjoyable things to do.
---
Islands are fun to me. To each his own. You might view them as a dungeon, but I see their value differently.
---
As far as 'overall content' goes- the examples you gave are largely effected by the fact that the map size is smaller. Percentage wise, if the current packs contents were the equivalent of the vanilla world's size, then I believe there would be more.
---
I never said that this pack IS better than vanilla or bc, I said it had potential to be if it had been executed differently.
---
Haha no. 
---
Very well thought out response,  but imo no threat defeats the purpose of even having the trinity in place. Also the dungeons were nerfed aggressively and early so not nearly that engaging.
---
One thing that often gets overlooked with rogues is how strong the Dungeon 2 4pc set bonus can be (depending on where the proc rate is at). By the time you're comparing it to AQ40 drops it is weak, but if they release it early in Classic or if a rogue is playing catch up to their guild because they start raiding late it is a great option. It procs A TON, particularly for horde rogues who get the benefit of Windfury totem to generated extra proc chances.  
---
For T2 sword rogues, who get their sword skill from Maladath, wearing eight pieces of tier 2 is generally the accepted choice. For dagger rogues though, if you are not including AQ40/Naxx gear, then for PvE purposes I like this setup...  
---
Darkmantle Helm (D2)  
---
Darkmantle Shoulders (D2)  
---
Darkmantle Chest (D2)  
---
Darkmantle Bracers (D2)  
---
Aged Core Leather Gloves  
---
Bloodfang Belt (T2)  
---
Bloodfang Pants (T2)  
---
Boots of the Shadowflame  
---
It kind of depends on the order that you get your raid epics in and there's an argument for going Darkmantle Belt and Bloodfang Bracers if you have enough crit from consumables/world buffs (Songflower, for example) to justify the extra hit.  
---
At any rate, if you can spare the time/gold investment to get a set of Dungeon 2 then it is worth going for because it gives you some really good options.
---
1/29/21 or for tauren I like 0/30/21 - this is great for pvp, especially early game or if you don't have amazing gear. You can raid heal as this spec until probably BWL. Balance hybrid specs definitely get better and better as you get further into the game, especially if you can get t2.5
---
Thanks for the kind words :)
---
I'm in exactly the same boat man, turning 39 this year, 2 kids, 4 and 2. While I was absolutely sure I would not have time for this, I slowly began changing my mind. It's all a matter of being honest with yourself and your family. I was hesitant to tell my wife that I would pick up wow again, because she had some difficult times with me during my HC vanilla period. I realize that 14 years ago things were out off balance. Quiting wow was such a relieve, I felt free again. Now that we have our little family, have our house and both have an abundant social life and good jobs, we both accept the fact that during this very busy period in our lives, having some time off to really enjoy yourself while doing something you really love is a must.
---
That being said, my wife totally agrees with me picking up Classic. She knows how important this  was for me back in the days. Of course the balance is crucial, but I should at least get myself 2 full nights during weekdays after the kids are gone to bed and probably some time now and then during weekends. We've grown up now and know much more about life and how to manage. I'm totally looking forward to Azeroth again, a lot more casual in comparison to vanilla, but still epic, for sure! Enjoy the journey and see you in Azeroth!
---
ps: get yourself a decent headphone, it'll be totally worth it ;)
---
Oh man I remember that. Most professions have trainers scattered around the world but enchanting is the only one inside a fucking instance. Thrustbrickingly stupid.
---
There are some points to argue about, but generally [this](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-Z2vplxWZACKmCpw1B8vexKQ2vwjRqFRjcJhHjAxxJg/edit) is a decent point to start with.
---
as two, you honestly might even be able to terrorize the path from duskwood to the rebel camp. i used to go there from time to time simply because its adjacent, but solo can be overwhelming since you often cannot respond appropriately to the flight path never being more than 30 seconds away, which means random players and reinforcements
---
Some 2h Mace from MC cuz noone else wanted it. I was a tank at the time and didn't really have a use for it so wasn't as magical a moment as it probably should have been 
---
I dont get why people keep refering to Varraks run when it was done pre fixing quest xp, thus given on average ~30% additional xp. 
---
Inside an instance no one wants to run too...
---
There was a relatively cheap 2h purple mace that I saved up all my gold for on my paladin.  I didn't really know what I was doing in the game, I just thought a purple item would be cool.  So I bought the Taran Icebreaker and got laughed at by people who understood the game 
---
If I don’t enjoy the leveling experience, I’m not going to level it to 60 in the first place. I do actually enjoy playing a resto Druid, and leveled as a NS/HotW hybrid recently. I suppose it’s just a personality difference that we’re debating here.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
Comcast also "understands my concerns" the problem is we know they don't give a shit.
---
Looted hurricane on my hunter in hinterlands while leveling. I would complain to my friend in school why do everyone say hunters are the easiest to level, I just die all the time and can only get a few shots off before the mob is meleeing me. so then i learned about beast mastery spec being the reason why hunters are op. then my pet never lost agro and we lived happily ever after. 
---
Man I miss back before damage meters were popular and you paid more attention to stuff like bow much Dps a weapon does. It's hard to explain but it made the feeling of getting new gear better. Now you just SIM everything, it makes for boring progression. 
---
It's from the other side, technically in Wetlands, looking South at the dam from where the waterfall is.
---
I don't disagree. I was a OT, but my main hobby in the game was PvP. Everyone in my guild knew that. I was just upset that he got both is all. Thunderfury is bis tank weapon through the end of the game iirc. 
---
Don’t think these exist. Anywhere. Not even on YouTube. 
---
TLDR; game became PvE focused over the years, while middle class denizen shrunk making end game more accessible through different means of difficulty. 
---
Depends how serious. If you care about your raiders being able to rank for cheap without any real loses then frostbite is completley fine. 
---
Razorgore trash should NEVER be even remotely close to a healer, and if it was then it's hardly frostbites fault.
---
Goblin packs are tanked and slaughtered by fury warriors, plenty to taunt if needed and honestly it would redirect the warlocks to melee instead of going into the raid which isn't a totally bad thing.
---
You can raid without having the most optimal specs without being a shit guild man.
---
I can send a link once I'm home.
---
Paladins aren't considered raid viable. They can stand there and take a beating just fine, it's everything else that doesn't cut it.
---
Then imagine you're not even that tanky and that's Shaman tanking.
---
Best you can manage is to tank some mid 50s dungeon.
---
I agree with you for sure. I was more of a fan of Sulfuras and Ashkandi anyways, but was never lucky. Haha 
---
Not necessarily, and modern WoW shows how it can be done. They replace the various threat management skills with various defensive cool downs that the tank can use to react to various boss abilities and situations that arise due to fight mechanics. Then toss in some situation group buffs and you have a game that preservers the holy trinity roles without a threat mechanic. 
---
The nerfing of Cata dungeons certainly highlights the dangers of listening too closely to your player base as well as shows how low the average player had fallen thanks to the easy WotLK, had Blizz stuck to their guns here Cata might even have been remembered fondly....although I doubt that thanks to how badly they fucked up the world.
---
I do like conversations like the one you started though as progressing through TBC and beyond is the most likely path forward after Classic. These highlight some of the areas where improvements could be made, and somehow I don't think that the TBC and beyond communities would be as staunchly #nochanges! as the vanilla community. TBC without flying and OP badge gear. WotLK without LFD and no 10 man raiding. Cata without the blanket 5man nerf. MoP without the fucking Pandas. Those could all be good reasons to revisit those expansions.
---
Hunters are fantastic in BG's. I posted some pretty crazy scores back in the day, especially in AV. 
---
Going 100+ kills to single digit deaths was a pretty common occurrence 
---
I hate BfA but "TBC released with 6" is disingenuous as fuck. ZA/Kara little more than large dungeons (fun, but that isn't raiding). 
---
2 of the other raids had 1 and 2 bosses respectively.
---
BfA first raid 8 bosses, TBC released with 9 true raid bosses.  
---
They already said that things like attaching multiple items per mail is going to be backported to classic. And with the modern addon API, postal and similar should work too.
---
Or just release TBC servers while keeping Classic servers the way they are?
---
I was 6 and went to primary school.
---
Considering I was level 58 when TBC dropped... no. No I don't. I remember using the AV Spear.  
---
Lei of Lilies
---
First one for me was winning the Robe of the Archmage pattern in LBRS, spent hours farming elementals in ungoro, eastern plaguelands and silithus for the mats on my mage but worth it in the end.
---
1- Where you say grindy, I say genuine content.
---
Long grindy leveling you say? Well, an entire fleshed out world with FUN and DIFFICULT content I guess could be a grind... if you dont like mmos.
---
Rep grind? Reps are a grind by nature...
---
Casual raiding? Hmmm, so they halved the sizes of raids and added layers of ez modes because the raiding was too "casual". Makes sense. This is just blatantly untrue. People knew who the raiders and raid guilds were on their server, and they were the exception, so by nature,  not casual.
---
2- TBC raids bland? They had the most raids and most variety of any expac. SSC was bland? Kara bland? Sunwell? Hyjal? This is rediculous.
---
People didnt understand classes? Well they actually had depth, so I could see where you could get that from.
---
3- Info about class became more prevalent... sure if you never did any research prior to this I guess? Classes became homogenized here, and content became so easy you could ignore class understanding anyway.
---
Nax remake was rediculous, why even bring it up it was literally tuned under the 60 version. Embarrassment that the entry raid for this "beloved" expac was a copy paste.
---
 Some rambling about pvp...yeah it ceased to exist.
---
4- agreed. Dumpster fire.
---
I think you still take fall dmg in cat form, so stealth breaks. 
---
Moonkin aoe is viable, any caster aoe really. It’s super easy for mage/lock to do these pulls if they’re careful
---
Epic 😎
---
Yeah I hear you man. Not much else to talk about on the game right now though, and I wanted to share my enthusiasm for it!
---
There’s none out yet. Absolutely none. Don’t try searching for them on YouTube or even google. 
---
Yeah I wish we could have those times back :(
---
Modern Blizzard are so hell bent on protecting everyone from a negative experience for some reason.
---
Rip its damn shell off 
---
You said that bfa had the most content of any expac. I think I have explained how outrageous that notion is, and not because of the overall map size, but because of the amount and quality of content in both vanilla and tbc far outweigh bfa.
---
Your bring up islands again so I will rest my case.
---
The utility is great but buffs aside they don't do much.
---
I believe it procs on every hit. But it does have an internal cooldown. My idea was wind fury but you’d be doing so little damage with a 90 damage one hand in vanilla. There was no dual wielding. 
---
Yeah there are a lot of buttons but during raid the amount goes down a ton.  Only banish for cc and its not too often or another lock can pick up.  You don't have to spam decurse or buff the raid.  
---
Well, i would really prefer them to go the OSRS route if possible because i hate TBC but i have serious doubt they will do that. I guess that when classic end i will just level to 70 and wait for wotlk.
---
I'm sorry, god damn meanings of words in communication are pesky, huh?
---
If memory serves tbc released with kara, ssc, TK, Gruuls, and mag. This is way more than 9 bosses if we are moving the goal post to that rather than total raids.
---
Lèeroy
---
I'm glad you'll finally shut the fuck up 
---
It might not be possible.  The whole point is we don't know.  Pservers get a lot of things wrong, I guess you have never seen that world :)
---
Yes, I did. Because percentage wise bfa does have the most content imo, and neither of us can prove otherwise.   So we will just have to agree to disagree.
---
Casters are the only class type that have a 100% resist change.
---
We did a couple 15-hunter AB's back in the day. it was awesome
---
[I even somehow still have a screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/Kcdtb04.jpg)
---
Considering how cucked Jeff Kaplan is, and his desire to focus more on combating "toxicity" rather than improving the game, i'd rather not have him go anywhere near Classic.
---
I am not saying there is or isn't something we don't know about.  Just saying we don't know.  I would guess there isn't anything that wasn't discovered but we probably won't ever know.
---
I relate all too well. I have always played a pally healer, and I’m so worried about getting distracted by my little one and letting my party members die, than I’m considering rolling a pure dps class. That way if I step away for a sec, maybe it’s not as huge of a deal. 
---
That's a tortoise.
---
I didn't reach cap until mid-wrath so my first epic was probably one of the welfare epics that the BadgePlz patch brought in. The first epic of significance I can remember though was Quel'delar. I got the battered hilt or whatever it was called and didn't know what it was. My friends told me it was a super powerful sword and I was really excited to get it. 
---
Then as I turned in the quest I realised I shammies couldn't use swords... So I got a random mace instead :( 
---
Still great stats, but a bit underwhelming.
---
I think the first epic I saw was BOE that dropped in Feralas. My friend got it, and sold it on the AH. Not sure if he sent me any of that gold.
---
They could just tell him to fuck off, and to stop imitating chairman Mao.
---
Just slam their hands on his desk and say focus on the fucking gameplay aspect and nothing else, and let him playtest with his chat box disabled.
---
1- I see your point but I still see the removal of threat as just a simplification of the game unnecessarily. You can still have engaging mechanics and cooldowns while keeping threat. It was another layer of complexity not only for tanks but all raid members other than just spamming a rotation.
---
2- Yes, I see your point but see in each of the cases you are stating if we just changed and tweaked this and that then this expac would be great! I agree with you, but the bottom line is that that wasnt the case, and even if they are rereleased it is highly doubtful they will be altered.
---
My arguments are about what was and is, not about what could be.
---
Lei of Lillies!
---
I remember how excited I was once I saw it drop from this Fire Roc in Tanaris.
---
Frankly I was never going to ask a mage for water or food ever again, or so I thought!
---
My Spirit Tap regeneration would make me un-oom-able with that amount of spirit. Not to mention this amazing on-use effect. 
---
i cant remember how many times, but over the course of months i killed that fucker at least 10+ times before he dropped the damn trinket 
---
December 2004..
---
test
---
I never got into raiding. So I took the route of the Tier 0.5 set upgrading my blue Devout. I've still got the character and sometimes log in and people stop and stare.
---
I would agree. All TBC has is raiding we have already done and very badly balanced arena that makes all other PvP trivial along with wpvp that was ruined by flying. The funny thing is that you often use less buttons in TBC in arena because engineering and all the trinkets and consumables no longer need keybound. If you want to play an ONLY PVE game I don't understand why you wouldn't play the modern game. In vanilla it's worth it to do raids because you have gear that can last a year or two that also is awesome for pvp. Why raid in TBC? To do something you have already seen that serves no purpose (outside a few items that are near impossible to get like glaives depending on guild politics)? Hey look at my gear! It's good for raiding and um raiding. Bg's are pointless and people just afk them but hey check out my raid gear that has no resilience!
---
TBC sucks. All most people did was Kara on repeat and they want to relive their past and "win" this time. It won't happen. You will be bored by the time you hit Hyjal because there is nothing else to do but raid.
---
I mistyped it. R/workingadultsguild
---
&gt;.&lt;
---
I got the stupid 2h hammer off a random mob running towards ungoro crater.  It was the first purple item my guild saw.  This was when all the 5 mans were still 10s and 15s.  But no one on the server had gold to blow on shit like that so I just kept it.  Still in my bank along with the engineering hat of stamina and my drops from the scourge invasion.
---
S A B C D F
---
Druid: S tier dungeon tank. Super simple threat generation, either spam Maul or Swipe. Nearly impossible to fuck uip. Higher HP pool and armor, best range pull ability in the game, isn't capped by rage generation. Has Innervate ensuring there's no downtime.
---
Warrior: B tier dungeon tank. Somewhat limited rage generation in comparison to Druid, doesn't have any team utility that hastens clear speed, limited multi target threat generation, and bow pulling is slightly less effective than FF(F). Looking at them purely as dungeon tanks that puts them slightly behind Druids.
---
Paladin: C-. Mana pool is restrictive, needs to get creative with Blessing of Protection usage (5 min cd untalented, 3 min talented) to compensate for lack of taunt. Not really ideal since you'd rather BoP a Mage or a Warlock so that they can do AoE freely, but in an emergency force dropping aggro with BoP does work so that still puts them above other classes. Has the best AoE threat generation in the game until they go OOM.
---
Shaman: D. Only slightly better than a fully buffed/talented Voidwalker.
---
All other classes: F.
---
Brain hacker dropped on a guild run of strath ud. What a crappy epic that was for my warrior
---
No I don’t want any fucking changes until after Naxxramas is out for several months 
---
But then they eventually go full-circle again, while also splitting the playersbase into 7 fucking games eventually, all with their own support teams.
---
I would rather them try to make a "better" wow based on the vanilla philosophy similar to OSRS (which is a massive success) and have one game for the hardcore playerbase, and one for the mobile gamers.
---
Basic business sense is that the less effort and man-hours put into something the better. I highly doubt any time put into this is for an ego related reasons. The changes they are making/considering are either to suit technological advances or financial reasons. I get that people on here like to push the "Acti-Blizz is Evil" narrative but they're simply a business acting how most billion dollar businesses do.
---
Good thing AV will be delayed in classic. 
---
True, but the same lens could be turned at vanilla WoW. If they just had a real pvp system instead of the abomination of the honor system, if they actually made the world pvp objectives worthwhile, if they nudged the hybrids a bit and fleshed out itemization.
---
Not to mention, best set design clearly belongs to TBC. T5 warlock gear and T6 priest set, daymn.
---
GMs back in the day are nothing like now. They used to spawn in game sometimes to interact with you. Way fuckin cool.
---
Crazy how 3 quests can bring you from 97 or 98 lol. 3 quests wont get you from 7-8 in vanilla lmao
---
Yah I miss my priest... and even though I say all of the above, I might sell out and roll a dwarf this time.  If the server never advances past 1.12, and population drops there might be a shortage of fear ward.  Who knows...honestly I picked human for bouncy boobs and faction.  I live for farming faction.
---
Yes it makes it a lot easier. Stupidly easier. We already know all this from private servers. DM gear at launch and 16 debuffs make it even easier. Tier 1 and 2 are already HARD nerfed just due to 1.12 talents and boss tweaks and rebalanced that nerfed content past when it was current. The other stuff added on top is bad. Nightfall axe spell dmg debuff being in at launch along with the 16 debuffs is also, really, really bad.
---
Along with making things to easy it also hurts crafting. Itemization and patch cycle are simply something that really needs examined by the Classic team. They are relatively easy fixes and they have the old itemization numbers from servers like Nost and internet archives. Rebalancing boss fights and other nonsense aren't easy fixes and expecting them to do all that work top try to make 2004 content challenging is silly. Tier 1 and 2 will be fine with just the 1.12 nerfs. Will they be easier than Vanilla was? Sure. Will you still need a guild? Usually.
---
I would not be happy with this I’d actually be pissed off
---
There's some incomplete zones that I wish would be completed and STV is such an obvious piece of filler it hurts.  It's designed to handle a chunk of the leveling they never quite finished, and the quests are godawful.  
---
If they do decide to touch things up, there's a bunch of zones that could use another few questlines and some nice lore-related upgrades.  Not the shitty cataclysm stuff, but some good vanilla-feeling quests and content.
---
Its not the people watching the steam, its the people in game tryin to be on the stream that are the problem.
---
druid might be good. get to transform into cool/cute animals and use the power of nature. its a pretty flavorful class that has the easiest leveling besides hunter and lock. hunters also fun with taming pets but the microing of a pet and managing food and ammo can be a pain.
---
Messing up talents and having to pay gold 
---
i was 6... so obviously i was pretty bad at the game lol. i didn't get farther than level 20 and my parents were constantly looking over my shoulder and stepping in when i was having a conversation, or trying to converse to the best of my 6 year old abilities, with random players. i think they eventually set some kind of filter to prevent people from messaging me since i apparently got nasty messages from time to time. i played every starting zone from 1-10 several times, but i really liked playing a night elf hunter because i thought they were beautiful and i liked taming cats. i didn't start competently playing the game til wotlk.
---
now i'm a full time student that plays... whatever i fancy, i guess. from bioware rpgs to nintendo games to bayonetta. i don't play wow anymore, unfortunately; i had fun questing in legion but i hated the mythic stuff. i didn't even bother with bfa when my ex who's a hardcore wow fan said he cancelled his sub just a month into it. nothing about it captured my interest, either.
---
i'm really looking forward to classic though! i hate how in modern wow, questing to max is just an afterthought, a chore to get through to get to the "real" game. i want to savor the journey with a close knit community, and maybe think about endgame raiding if i can manage it. i think i've got my heart set on a warlock of some kind, maybe human, haven't really decided my faction yet.
---
Developers spending more time working on their games isn't anti-consumer. You've worked yourself into a fervor based solely on bad faith speculation. 
---
Heard it wastes a debuff slot so I wonder what modern guilds think of that weapon now.
---
Why do people want to avoid servers with streamers? I think it would be more fun tbh I love busy servers 
---
Uldum quests are among my favorites to play actually, but of course the mechanics slone wouldn't fit with early WoW. It's like a fun indie singleplayer game.
---
You will, it’ll be a tiered release of content, AQ will be released later
---
Old school. Done with school and already going for marriage and kids. 
---
The most brutal sentence I have read all day.
---
*Hey just noticed..* It's your **8th Cakeday** Myrkull! ^(hug)
---
December 2004:
---
Freshman year of college. Just moved to dorm where all my hs friends were. Played WoW religiously when friend introduced it to me. Classes, parties, sleep when not playing WoW. Forced myself to like mainstream rock music because it was meta.
---
Now:
---
Mechanical Engineer. Moved states 4 times in the past 15 years. Single. No kids. Still game but not as much, main reason being because all my old friends have forgotten gaming and are married with kids. Game with new friends for a couple hours each day. Netflix, EDM, chilling at the beach when not working or gaming.
---
[https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=260](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2605)0 45:10 he mentions AQ specifically. I would assume that when he refers to the event he is talking about doing the collections to start it as well.  
---
Man my first epic I don't think I'll ever forget. I wasnt in game at the time and I get a text from my buddy who mained a druid. He said hey man get online I have something for you. 
---
I login and he throws Krol Blade in the trade window and presses the check. This mother Fucker bought me a Krol blade. I think I was like level 52 at the time and was leveling as a sword spec rogue. OMG the SS crits that thing pulled. It was amazing. 
---
Damn you
---
nah
---
The issue is that OSRS doesn't have the same progression or power creep as WoW does. A level 60 in Naxx gear will be ridiculously stronger than other players and have 2x the health pool of a fresh 60. I wouldn't mind content past Naxx a few years down the line, but the issue is that there's no easy solutions to doing that with the power creep at 60 and how broken Naxx gear is.
---
The whole server community is centered on the streamer. Everything in trade chat-about the streamer. If you kill a mob that the streamer is trying to get-you get right click reported and harassed by his/her ravenous fanboys. If you yank the streamer-he/she will most likely say your a stream sniper. If you run a dungeon or raid with the streamer-he /she will get all of the loot, a completely corrupt loot council/loot distribution system. Whatever faction the streamer plays-heavy faction imbalance because his/her fanboys will want to play with him/her. If you see the streamer-there will be a ton of fanboys following him/her. If you are on the same faction as the streamer, because of the imbalance your queue times will be veerrryy long. Need I say more? Streamer realms sound awful.
---
1- Even without pvp objectives vanilla still had the best world pvp. 
---
2- I agree with this and it's why I said tbc had the best class design, because it withheld the class integrity while also balancing specs.
---
3- ten storms says hi. Judgment, wrath, might,earth fury, dreadnought,  cryptstalker.
---
Vanilla most iconic but tbc very good as well imo. That tier 6 druid..
---
Mmm
---
Don't come here with your science!
---
Warriors won't have any plate on dinging 40, (on their mains at least). Shamans should have Mail hoarded, putting them in the same gear.
---
Shield Block only lasts 1 hit, 2 if prot specced (but the average warrior isn't), and detracts from your rage generation. Against multiple mobs, it's not so effective. Stoneskin totem only needs to be dropped once at the start of the fight and applies to all hits, like demo shout, but is significantly stronger than demo shout, especially against mobs with a high attack speed like the Monks in SM.
---
Shield Wall is a one off cooldown saved for when something goes badly wrong. You're not using it every fight, so I don't count it for general mitigation. If Ice Block didn't drop aggro, it wouldn't make Mages the best at mitigation since they'd still be squishier most of the time.
---
Thunderclap is not generally used when tanking due to the poor rage to threat ratio. The debuff is good, and with it up I concede Warriors are better at physical mitigation, but in doing so they'd cripple their threat output.
---
Shamans also have Grounding Totem, Earth Shock, and various resistance totems which mitigate a bunch of damage from caster mobs which Warrior's longer cooldown Shield Bash can't compete with.
---
For ranged attacks, Shamans have Wind Wall totem, but those are pretty rare and can be prevented with proper positioning, so I'm not counting that.
---
Shamans can also Purge damaging buffs like the Scarlet Wizards' Fire Shield which reduces incoming damage.
---
Shamans can also choose to place a Healing Stream Totem down, which will offset a little bit more incoming damage with healing - equivalent to reducing incoming dps by about 8.3 after factoring in Armor. Roughly equivalent to using Demo Shout on 2-3 targets. The downside is you need to drink more often, since you won't have Mana Spring up.
---
For the above reasons I believe an enhance shaman specced into tanking talents is better at general mitigation than the average Warrior on dinging 40, though is swiftly overtaken again as the warrior gains plate gear in the levels that follow.
---
Damn I didn’t know it was like that. I’ve watched some wow streamers but didn’t notice all that Shit going on but yeah that doesn’t sound fun. I still prefer high pop servers though. Really hope the right click report isn’t in classic that’s so toxic....
---
Leerhoy
---
I hope they do that; add content to vanilla. Maybe make KT drop a book that lets you hit lvl 61 or unlock a new raid but only if you kill him/get it. So you’d need 40 kills to get all members the book or something. You know, for the elite. That’s how vanilla was. No casual bullshit. 
---
A good Hunter/Warlock will stick their pet on you and never allow you to drop combat. Hunters can be especially obnoxious if they're highly skilled. One guy I dueled uses Owl because of Screech. What he would do is he'd send his pet into Screech range but keep it far enough away from me that I couldn't kill it.
---
Stuff you can do to make it easier for yourself is buy consumables like Swiftness of Zanza or try to get the Spirit of Zandalar buff once Zul'Gurub is out. They're some of the most powerful consumables/buffs a Warrior can have in PvP.
---
If all games are in maintenance only mode it would be rather trivial to keep them running. 
---
3,000 subs a month is $45,000 USD retail. Which is $540,000.
---
More than enough to keep a server for 3,000 people running for a year. At a profit. 
---
And there’s no way I’d see them dropping below 30k subs per version of classic, even if they had Vanilla, Wrath and TBC Servers. 
---
I would love for them to keep level cap at 60 but make tbc content all lvl 60 but with high stats so it requires you to do at least some vanilla endgame to be geared enough to not be able to just walk in at 60 or 58. Nerf tbc greens to be slightly stronger than vanilla greens but not vanilla blues and epics.
---
TBC raids will be lvl 60 but vanilla gear won't be strong enough for people to just walk in to tbc raids at the start. TBC heroics +professions etc. will reward good enough gear to get into TBC raids. 
---
Also tbc zones aren't a whole different continent/loading screen, add it on to EK/Kalimdor so old zones are better at staying relevant than they were/are right now. Make old  TBC quests(main storyline quests in each tbc zone, attunements etc) give the talent points currently gained by levelling so it's possible for the added talent tree tiers.
---
 ^Same with wotlk. Just lvl 60 cap, talent points gained through content, zones connected to azeroth so you can access  flight points to vanilla zones instead of having to go through a loading screen then fly where you want to go.
---
Keeps old content relevant, keeps azeroth just as lively since a lot of people doing tbc/wotlk content have access to ek/kali flight points(less of a process to go do some STVietnam pvp, help a friend/guild member with a quest/getting ganked/raids + dungeons[dungeon runs as well] etc)
---
It would allow them to not worry about new xpac greens being stronger than previous xpac blues and sometimes ok/meh epics. dont have to worry about having to redo defense rating(maybe even hit rating etc if you're on top of gearing from old content so you can replace pieces with upgrades and still maintain stat caps)
---
Then personally I would want them to stop at wotlk(lvl60  etc) and start adding old cut content. Old Ironforge, Airstrip, Hyjal, Gilneas, Karazhan, north-of-EPL (later became Ghostlands), etc. Raids rewarding better gear than wotlk raids as well as giving same quality or slightly better(maybe not higher stat values than previous xpac's gear, but better itemization gear compared to previous xpac raids.)

Yee it makes a huge different. Double the debuff slots changes the game. If dire maul is open at launch alongside 16 rebuffs, molten core will be a breeze. The only difficult variable is that when you get 40 people together, there’s still a chance at least 1 will fuck up and wipe the raid. But for those hardcore guilds that have been training on private servers for years, it’ll be cleared ASAP. 
---
One thing to take note of is that private servers don’t have completely accurate data so perhaps blizzlike raids will be more difficult. Not sure too much about this point but I’m sure someone can have a better explanation for you

Damn 10 storms, gonna end up rolling another Shaman just in hopes of getting those wolf shoulders.
---
* I was 5 years old at the time
---
* Well as you can imagine, no I was not playing WoW :) But I did start 2 years later as a Human Mage! Which didn't last long, I became an Orc Shaman after level 17ish; Warmaul-Misha
---
* I can't exactly remember that far back! I'd wager a guess and say preschool? Can't even remember when Kindergarten starts.
---
* Now I spend a lot of my time on WoW, and sometimes Minecraft. I plan to be a Gnome Mage come Classic!
---
Pretty sure my first epic was a piece of PvP gear. Probably Unstoppable Force. 
---
Yea you’re right!! I remember now from the name that it used to spawn a little whelpling occasionally. Sword was truly awesome. 
---
Mr. "You think you do, but you don't" is currently Blizzard's CEO.
---
Mine was Ring of Spell Power that droped back in those beautiful days in Molten Core - I was so god damn happy with my mage :...)
---
If I were you I'd stay resto, which is still great in pvp with a warrior buddy, until you get that sweet AQ and naxx gear. Then elemental becomed amazing. 
---
I too kinda doubt we’d ever see a Cata classic server. Unless they just go whole hog and second to release *everything*.
---
MoP is honestly likely even if they skip Cata. WoD I doubt they’d ever do unless, again, they’re releasing everything. Even if they did I’d expect a very accelerated content release schedule and, essentially, an early launch of the Legion servers. 
---
And yet here we are discussing the upcoming release of Classic WoW. He was proven wrong, he admitted it and we are getting what we want.
---
Classic appealed to more people because it was a traditional mmorpg. Not the streamlined, hop in for 1hr while on the train bs everything is today. Getting things was an accomplishment, not a handout. You felt good to get somethin done. 
---
Imagine unironically believing this lol.
---
In 2005, I was a student in the Special Forces Qualification course. 
---
In 2019, I am a qualified Green Beret that has been to about 50 different countries for a variety of roles, missions, and really met some cool people. 
---
Ah fuck it streamers are going to ruin classic. Now that you'll be known on servers again they can really fuck you over 
---
Aw shit really? That must have come in with TBC I never knew that. I love having characters on both. I'm gonna wait a while before I start playing to try and get a balanced server 
---
Very awesome work! Great Job!
---
It's running on the same client as current. (the demo one was a little behind but I think they said it will use the same one) so if you can't run BFA you will likely not be able to run classic. It will be on the blizzard launcher, probably as it's own game but maybe just a subset of wow servers.
---
Actually it’s great in pvp. Getting a proc from hand of Edward and instant casting a rank 8 holy light back to full HP is OP.
---
Leeroi
---
Kevin Jordan!  He also streams on Twitch occasionally, and often answers old WoW design questions.
---
Tortoise is a type of turtle.
---
The only reason a warrior doesn't use Thunderclap when tanking is because he doesn't need to. He can easily charge&gt;thunderclap if he wants without really sacrificing much threat. But if he doesn't need the mitigation to survive the pull, its not really needed. Like if you are using stoneskin totem at the start of the fight, its basically the same as popping TClap + Demo Shout at the start. Except TClap and Demo Shout actually do some threat. Not great threat,but some threat. 
---
Saying shield block detracts from your rage gen is a weak argument. By definition, all damage mitigation detracts from your rage gen. 
---
As soon as I hit 40, I bought some green plate gear off the AH for pennies.
---
Warriors also do have disarm in addition to shield bash which hasn't been mentioned.
---
Shield Wall is just a bonus o shit button.
---
I think all this considered, warriors have the better mitigation. Them choosing not to use that mitigation is because they don't need it. Not because it is going to screw up their ability to generate threat. Which I think just emphasizes how much of a moot point it is to have access to slightly higher mitigation anyhow.
---
I have no issue with this, as long as it's optional. Not sure why anyone would care tbh 
---
I WAS THERE. We spent hours on that boss. I was the shaman Pumaran. I was the one who ran across the screen during the screenshot. I also see Dakkin our Aussie Shaman!!! I miss those days.
---
I purchased The Green Tower very early on for 10g and used it for a very long time on my human paladin.  The first epic I saw drop was the Ring of Saviors, from the ghost camps in Azshara (one of my favorite vanilla grinding spots), which I also equipped and used for a very long time lol
---
My first KT progression kill
---
Really?
---
Removing Loot trading?
---
Removing Sharding?
---
Adding Spell Batching?
---
Not Patch 1.12 but 1.1 ??
---
No right-click report??
---
LMFAO !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
I meant it literally lacks the animation, back in WoD it had some hilarious interactions with it, wouldn't be too hard to fix but I dont think they'd want to
---
Releasing a game 100% is not possible, you have to think of backend issues aswell, do you want early 2000s security in your game? You would have chineese gods shooting laserbeams out their eyes in a week. Some changes have to be made. While I hope they dont implement any of the simplification retail has, i understand some things. Gui changes i dont care about, default wow was gabage with guis anyways. While I hope for no sharding, i do expect it to be there and wont be a deal killer. Will it be a repeat of retail? Maybe, but lets wait and find out first.
---
I got 39, I didn't read it included major cities too, really stumped me because of that lol.

I got 5/8 Felheart (T1) and 1/8 Nemesis (T2) on my first MC Run while I was level 58. I was recruited into a guild and basically I was the only lock. They took me to MC as soon as I could enter (58 was minimum for attunement).
---
My main job was getting and keeping on Curse of Elements to bosses for the 5 Frost Mages. They resisted a lot due to the lvl difference but 1 out of 5 went on and was a raiddps increase.
---
So as the only lock on my first run I couldn’t really bid on weapons and items but naturally I got all lock items. Then I was so excited I spent 2-3 whole days yetifarming in Winterspring to ding 60. As soo as I hit 60 I put them on and felt as a God amongst mortals.
---
TLDR; got 6 epics on my first MC run as lvl 58 due to lock shortage and dumb luck. :D 
---
I love my rogue and I like having a shaman in my group for Windfury Totem. Whether they are resto or enhancement (at least in a 5-man) doesn't bother me I just love that freaking totem and if they are there as dps then it makes bringing a resto druid healer more viable since you have one person who can resurrect dead party members and self resurrect in a dps slot.
---
i think ur the only one that grinds for fun my dude 😃
---
Bith Plz if you dont have the names bound to a mouse button before hand you are not going to get them also best just to let it be default Char (dont pick class/race) and delete it a bit later after the mad rush has gone you can tell you are not prepared
---
Broke lots of crowd control effects, though. 😫
---
Mage 
---
Why do you take the point out of nature's grasp if you are a Tauren? For the extra mana and because warstomp is more reliable? 
---
Winterspring. Always got good vibes from it and loved hanging out there.
---
Well, I play a lock so not really an option lol
---
Hunter is fun to play. Damage ok. Great in Bg's. And you the only class who can kitting everything :)
---
2-4 Raid spots is ok not impossible to get a place.
---
Yup
---
Same here. Found off the nagas in Azshara. Sold them for about 40g if I remember right 
---
Stop level at 60, but evey time you add the new content, add more talents, skills, gear. That way you dont have terrible powercreep, and ppls work getting current gear doesn't feel waisted. Anu game that increases a level cap, just killes all their previous content. Thats why im a fan of lev 100 cap from the start on any rpg. And for new content add skills, passive or other ways to slowly increase power that doesn't ruin previous work.
---
probably priest which is sad because I really love spriests and would main one in a heartbeat if they weren't so mana starved, I really don't have much interest in primarily healing so only having the one mana starved offensive spec kinda ruins it for me. Although I still sometimes think about maybe trying to do some sort of wierd mp5 build or something off the wall to make it work.
---
Un’goro for me. My favourite zone. Loved to run around collecting herbs and killing devilsaurs. 
---
Rogue. Just subjectively not a class-fantasy I enjoy. Prefer ranged classes and classes that can heal. (warrior has an exception because I do enjoy tanking)
---
Tbh nobody knows what Blizz will do in 3 years time, so making definitive statement's about what will happen is silly.
---
Oh yeah.  Earthfury boots.  From a MC pug that was only able to down Lucifron.  So inconsequential, and I was a troll so half of it didn't even show up on my character-- but I felt pretty epic, not gonna lie.
---
Shaman because I dont meet the 300lb minimum to roll a Horde toon.
---
Paladin because I don't meet the 301lb minimum to roll an Alliance toon.
---
You're just a little wrong.
---
Least I have chicken. 
---
Hi, /u/ClassicAzeroth
---
Check out my comment and cry over the fact that I, a Horde player extraordinaire, have outsmarted you ;)
---
Undead rogue. I understand the reasons for going with orc as a horde rogue, but find dying in PvP to a fear that I KNOW I could break if only I had Will of the Forsaken far more frustrating than losing to a stun that I may or may not have resisted if I had Hardiness. Hardiness is great, but there are situations where resisting a stun doesn't make a difference. With WotF you can make sure that its use is impactful almost every time you use it.
---
Are you sure I'm not mostly right?
---
This is hilarious because I insta reroll my character often because of skin colour or portrait not looking howI thought it would! 
---
I was 17.  I played an undead warrior.  I was a junior in high school.  Pretty much was into the same hobbies and music that I'm into now.
---
I'm a software engineer now and I don't have much time to game, but I'm making plenty o' time for Classic when it comes out.
---
Dwarfen hand cannon on my hunter
---
You seem fun
---
I know this isn't a late game answer but I would say The Barrens.  
---
Few things beat Barrens chat, my friend!
---
A devastating riposte to be sure. I shall watch your career with interest.
---
Yes. I would be upset. It would just feel like an unnecessary and change that makes no impact because, as other people in this thread have explained, the game would be "solved" again before people have even reached the end game due to datamining. If they really wanted to make gearing unpredictable in this way they'd have to implement warforging, titanforging, random stats, etc. like in retail.  
---
But that would be fucking terrible. Leave it as is.
---
Paladin I would rather cut off my legs then roll Ally. 
---
&lt;3
---
owie my job security
---
1kneedles has a report to nessingwary quest
---
Whoa, 302 IQ over here
---
Even then doesn't the armory only work post level 10? So people will have to wait a few hours unless they log on the server and do a /who.
---
I know. It is one of my favorite raids of all time. 
---
Vanilla- Best leveling experience, immersion, and basically RPG elements.
---
The Burning Crusade- I didn't do much end-game until wrath, so I can't judge what people seem to say is the most important part, but I can say flying was added here, which was cool at the time, but now we know better.
---
Wrath of the Lich King- I want to say the best single story throughout an expansion, but the Lich King kinda felt like a comic book villain at times due to how often he just showed up to taunt us. That being said, all those concerns were completely invalidated by Icecrown. So i'll say this expansion was the most chilling, and lore-weighted.
---
Cataclysm- Oh man I was upset by the change in the world, and the story between the zones (exception being Mount Hyjal) was laughable, but I do have to say I think the Classic world actually benefited from this. Imagine if we never got the world revamp, where would the Nostalgia for Classic really be? Would we ever even get this? I know its a funny silver lining, but its worth mentioning. Also those launch heroics were the bee's knees
---
Mists of Pandaria-  I burned myself out on the dailies at the start, really really hard, and I regret it. I ended up leaving before 5.1, came back after SoO launched. The Thunder Isle content looked fantastic even though I missed the buildup and progression of it. People complain about the pandas and the kung fu and the destruction of all our lore, but I think MoP built upon our current lore so well and so heavily that it is my favorite expansion in terms of the lore, not quite the story, but the additions to the overarching explanations to the entire universe. I don't think my post will survive the downvotes sadly.
---
Warlords of Draenor- Oh boy i'm ready to soak those downvotes like no tomorrow. Of course I hated the expansion, there was nothing to DO. That being said, its my most fondly remembered expansion, due to the friends I made during it. The lack of a rush to do anything at all made a lot of us actually stop to smell the roses, the zones were beautiful, the music was glorious, but I still cannot justify the story entirely. And gosh dang I miss Hellfire Citadel archi-trinket Frost Mage so dang much.
---
Legion- Funny enough, I almost quit after 7.1, although Return to Karazhan was amazing, and all the class quests were so cool, I could not forgive the Legendary System. I'll never forgive the legendaries. But if we look past the Legendaries, and the bomb-wreck that was 7.2, it was an amazing expansion. We had so many unique class questlines, and the class fantasy was the strongest it has ever, and probably will ever, be. I got all 36 Mage Tower appearances, and that right there was amazing. I thoroughly enjoyed learning all 36 specs in the game (cough cough except shadow priest) to do a challenge like that, and they better do something similar again.
---
Battle For Azeroth- Well, its too early to judge it in the same perspective we're judging every other expansion, the ONLY reason I am still playing is because I have hopes for 8.2. But i'll admit, they are not very high hopes. The story is better than most people think... but its still terrible, if you season some dog poop its still just dog poop. I understand Sylvanas' motivations, and I understand the war, but what I cannot understand is why the Horde stand by it, why my Nightborne main just does whatever Sylvanas says despite having JUST been in a massive rebellion against a tyrannical leader (The Suramar storyline in Legion). When Classic comes out, i'll be playing that, but i'll still keep up with the story in BFA so I can give it the proper judgement it "deserves" at the end. The reason WHY the expansion is bad is that so little of the content is actually enjoyable. Islands are a chore, Warfronts are cool in my opinion but you only do them once a blue moon. Leveling is a slog, not an enjoyable length of time, but just a slog. Imagine 1-60 with an immersive world, then imagine 1-120 without the immersion, ignore the actual length of time. At least the current raid (Battle of Dazar'alor) is one of the best raids they've ever made (IN MY PERSONAL OPINION).
---
My favorite? I'd say Legion, but only after 7.3, Argus was really cool.
---
Looking through Joana's guide, he doesn't turn in any one he gets to Stranglethorn Vale. So either there is none, or they're not worth picking up. 
---
I loved to just kill the demons in southern winterspring. As a shaman it was fun to interrupt, grounding totem, and kite the caster demons.
---
Eye of shadow dropping is cool too c:
---
Other favorite is the timbermaw dudes in felwood. Maybe its because I usually go enchanting and thus get the recipe but its fun to just pull a pack of mobs and kill them while chilling.
