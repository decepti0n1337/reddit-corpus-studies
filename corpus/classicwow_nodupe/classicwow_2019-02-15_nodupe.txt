This was a long time ago and I'm not proud of this but..
---

---
On my Rogue, I would do the following to people of the other faction when out in the world or in bg's just to piss them off:
---
/Sap
---
/Cackle
---
/Spit
---
I'd repeat this process a few times. I was a vindictive little prick back then lol.
---
---
---
Just taunt off the healer.  Let dps feel the pain 
---
Couldn‚Äôt agree more mate. I had a similar experience fishing deviates in WC. Me and a few others would regularly chill in there and fish. Even though, of course we were all competing sellers of the same thing, deviates, we never felt against one another and stayed friends throughout vanilla. I stopped playing half way through BC and am very much looking forward to playing Classic, making new memories and some fishing mates along the way. üëç

You have Gloves of the Fang listed as BiS for a 19 rogue twink, but the BiS is Scouting Gloves of the Monkey. 
---
Also, you're saying +15 agility Enchant on your RANGED weapon is BiS? lol have you even played the game?
---
Isn't this something that was already in vanilla Wow? Not sure why it wouldn't be in classic.
---
My internet had issues and my name got out in 3 times. Judic in Bloodscalp US
---
yeah I remember this change (i was sad haha) but I cant remember when exactly they did it since I played since beta and stopped somewhere in TBC. However I had lots of fun with it. And I absolulty understand why they changed it.

---
Thanks so much for giving it a try and I‚Äôm so happy to hear you enjoyed it, great to have you on board!
---
Which is why I said 3/3 is mandatory if you plan on doing PvE
---
&gt; best for solo PVP  
---
You have a lot of answers in this thread.  I'll answer a bit differently.  
---
1)- Avoid warrior.  Warriors generally require friends to be successful in pvp, as many classes have kits that are extremely good at escaping a warrior, or locking one down and killing it.  They also scale heavily with gear, meaning that much of your solo pvp joy will be locked up behind weapons and gear that you would have to raid heavily for.  
---
2)- Avoid Shaman.  Shaman is not at all bad at world pvp, or solo pvp, but you gain a lot of synergy when grouped.  You will also face some reasonably hard counters at times, and have no amazing escape.  
---
3)- Avoid Paladin.  While you can escape from anything with bubble hearth, your fights will last a long time, allowing a solo fight to turn into something way less in your favor- and even if someone from your faction joins in, well, you win, but it wasn't really solo.  As the saying goes, pallies without allies is just p.  
---
Every other class has something to offer the solo pvper.  Rogues and druids can select targets cleverly, and both can often escape or go places unexpected, an obviously huge thing in world pvp.  Mages have good control over positioning with a ton of snare and root and blink tricks, as well as offering amusing two-three shots depending on the relative gear of the two of you, as well as a decent number of specs you can pretty much hard counter.  Warlocks play a slightly longer game than mages, but have many methods of regenerating and crowd control that can prove hilarious, as well as not really being hard countered by much.  Shadow priests are amazing or good versus almost everything, but note that as alliance your lack of a reliable ability to stick a fear will hurt.  Hunters have a variety of world pvp stunts that they can do, and you will often find yourself getting the jump on people.
---
It's really not that hard. Once you get some practise in while leveling it's not rocket science.
---
THE PATROLS!!!! 
---
It's not a flight simulator or chess. It's all pretty simple actually. As long as you're fully conscious, not screwing around, and not a complete idiot (which most people aren't) you'll be just fine.  
---
Just make sure you get plenty of practice. Tank dungeons as much as possible (not hard to find a group who needs a tank at all), as you level up and when you hit level cap. 
---
It was Sunken temple for me (I didn't dungeons often during vanilla). I was healing as a feral druid, and would start every pull by shifting into bear form for a bit. My group seemed to approve of this tactic.
---
No one knew the order to click on statues so we had to head down to the bottom floor to go play Simon says.
---
Though I don't recall wiping, it took multiple hours to reach Jammal'an and our group disbanded before we could kill Eranikus or the summoned boss.
---
I have already posted, thank you, maybe post it on the wow forums and /r/wow also.  Get it to the masses and get it working correctly with a lot of people. 
---
Not answering your question, but a lot of the "theorycrafters" talking about how good battle shout conveniently forget to mention that you are rarely going to get full threat from BS in either cases because the whole party won't be in range of the buff.
---
Group leveling is fun, but matching schedules with someone is the real challenge.. We're talking about approximately 240+ hours of playtime.  Are you sure you're going to be that synced up with your friend for 240 hours?  If not I generally recommend leveling separate but trying to play together when possible.  If you get too far ahead, it feels great to have some sweet items you can help carry your friend through an instance.. or you have extra gold and can help them buy their mount.  I personally can't stand having to wait for another person to log on to play, so 'group leveling' all the way would just never work.
---
&gt;take some responsibility for your actions 
---
This is the dickish part. Not what you first said. That is a factual statement. But this part is condescending and dickish. 
---
It‚Äôs not your place to admonish or lecture someone without even the slightest clue of the context. Hence, you‚Äôre a dick.
---
That‚Äôs the hard part a lot of noobs or casuals screw up with.
---
You have to anticipate spawns and be cautious with your pulls in Classic. Even a single extra mob on you often means death.
---
If you blow forward in a mine especially, you can get spawns behind you or on top of you. Rookie mistakes like that often mean death in Classic, but those still are rookie mistakes. It just feels hard because other MMOs are a cakewalk
---
So weapon skill does mean quite a damn bit for melee. There's two spreadsheets floating around, basically +10 is the sweet spot for 100% glancing blow dmg (private svr) which is arguably more important in PVE.
---
I've been mulling the idea of a combat/sub build which will be used for a balance of pve and pvp.. it really does not seem like a popular build haha. 
---
Basically, early 60 will be combat down to sword spec and expertise and the rest into sub for hemo and prep. The alternative, once more AP is obtained late game and maladath OH, go combat down to BF and the rest into sub down to deadlines.
---
Basically im looking to maximise white dmg through weapon skill, serrated blades, hemo, dual wield spec, BF+prep.. 3rd party buffs  like sunder,CoR, gift of arthas, even sharpening stones as opposed to poisons which might get resisted. Curious to see +5 weapon dmg ench on slow MH for hemo, prob favors ass/sub build. My com/sub likely favours dual crusader to lift white hits through deadline.
---
To summarise, i really need that weapon skill to reduce the glace dmg reduction to 0. Excited to experiment come mid year!! :D :D
---
temporary mute in public chat channels but you can still talk in guild, party, and raid.. that doesn't impact gameplay at all.  Mute away!
---
Blizzard fired 10% of its workforce when Vanilla launched.
---
Man, it's been down hill since 2004!
---
if you see people purposefully trying to destroy the fabric of the game maybe you should report them instead?
---
And you don't need to spam chat for an hour to do the elite quests.
---
It's so close, you're probably better off spending time finding a hardcore guild and just pick whichever faction they're planning to play.
---
You should also demand that every job should be capable of owning a house and supporting a family of 4.
---
Yes, just wait for another "update" to Shamans  
---
&gt; : \
---
I've seen this thrown around but there are more niche crowds than vanilla. TBC, wrath, even later ones like cata and mop.
---
Thus my response why not both. They'll likely stick with only one option, if either, and no matter what people will be mad. It's just reality. 
---
I always felt tbc was a perfect sequel to vanilla. Tbc gave specs rather than classes. Like you probably know, prot paladin and ret paladin is incredibly uncommon in the raiding and end game scene for wow but both were balanced in tbc to be actually quite useful. 
---
The leveling in tbc didnt change drastically, it felt very similar. Afaik there was no phasing. 
---
I just felt it was vanilla+
---
Wrath imo is when things started to change massively
---
You can't just requeue in BFA during a key, either.
---
Closest I've got to the feeling of playing a (good) MMO for the first time was Ark Survival Evolved. Not because Ark is a good game. It's not, it's a horrific game that has no business making money. But the concept of survival and building, knowing that danger is just right around the corner.  
---
I don't play survival games anymore because they're all shitty early access con-jobs. But when or even if there's ever a WoW of online survival games, I'll be in trouble.
---
With the number of layoffs, loot sharing is now going to make it in by your estimation? You say it "will" but maybe I'm just being pedantic. I fail to see the logic beyond, "hey this might be true" 
---
Ragefire chasm, I played a warrior so I was told I was the "tank". This being my first RPG I assumed that meant that my job was to deal a lot of damage, after all the turret on a tank can dish out some serious punishment. I don't remember precisely how the rest of the dungeon went, but I do remember that it wasn't until SM lib that my friend explained I was actually supposed to be the guy taking all the hits.
---
Tanks have cookie cutter rotations in retail?
---
And here I was following a priority system, guess I'm pretty stupid
---
From this Comment I think you might be closer to the people you describe than you think. Yoikes
---
Weird, can you explain how that term applies? I just learned it and this doesn't make sense to me 
---
So your guild allows peolme to act like complete tools and assholes? Cause in your example your in this person's guild.  Just cause someone is a guild member doesnt indemnify them of their poor actions...
---
*You'll right click then tab out to pornhub and you'll like it*
---
Thank you so much for this
---
Lmao, the final scene with the beavers
---
Yes I'm aware of that, still not everybody has 10 extra minutes per quest to wait for good pulls and.compete with others, like mines entrance mobs as you mentioned, so going in is an option, specially when you're in a group, hence the faster leveling.
---
I am surprised not to see you mention Orc Racial blood rage which gives an AP burst. It closes the gap somewhat between humans and orc
---
The one hand axe drop from onyxia is ridicalussly good for orc warr 
---
Can‚Äôt you just afk to fail and get a lower key?
---
Plus it gives you a huge incentive to want to gear up and make friends to play with
---
Yup.. we call that one "The repair bill"
---
&gt; The only homogenisation of classes has been about buffs. 
---
Losing auras and totems is a big part of class fantasy. 
---
5 silver per rez  
---
I did this when Lord of the Rings Online launched too.  
---
I was quite an enterprising Priest/Minstrel
---
Mace spec rogue. You can basically keep someone stunned so long they die before they can do anything. You have to be kind of a sadist to play one because they are so brutal it feels like cheating.
---
So what? Have you tried to go to gnomer as a horde? What about stockades?
---
Some tips to earn gold while leveling (assuming fresh entrance to game):
---
1. Skinning. The most consistent bonus gold earner which scales with leveling as the hides increase is vendor and AH price. You do not have to waste time running around the world finding nodes.
---
2. DPS. Killing fast means more xp. This means gear for pure dps using stat priorities. The more deeps you dish ... the less damage you take. Do not level as protection or healing. Any tank can do dungeons or open world content fine without full talent and gear commitment to one spec.
---
3. Efficiency and recovery. No downtime classes (ie. warlock, feral, etc) level faster for a reason. AOE classes dramatically become more efficient prioritizing the correct stats. Don't waste tons of time traveling for quests that are not chains and decrease xp/hour dramatically.
---
4. Focus on capping professions that only create late game profit ... in late game. Don't level profs that slow your xp gain by too much. Plan their leveling but do them once you can convert your effort to profit soon after.
---
5. Only train the skills you need. If you do not need to respec at 60, go ahead and still ignore those skills until later.
---
6. Prioritize getting larger bags. LOOT ALL!!! Grey Beast loot stacks and sells for impressive gold. Vendor everything, sell anything on AH that pays more than vendor if worth your time to post it. 
---
Meh, enough for now. As for you group build (ignoring the OBVIOUS raid specs most will be forced to play in raiding only):
---
- Rogue: spec likely won't make much difference if grouped but obviously Combat is more solo friendly for that player.
---
- Warlock: SM/ruin is fine as it is heavy enough in affliction to make leveling easier but the ruin points would be better put into Demonology if purely thinking about pve grinding outside of raiding.
---
- Warrior: Prot will slow your earnings in every area of the game unless a 100% dedicated dungeon and raid player. Even 100% prot isn't required for every dungeon in game unless their gear is so terribly bad that a paladin or druid would tank better anyway.
---
- Druid: If you don't level as feral, your will slow your gold gains outside of dungeons and raids by a huge amount. Technically, while leveling and through most of your pre-BIS grind, a dedicated feral will tank better than the warrior and the warrior should just play dps instead. Completely reverses once you hit raiding and the druid 'could' stay feral if another dedicated healer joins your core group, 'could' go hybrid and heal well enough to get by yet can still solo and maximize open world grinding more or just go healing once your buddies gear up to make up for the lack of feral dps (feral dps from lvl 20 through beginning pre-BIS is actually superior to most other classes).
---
Just some things I experienced.
---
From what I can remember from classic days; very very few people managed the trek to gnomeregan because it wasn't worth it and there was no real reason to. Same with stockades considering it was in an enemy city i doubt anyone bothered to try.
---
Buddy 1: 
---
‚Ä¢ BRD pickpocket runs
---
‚Ä¢ 2-man Stealth DM tribute runs (with you)
---
Buddy 2:
---
‚Ä¢ Dire Maul: East farming 
---
‚Ä¢ Maraudon Farming (solo or with a friend)
---
Buddy 3:
---
‚Ä¢ Sell your tanking services runs for people working on pre-raid BiS
---
‚Ä¢ Run lower level dungeons like ZF for Twink items/BoE that sell for a lot on the AH
---
You:
---
‚Ä¢ You have the advantage of being to tag along for pretty much everything above
---
SM is awesome, great xp, loot and overall a fun instance. The run isn‚Äôt even bad. Just go from south shore through Dalaran/the lake and it‚Äôs maybe 10 minutes. Stay grouped so you don‚Äôt get messed with. My tank buddy and I would find a couple others to farm the instance for multiple runs at a time. 
---
People still ragequit like mad in legion. while I loved the challenge of M+ the most, the toxicity from some players so really saddening.
---
Run Live Stratholme as a quad and split the profits down the middle.  There are a lot of good items and recipes that sell for good gold there, and you should be able to manage without a 5th.
---
Goodpoint!
---
Probably one of the facts that is least heard of most of the time.
---
You can teleport to Gnomer from BB as horde
---
How do you ever get camped when you're dying next to an instance entrance. You die once then ress and zone in.
---
I spent waaay too much time in SM back in the day. I just didn‚Äôt want to leave. Getting every bit of mail gear on my Paly then shortly thereafter gaining plate mail ability sucked tho.
---
&gt; Outside of that tanking is mostly about knowing the pulls in a dungeon well enough to mark mobs for cc and kill order.
---
Don't forget that when playing a tank, especially in PUG dungeon groups, you are ALWAYS the default party leader, sometimes the babysitter.
---
All jokes aside, knowing where to go in the dungeon, knowing bosses' abilities or mobs' abilities are a necessity when playing tank. I know it feels like a hassle and perhaps an unwanted burden, but having all that knowledge will make you feel that much"in control" and you'll be able to tell people what to do/look for.
---
You mean 10,000,000√ó$15??? A month?
---
++
---
This is the TL:DR of tanking. Thank you.
---
The only good thing about classic Stockades is the amount of wool that drops.
---
Mage  
---
There was a certain spec that could literally one shot anyone like every three minutes. Rogue takes too much work if you "just want to kill people"
---
Those are meeting stones, not summoning stones.
---
Good to see plenty of Suramar people on there already.
---
If you remember a real annoying nelf warrior named Dresdain reach out and I'll carry you through classic
---
even team go right!! odd team go left!!!!
---
FUCKKKK
---
Thanks for the recommendations! 
---
&gt; HWs
---
Strange shorthand for chain heal. 
---
Tanking is fucking tough. Tried it on a private server, just dungeons were really hard to keep aggro.
---
Yep, that's basically it.  
---
If you'll play in average/bad guild, go alliance.
---
If you'll play in a good one, go horde.
---
Good idea!
---
I'm always full PTSD mode with those patrols, always looking over my shoulder.

---
I went on retail to see if my old guild was still around and it was but only 1 person was logging on and the list seems to suggest they all left during cata plus no one on this list I recognize, feels bad man.
---
I don't know who downvoted me, but you'll find out the truth sooner or later.  Hemo is a pvp spec with no role in pve, and that was the case throughout all of vanilla and a decent pace beyond.
---
If somebodies actions don‚Äôt make you want to take 2-3 mins to write a ticket then it‚Äôs not enough for them to even be close to getting a ban.
---
Its more sketchy in the 10s and 20s where lots of classes just don‚Äôt have their spells yet. By lvl40+ where people actually have their damage and defensive cool downs and abilities you can plough through most instances pretty quick if people know what they‚Äôre doing. I bet a half decent group could do a 45 min baron run within a few days of hitting 60.
---
Perfectly viable.
---
Just because it‚Äôs not maximum efficiency doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs not viable.
---
Thank you for the well written advice!
---
I will say that something I am disappointed with in WoW is that they dont reward you for exploring enough in random buildings or caves. The best possibility for searching one of these areas is a random chest with junk in it.
---
As annoying as they are it's going to be so fun to get ambushed mid pull
---
Summon stone. 
---
Um nah I don't think so. I watched a video recently of some gameplay in the Barrens and just can't see myself spending the time time to play the game anymore. It'd be nice to relive it all again but I think I'll leave it in the past for now. 
---
Real life click baiting about Blizz.
---
Well not really vanilla then but ok. I would blame that camping on the lazy bastards that find getting to the instance beneath them.
---
Don't need to fail. Simply activating the key gives you the lower key. It's completing it that changes it. Sounds weird, but that's how it works in the literal sense.
---
A vast amount of private servers 
---
The braizers in IF used to actually do damage and cause a sound effect. Pretty sure you used to be able to push idle bank alts/lowbies into them and kill them.
---
Honestly I only played vanilla and quit pre TBC so I could totally be wrong that was ever a thing 
---
I'm convinced it's August as Legion and BFA were released in August.
---
Yeah good point, its community building because it makes you realize.. hey. Maybe I can't do this alone...
---
Also it only works if they (party members) are already on the threat table, so if they haven‚Äôt cast anything or attacked yet it doesn‚Äôt do anything.
---
I can't recall this ever being possible.
---
&amp;#x200B;
---
Can anyone confirm?
---
Just ran it on a private server, no loot from any of the bosses... what a shit instance.
---
This guy rogues. 
---
The only thing I'm unsure about it pushing people into it. They definitely caused damage at one time and people at high levels used to stand in them just to trigger the sound effect and be annoying that way
---
The first time back is still just as magical, even if you played in 2006. Nostalrius was one continuous nerdgasm for me and for most Classic vets I've talked to.
---
The issue is doing it again and again: I've gone through 3 private servers and it does eventually lose its magic. Private server vets really have vanilla down to a science. It's still fun, but it's not the same. 
---
The first time back is awesome tho, no worries. My advice to everyone is just avoid private servers until Blizzard releases it. Really. Don't fuck up what should be incredibly special.
---
I had a friend that kept telling me about some game called World of Warcraft and I kept telling him that it looked terrible and I'd never play it, then I saw a youtube video by I think a gnome warrior named Dugi and after that I thought it looked interesting. Started playing on Bladefist-US the day after it opened and I really enjoyed it, I had never played an mmo before so everything was very new to me. Sadly I started playing at the very tail end of Vanilla so I feel like I missed out on alot of experiences.
---
Couple of months into BC and I got my best friend to start playing with me and we made a few really good new friends and raided with a small guild. Things were good until late WotLK and then friendships ended and things changed in Cata. After that I was mainly a solo or duo player with my rl best friend. I still play off and on, usually get expansion, play for a while and then quit for months and eventually come back.
---
I think what made me fall in love was the openness of the game, being able to go wherever I wanted in such a huge new world. I've always been pretty antisocial so being able to make a few new good friends was also nice.
---
One thing that kind of killed the game for me was losing my server, having other servers merged and all the phasing going on. I liked having allies and enemies that I knew by name, hating certain players and being hated was fun to me, felt much more like a community. 
---
IF I play classic then I hope to do the things I missed out on by starting WoW so late, like experiencing the old raids and alot more world pvp.
---
I'm a terrible writer so hope this wasn't too hard to read.
---
Bloodrage + Battle Shout is a very nice opening when you have to range pull and/or LoS, because you'll usually be in range of your whole party, generating 50 initial threat on each mob + 50 over 10 seconds + 70 per player in range divided by the number of mobs. Overall a solid pull to make sure all mobs gather around you.
---
Also to answer /u/emdeemayy there is no true answer about whether or not re-applying BS on already buffed target should generate threat. It does on some servers, doesn't on some others. Nobody knows for sure how it worked back then. We'll see how Blizzard decides to make it work in Classic.
---
For sure, Lava did do damage. I just don't think it was possible to push your faction in to it. 
---
If you want to be a pve meter topper then you need to be a human to eliminate glancing blows. More of your damage comes from white hits than you realize. If you want to be better at pvp you should be a gnome or dwarf for the racial traits. Either way though, you cant raid or pvp optimally with hybrid specs or non-optimal specs. No serious guild will let you use hemo in a raid so then they will want to know why other rogues are doing 30% more damage than you. Then you'll have to explain your pvp spec and get scolded lol. 
---
Yea I don‚Äôt think you could go inside the instance you‚Äôd get a message saying ‚Äúplease return to nearest GY‚Äù or something. It fucking sucked 
---
Meh, to be fair, Gnomer and Stocks are not that big a deal to miss. SM, though, is amazing and has loads of content and loot. I think bringing up those as counterpoints isn't the best move.
---
like everyone else said vanilla is simple as hell. The only thing you need to adapt to is the pace, its not like current wow where you will be pressured to go go go, people expect the dungeons when they sign up to take a pretty long time and as long as you don't just sit around for 5+ minutes or cause a wipe every other pull people will stay and complete it. There are a few rules to follow to keep up a steady fast pace. 
---
LoS pull if you are scared mobs are too close to one another or more commonly a ranged mob.
---
CC dangerous mobs or if you fear too many will pull with the initial pull. A 1 second delay can save tons of mana or health scares. 
---
Watch healer mana and sometimes even DPS mana. A group with 2 OOM mages is going to kill painfully slow, its best to just tell your healer and them to get respectable mana and then go along your way. 
---
Ask questions. People talk in chat and dungeons and if you don't know something just be straight up with people. I returned to Vanilla WOW like 4 or 5 years ago and I didn't remember jack about tanking some fights. A simple question can prevent a 10 minute runback wipes. 
---
Thats really all there is to it. Some other side tips.
---
Take responsibility if you F up, people will understand because it does happen.
---
If a DPS wants to speed run stuff by pulling for you or generally makes your job harder tell him to cut the shit or find a new tank. Next to nobody wants to find a new tank. Slow and steady is better than fast and sloppy. 
---
Conform to your group composition and dungeon you are running. Some healers are better, you can push the limits that way. If you got a great AOE composition you can pull a little bit more. If the dungeon has easier monsters like Zul Farrak you can if you feel comfortable pull bigger groups. All in all once you get a few dungeons under your belt you'll know fairly quickly how much you can pull based on the mobs and your group. 
---
P.S if you plan on tanking as warrior rage generation after pulling and the number of people affected by your battle shout awards a bit of extra threat, very useful for AOE tanking or getting beginning aggro. 
---
I'm going skinning thanks 
---
3-6 months until micro transactions post launch
---
The single-sided, spiked shoulderpad is so iconic
---
those Private servers don't have right click report policies Blizzard has installed in Retail..
---
Remember if you're the guy who rage quits after one wipe you will get that reputation and be less likely to get invited.
---
I get that and personally perfer that. Biggest hopes are automated but with tweaks from Retails current right-click report policies
---
You only need 4/5 spiritual focus if you take improved Conc aura in the prot tree- but generally I would say that wouldn't be "ideal play" for a few reasons. 
---
Heal aggro is split between all mobs present, so if you lose one mob out of four and it is wailing on a DPS, then all the heals you do will help you maintain AOE threat to a degree but not by much.  Heal aggro is only half as much as damage (righteous fury does not modify it unfortunately) so even a holy light around level 60 would give you perhaps 500 aggro if it heals 2k over a 3 second cast.  You'd be better off judging righteousness which would give you over 1000 aggro instant cast. 
---
I agree if someone is pulling aggro a bit give them Salv immediately and don't let them ask for anything else =P  You're the tank, you're in control!
---
Many trash mobs may still have an interrupt mechanic so you might end up getting silenced which is a BIG deal to get locked out of the holy tree as pretty much all your meaningful tank abilities are holy spells. 
---
Generally instead of "taunt" you want to do as much threat as possible (judgement of righteousness, seal of righteousness).  Heals might make sense, but your group healer will also probably be healing the one who pulled so you might end up overhealing which produces zero threat. 
---
4/5 Spiritual focus and improved conc aura are great in PVP though!   25% interrupt resistance if I remember correctly and 100% immunte to pushback from damage.  25/26/0 holy/reckoning is a great pvp healing build and reck bombs are a force to be *ahem* reckoned with
---
Hi, /u/imaginebetter1997
---
Don't be a fucking pussy and just do it you'll learn .
---
watchinga friend run Beta Stratholme Dead side when the towers would attack playres. Shit was intense. Actually felt like i was going to play Warcraft 3. It never went live of course but will always remember that instance and how hard it was for a 5 people at that time.
---
5% seems high, I think it‚Äôs more around the 1% increase range. 
---
Is feral tanking a viable thing in Vanilla ?

yeah, but Horde also had Shadowfang Keep and Wailing Caverns. Vanilla had a lot of those sillyisms about content for both factions.

I like how people like Kottick think they are some type of rare shrewd financial genius because they are so able to focus purely on the bottom line.  Its not a rare gift to care about making money.  Kottick just has a short sited approach to doing it that will cost him his entire company in a couple years.

Druid tank since vanilla and multiple years of Pserver experience here. 
---
Druid has better TPS than warrior, they can hold AOE threat better than warrior, they are IMO way better OTs than a fury slapping a shield on (much better they stay fury and deal big DPS anyways), they are great leveling tanks and they are versatile. They can innervate/rebirth in a pinch if a taunt is coordinated, they can DPS/Heal if you got another set (which you should), they can flip to mediocre DPS mid fight if your job is done. +5% crit buff to melee is a decent boon. Overall they are the definition of jack of all trades master of none. I'll try and give a rundown of the sections about druid I remember off the top of my head.
---
Early 60 - Roughest part in my experience. A fresh 60 druid tank with no bonus armor gear and a tiny HP pool is fresh meat for the grinder - especially if the healer is equally geared. Once you get your armor trinkets and a few other half decent items you will feel better.
---
Dungeons - Once you get around 8-10k armor is when dungeons are yours to own. You can pull multiple mobs, you got a sizeable health cushion and your high armor helps with most dungeons. I always hated scholomance though, that place always just ripped me a new one with the spell damage. Try to aim for pre raid bis before stepping into raid, you're going to be hanging onto most of the pieces for a while.
---
UBRS - You can tank it fairly easily. Plus you can sleep some monsters when you pull. I'd recommend doing this once you got around 9k armor.
---
MC - Most of your gear is going to stay the same from your pre raid bis list. MC is rather easy so you can tank it, but i'd recommend being an OT simply because warriors are the better MT. They got better CDs, they got shield blocking power, they can use potions, and if you are progressing they are less subjective to spiky damage, healers don't like that. Your few upgrades in here will simply be given to the MT warrior first. Medallion of Steadfast might, warrior prio. Heavy dark iron ring? Warrior will probably need it even if it is a BIS item for you until AQ. Fireguard shoulders will probably be given to FR ragnaros tank and then you (unless you got AB exalted shoulders). Ragnaros cape will probably be taken by the MT.
---
BWL is where start to get real upgrades but it is also where you are most weak in my opinion. You are a great tank for Broodlord but you can't tank Nefarian, at all. This is where you get a great deal of DPS cat gear as well. 
---
ZG is fun and unfun to tank as. Jin'do is made obsolete because you are immune to his charm thing I believe so you make the hardest fight here the easiest. However you cannot tank hakkar which is a shame. He puts you out of bear form and 1 shots you, so sadly if you do tank you need to have a 3rd tank ready. Really I just avoid this raid because it drops mediocre loot, some replaced by your pre raid bis.
---
World Dragons, holy moses if you can get a guild to actually farm them AND feed you them? you are in business but its a sad truth you probably won't get the items. Which is a shame because the dragons have insane loot for you. Near BiS helmet, some great bracers I believe, nice pants if you are too lazy to WSG farm. The helmet/bracers/hands are probably the hardest slots to get filled so if you loot one of those you lookin' fine. 
---
AQ is where I believe tank druids to shine the most. They got high HP from some of their best gear, they got high armor that warrior can't reach yet (yet) and so much of their BIS gear drops in here. Revel in it. 
---
Naxx you can tank patchwerk well. Everything else is best for a warrior. You get good gear here but yeah, a warrior will start to get his insane gear and catch up you in armor/health and retain his better CDs, potions, and blocking ability.  
---
Yup. But I‚Äôm not on the US servers. 
---
One thing that i havent really seen mentioned is tempo, or rhythm.
---
As a tank, you should be setting the tempo of the run. As you get a better feel of what the group is capable of, you can push them harder - pulling with people on lower health and mana. This helps retain some rage from the last encounter, and can delay the dps/healer generating aggro. Dont want people to attack until you have 2 sunders? Pull when they are still drinking and are up to 80% mana or so!
---
When a mob dies, you dont need to have a massive threat gap over everyone - if you have solid threat, stop using specials and bank that rage - particularly if the mobs flee. If they flee and come back as you still have aggro, circle around the melee so the mob runs back through the melee to get to you. 
---
Now the most important and basic thing to do a tank is to face mobs away from the group. Run uo to them, through them, and turn around. This makes you the closest person to any pats, gives you complete visibility over the rest of the grouo for anything loose, and presents the mobs back to melee which gives them less downtime/decreases their time engeage.
---
I agree, that's why I primarily just run keys with guildies. Same thing I did during Vanilla. Everything is just so much better when you have a guild group
---
So you do hate *some* people?
---
I used to always guard the Lumber Mill on the hill as a stealthed Druid. I think in Wrath was when druids got Typhoon. The knockback spell. The flag was right next to the cliff....

I think because of the recent Activision flex over Blizzard, Classic may not happen after all.

The only way you wont be good enough is if you don't try.

SM was a coming-of-age set of dungeons. By the time you hit the 30-40 range, you've gotten most of your core spells, your armor class is probably about to change, and most competent players would be able to get their mount around levels 40-42. It was also great for grinding for gold because the vast majority of mobs were humanoids who dropped silver every time, not to mention the badass armor and weapons that dropped in those dungeons. It's such a memorable set of dungeons because it felt like the turning point for everyone in terms of gameplay and the way you thought about your character. It was the threshold between mid-game and late game where you began to realize you were much closer to becoming one of those legendary raiders you saw riding around in Org/IF.
---
SM and the experiences around it are unforgettable to me.
---
That‚Äôd be wrath not TBC.  It wasn‚Äôt useable in a Defensive stance until then. 
---
So from what I'm hearing your saying that the Warlock Ritual of Doom is like a 5 person Russian Roulette? If so then that's hilarious. 
---
You will absolutely get invited to guilds as a Gnome Rogue. If a guild turns you down for not playing a Human Rogue they better be competing for world firsts and world record clear times. If they're actually that serious about min/maxing they better come up with the results too. Otherwise I'd suspect them of being total assclowns.
---
To be honest, if you're PvPing you should pick a PvP race. Gnome also happens to be insanely good for Rogues.
---
You will get a lot of practice, you probably already have some edge due to experience from previous games. One big factor in why Vanilla was considered so difficult was the lack of experience the players generally had, we all kind of sucked. Virtually everybody in Classic will be a seasoned player to some extent, the average player is going to be playing a lot better than in Vanilla, making everybody else's experience easier too.
---
Warriors have it rough while leveling, being the most inefficient class in the game for leveling speed. Death tolls and damage intake will be high, repair bills and constant need to buy food will eat up a lot of your gold. It won't be any easier at level 60 as you switch to protection spec to fully commit to tanking. Maintaining a steady gold income and keeping up with all your tanking expenses will be difficult when you kill everything slow as molasses.
---
The plus side is the grouping opportunities. The tank is always the hardest spot to fill in 5 mans. People will be much more willing to join your group if they know the tanking is covered. Many of us have been in those nightmare situations where you have 4 people ready to go and then spend an hour trying in vain to find a tank before everybody just calls it.
---
I'm really curious about that enhancement shaman part.
---
Drom the stert, it's the caller basically saying he had a sort of spelldamage hybrid approach to enhance.
---
I'm perhaps too narrow minded here, but I couldn't help but think that just wearing really good physical dps gear and auto swinging with the odd stormstrike is always going to be better from a dps numbers perspective.
---
It makes me remember a spell power stacking ret paladin in just fantastic gear, who did fuck all for damage.
---
With everyone having dps meters, and warcraft logs classic (in some form), will these builds have a harder time justifying their existence with common knowledge of their failings? Or will the high raid dps resulting from (most) knowing their shit better than OG vanilla give enough leeway to allow more weird or hybrid builds to raid than before? 
---
Will we have more people going "just heal/reroll warrior" or "our raid damage is overturned for mc anyways, do your thing." 
---
Eaiest to assume the former, but I think the latter will still exist in large share. 
---
Yeah! It is pretty funny. They have some videos on YouTube if you are interested.
---
&gt;Though the medical term can be a slur too, which is why I don‚Äôt use it either ... You‚Äôre actually claiming I‚Äôm using that word. I‚Äôm not.
---
So why did you make a thread here called "Relaxing Warrior Leveling Builds without the Autismo" a few weeks ago?  As I said in another post, I don't really have a problem with it being used that way, as I've done it myself, but I don't see why someone with your mindset (as far as I understand it) is okay with that but not with other insults based on disabilities/mental illnesses.
---
Who was I attacking in that thread? 
---
Oh, right! The abstract concept of a talent build!
---
Nice try going through my old posts tho! I hope you actually learned something useful (not likely though.)
---
There's  an interesting conversation to be had here, but when you launch into a tirade such as:
---
&gt;Because it turns out the only people generally affected by this kind of reporting are the fragile, white gamerbros (the true snowflakes, let's be real) who conveniently only bitch and moan about protecting their *#Gamerwords,* such as the n-word or the f-slur.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;There is no need to protect these hypocrites disingenuously hiding behind a veil of ‚Äúmuh free speech.‚Äù
---
You're just as guilty of lowering the level of discourse as the opposing argument you criticize.
---
Yeah, no I‚Äôm not. Please don‚Äôt do the disgusting thing where you equate using the n-word or the f-slur with calling gamerbros *fragile little snowflakes* because that‚Äôs such a myopic and smoothbrained take. 
---
My best SM memory was actually outside it on my 49 Twink Enh Shammy. I spotted a level 42 riding up the slope to the entrance and ganked them, then I noticed two 60s just watching our battle unfold. A mage and a hunter. I don't think they had been 60 for very long, nor were they well versed in PvP it seemed, as I decided in for a penny in for a pound and started attacking the mage. I managed to get a very luck Windfury crit and took him down almost instantly, then not soon after that had the hunter killed as well, and so I was there was 2 60s and a 42 laying dead at the feet of my big smelly Tauren, and I promptly mounted up and run away before they called the big dogs in, chalking that as one of my best feats in world PvP.
---
Which is what made it great imo.  Ally had others as well like gnomer, stocks, and arguably ulda. 
---
I did not know that heal aggro is split or that overheals do nothing. You've been very informative. 
---
&gt;Who was I attacking in that thread?
---
That's not your criteria though, is it?  Can I say that someone who is indecisive is "acting like a transgender person"?  Wouldn't that offend trangender people?  
---
&gt;Oh, right! The abstract concept of a talent build!
---
This is literally what people who say "gay" as a descriptor for something gay use as their defense.  "Oh dude I wasn't referencing their sexuality I was just saying they're lame".
---
Well this got political.
---
It is quite autistic behavior to obsessively track minutae. 
---
Are you arguing that this isn‚Äôt true? Or that pointing out this fact is insulting?
---
So when you have a talent build that revolves around tracking Crits and using /sit macros obsessively, then yeah, that 100% qualifies as autistic behavior. *Medically*. 
---
I wanted a build that was the opposite of that (and the sub delivered! An Arms Bleed-build!)
---
But tell me again how you‚Äôve ‚Äúgot me‚Äù?
---
Why would they change that ? It‚Äôs exactly what ACTIVISIONbli want, Low cost, high income. They won‚Äôt cancel an easy way get more millions of $$$.
---
It was more about creating a strawman yourself, but if you want to jam everything into this snowflakes versus gamerbros worldview go ahead.
---
Sounds like you‚Äôre pretty triggered yourself, mate. Seems like I really hit a nerve!
---
What class is best for 1 shot ting in pvp
---
You can definitely learn to be a good tank mechanically while leveling and farming dungeons in the early end game. The bigger long term issue is that as one of the tanks in a raiding guild a lot of asked of you. You absolutely need to be one of your guild's more active players. People will help you out, but you need to be there for the guild too. You must come with a lot of consumables every week, you need to farm a range of different sets of gear for different situations and you need to be one of the leaders in your guild. If you are not somebody who's prepared to devote a lot of time to classic in the long term then you should probably consider a role other than tank.
---
It's really annoying when one person has all their centaur ears and the other person has like two. But in all honesty I think the pros of playing with a friend vastly outweigh the cons.
---
Yea I always saw the razor fen instances, wailing caverns, rfc and sfk as horde instances. Deadmines, stockades and gnomeregen as alliance. 
---
Running one of those as the opposing faction is a headache at the levels required to clear them.  Unless you had a really dedicated group that knew what they were doing I passed on them. SM was way too good to pass up for alliance, even if it was in horde territory. 
---
&gt;Or that pointing out this fact is insulting?
---
I am pointing out that some people who share your mindset about speech policing find it very offensive.  
---
I have no problem with the term being used that way, I do it myself from time to time.  What I have a problem with is someone who wants to censor people and doesn't seem to have a criteria for which mental disorders/illnesses are fair game to reference in offhand comments.  
---
It's not a good idea to open with 5 sunders. Shield slam gives more tps and more tpr. Revenge gives more tpr, etc.
---
Sunder is the baseline threat generation ability. Generally you cast it only when you have nothing better to cast. It shouldn't be your go-to, especially at the start when you need to establish aggro.
---
Bloodrage slam sunder sunder sunder shield slam is the "standard" opening assuming you have a dps warrior for thunderclap.
---
&gt; I am pointing out that some people who share your mindset about speech policing find it very offensive.
---
Then please report my post, and if enough people agree, then I would have had to reword my comments in a less offensive way!
---
I agree with you! This is a much better system than your ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù majority-biased bullshit opinion. 
---
I did Razorfen Downs a few times because the quest reward was great and it was on the way to Tanaris / 1K needles. Wasn't difficult getting there. Now RFK on the other hand.... Pointless as alliance.
---
If you're looking for it to fill a void, it won't. The only time something can really impress you is if you're not expecting it to. I made this mistake when Red Dead 2 came out in fall of 2018, I was extremely hyped only to be let down. On the other hand, I played Horizon Zero Dawn too, wasn't expecting much from it and it blew me away. Best thing you can do is find some people you like playing with and try to get the most out of all the content
---
That honestly might be the only time I use a quest helper in classic.  I think I might try to do every one of the instances again because honestly I don‚Äôt think I experienced them in the old wow until the lfd tool came about.  I never rolled a night elf so bfd was pointless to me.  I never really knew if there were any quests for any of the boar instances in the barrens.  I think I might do that just to see them again. 
---
My guild was doing deadmines and summoned me from Darkshore (Nelf with no flight path to IF yet). Later I had to do the reverse run back through wetlands. Good times.
---
It depends mostly on the skill of your group how fast you can pull. In my vanilla 3man group we pull constantly, my friends playing tank warrior and offtank druid while I heal with priest, they juggle the aggro depending on the situation.
---
I just had a guy complaining about our "retail style" pulling because we were so aggressive and fast, even though the group was never really in danger of wiping. Problem is that random/average players don't have the concentration during bigger/faster pulls to still use their kit accordingly, focus fire etc. You need good movement (kiting) to avoid damage while maximizing your own. Also healing is generally misunderstood by people who didn't raid when mana management and cancel casting still was a thing.
---
You can generally pull much faster and bigger in vanilla than people tend to w/o risk. I have no idea how retail feels like since 12years but in vanilla you pull fast/big with a good group, because you want to get more out of your time spent.
---
You can't afk skilling with actual 1.12, you can afk trade like mages do on pservers, can't do any skills. But i believe you can afk ah trading. 
---
&gt; So are you arguing that this isn‚Äôt true?
---
It isn't true, that's like saying it's ADHD behavior to lose motivation. Yes, it's one of the things you look for, but standing alone it's not enough to diagnose from.
---
If this is in guild chat, the guildies would usually rather support their guildie than not.
---
After his comments to the interviewer, his grin makes me think he enjoys fracking people over.
---
Well that‚Äôs one of the things I was looking for to diagnose a talent build I didn‚Äôt want!
---
Ahaha! you and your friend‚Äôs reaching is epic. Ya‚Äôll could star in a remake of Stretch Armstrong!
---
You can‚Äôt afford a missed, parried, dodges Shield slam on pulling especially on 63+ mobs. Pre Tier3 your hit rating is trash, making it pretty common to miss those. Missing your Shield Slam would set you back so hard on the aggro table vs the rest of the dps with no rage to follow up with. Opening with a missed shield slam on taunt-immune mobs is dead dps or a wipe. 
---
Sunder is not your baseline threat generation ability. It actually empowers the rest of yours making it mandatory for yourself and the rest of physical dps. 
---
In three ability casts and considering the amount of rage consumed, you‚Äôll generate so much more threat going sunders first followed by slam. If you are really worried and you have the rage for it, slam on the third sunder. 
---
When multi-mob tanking, shield slamming first means your group is already dead. Gathering that amount of rage takes quite some time, time that you can‚Äôt afford to waste on the beginning of a pull. You could argue for Blood Rage, but  you aren‚Äôt going to have Blood Rage on every pull.
---
Briarthorn is such a tease
---
Read the tanking and dungeon guides out there. Early on you can tank fine in the early levels with a pure leveling build but somewhere in  the mid 30s consider a hybrid build taking core prot talents . This will slow down your leveling but if you are serious about tanking then learning your abilitiies and the role in the early dungeons will be less stressful than trying to play catch up once you near the level cap.  Plan on running every dungeon at least 3 times but aim for 5 runs or more and focus on getting the best tanking pieces. Tanks in vanilla are extremely gear dependent and getting the best pieces in your current dungeon will make getting upgrades in the next level dungeon easier.  Start grinding for gold and mats for enchants early on for your dungeon blues as well....its expensive and a time sink but you'll see excellent results in groups and its a good habit to form for level cap.   PUG a lot. Stay with those truly horrible groups and try to learn to compensate for horrible players and  horrible mistakes. Those bad groups aren't for dropping bosses and getting gear..they are for training and learning to tank well in bad situations. It might be rough and annoying but it will pay huge dividends when you are in a good group or guild run especially in end game instances/raiding.  You also want to network with healers and make friends with them. A tank/healer team can level great together and the tank and healer are the foundation of a group....DPS/CC classes are usually a dime a dozen and simple to find for a group.   L60 is the cap so there really is no great rush. Take your time and enjoy the experience. In vanilla there was almost always a tank and/or healer shortage.  If you really want to tank then other players will bend over backwards to help you do it especially if you display the desire to do it well(learning strats, enchanting gear, having and using pots, buff foods and first aid.). People will not let you suck as a tank unless you are adamant about being ignorant and not trying.
---
Whatup stormreaver-US!?
---
&gt;Then please report my post
---
not a NARC so you don't have to worry
---
&gt;This is a much better system than your ‚Äúanything goes‚Äù majority-biased bullshit system!
---
Maybe it is for you.  But if most players disagree, why should it change?  
---
Yeah, ideally a rogue-tank partner with a resto/balance hybrid.
---
Because not having moderation is supporting the status quo where racism and homophobia are allowed to run rampant creating a worse environment for everyone. 
---
Sfk on my old aimless UD warr. 
---
You're pretty good at doubling down and dodging questions, I'll give you that.
---
But, seriously how can you be so convinced that you're right when no one ever agrees with you on anything, to such an extreme that you believe that in order for two people to agree on something, they must be friends?
---
Lets try applying your logic, just for the hell of it, it should be okay to call someone the f-word when they suck dick at the game as that's homosexual behavior. I'm not looking figure out if they're actually homosexuals, just pointing out that their behavior is.
---
As a warlock in normal instances, I tell PUG healers *not* to heal me unless there's a mob stuck to me and my death is imminent. I can (mostly) manage my own HP and mana, and healing me is usually a trade of priest mana for warlock mana, which is a bad trade.
---
&gt;creating a worse environment for everyone.
---
You don't care about what's good for "everyone", you just criticized the status quo as being "majority-biased".  You just want to ban people until "everyone" is made up of people who agree with you.
---
&gt; Thunderclap does not belong anywhere in Vanilla warrior tanking, except if you are an off-tank. It does absolutely no threat. For the sake of comparing, casting Battle Shout gives you more threat than Thunderclap.
---
I personally never played Warrior myself but I've seen tons of good Warriors use Thunderclap while tanking multiple mobs. No Idea what you are onto. Checking the wiki it shows that it actually generates decent threat while also mitigating damage.
---
The friends comment was a joke. I see humor has completely died in this thread. I forget that it‚Äôs the first thing to die when gamerbros begin to #RISE UP. 
---
&gt; But, seriously how can you be so convinced that you're right when no one ever agrees with you on anything
---
Because unlike #gamerbros, I don‚Äôt hide in a mass of NPC popular ‚Äúunpopular‚Äù opinions. 
---
I don‚Äôt need popularity to know whether I‚Äôm right or wrong on the net-positive benefits of moderation in online communities. 
---
And even further: Knowing how predictable people are in the sub, I can oftentimes tell when I‚Äôm right because of how many neckbeard Classic #nochanges NPC nerds get mad at me. 
---
;)
---
Yes. People who agree that constantly spewing racism, homophobic content never adds anything good to an online community. 
---
If you aren‚Äôt part of that group of people then I don‚Äôt want you a part of any community I am a part of. Plain and simple. 
---
Sometimes, while on my feral druid, I would go looking for an enemy player that was questing.  I would then pounce on the player, run away, get back into stealth, rinse and repeat the whole process.  The player would eventually get fed up and try to fight back; sometimes I would engage and other times I would run away to do it all over again.  Sometimes I would do this until the player brought a few friends, managed to leave the zone/area, or logged off.
---
&gt; The friends comment was a joke.

And more insults, I told you, just keep'em coming, I couldn't give fewer shits, all they're going to do is show that I'm correct in that you don't give a shit about creating a non-toxic environment, you just want to control others... as was my very first comment in this thread.
---
You claim you want a game without toxicity and harassment, you've not managed to write a single comment without toxicity and you're supporting tools for harassment, so I'm honestly not sure how that can be true.
---
wasn't lil timmy's peashooter best ranged?

I love that you equate calling you a r/fragilewhiteredditor with calling black people n-words or the racism against mexicans in private server tradechat. 
---
Love love *love* it, ahaha! Such a hypocrite!
---
I agree only in as much as it tends to lead to entertaining stories.
---
My wife is definitely a ‚ÄúOoh! Shiny!‚Äù player. She would often run off in the middle of dangerous areas to farm herbs without telling anyone (usually me). 
---
I would casually say out loud, ‚Äúadd‚Äù. She wouldn‚Äôt reply, but I would assume she picked it up (as she normally did). And then I would be killed by 2+ mobs.
---
I‚Äôd look over at her after cursing and she would give me doe eyes and say, ‚ÄúI was just picking this flower. What happened?‚Äù
---
&gt;constantly spewing racism, homophobic content

So as long as people only drop the occasional n-bomb they're in the clear?  I can live with that.

Played on a low/medium pop realm in vanilla.... literally the only one here horde and alliance.  Feels bad man

I‚Äôll still right-click report you, but that only results in a suspension, remember?
---
I‚Äôm starting to think none of you even know how the system works.

You get one pickup, not 3.

The only way that isn't true is if you believe that being white is better than being black or mexican.

Lets try applying your logic, just for the hell of it, it should be okay to call someone the f-word when they suck dick as that's homosexual behavior. I'm not looking figure out if they're actually homosexuals, just pointing out that their behavior is.

Yes deadmines.  I was running it with other new players who wrote RL friends.  They kept accusing me of damaging the melee with flamestrike.
---
It is going to be Beta and not PTR , PTR happens when there is a live version of the game running parallely and they want to test somethings out over a short period of time before pushing it into the live version. Without a live version, PTR is basically beta .  
---
Considering that there is no "mystery content" , Blizzard has nothing to lose and everything to gain by doing a 2\~4 month long Open Beta . There are going to be a lot of changes and they would need to make sure the community does not go haywire with each and  every small aspect of it all.

Yeah, only entitled little trust fund brats with mommy and daddy paying their way.  In other words, losers.
---
Omni-shambles bad
---
Aoe tanking or multi-mob tanking isn‚Äôt done with thunderclap but by applying single target aggro abilities on each mob, one at a time: good‚Äôol tab sunder. You can also mix that with Cleave. 
---
Thunderclap is clunky by design with Battle Stance requirement. It does not generate decent threat. 
---
It does mitigate damage, agreed. Although, during your pull, when you happen to have it under control and you have enough rage to cast Thunderclap, it is usually too late. 
---
In a multi-mob pull, just the fact of switching to battle stance and losing your damage reduction from defensive stance will most of the time nullify the gains granted through TC‚Äôs debuff.
---
On the other hand, if there is another warrior in your group, he should definitely thunderclap.
---
The f-slur has a long history (centuries even!) of being used to put down homosexuals. 
---
If you‚Äôre using it in tradchat you should be reported, and if enough people agree and follow suit, you should be suspended. Easy as that. 
---
You can petition a review, but your use of the f-slur is pretty much against ToS so good luck with that. 
---
The Chronicles and other books are WHY I love the lore. Nowadays it's such a mess to most people, and nobody wants to hear me explain sylvanas for the 100th time when none of the game backs me up. But I love it all personally, keeps me invested in the story
---
1 out of 99 people will blow content this year
---
I played human, and since they didnt have emft in vanilla it basically sucked as spirit and sword spec isnt going to help a warlock. Gnome would be fine with an extra root break. Really warlocks need teammates in pvp anyway and the more teammates you have, the less racials matter.
---
It's annoying but there's a few things going for alliance warlock as well. No pallys so there's only 1 enemy class that can dispell SL/Corruption/Fear (technically shamans have tremor totem but it's pretty useless). You also have pallies on your side which means BoP/BoF/Cleanse for you which is really nice as a pvp warlock. You also get Salv which is really nice for raiding.

There's just no way around the fact though that Warlocks rely a lot on fear for CC and WotF is so good aginst fear and UD is always a very popular race on Horde. Warlocks become a lot stronger in good gear, enough so that you will be a big force in PvP even on alliance if you can get geared. So if you think most of your time playing will be levelling and lvl 60 pvping in blues/greens I wouldn't recommend lock, but if you know you'll be raiding and be getting ZG/AQ+ gear then go for it.
---
Pretty sure he means the number of herbs looted from the one pickup
---
Personally I think the realization that we collectively need to come to is that the Golden Age of game development that gave rise to games like WoW was unsustainable. Game studios being driven primarily by passion for the craft allocating development resources toward unproven audiences and routinely missing deadlines created some great pc games, but it also led to droves of collapsed studios when they took one misstep. Not everyone hits a home run on every release like Blizz did for so long.
---
 At some point the industry needed to grow up, make business decisions based on expected profit, adopt monetization models and release schedules with an eye toward financial stability even when it comes at some expense to the consumer.
---
There still are indie studios out there launching their labors of love - and these will be the artists moving the craft forward and deservedly receiving praise from critics and consumers. But I think it's totally natural for the largest, most mature companies in the space to run their businesses more like a business.
---
About 40% of the pvp focused horde will have a decently long cd ability to get out of one fear (and be immune for a couple seconds), another 40% will be orcs, and the last 20 tauren and trolls. It's not that bad really, and you can cover a lot of the downsides with engineering. 
---
WoW Classic will be using the retail client and so the file system used by it . Am not really familiar with the modding scene , but it would not be wrong to assume that the files are encrypted to keep more casual people away from messing with the files.   
---
Considering people have data mined WoW BfA  , even if Blizz uses new encryption on the file system, it  wont matter.  
---
Consider the game files as a lock, the key is usually hidden inside the client and people always find a way to get the key. Good luck
---
&gt; The f-slur has a long history (centuries even!) [...]
---
First off: what does that have to do with anything?
---
Secondly: Homosexuality has a long history (millennia even!) of being culturally accepted, and last i checked millenia were longer than centuries
---
Lastly: There's no such thing as the "f-slur", there's a n f-word and it can be used as a slur.
---
&gt; If you‚Äôre using it in tradchat you should be reported,
---
So on top of being toxic, you're actively arguing for harassing people, are you sure you really want what's healthy for the community?
---
&gt;I‚Äôll still right-click report you, but that only results in a suspension
---
A suspension that starts at 24 hours and doubles with every infraction, with no limit, right?  Yeah, no big deal...
---
Still a strong class 
---
You only have trouble with one race, in a 1v1
---
For the rest of group fights your fine
---
And for any other race 1v1 you‚Äôre fine
---
&gt; Secondly: Homosexuality has a long history (millennia even!) of being culturally accepted, and last i checked millenia were longer than centuries
---
LOL 
---
I can‚Äôt argue with such a brilliant mind! You win!
---
I highly recommend druid tanking. They are bar none the best Dungeon tanks in the game. Swipe is an ability that hits 3 targets, which is a lot better than warrior's 1 target. Druids also cause more threat and do a lot more damage, making your dungeon runs go faster. 
---
Druids are great off-tanks in Raids but are generally not picked to be Main Tanks because it's nearly impossible to get the required 5.75% critical strike avoidance that warriors can get much easier from Defense gear. But yeah all level 62 enemies (and below) are fair game to tank as druids, and sometimes do the job better than warriors due to high armor and health.
---
Challenging doesn‚Äôt being to describe it
---
The fucking TRASH in deadmines annihilates an under geared / under prepared team. And VC is a serious DPS race as he hits like a truck.
---
Fantastic, rewarding and awesome instance 
---
Nice! That‚Äôll do!
---
You haven't tried arguing at any point, all you've done is throwing insults at me.
---
Escape artist is amazing for warlock. It's THE best BG racial. Getting out of nova (and avoiding shatters) if your devour is down (or gets their Detect Magic/Winter's chill), hamstring, and Crip is super invaluable. 
---
Plus, you have paladins on your faction with BoP and freedom. Tongues sticks super easy against horde in BG's unless their Vurtnes are on point. 
---
Solid all around. Million times better than Perception, for sure. 
---
People like you have to be dishonest about what you really want, otherwise no one will agree to it.
---
See you in Classic, I guess.
---
Here is the list from that vanillafriends site someone on this reddit created --
---
https://i.imgur.com/qg1B4jN.png
---
If you fail to pick the herb you just try again. It's not like it disappears.
---
I see you trying so hard to make right-click reporting into a bad thing but this is the best you can come up with?
---
Phew, I hope you raid better than you argue cuz otherwise I *won‚Äôt* be seeing you in Classic, LOL. 
---
Honestly, before raids I wouldn't put a single point into prot.  I tanked a ton of content in vanilla and the extra aggro gen from arms or fury just made instance runs smoother and faster.  I compensated for some of the extra incoming damage by kiting mobs (really easy with the fury talent Piercing Howl) and by always having a pot or tuber ready to hit if I took a damage spike or had too many mobs on me.
---
I would kill you on sight for being a gnome.
---
&gt; white gamerbros
---
Reported for racism.

If you have those three, skill will come. True in every area of life, not just WoW.

Also mind control. Can be powerful in both WSG and AB and is something really no other class can do.

Don‚Äôt be the guy who want the most perfect race for the most perfect class, it doesn‚Äôt work like that at all.

Deathbringer, it‚Äôs top end and super slow speed of 2.9 is insane. It‚Äôs also got a nice proc

Self-policing of speech in communities (this includes moderation and *gasp!* censorship) improves the quality of those communities over time.

How? Because it turns out the only people generally affected by this kind of reporting are the fragile, white gamerbros (the true snowflakes, let's be real) who conveniently only bitch and moan about protecting their *#Gamerwords,* such as the n-word or the f-slur.

There is no need to protect these hypocrites disingenuously hiding behind a veil of ‚Äúmuh free speech.‚Äù

The level of willful delusion required to believe that right-click reporting is a net-negative on the community is insane. It's called [belief perseverance.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Belief_perseverance)
---
Did you just repost your comment from earlier? Why even bother when I already responded to it and you completely ignored everything I had to say.
---
Pretty sure it never made you undead. You're probably confusing a thing that existed very early on in vanilla beta where UD were permanently classed as UD not human, and had all associated immunities/vulnerabilities. I don't think it ever existed in retail WoW though.
---
Because it contained a reference to a toxic political commentator that many white gamerbros are fans of, but because he falls under the purview of *political content*, my entire comment was removed. 
---
Which is, by the way, another excellent example of how moderation of online communities can improve the quality of the conversation!
---
Mods should always be active enforcing this sub‚Äôs rules (not active enough, if you ask me.)
---
They're both really good depending who you're fighting. One of the biggest differences is in organised PvP you will often have someone there to dispel dots/fears/polys off you so in that context fear isn't much of a concern. Also in that context if you get 5pt KS or HoJ or Bashed you're probably quite dead/screwed regardless of your heals and in that situation orc really shines.
---
Scarlet Monastery is one of the Holy Five pre-raid instances:
---
Deadmines
---
Scarlet Monastery
---
Zul Farrak
---
Stratholme
---
Blackrock Depths
---
But why bother reposting it if you're not going to discuss replies to it anyway?
---
If anything, numbers indicate they fire people so they could keep paying Kotick and gang 38.3 million a year. Not devs. 
---
The cap on the number of devs in most tech giants is related to lack of people with sufficient technical proficiency, not lack of budget. It‚Äôs hard to recruit. It‚Äôs gonna be even harder it get dev superstars now that the company is on the news in such a negative context. 
---
Source: I work for a web giant you all know and use our products every day, probably even as you read this comment. 
---
Tanking in raids is different, if you wanna do fast runs you have to do max threat and clean pulls consistently so your dps can start nuking right away. Also no faceroll tanking abilities like retail so you have to do everything single target and manually. The difference between a good tank and average is huge and you will really notice as a DPS class.
---
Unless you're a healer in which case you will 
---
1) Beg for mage water
---
2) Cast Fort and go OOM and repeat step 1 until you have enough mage water
---
3) Cast Heal Rank 4 a billion times....and maybe greater heal once in a while and hope for a chance to dispel enemy players and the occasional fear or mind control
---
Yeah once you have two fears and big dick shadow ball ruin crits, lock pvp is pretty fun. 
---
Void sac. Soulstone shenanigans. Fun times.
---
My hunch on what flipped the switch to make Classic a reality is that there is/was a core of dedicated developers/managers pushing for it internally. Like in their free time or whatever people were fiddling around realized there were some workarounds that would make recreating Vanilla on the modern infrastructure easier than they first thought.
---
Say what you want about Activision and the new top brass at Blizz, but I think there still are alot of talented passionate devs there, and when a group of them shows up with a plan or even just a strong passion to make Classic a reality I think the highers ups caved.
---
Totally agree Activision's perspective made it easier to greenlight, but I think if there's an internal group to praise for making Classic happen its more likely to be a few holdout Old Guard Blizz employees in the mid levels of development.
---
I thought tanking was easier in classic.  Tanking in later expansions became so hectic and flashy I had no idea what the hell was going on anywhere. 
---
Sure, I blew you the fuck out [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqnk8a/how_many_people_actually_want_an_option_to_report/eghlxlb/?context=2), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqnk8a/how_many_people_actually_want_an_option_to_report/eghmu1u/?context=1), [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqnk8a/how_many_people_actually_want_an_option_to_report/egibggo/?context=1), pointed out a literally *insane* thing that you said [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqnk8a/how_many_people_actually_want_an_option_to_report/egic6vt/?context=1), made someone else admit a pretty fucked up ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqnk8a/how_many_people_actually_want_an_option_to_report/egib7k7/?context=1), and saw you trip over yourself over [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqnk8a/how_many_people_actually_want_an_option_to_report/eghn9bn/?context=2).
---
Honestly, maybe you're right. I don't need to really respond cuz ya'll do the work for me with your volcanic takes. 
---
Y I K E R S.
---
So how do people here feel about the possibility of classic allowing more than one type of tracking at a time? (mining and herbalism)
---
Chest loot wasn't too bad in classic. It had a decent chance of a BOE blue item.
---
Chests in retail are completely worthless. Oh, 15 war resources and 8g in vendor trash? That will go along well with my 15000 war resources and 12 million gold. 
---
If the tank dies it's the healer's fault. If the healer dies it's the tank's fault. If DPS dies it's their own fault.
---
This is true, but I think it can take on a slightly different flavor in a raid setting. Raid leaders will often take great care in organizing their 'warrior core'. Other roles can be a bit more plug and play, but having stability in a core set of tanks and off-tanks can be very important.
---
My advice is to be upfront when looking for guild that your dedicated to becoming one of their primary tanks, a lot of guilds will love to hear that while others might already have a group they've built trust with. Mechanics wise there isnt too much to learn (though likely more than most other classes), but building trust that youll be available consistently is just as if not more important to becoming a successful tank.
---
&gt; The "googogogo pull!!!" crowd will fail miserably in Classic. Because healer mana is scarce even when played well, fights are longer and AoE is minimal. Things are generally more methodical. So you taking a few seconds to mark a target, to do a good LoS pull, all that stuff is expected and very rewarded.
---
You can still do go go go pulls in Vanilla wow and I did so whenever I had a good healer or DPS that could CC stuff without direction on my LOS pulls.  Due to tab/sunder spam you do have to be more on the ball about marking targets.
---
Healing Wave ... and please don't make me explain the joke to you.
---
Just another thought a little different from what some others have posted. Be sure you're aware of defense. In vanilla not everyone was familiar with their class and plenty of tanks we interviewed for raiding came into the raid crushable. I always dismissed them without much thought. Defense capping should be your priority when you get to 60, then working up your stamina etc. There is so much more info this time around though I'm sure it will be easier for good tanks to find the resources they need. Its not that hard, and when in doubt tab and sunder. 
---
You don‚Äôt thunderclap/demo if you want threat per second. Those abilities are for surviving if the group pulled to much. Your best aoe threat ability is battle shout. Do it a couple of times at the start of the fight to put aggro the healers. Then apply sunders to the main and off targets with the occasional shield bash/revenge when rage permits.
---
Seen a couple guilds from Stormscale US that I faintly remembered from back in the day that is so cool lol. Gonna add my name soon I was Akiak a Tauren hunter! Was in the guild cohesion for awhile 
---
Nice website. Did you guys used plugins for the register, search thing or how did you managed to code that? I see you are using wordpress.
---
Also please remove from Steamwheedle Cartel EU, there is a duplicate. &lt;3
---
I did some experimenting with dual boxing in Vanilla wow.  It's slightly slower than group leveling which means that group leveling would be even slower since there's less sync in attacks with 2 people at the cotnrols.  The one exception might be a warrior/priest combo.  
---
BFA is alright, just not a whole lot of end game content.  Would still recommend over classic though, I don't think it could possibly live up to the nostalgia hype. 
---
Surprised they didn't NDA him as part of the package and ten use interns to 'weekend at bernies' his forum persona.
---
Picked up the chronicle vol3 Boxing Day. Great find. Recommend 
---
thanks bud, happy whackin. 
---
and somehow they keep on running. :)  (To be fair, some of those p-servers are unmitigated shit shows, that could really use some moderation, even if it was automated, but not all. ) 
---
Not only this, but in actual proper group pvp, an alliance warlock is a lot stronger due to less friendly dispells and no pre stacked fear wards on horde side. Not only that, alliance warlocked are more neccesary becasue alliance lacks hard burst in premade vs premade.
---
So basically, in proper premade versus premade pvp, the alliance warlock is actually the stronger / most impactful.
---
&gt; Sure, I blew you the fuck out here, here, and here.
---
You respond by insulting me, huge blowout for sure!
---
&gt; I pointed out a literally insane thing that you said here
---
Let me guess, you don't believe in climate change either? or you believe vaccines cause autism? (epiphany, that might explain why you're so obsessed with it)
---
&gt; made someone else admit a pretty fucked up ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù here
---
What compromise are you even talking about?
---
&gt; and saw you trip over yourself over here
---
Yea, I tripped over myself, totally, were you expecting a reasonable reply to nothing more than an insult?.
---
But let me try for the 10th time.
---
A: If you're trying to prevent harassment, why do you want to give people the tools to harass others?
---
B: If you don't like toxicity, why are you being super toxic all the time?
---
C: Do you not see the hypocrisy in calling for moderation of slurs while at the same time throwing them out left, right and center?
---
D: Do you not find it sad that you've never had a stranger agree with you *ever*?
---
E: Why is it preferable to interact with toxic people who aren't being toxic at certain to not interacting with them at all?
---
F: Are you actually just being toxic because you think that's a way of convincing me to support moderation?
---
For added flavor save the full kidney shot for when they're almost dead so they can't get away. 
---
Are devs and CM the same thing?
---
beautiful
---
The question is really HOW you want to kill people.
---
Go look up pvp videos. If you like the style the class kills people, pick that. All classes can do wonderful in world pvp if well equipped/prepared. 
---
You‚Äôre on a classic wow subreddit and you recommend BFA over classic and say people want classic purely for nostalgia purposes and it won‚Äôt be as good as people remember?
---
?? How are warlocks weak in lowlvl pvp? They literally run around with voidwalkers, hp stone + pot and healthstone if they know what they are doing(you basically never need to pop your hp pots you find, so you can save for ganks). 
---
Yeah haha, I realized after the fact.  Just saw it on new and decided to give my unintended inflammatory two cents. 
---
&gt; Do you not find it sad that you've never had a stranger agree with you ever?
---
Lol, so cute how you phrase this because of how raging mad you are.
---
Jokes on you though, people have agreed with me [even in this very thread!](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqnk8a/how_many_people_actually_want_an_option_to_report/eghmuo6/?context=2)
---
Ahahaha
---
You can charge, thunderclap, defensive stance. But the threat from TC in vanilla was pretty low. 
---
There wasn't floating healing text back then, only damage text.
---
Floating healing text was added in *I THINK* WotLK. It will most likely be available for classic.
---
You hit one in 6... that's an improvement, now we're just missing the rest.
---
Also, he's literally disagreeing with you.
---
This is going to be one of my favorite things running 5 mans. Doing the event in ZF is going to be hilarious.
---
Prepare to be slaughtered.
---
I have not played 8.1, I quit after a month. But 8.0, It was fun kinda at first. Definitely not what it used to be. But it's ok. You can get max lvl in 2 days. I did it over a weekend. Only reason I kind of enjoyed it was that I was playing with a friend.
---
Then priority seemed to be doing daily's. And there is this horrible questing storyline that you need rep to continue. Which makes you try and do more dailies expecting some big tits at the end. But all you get is a 'to be continued'sorta thing.
---
There are these instances you can que for sometimes. Called warfronts. It's like pvp without alliance. It's really just trash and I kinda felt depressed playing a couple.
---
Then there is the artifact neck piece you grind levels for, which is basically more daily's and its soft capped so you really cant go nowhere with it after a certain level.
---
The game is soulless by the end. I didnt even look at other players anymore, curious to see loot. I didnt even look at my own gear near the end. Its sorta just looking through ques for mythic dungeons where people get tilted as fuck. Or raiding with your shitty guild killing 2 easy mythic bosses. 
---
 I just log in and sit there in my chair for 2 or 3 minutes before exit. So I unsub cause it was honestly depressing or just felt like a waste of time.
---
This reminds me how nice hunter traps are when tagging a spawn lol
---
Point taken, it‚Äôs an exaggeration (possibly - it may actually be true, need to verify), but when it comes to Nax specifically, Blizzard themselves have stated that only a small percentage even reached it, let alone completed it.
---
Rank 14 Orc Warrior with Windfury weapon should still beat Human.
---
That might be a reason - it did find my character (I started in October 2006) and it found my friend‚Äôs character (he started in July 2006) but we were both on a US server... 
---
I have heard reports that it didn‚Äôt show some people for some reason, and is overall rather random, but for the most part people were successful in finding their toon.
---
Sorry it didn‚Äôt work for you üòï
---
My most fondest memories of WoW ever were with my vanilla guild. 
---
Fallross 60 Dwarf Paladin &lt;Awakening&gt; Lightninghoof
---
How come you go over to US server? Just curious
---
Nah, quit bfa quicker than reegun. Really boring 
---
I think you should hold back and wait for Classic.  
---
Go play a different game, in fact a different genre all together.  
---
That's just my opinion. I think you'll play BFA in an attempt to chase some high but realize it's methadone but what you really want is the heroine.  
---
If you liked the story of legion, play through BFA. It's a fine experience. @ $2 an hour, it's worth the box price to play for a month or so.
---
Putz around. Get some fun mounts. Do some of the secret puzzles. Dip your toe in. Don't no-life it, but get the muscle memory going and just enjoy it here and there.
---
Yes, ish.
---
Very good at dungeons and trash from high mitigation and threat.
---
Not great at MT because they lack block which provides a huge amount of the uncrit able which avoids damage spikes on bosses.
---
Something I'd have never known. Thanks. I don't know much about the PVP meta.  
---
The most I can get is from Ohhgee and he doesn't post often it seems.  
---
I find this absolutely insane.
---
BfA is such a hollow experience it just makes you want to play Classic more. Advice: Avoid the game till summer and enjoy other games.
---
Kudos to you for taking charge.  The siren song can be hard to tune out.
---
You aren't 2-manning DM:T until both you and the rogue are Blackwing Lair geared.
---
You can group up with the warrior or as a 4-man and run strat live sellabes run (reserve the sellable stuff grouping with the tank and run with 3 random dps or just speedrun it as 4-man). You should get a few Righetous Orbs per run as well as the possibility for patterns + the tome mages need to learn how to conjure lvl 55 food.
---
Honestly there isn‚Äôt really any more to the story.
---
The site is slow as f
---
Getting 1 Mountain Silversage is sad. Getting 3 makes the day incrementally better.  
---
I actually really enjoyed running around with herb/mining for several hours in Azshara.  
---
I am horrible at PVP so the moment someone decided I should be dead, I was very quickly.  
---
That is rad about your Mum!  My brother plays and we're going to duo level our first characters, but the rest of my family doesn't get it.
---
I‚Äôm really enjoying the new raid. But that‚Äôs about all there is to do that‚Äôs worth doing unless you pvp. 
---
Imp blizz good for bg to slow whole team in AB and AV
---
but ye as i said depending on playstyle
---
You are right, I should not have assumed and simply researched what horizontal content is, but you also have to understand that my misunderstanding came from the fact that I assumed you answered my question directly - my question was, why in the discussion threads of the future of Classic WoW is the focus almost entirely on raiding, given that the MAJORITY of the player base did not reach the end game and given that the content of WoW is so much more vast than just raiding. There are people who are ‚Äúalt whores‚Äù and keep creating alts, there are people focused on professions, there are people creating thinks, there are people focused on PvP, there are people who want to max out every reputation tab they have. 
---
The point I‚Äôm getting to is you are discussing how raiding did not solve the problem but simply shifted it from horizontal content, but that is not an answer to my question, my question is why you are even focusing raiding when the reality is for most people the content was released too quickly for them to have time to complete and only a small hardcore fan base (who is clearly NOT the majority of the revenue stream) was able to complete the content as it released? And even more importantly, that an audience existed that didn‚Äôt even care about raiding and only wanted the gear from there in order to use it in other aspects of the game that they enjoyed more than raiding?
---
Oh it was absolutely for the best.  It didn't seem like it at the time, but we weren't going to be able to keep it together.  WoW, and the time I spent on it certainly hastened things along though.  To her credit she did try the game and played a Hunter into the 30s, it just wasn't for her.
---
Its fucked I can sub for a month and catch up to people who havent stopped. I'm barely behind on my neck as well... it's been like this way to long and its awful
---
Leveling the storyline is fun I guess
---
np mate  
---
imp arcane explosion is good for pvp when you need to make a last effort to finish someone off, and when cone, fireblast etc is on CD but you need something instant  
---
yep 2 points in arctic reach + piercing is a good way to end it, depends if u want to use blizzard for the aoe slow sometimes in bgs or not :)  
---
personally I guess I'd do this:  
---
https://classicdb.ch/?talent#of0VsobZZVAG0sbtho
---
I think you're correct!
---
Reckoning ret. YouTube vids of guys doing 6k. Gotta turn off auto attack then take some hits to use it right
---
The exact number is, as a rogue, assuming you have the +5 from talents, 15% glancing damage, with 40% of white hits being glanced and around 50-65% of total dps being white hits, this is 3-4% damage overall boost. Not counting the 3% hit gain from reaching 305 vs bosses due to rogues getting it from talents.
---
Pvp or pve? Competition might be even tougher for resto druid since most guild will be stacking priests. If pvp, probably pretty fun. As a NE hunter I always welcome fighting along side my druid brothers.
---
Them joining the horde doesnt make much sense though, right?
---
Honestly, I don't remember a war being too much hassle to level. Nobody ever said no to a war in the group. Yeah, they might rely heavy on gear which you might not have as a casual player, but that matters less if you do appropriate raids vs pvp. You can still pvp a bit, just play defense more.
---
Sadly both servers I played on aren't even in the list. (EU-Zirkel des Cenarius and EU-Das Syndikat)
---
I wasn't aware the DM N duonrun required so much gear.
---
Yeah I have heard strat live a few times now that seems like a good idea. 
---
Hunter. Fastest leveling class and very good at farming gold at 60. Its the ultimate solo class
---
i hear mages are good solo farmes and the lvling is good aswell not incredible, due to drinking but still good. Hunters are the masters of solo, they can do highlvl solo dungeon runs. Theyre the fastest lvlers. Professions id say would be herbalism and alchemy so u can supply pots,flasks etc through out all Raid tiers.  
---
But real money comes form camping the AH flipping stuff etc, so prepare for that if u really want to make gold.
---
To build on his statement, I did some testing in Strat Live on a private server. Yes I realize private servers are not completely accurate.  
---
If you kill all the normal pulls in Strat Live, including skipping Cannonmaster, and you vendor all items including greens, AH all runecloth and Righteous Orbs, you get an average of 120g per run. Split that by 4 = per run.  
---
If your group trusts each other a lot, you can have 1 person who loots everything (probably you as a healer) and does all the vendoring/AH'ing in Org/IF and then gets summoned back to Strat. After about 5 runs you hand out the split of gold and you'll have 150g each.  
---
Reasons why you'll actually get more than 150g each:  
---
I did not do AH estimations for greens, instead I just vendored them.  
---
I also did not take into account the Conjure Food tome that drops.  
---
I also did not take into account any blue or epic BOEs that dropped.  
---
I did not take into account disenchanting the BOP gear that drops, instead I just vendored them.  
---
I also did not take into account the Flask recipe that drops.  
---
So I believe the *minimum* you guys will have per person after 5 runs is 150g.  
---
Even if it does not come you could just use gatherer 
---
Lots of good replys already. I'll just add that maybe you should play with a pocket hunter. I play a hunter and spend most of the time guarding the priest on our team. It's a weird combo to play as a body guard but with my boar/concussion/intimidation/traps/BW allows me to stop whatever is going on for a second and let's the priest get free. 
---
In BGs, especially AV, a dominant healer makes up for the fact I'm not super active in pushing the game.
---
It seems it got to you, so i would consider it a success.
---
the loot thing is so true, sad, but true.
---
who cares anymore. none of it matters bc it will be outdated in the next patch a few weeks from now, the itemization is all identical so its probably just 1 more ilvl than your old one same exact stats. and even then its probably all transmogged everywhere around you so no one can even tell what you are wearing or what others are wearing. 
---
How the hell did wow get so lost LOL its crazy
---
Thank you for the extra details, you've sold me on this now
---
Keep in mind if going Hunter and doing solo Tribute runs, you need Engineering (or technically Blacksmithing works too, but is a poor choice for a hunter).
---
How every Classic addict feels *literally all the time\**
---
Yes. I remember when my guild mate was telling me what wotlk raiding would be like. We were a hardcore raid guild and I remember saying. People are gonna be walking around in my gear? With less stats? What? I quit for RL reasons shortly before wotlk released and tried again every expansion for a bit but something was missing. I didnt miss much. But I did give blizzard $60 plus a sub every expansion lol
---
oh didnt know that ty for the info =)
---
It makes sense, if you think about it. First off, they were alone since Kael‚Äôthas was declared traitor by Garithos.
---
They learned of the Forsaken, who just happend to be led by the former Ranger-General of Silvermoon.
---
The Horde need allies, Quel‚Äôthalas needs allies, and they found the connection to make it happen.
---
oh my bad xD
---
BFA is definitely a step down from Legion. Legion was alright IMO; better than WOD but a bit worse than Mists. BFA is similar quality to WOD, with the lack of content and people quitting en mass.
---
I would wait for classic and play other games until then. I don't think BFA would burn you our for classic, since they are much different games; and since you would probably get burned out on BFA in 1-2 months, meaning you would be coming back around the time classic comes out. But I don't think it is worth the risk.
---
Hunter or Mage.

The Countdown to classic podcast just dropped their merch site.  I picked up a shirt and some stickers, looks pretty dope.  Ill toss you the link    [https://www.redbubble.com/people/joshcorbo82/works/37009489-countdown-to-classic-merch?asc=u](https://www.redbubble.com/people/joshcorbo82/works/37009489-countdown-to-classic-merch?asc=u)
---
damn, what a shame lol
---
basically same story here with the expansions and giving it a shot
---
I remember the exact moment I realized it was done. I quit pre WOTLK and then I briefly came back in wotlk just to play one of my friends characters and help him in arena. I found out rogues had a self heal when he was giving me the rundown on new changes... to me that was the killer lol. All the classes started being able to do everything. Everyone could remove all types of debuffs, everyone had a heal, everyone had a similar dps rotation bla bla. The buttons were just green instead of pink. Same shit everywhere ugh.
---
I gave it a shot in WoD too and lasted about a week or two with the garrison and not even seeing other players at all 
---
best class + best race, you will be a little god  :D (but  don't take green hair if you are a male gnome, it's not cool) 
---
When exactly does classic come out, do you know?
---
Hahaha. Yes the garrison. Single player mmo basically lol. With daily's. Oh God that was horrible. You could log on and spend 2 hours a day in your garrison and never leave cept to hit the AH. 
---
That might have been what i was doing. Regarding the threat generation, i didnt really know any better than it was an aoe ability so it must be for aoe situations. 
---
Though i think it only hit up to 4 mobs back then right?
---
No announced release date yet. They have said "Summer 2019" though. So you could assume sometime in June-September of this year.
---
In order to get the most out of the game you're going to have to decide on what role/class you wan't to play in groups/pvp/raids first.  Kind of the same with making gold, it depends on what you're going to be focusing on later on.  
---
\*however..  if all you want to do is hit 60 and make money just roll a BM hunter and gather flowers and leather all day.  
---
big dick pom r11 frostbolt crits
---
I didn‚Äôt read all the comments so I might be repeating someone else, but I feel like this is something you should consider.
---
Leveling as a tank will be very advantageous. You will have plenty of opportunity to run instances back over many of your peers and you should be able to reach 60 ahead of most players. 
---
End game as tank offers you a lot less opportunity as far as PvP and PvE. PvP groups will only ever need/use one at a time. PvE guilds will rock one MT and 1-2 off tanks for 20-40 mans.
---
Bless all twinks.
---

---
Not to mention that the chests show up on the minimap.. back in vanilla dwarves used to be useful :p
---
Try to remember to remove down votes when you realized I'm right though! uWu
---
I‚Äôd like to add that once a feral Druid racks up all the epic feral gear for end game tanking it becomes a hell of a lot easier for Druid tank to MT. A freak crushing blow can cause some chaos but a good squad can work through them at max 16000 Armor rating a druids total damage mitigation is so high that decent healers will keep you capped off for the occasional crushing blow. Their are 2 End game bosses that require fire resistance gear and poison resistance gear. These resistance gear sets are so low in stats and armor leaving the bear MT at a huge disadvantage that can‚Äôt be overcame.
---
GL getting into a 2x shaman group. Thats just not happening
---
I too play solo. I have on pservers and can‚Äôt wait to for real in classic.
---
I would recommend playing dps, you will progress through all aspects of the game much faster. Leveling as a healer or tank solo can be slow.
---
If you like to play more than one class, plan your professions accordingly and level them simultaneously. For example my hunter alt is going to be my Alchemist, and my mage alt will be my herbalist. This way I can aoe farm and gather herbs, then just mail them over to create pots for everyone.
---
The big reason I do that however is because I like engineering on all my toons for pvp. It‚Äôs worth mentioning you can create a level 5 bank alt with Enchanting that can DE any level of gear!
---
I enjoy the solo vanilla experience way more than retail. You never ‚Äúfall behind‚Äù like you would in retail, and you can reach your goals at your own pace. And to help myself access content I can ‚Äúpark‚Äù my toons at different milestones and log in to them when I have the appropriate time. Aka specific dungeon runs. Good luck!
---
This is around the wrong way. It‚Äôs odd group left, even group right 
---
What sword spec are you talking about, he is going fury for dps, he won't be putting points in sword or axe.
---
Reck pal, enh shaman with wf and pom pyro mage i‚Äòd say 
---
Oh so you wanna take it to the end. Are you also willing to grind r14? Because any r14 warrior will do atleast 20-30% more dps than you. Are you sure you can find a guild that will feed you swords over rogues? Are you willing to grind BRD for months for Ironfoe?
---
Classic has nothing to do with your race choice, it is all about how much time are you willing to spend.

Have really vivid memories where i was home from school sick one day making an undead rogue and just really getting immersed in the moody vibe of tirisfal .

And the veins could hit more than once, so if you are both miners you can share and both level mining
---
Another comparison I find fitting is: Having watched HBOs "The Wire". After having seen it, you will never ever find a TV show as good because you've seen perfection. Everything seems bleak and gray in comparison.
---
I‚Äôve been hit up by their recruiters a ton over last month, they are definitely hiring a ton of engineers right now. 
---
You're asking a sub full of people who want Classic and don't want BFA. So you are going to get answers reflecting that group's point of view. Which is fine if you are in that group, but if you are asking, you aren't.
---
Or at least to to /r/wow and ask there too.
---
Thanks for making the site. Wish they'd sticky or sidebar it. Hope it gets more exposure
---
Herbalism gets so bloody later on in the game. 
---
It gets the blood pumping if your wPvP fight will end with a 50g reward, because you won a fight over a Black Lotus. 
---
Potions, Engineering Trinkets, pulling adds. All gadgets and the tryhard play are on the table.
---
What's wrong with you?
---
i levelled really fast with warrior and pala combo.  i think overall you prob save time cause youre harder to be ganked,  already got 2/5 for group content ready (super fast groups if you level as tank healer classes)  and shouldnt really die to mobs cause someones got your back.  
---
most important, it was fun as fuck to level together.
---
FUCKKKKK
---
Thottbot is back if you want to search tru the items 
---
A miniscule quality of life change. I wouldnt support it, but its not like it will change anything.
---
When I farmed Herbs and Nodes, I had Herbs on mousewheel up and nodes on mouse wheel down just changing tracking every 4 seconds. Becomes second nature after a while.
---
but not all quest drops are shared, so some quests you do actually have to stay longer and kill more so you both finish.
---
Equating the n-word or the f-slur with calling gamerbros fragile little snowflakes triggers the fuck out of people on this sub and I love it.
---
(The secret is, I know it triggers them because they mostly fill the stereotype of the fragile white gamerbro.)
---
A hunter that can handle chain trapping is a fantastic dps to bring to any 5 man. Of course most hunters suck
---
During retail vanilla alot of the items changed stats from one patch to another. Do you know for certain that the item listed on a private server database will be identical to how classic will be? 
---
It may change the meta of the game. Items you concider bis on private server 1 is not a bis item on private server 2 because they use slightly different values for mobs resistance, armour etc. Both of the private servers are just guessing at how the values should be. 
---
Blizzard will use the correct values for mobs, proccs and items, which means we do not know at the moment how it will affect the so called bis-lists.
---
yeah. i am totally fine with playing vanilla forever. its the one thing i am looking forward to. i always hate it when people say "wait till you cleared naxx. you will leave the game". that complete bullshit to me.
---
hunter/mage.  Warlock a lagging behind third option due to affliction dots  on melee targets farming.
---
I did the exact same thing only i quit in panda-land. Not worth it. Played until i got 120 and then quit again so now im holding on until classic and i would advise you do the same.
---
If the tank dies, it's the healers fault. If the healer dies, it's the tank's fault. If the dps dies, it's their own damn fault 
---
You run dungeons for people leveling alts for 5-10g.

Just awful.

---
I'm in the same boat but I'm sticking with my warrior. Gonna suck but damnit I want my warrior back.
---
I see your point; however, it's not a good idea to tell people that they have certain feeling about something as that is crass and myopic. I still don't rate epgp as a system and would avoid guilds using one, though as with all guilds raiding, the system matters less than the guild officers in terms of how well it works.
---
I don't a F about Gnomer and Stockades, but MC/BWL are much faster to travel to as Alliance. So in general.. I think it's fair.
---
Consider this: due to the debuff limit, combat is the best for rogues raiding at 60. The best combat spec is the sword spec or dagger spec and humans benefit from the sword spec even more.
---
So it's a given most PvE rogues will be rolling Human.
---
Leveling with a friend who has the other of herb/mining sounds fun, that's for sure!
---
Difficulty isn't the main problem imo. It's more like if you want to be the main tank in a raid then you need to commit a lot of time and always be available for every raid.
---
Certainly not if it's handled by bots but I wish there would be a GM handling it.
---
If someone is legitimately shitting on someone's experience in game (beyond some ganking) like heavily offensive names and messages, yeah I'd want to report them so they talk to a GM about it since a bully's weakness is bringing their actions into the light.
---
.....fuck right click bot regulated reporting though.
---
Underrated. Thank you. 
---
Hunter eng/mining solo trib runs is great. Mage is also really solid for BRD solo farm. Both mostly come down to what will be possible.
---
BE have a great story in WC3 TFT, would recommend.
---
Same. Last July I randomly picked a weekend this July to just take an extra long week off when we did vacation bidding.... Oh Universe, sometimes you do me so right.
---
Male dwarf warrior. The best race and the best class. I will terrorize AV to get my welfare epics.
---
Latest statement said just 2019.
---

---
i think the worst thing is that you will be able to report people of the opposing faction. this is complete bullshit. i hope there will be no right click report in classic, but if there is (which seems realistic to me) it should not be possible to report the opposing faction. would be retarded to get reported for ganking someone, what is just part of the game
---
Well, obviously if a sword rogue sucks, he will perform worse than a dagger rogue.
---
But the spec is still superior, even in BWL. In BWL you just tweak the spec a little and use backstab for the second boss.
---
Ugh.. I've changed my mind so many times now but ..   Leaning heavily towards a Holy Dwarf pally also with a passion for fishing, and beer.
---
Im with you, i played a tank in expansions but feel that im might not be good enough, kinda have this fear of actually doing instances in pugs. And ive seen my fair share of shitty tanks. And i know i would be better than them, the level of play i require from myself is just much, much higher.
---
The thing is, i have read everything i could find about tanking in classic, got the info, im sure i know more than almost anyone thats not actively playing a tank (and maybe more than some of those too). Main a healer class so have a good understanding of what to look for. 
---
So what i need is experience that would build up confidence, its just a mental block (mainly about tanking loads of mobs in trash, bosses are ezpz). Leveled another warrior alt on the new private server (well hitting L57 today). Need to force myself doing some tanking runs, maybe i start doing some lower level shit to be overgeared/powered to feel at home at first. 
---
Warlock since 2005 I just haven‚Äôt picked my race or faction yet!
---
It was easier later on, since you got addons to help you out. Those addons that highlighted the mobs target bars when they were NOT attacking you made tanking a lot easier and you had much, much easier time to tank anything. Threat became non-issue later on. In vanilla threat is the MAIN issue.

Naxx and SWP were great because they represented something to strive for, to always progress for. I killed Mythic Archimonde in HFC in a top 100 guild. Absolutely nothing felt emptier simply because I already killed Archimonde so many times before then.
---
The raid progression system was discarded with solo or dungeon content that awarded gear superior to raids (TOC/badge system nullified not just Naxxramas but Ulduar as well).
---
With you on that one. I liked Wrath a lot and enjoyed achievements. I didn‚Äôt raid so I wasnt confronted with the link achievement or gtfo sentiment, but it is isn‚Äôt something I would want. In any case achievements are great but keep them out of vanilla :)
---
I thought there was a PowerPoint or something that said Summer 2019?
---
I played Human Warlock on private servers. I'm gonna play Gnome Warlock when classic comes out. 
---
Not being able to fear Undeads wasn't really a problem at all in pvp.
---
+ in PVE gnome warlock is the best for min/max dps out of all the races. 
---
Why would you need Engineering or Blacksmithing?
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqejkm/classic_still_confirmed_releasing_in_2019/?st=JS5RTHIX&amp;sh=8d01e92a
---
As a Hunter? Good luck. 
---
Just make sure you guys have all the professions that you can make gold while in instances: herbalism, mining, skinning and enchanting. So you dont leave any money lying on the ground while doing the runs.
---
I guess the timeline changed a bit as it got closer. 2018 Blizzcon was where they said 2019, so I guess after a few months, they realized it might not be ready until Fall or Winter. Not really too surprising though IMO.
---
Very cool art. Makes me more hyped for classic. 
---
Alright slow down pussy slayer.
---
I live over this side of the world now. Just makes it way easier time zone wise. I‚Äôve tried to play on EU from here. Just doesn‚Äôt work out well. 
---
To open the inner door. With Engineering, you need at least a Large Seaforium Charge to open the door without killing Guard Mol'dar. With Blacksmithing, you can use a Truesilver Skeleton Key or better. Both crafted items require their respective professions to use, but can be traded or purchased from the auction house.
---
Rogues can also lockpick the door, but obviously that option isn't available to a solo Hunter. 
---
Ah ok. I work nights in NA and since I've been on private servers the raids times are fantastic

To be fair you wasted *a lot* more hours to get Sulfuras

If you can mind control them into clicking yes on the several dialog boxes required to actually make it happen...

NE druid or UD warlock, depending if friends goes horde or alliance. Would like to play druid as horde too but i just couldnt stand being a tauren.

Hello. I am Sakuraba on Discord who talked on the podcast.  
---
So here goes. If the server are blizzlike it should work like this: Flametongue and Frostbrand should both be affected by Elemental Fury crit bonus. They should also crit dependent on your spell crit and not melee crit. The same goes for different weapons proc that can crit and are based on Nature, frost, fire should be affected by Elemental fury. But FT and FB procs should not trigger clearcasting or Elemental devastation. 
---
Flametongue, [with a fitting build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0kx0hoZxVMdVMhx), receives the following benefits:
---
10% of your spell damage
---
15% increased damage from Elemental Weapons
---
15% increased damage from Improved Scorch
---
10% increased damage from Curse of Elements
---
100% crit damage from Elemental Fury
---
And with Frostbrand it should be: 
---
And if a hunter for example have Nightfall that affects your damage aswell.
---
Spelldamage Enhancement will then work around using a fast main-hand with FT or a 1-hander or 2-hander with FB (when FT are resisted). You use shocks for dps and get ED procs that will give you 9% crit and will give you Flurry procs. Problems with mana spamming shocks can be solved by downranking the shocks in some fights. 
---
Gear:
---
You will in PvE aim for spell damage, spell crit, mp 5 as main stats imo. The problem are getting melee hit caped at same time. But you may need some gear with melee-hit on them.
---
You will need to take cloth gear so mages and locks will love you. 
---
Weapons sometimes weapon with a good proc will be better if it can crit and are nature, fire or frost. 
---
Darkmoon Card: Maelstrom [https://classicdb.ch/?item=19289](https://classicdb.ch/?item=19289) are another nice item to have. 
---
Funny to see that, my first 60 in retail vanilla was legit a pink-haired frost mage gnome!
---
Absolutely right, but if you're looking at it long term, you'd want to take the slight decrease in performance so that you can step into T5 with a fully geared warrior tank. Short term paladin is objectively superior for T4, but you want your warrior tank to be fully geared as well as if they're new or out of shape to use this experience to master or remaster warrior tanking.

---
You won't match any solo powerleveler or come close to it, but you can still level up at a good pace with a duo. Having a healer and pseudo-tank will also let you take on all the harder quests with far less hassle. It's not optimal but it's not going to slow you down too heavily at all so by all means go for it! Playing a game is about having fun after all, no?

Maintanking is hard, offtanking is easy. If you decide to be offtank you wont really have a hard time, all you need to know is how to taunt at the right moments (wingbuffets in bwl for example) and good mob positioning.
---
I like farming beasts from lvl 55-60, it is less than 10hours slower than questing and gives you about 800G + a random blue drop. Get an addon that tells you the value of vendor trash dropped by mobs you kill. I use mobinfo. You can then just run around and kill stuff. Im not giving you my spot tho :P
---
BTW beware of skinning it gives some gold but it costs time. You want to get high lvl fast cause everything you do at low lvl is almost worthless so speed is important.

You can say even months

Torn between Orc Shaman, Dwarf or Undead Priest (would prefer Dwarf because they look better) or Dwarf Paladin. It depends on what faction we end up choosing with my friends, I‚Äôm mostly a Horde player, but playing Alliance in Classic would be more of a new adventure for me. 
---
I prefer Healers for PvE but I also want to PvP and had quite bad experiences with the growing respec costs and meh farming abilities of Shamans on pservers, despite how fun Resto is for PvE and Paladin is quite tempting with their free/budget mount option and the fact that afaik they can reliably raid and PvE with the same spec. Regarding Priest, their leveling is the most fun from the three and Mind Control has a lot of potential.

While you may be correct that Defense Cap is important, in a high end guild the MOST important thing is threat. Threat in Vanilla WoW is serious business. I had never played a Warrior in Vanilla and usually always played a healer but with ND I decided to tank. There is a steep learning curve. It‚Äôs an incredibly dynamic role though and it‚Äôs very rewarding once you get the hang of it. 
---
A lot of casual guilds overemphasize tankiness and don‚Äôt understand threat properly. In Vanilla, threat is THE limiting factor of pushing high end content. 
---
Ignore defense cap, if you are dying a lot you need better healers or debuff management. Make sure Demo Shout is up all the time and reapply if CoR is applied.  Also, learn why fights you can DW on and which you shouldn‚Äôt, very important. 
---
*Woah!* It's your **1st Cakeday** drafty1983! ^(hug)
---
I am in no way the right person to say what you should do. Because I'm not an experienced tank. 
---
However, I'm leveling a warrior on a Pserver. And went into Deadmines at level 17 as DPS. Because I thought Level 17 would be to low to tank it and we had a paladin who wanted to tank. After the first room it was clear he could not hold aggro. So I tanked the rest of the dungeon at level 17 with shit gear. We took it slowly and I jut focused on tanking the elites. And left those non elite miners to be dealt with by the rest of the group. Since you should be able to kill a lvl 17 non elite without my help regardless off your class. So I just tanked elites + protected the healer. We did not wipe once after that. Although I did die 2 times myself. But we did manage to clear the whole thing.
---
My point being, if you just take it slow you should be fine. Even when you are inexperienced, low level and undergeared. 
---
Leveling as a tank is honestly really silly. You can tank anything as Arms and you‚Äôll have Tactical Mastery which is 100% required for leveling. You‚Äôll need to be stance dancing ALOT, especially in PVP and if you can‚Äôt well you‚Äôll lose a ton of fights. 
---
Ignore this comment. Defense cap is unnecessary unless you have awful healers.  Yes, you‚Äôll get chunked every once in awhile but you are losing so many stats to attain that cap it‚Äôs pointless. 
---
Tauren (or NE if my friends convince me to play alliance) Druid.

It‚Äôs down between hunter and warr. And pala/sham or druid, depending.

Close seconds are mage/lock.
---
Honorary mentions: priest, rogue.
---
Feral Tanking is seriously underrated in Vanilla. Probably because a lot of idiots are trying to play the spec. Our raid leader is a Feral tank and it is incredibly powerful. Snap threat and AoE threat is immense. Warrior threat will always outshine in the longer fights but Druid is no joke. 
---
Now I know what music I‚Äôll listen tomorrow!

Good. Your fear of failure will drive you onwards.
---
There is no need to go out clubbing when we‚Äôve got [this](https://youtu.be/0dlRzu3VPko)!
---
I am going to suggest something a bit different. Play a Warrior if you intend to solo. Yes, leveling won‚Äôt be fast, but is that really your goal as a solo player? As a Warrior you will want to learn how to tank. This will make finding a group for Dungeons easier since you will fill one of the most sought after rolls in a group. If you PvP Warriors are one of the most challenging and rewarding classes to play in BG‚Äôs and World PvP, but you will want to take Engineering if you go that route. I have been playing a Warrior for a decade, and found of all classes to solo with it was the easiest to find a group for whatever task I needed to complete.

Pool isn't correct, just mentioned to be click-report or no, so it can work in very many ways, even Insta ban after 100 reports.

Seriously the old school Blood Knights were badass, truly morally grey Paladins who did awful things for their people. Now they‚Äôre just a boring, generic copy+paste of the Human Paladins who just wear red and black to be edgy because ‚Äòthe light is sooo great guys!!!‚Äô

If we ever move to BC I‚Äôm making a BE paladin and rping him like crazy.

Orc rogue who will be my main but I'll immediately park her in an inn and start storing rested XP, then I'll switch to an orc warlock with mining/skinning. I'll only play the rogue while rested, the rest of the time I'll level the warlock who will hit 60 much quicker. All cooking ingredients and ore gets sent to the rogue while the rogue slowly levels up engineering and herbalism. #masterplan

The most efficient way to farm gold as a group in vanilla are as follows:
---
- Frostmaul e'ko farm (by far).
---
- Other e'ko farms
---
- Strat-live orb/recipe farm.
---
Claim to be an Enchanter that can do enchant "insert any". Accept somebody's mats. And then find an enchanter of my own to have that shit enchanted on my own gear. Free enchants! Did the same with Blacksmith craft gear and other stuff. Surprised I never got banned for scamming. 
---
Tldr
---
pros: It's more fun
---
Cons: Not significant. 
---
During leveling easy, afterwards harder.
---
Wait bruh. Patience is virtuous!
---
*and* in the game, right?

What is mage survivability in pvp and ability to escape from gankers like in classic? I only played mage in legion and bfa (and a little in mop and wod) 
---
I'm having a tough time deciding if i want to main mage or druid. Being able to survive and escape gankers i can't beat is really fun for me, druid even has stealth to prevent me from being ganked.  But on the other hand i love making portals and food. 
---
*Huh.* Didn't even know this was a thing on Youtube.
---
Loving these. The Hinterlands would be awesome: Aerie Peak, Jintha'alor, Seradane :D
---
Mage survivability is top tier but not better than Druid. A good Druid is impossible to catch. 
---
But there‚Äôs more to pvp than survivability and Mage is far better than Druid in all other aspects of pvp. 
---
There's 6 quests for Stockades so it's pretty good for XP too
---
And they get to display their melee weapon and their ranged weapon on their character again Pog.
---
Warrior is awful for solo play. You‚Äôre always undergeared and just dying constantly in both pve and pvp. Warriors shine in great gear and group settings. 
---
Please keep this up. If you have a shop to order bigger prints or canvas paintings I'd love to purchase a few for my home.
---
Now handle it
---
Its going to be great. In Vanilla and TBC I had a big friends list of folks that were good tanks/healers/CC. I would log in and people would ask if I could go to an instance with them, or would I tank the mage in High King Maulgar fight.
---
These days other players are just nameless NPCs with better AI.
---
It will reset I think
---
Yes. It will cycle through in the same order every time.
---
thats what i wanted to know. thank you :)
---
I played both human and gnome. Perception is way stronger than Escape artist in group PvP. You can dispel novas and druid roots. Paranoia + Perception and you can see rogues and druids miles away in BGs.  
---
Gnome is obviously better if you want to min-max for PvE but the difference is very minor. You get some more mana (Life Tap lmao) and tiny bit of crit.  
---
cringe
---
I usually play two characters more invested than any future alts. Traditionally, this has been a Rogue/Priest combo (Human/Human in Vanilla, Belf/Belf in BC, Troll/Orc in WotLK, and so on).
---
I'll usually "main" one of those if and when I raid (usually the one that benefits the raid more, also usually the priest, and I could not *possibly* know why that is). Seeing as I'm not as nimble as I was when Vanilla was retail, I probably will forgo maining my priest this time around, and main a Dwarven Rogue. Unless I go Horde, in which case I still ma undecided between Orc and Troll Rogue.
---
I mean sure, I would prefer a Tauren Rogue, but for some odd reason, the game puts you in perma-stealth with disabled chat. And while it certainly is fun clomping around, pickpocketing unwary Undead, mooing silently to yourself, I want to play Classic for the social experience, so no perma-stealth cow for me.
---
With 1.12 talents and itemisation? Easily. I did it with a group without even trying while everyone was getting pre-bis.
---
Retail tourists won't make it to ZF.
---
Just adding to the info incase anyone cares: I played a build halfway between this and the 'standard enhancement' build on a recent pserver because I wanted to go all in on supporting the group. My builds here https://classicdb.ch/?talent#hE0zVzhoZVVbdq0ux
---
I'd get put in the group with all our fury warriors and 1 mm hunter to totem weave all raid long to make sure they were being the best they could be, while also proccing nightfall to help all the casters. Spamming rank1 earthshocks between everything lets you get clearcasting for bigger shocks or lightning, and critting with even the little shocks meant i was getting tonnes of crit for my axe too. I always wanted to try to elemental build but the gear is so very niche its much harder to gear for. While its not optimal; its consistent, and everyone loves you (except maybe the hunters and [elitist jerks](https://i.imgur.com/j7IPkoC.jpg)). [If you gear for it you get pretty silly critical hit %](https://i.imgur.com/rCe9Ram.jpg), but you really need some decent gear before switching from a cookie cutter build to ensure hit% and crit% are always are required levels for flurry, as dropping resto points to early leaves you with poor mana reserves and lots of sadfaces. 
---
Dps should not have to kite in a 5 man dungeon. A frost mage could do it easily with a big group of melee, but expecting another to run around because the tank can't hold aggro on everything he pulled it retarded.
---
Who are you to say it‚Äôs not a big deal when you don‚Äôt even know the guy? I have a hard time believing you were involved as you say if you‚Äôve never even heard of him. By far and large the most respected employee on the forums , so active in the community. I agree the CM team as a whole is extremely lackluster....with the exception of him. Felt like the only one who really cared about our opinions. That sentiment is shared by so many people, and if they truly were in touch of how we feel, and want the CM team to do a better job, firing him was the absolutely last thing they should‚Äôve done in that department. 
---
I would frequently be the wsg flag carrier as a frost mage if there wasn't a good druid option. Slows, Nova, blink, and sheep can make you pretty slippery. 1v1 or if a higher level gets the drop on you, it can be a different story. Hunters and druids will be tough to get away from. And anyone more than about 5 levels higher than you will get crazy resists and will be harder to snare. I played both druid and mage in vanilla and if your primary concern is escape then druid is better. For what it's worth I still prefer mage. You're a potent PvP presence and once you're lv 60 you'll stand and fight more often than you run away. 
---
Because you are 14.
---
srsly i dont get it. why do you downvote me? oO
---
how do you get rid of crippling poison or hamstring?
---
human sucks ass compared to gnome.
---
I only played the tail end of vanilla, was about level 50 when TBC came out, but while tanks had a hard job they also had to rely on CC, couldn't get through instances without it.
---
On my server, It was basically accepted practice that you would mark Targets, and the DPS would kill Skull, then X, then Square, then Moon. DPS were expected to CC at least 1 mob each if possible, and there would be mana breaks for the healer.
---
It'll be fine. Just remember that if there is no cross realms then you'll be seeing the same people all the time, so make sure to get a friends list together of all the good healers and CC you come across. :)
---
Thanks! Messages like this one make me smile :D
---
Or the group could not be retarded and just wait 3 extra seconds before starting dps?
---
Could of used those installs of 60$ to stack up with drinks,snacks&amp;weed  for the release of classic xD
---
Mace spec rogue wasn‚Äôt a thing until bc. It‚Äôs better to just go Pvp spec and kill people in a stunlock.
---
Haha so true! Keep logging and checking every five minutes. 
---
The longer maintenance was the reason I had sooo many alts 
---
AOE Grind spec or Frostbite solo target spec for leveling in classic bois. What will you be doing?
---
also already though about something like your first skilltree with improved sprint. but you would gimp your burst damage significantly (where u heavily rely on) just to remove slow / root every 3 minutes. maybe it could be better in a duell against mage, but overall i thing something like this is much stronger.
---

the last 3 points you can put into improved kidney shot or improved gouge.
---
All servers up for 11, go for lunch, chat with co workers, maybe think about booting bloodfeather  - blizzard staff
---
my friend and i were able to watch his brother several times, but i was also able to watch youtube videos etc. guess thats what why my mother didnt really allow it, i was kinda obssesed with the game. But thats how i am if i like something i really dig into it. 
---
On an empty server AoE leveling is extremely fast and efficient. On a packed server you have no choice but to Frostbolt spam your way to 60. Not that‚Äôs it‚Äôs slow, but it‚Äôs nowhere near as fast and fun as AoE leveling. 
---
Fair but why would you even level on a dead server. There'd be no groups going at 60.
---
Yea, really, play the campaign in WC3. It shows why they ended up with the Horde (Basically: lesser of 2 evils).
---
I‚Äôve always wanted to play a mage but I just can‚Äôt get over how boring they look. You get one piece of gear that determines how you‚Äôre character looks. Sure you get boots gloves shoulders and helmet but for the most part, it‚Äôs your chest that you see with cloth. 
---
Then there‚Äôs the tabard. Like it just stops after the belt? Let me just cut a hole in my magic robe so I can tuck the bottom 50% of my guild tabard into it. 
---
I cannot play a cloth class for this reason. It just looks so stupid
---

&gt; eliminate glancing blows
---
Wish people stopped stating this. Glancing blows cant be eliminated and glancing blow chance depends on BASE weapon skill. + skill makes glancing blows do more damage only.

Like all things, practice makes perfect. Failing that, hit sunder armour as much as possible. Some simple rules to keep to;
---
When you are threat capped (i.e. the mob will not leave you as you have more threat on it than it has life left), switch to next target. Unfortunately in classic getting threat capped is likely to be when the mob has 10% health left.
---
Make sure you have enough threat on targets that are not CC'ed so that they don't target the healer. 
---
Don't break CC.
---

6 months seem like too long, you would probably get bored. If you really want to play it I would wait until maybe a month or so is left until classic

I'd actually say Druid. That way you can cover all content and ensure that you have access to all groups for instances etc.

I wouldn't say "lesser of two evils" so much as "too prideful to willingly subjugate themselves to a force that belittled and antagonised them in the past", but yeah, it's a good story!

solo tribute is private server bug
---
Your hemo spec would be better for PVP to begin with as it's much less gear dependent than assassination. Investing that deep into combat would hurt your damage output - I'll be running with [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZhZxMe0cGRo](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fheoRxzZhZxMe0cGRo) to get cold blood for nice eviscerate crits and ruthlessness/relentless strikes to help cp/energy regen.
---
Rly curious whats going on there
---
They surround the wasp/hornet then start wiggling to increase its temperature beyond what it can endure
---
They cook the wasp? 
---
The only defense honey bees have against wasps is their ability to survive at a slightly warmer temperature. What the bees do here is effectively gather around the wasp in order to warm it up, so as to kill it. So pretty similar to a 40man VS KT. 
---
Woo! Decent memory confirmed. I'm not that old after all!
---
That being said, it probably was around 90 after all. Forgot that part, only that it was hella more gold than I had. XD
---
The bees swarm the wasp to cook it with their bodies.   
---

The real question here is, would we need Classic if there was no Activision in the picture, cause I am pretty confident that WoW retail would still be great if it wasn't for that merge.
---
At least from the direction Blizzard took moving from Vanilla -&gt; TBC.
---
yep
---
I respect your opinion but you truly have a shit taste.
---
Yup
---
Yeah farming as a priest back in the day was rough huh? 
---
I didn't get my epic mount til well after TBC was released (mostly because I didn't get the xpac for like 6 months and was stuck grinding in Felwood and the like :P ).

Meanwhile all of us envied the hell out of you for it :P
---
For both mounts, actually...

The guy walking across the camera from right to left at 16 seconds walks just like an NPC.
---
looks OK from behind, which is where you will be viewing from 90% of the time.
---
 
---
Warriors, Rogues, Mages, and Hunters will compromise 80% of the server.
---
Gnome Master Race
---
Comprise
---
almost 99% sure it's going to be warlock, most likely human.
---
i'm just so torn on additional characters. i know i shouldnt think about that already, focus on the lock first and not spread myself too thin, but there are plenty other classes/races i really want to play.
---
Druids are almost always the least played class. It would be quite common for me back in vanilla to be the only druid in a group, and it sometimes got me invited to raids just because they wanted Mark of the Wild and they had no druids around. 
---
Next would probably be Shamans. I guess more people liked the Paladin archetype than the Shaman. Which given my other class was a Shaman was kind of handy, since they were always in demand. 
---
Thanks for the reply! What's it like getting ganked by rogues? In retail i'm dead in a few secs. Is it better in vanilla?
---
Played troll hunter throughout Vanilla back then. This time I'll play human warrior.
---
Heals cause threat.
---
you can target some low-level mob that self-heals, and use some low-level weapon
---
Maybe it being in Elwynn is just a 1.12 Mangos thing.  /shrug
---
Conclusion : always take care of your elemental resistance 
---
Blowing people up seems like even more fun. Thanks for replying!
---
Gnomes are tiny. You can hide in some of the objects in the game. I remember there was a pumpkin that you could run through and sit in and you could barely see my player's name. I imagine if you have a short name you can hide and fit in a lot of objects.
---
‚ÄúWe do have a healthstone up, right guys?‚Äù

---
i agree with you besides setup. i think this is a really bad talent. i have not seen anyone recommend that talent before. its unreliable and very situational.
---
Pretty much the same build I have been kinda thinking over, although I may try to go improved gouge over expose armor
---
Human female rogue. My first main in vanilla was a nelf rogue, so ill stick with the faction and class and go human for the racials
---
The thing with right column rather is, it is predictable and stable who you can sell that too. There are a lot of games following the left path, and there is a big enough target audience for them. But most games stay under the radar, and it is rare for them to become big, and hard to predict which ones will.
---
So companies will not risk investing in the left type, since they are all after predictable, stable profits. Yay for capitalism!
---
thats what i was considering that it might even be better to roll a class not often seen so you will have a raidspot. better than competing with 100ds of other players of the same class
---
"JESUS STICK IT CLEAN OH JEEZ OH FUCK"
---
If you increase glancig blow dmg to 100% you for all intends and purposes "eliminated" it.
---
ALRIGHT LETS DO THIS!
---
Same boat lol
---
I think I'm drawn to the tanky magical dot damage dealing classes.  I may go Human lock just for the experience of fighting Undead.
---
My friend used to say that to me before he told us he was a furry. Do you have something you want to say?
---
Take 2 weeks off,  rust lieveling to get ahead of the curve. If i manage to do rust I'll aoe farm. 
---
Warriors will be the most played, Mage/rogue next, Hunter, priest/paladin, warlock, shaman, druid
---
That was pretty much the makeup of vanilla and things may change a few % points but I would imagine it stays fairly the same. Lock,Sham,Druid just have so much more crap going on with their kit than just about everybody else that most people don't want to deal with them, particularly since lock/shaman dps is on the low end until AQ (even then shaman dps is pretty bad but burst is insane) Druid you just have to work so much harder than everybody else to get decent results as feral, moonkin is basically a an inside joke, and they have the most boring healing of any class.
---
I didnt like BFA at all.
---
At start go with frostbite solo spec. If you are ahead of the curve at around lvl 30, respec. It really only gets viable from around lvl 28 anyway. If you are in the zerg, stay solo spec. 
---
You can always start lvling with aoe spec from 46+ in mauradon and 51 in DM, with no fear of competition (if both are out from the start)
---
This is what I will be doing anyway... hope this helps:) 
---
No it is not the same. Glancing blows cannot crit. Reducing chance for glancing blows to land is a completely different thing than increasing glancing blow damage.
---
That 8 hours is just the raid time that wipe
---
So doesn't matter what you're going to play just something?
---
Orc Warrior all day.
---
Escape from gankers is amazing. Ice block, frost nova, blink and sheep make it that you can escape almoast any class. Add engineering to that and it gets even better. Maybe only druids are better in open world 1 on 1 ganks, but not by much. 
---
Just run off when they are sheeped, mount up (after a few sec when combat drops) and you are gone.
---
orc warrior or shaman. Still not decided whether I want to be useful or have WINDFURYYY.
---
Not true depends on how good your guild is. If it's a good guild they aren't going to invest time I a shitty tank.
---
Hybrid classes struggle a lot finding raid spots. 
---
I totally forgot about these, thanks for the nostalgia! :D
---
In MoP I solo farmed MC until I got everything I needed for Sulfuras. So proud of myself when I finished it. Probably 20+ hours of work over a month.
---
Turns out my monk couldn't use 2H maces. Well fuck.
---
But more relevant to classic: only two Corrupted Ashbringers ever dropped on my server (Draenor) . My older brother got both of them. One on his alt warrior tank that he rarely played.
---
The other on his rogue main. 
---
Mages counter rogues in vanilla. 
---
Yeah, and starting off with a Thunderclap and Demo puts initial threat on every mob to give you time to get a single target threat ability on them all. You're also taking a good amount less damage, so you are less likely to need the heals until you've used those abilities.
---
What's the alternative? 
---
If you pull a pack of 4 that's still 4.5-5 seconds until you sunder/revenge the 4th mob. Which has no threat from you on it's table, unless you used Bloodrage after the pull.
---
??? Everyone wants shaman totems.
---
Try it out, as someone who is one of the main 3 tanks of a classic guild and one on a vanilla private server it is more about your tanking knowledge and positioning if you've tanked other expansions of wow you'll be fine there are plenty of things that will help you establish early threat. If you are worried about AOE threat get plenty of oil of immolation and go goblin engineering for sappers. Otherwise just tab sunder and cleave. And hope your dps aren't retarded.
---
The dmg output talents I would lose are only the Lethality and Cold Blood. Lethality is only works for hemo and only for the crits which of course counts but I think it is overvalued for 5 points. Cold Blood is on a 3 min cooldown and it only makes a difference like 75% of the time cause about 25% of the time the spell would have been a crit anyway.
---
To make up for the dmg loss I can have Murder for 2% for all source of dmg and I could have occasional Riposte for 150% weapon dmg. And if I can break roots and snares with sprint, I could reach the target more often to swing in at least 1-2 auto and a spell to compensate the dmg loss.
---
My first character back in the day was a nelf Hunter named Raikou. He still exists, only, he's changed sex, race and faction about 20 times lol. Currently a dwarf. 
---
Lol you mean a random chest with a left over slice of watermelon in it.
---
that bee's name is beeroy jenkins
---
I don‚Äôt want it to, and I‚Äôm not 100% sure It will. But given the fact it was Blizzards own idea, I think it‚Äôs likely. They might not want to have a laissez-faire no GM no Loot Trading system in a game in their current lineup, which is unfortunate.
---
Also it‚Äôs odd that both of us got voted to sub 0 with differing opinions. People be weird sometimes.
---
Well said
---
When you are at STVietnam and kill one player.
---
I had combat text activated on the 1.12 client. Above the head of my own character like damage numbers. 
---
I want to see those sweet crits. 
---
Not sure if there is an addon that shows these numbers above a friendly target though. 
---
Only reason IMO to play retail right now is IF you want to pay your sub with gold, you can grind some gold in advance.
---
I don't think you can burn out for Classic by playing retail, they're very different games, you can just get bored quickly if you don't like it. 
---
Not if they‚Äôre healing. 
---
So you are that guy... 
---
Fu u.. Lol
---
No.
---
Only ever did it twice and killed 3 people total  haha
---
Gtfo
---
5 clicks will get you a different result each time since the starting point is random. (So no, you can't figure out the exact numbers of clicks to quickly create your main and get the name you want :)
---
If you want to do the gold farming in the long term, consider leveling up tailoring/alchemy alts for mooncloth and transmute CDs. I think it requires just lvl 35 to be able to train it and the more alts like that you have, the less you need to worry about farming gold. Make your main a mage with herbalism to supply the alts and you can still farm some extra with AoE runs.
---
so it would work to put the slider complete to the left and then go for example 5 times right from there, right? that would always get the same result.
---
you got my intention right there :P 
---
Id say its very alt friendly, Im currently playing on Pservers where I have 2 alts (then 3 around lvl 40) and the server is 7 months old. You can level them really fast and it's a great way to make money for your mainn (like lvl a mage to farm gold for your warrior main). The only thing Id say is hindering you is ranking. Getting over r11 for most people is a struggle, trying to juggle rank multple characters is impossible if you aim for the higher ranks. However when you are done with one, nothing says you can't do it again.
---
Another part is gear allocation during raids, when your guild is done with MC just farming the last few specific items brining alts to soak the other items is common. Raiding is also farily simple in vanilla and people get raid done in a day so you can have multiple chars in different guilds etc.
---
Bot? Weak
---
It's not really a slide but a circle, you can go left or right and if you get on one end, you continue from the other one again. So it's pretty much impossible to generalize it, you will have to memorize the looks to get your preset correct.
---
With evasion up vs melee/pets it's about 40% chance of a free CP each time they auto-attack. Alternatively you get 1.5 seconds extra energy regen each time you gouge or 3% extra damage for one or two of your eviscerates per fight.
---
I haven't played vanilla since vanilla, I'm entirely basing my choice of Setup on memories and hypothesis so I can't guarantee/recommend it. However I'm not bothered that other people aren't recommending it, most are just regurgitating what they've read elsewhere. The last time I played in MoP I was constantly trying to get Combat spec taken seriously in PVP but everywhere I spoke I was told I was clueless as everyone was playing the exact same specs as each other without considering other specs. It took Woundman switching to Combat to convince my RBG leaders to allow me to play in combat spec even though I would repeatedly solo glad EFCs.
---
Male orc warlock, gonna terrorize bgs with my green buff boi
---
Like for your main, there are various stages of commitment to your alt/alts. It all depends on, how much time and ressources you want to invest in your alt/alts.
---
In vanilla, I mained a mage and we had most stuff on farm relatively fast. So I had quite a lot of time for alts, between new raid instances. I ended up having six alts on 60. Of which, two made it into Ony/MC/ZG raids with pugs or other guilds.
---
Vanilla is not alt friendly at all. Getting 3 characters to max level takes months of playing every day. And then you have to gear them up. Gearing just one character in Vanilla is a hassle let alone 3. 
---

Some private servers made it impossible and others left it alone so it's hard to say. Either way, hunters also have a very easy time farming ~30g an hour in mara.

How will you all decide which server to play on? Day 1 just pick the coolest name? Any timezone biases? Preference high, med or low pop after a few days of launch?

Roll engineering, stack free action potions and limited invulnerability potions to be safe vs those annoying undead rogues and warriors.

Correct, contrary to some rumors on the internet, classics release is still planned for 2019 (expected Summer, as announced at blizzcon).
---
More news to come when we have them = soon(tm) :)
---
I play on a pserver and the extremely vast majority of people I come across are knowledgeable, cooperative, and have a base level of courtesy.
---
I translated it in another comment for you:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqw50a/german_cm_confirming_release_date_for_summer_19/egixly5/
---
well, at least your friend has retail, with bipedal chihuahuas and fucking pandas. that should be like a furries wet dream.
---
I'm currently leveling in BfA (I was curious, as you are, have already had the addon unlocked, and had enough spare gold to just throw it at a sub, because I am not willing to throw my own money at retail WoW at the moment). I don't think it's worth it, and am not even sure if I manage to hit the new level cap before giving up on it again.
---
Don't get me wrong; The new environments look decent enough. I started in Drustvar, and the environmental mood is nice. But that's about the best thing I can say six levels into the expansion. It's just the same old, bland shit, only older and blander. There's this one dark Legacy Comic that perfectly sums up my leveling experience so far: [Make it stop](https://www.darklegacycomics.com/644). 
---
There's just no substance any more to it. You move through pretty scenery doing the same shit for the nth time. There is no anticipation for a good quest reward, because rewards are leveled, and individual items have absolutely no character any more (Including quest gear all sharing the same look - one for Zandalar, one for Kul Tiras). There's no anticipation for a story line finish, because at this point, the story in WoW is so arbitrary about everything that there's simply no tension in anything any more. There's Facebook-style Garrison/Class Hall/Ship missions *again*. The fights in the open world offer no challenge at all. The difference between a group quest and a normal quest merely is how long you're stuck in a fight.
---
I'll stop here before I bum myself out.
---
I know the draw is strong to get back into the WoW you loved. It was (together with having more time on my hands that I am comfortable with, and needing a distraction, and not having to spend a cent on it) the reason I gave it a shot. However: I do not think that BfA would burn you out on Classic. Other than the setting, the game at this point has *nothing* in common with its original version any more.
---
If you're itching to get into it and don't trust strangers, I would recommend to take option that has you spend the least amount of money. Do not go for the six months of subscription. Take one. I've had mine open less than a week, and I'm already bored enough to ponder uninstalling it.
---
I agree. But in the light of recent negative news about blizzard and the pessimist nature of this sub, some, me included, got anxious by the vague wording of the english CMs post only mentioning 2019, not summer for the release.
---
‚ÄúHave you even played the game‚Äù haha so true
---
Is Gnome out of the question? That would give you a root breaker without losing CB.
---
Comes down to how far you want to go with the alts and how much free time you have. Zandalar rep is vital for zanzas, AD rep moreso for naxx attune. If it's just for professions or gold farming then easy!
---
Roughly ... you are right ... the rumers on the Internet are Not true ... we still plan to release Classic in 2019 ( expected in the summer as anounced ob blizzcon) 
---
We give you more news as soon as we get them
---
Actually I am planning to roll a gnome and it would have 3 root breakers then :D 2 sprint with prep and the racial
---
smh stick to the plan
---
a
---
Probably a very late summer release. Late September. 
---
Wasn‚Äòt summer 2019 already confirmed?
---
Of course it wouldn‚Äôt be feasible, but the idea amuses me.
---
Play daggers if You want to have fun.
---
Play hemo if You enjoy predictable, scripted and identical fights and rotations.
---
yes, but a post by an english CM this week made some people nervous, since he only said 2019, not 'summer' 2019.
---
See:
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aqejkm/classic_still_confirmed_releasing_in_2019/
---
&gt; What's the alternative? 
---
You remain in Def stance, cleave once and you have the same result. With less damage taken.
---
If you plan on leveling with dungeons, please do not pick frostbite.
---
Hi, it looks like there‚Äôs a lot of inaccuracies on your gear list/how to get the gear. Just a few things at a brief glance: 
---
1) you can‚Äôt mail the Arcanum/Libram enchants - these are applied thru trade
---
2) you can‚Äôt get the WSG items with honor and marks in Classic - these require reputation and are purchased with gold
---
3) you can‚Äôt apply 15 agility to ranged slot
---
4) cruel barb or stinging viper are widely considered better than the WSG weapons (which require Revered anyway)
---
5) Talbar Mantle is considered best for all classes at 19, no one uses white shoulders unless they‚Äôve got naxx enchants on them
---
They said summer in the restoring classic blizzcon pannel
---
oh i see
---
Confirmed. It's all about the glancing blows since white damage is such a large percentage.
---
I'd you are the kind of person who watches the meters closely and combs over the logs after raid to number crunch.. go human.
---
If you dont care about coming in 5th-10th instead if 1st-5th place then gnome is a great choice. I also highly recommend going daggers for less weapon competition between fury wars and human rogues, you can still pull good numbers in pve and they will be great for pvp too.
---

---
Hemo just gives you WAY more control than daggers and you should be able to kill most classes with 2 CB Evis.
---
I know man. They have really cool locations sometimes, but you can see that there's supposed to be a chest. So no fun in finding them. Imo GW2 did this a lot better.
---
It's about sending a message. Nothing infuriates hordes more than dying to a gnome. 
---
I know you are weary of Bethesda but you should check out elder scrolls online. They have changed the game like crazy. Me my brother and my good friend all played vanilla wow and just finally couldn't stand wow anymore after BFA, and ESO is really hitting that itch wow used to hit.
---
It's developed by zenimax which owns Bethesda but it seems clear they are ran very differently.
---
nice job getting the much needed information out of the CM :)

What ever happened to trying different specs until you see what fits your playing style best? You're never going to find a spec that's "best" it all depends on your skill, play style, and gear. If you like sneaking around then pick talent points and gear that support that play style and your most commonly used abilities. If you hardly spend anytime I stealth mode then gear and talent appropriately. I believe a better question to ask yourself is comparing the talents that compete for your point allocations and considering if they fundamentally improve, change, or a detriment to how you feel you more successfully play the class.
---
It was great! Thanks for telling your story.  I do hope the sharding doesn't effect server like when they merged.  Time will tell I guess.
---
No way i can decide, i always change my mind. Badly want to be a paladin, badly dislike the female human animations! So i guess NE Priest or if i go back to my roots, NE Hunter. But that doesn't let me heal! ARGH.
---
Preparation is generally considered a must have for pvp and will help you BIGLY in fights with your biggest counters I.e. mage
---
Otherwise, pretty much anything is fair game
---
Not true, seal of wrynn is upgraded in 1.9
---
I am in this boat right now.
---
My brother is so hyped he wants to boot up a private server but that‚Äôs just gonna get us burnt out before summer hits.
---
Best thing is to resist, switch gears to Anthem or Division 2 or something else to keep occupied, then MURDER classic when it drops
---
Time constraints to release the game unfortunately...they could have added so many more little hidden treasures/quests/rare mobs to the game. Caves everywhere with an elite + chest or something. But going off the beaten path most often means just random wilderness with moar mobs and nothing else.
---
Especially horrible when guarded by elites and you took the time dispatching them...
---
Which deep crevice of your ass did you pull that information from? I'd like to know. 
---
As a hunter would you say Engineering is necessary, or do you think it's possible to go Herb + Alch? Your post inspired me somewhat.
---
If I roll horde I‚Äôm going shaman 100% 
---
We are a US based guild, he was not apart of our guild.
---
&gt;You remain in Def stance, cleave once and you have the same result. With less damage taken. And more rage.
---
Cleave only hits 2 targets, costs 20 rage, and eliminates the rage gain from that auto attack(?). Not 100% about that last one, but it's damn sure not your first choice for generating threat in any situation. Not even if there are only 2 mobs.
---
Cleave is an AoE rage dumper, like Heroic Strike is for single target.
---
This is a really good idea and I thought about doing this too a while back but unfortunately it‚Äôs in a circle and is random every time 
---
We will be picking a server that is PvE with a EST time zone.  We would like a high pop server, with a relatively even distribution of alliance and horde, but we really can't predict that.    
---
Some would argue, that if you have, say a Warrior, you will NEED an alt just to fund it. A farming class like Mage or Hunter. So, if ypu are maining Warrior, you will actually need an alt, if not, its fine just to twink out 2-3 characters at multiple brackets to maximize fun. Also, you can get in good with guilds if you level a Priest as an alt as well for those unexpected times one of the Priest isnt able to make it to a raid. 
---
Not really. Since you're always in demand in regular dungeons (since you fill all 3 slots, you have it easy finding a group), you make a lot of friends on the way to 60. So at 60, chance is 100% you're in a cool guild with friends who respect you. So you can easily be the hybrid :P
---
Keep Herbalism to make gold if you like picking flowers, buy consumables with gold, level engineering for a useful profession. Alchy is an alt profession. 
---
Mages and Druids mostly, if I remember correctly. It probably had a lot to do with why I main a Druid. 
---
Hunters as main were surprisingly low % in the various polls here though, but I take it lots of people will roll a hunter alt for farming/soloing.
---
Priest is my main. Priest was my first main, and I've mastered the class.
---
But my first ever character I got past level 5 was a Rogue, and that was 3 months before TBC went live. 
---
So this time around,I am playing a Human Rogue. I don't know the class past level 45, and the last time I played one was in 2007, So what I remember about it is very limited and I couldn't be more excited. 
---
Speaking from an Alliance perspective: druids, warlocks, and pallies will be few, dwarf priests will be wanted, though any priest is fine, and mage/rogue/warr will be overrepresented.
---
Hunters will be everywhere at first but once aq drops they'll whittle away fast.
---
Thats why I started stating that I know there is no "best" spec. Since I still have to wait 5-6 months to try it out for myself I asked people on reddit their personal opinion so I can have ideas to theorycraft my own style.
---
Very helpful thread! Thanks so much truly!
---
That's a good point. I just wanted to share my point of view so you could consider not getting stuck on someone else's opinion. Doesn't sound like you would. Happy hunting!
---
The other side of this truth is that gnomes make the most worthwhile targets
---
Good luck with RedRidge elite quests with 2 peeps ;-)
---
But your point stays of course.
---
1. Warrior. 20-25%
---
2. Rogue/Mage/Hunter. 15% each.
---
3. Priest/Warlock. 5 to 10%.
---
4. Shaman, Druid, Paladin. 5%ish each
---
That is rough estimates of how more recent private servers are. 
---
In "real" Vanilla, Hunters were far more popular than the number i gave out. However theorycrafting and realizing the limitations of the class and its scaling issues, it will "only" be as popular as the Mage and Rogue roughly, as oppose to Warrior level.
---
I wonder what the actual Black Lotus market will be like in Classic. Chinese farmers fuck up the prices horrendously on private servers.
---
1.5 seconds is usually enough to restealth, though. Also utility for your team.
---
Treating imp.gouge as just 1.5 extra seconds worth of energy is underestimating it a lot.
---
Nice save
---
In my opinion vanilla has the most "alt-unfriendly" end-game because there is little to no catch-up gear to bypass the linear progression so you'd have to invest a lot of time raiding with multiple characters across several different raid nights or different guilds. I think that's a good thing.
---
Unless you're fine with barely geared alts that will at best take part in casual PUG Ony/MC/ZG and wear mostly blue gear for ever. Don't expect to have 3 characters decked in epics one week after hitting max level like retail WoW.
---
Most people will have one geared main for PvE/PvP, one alt for gold farming (hunter, mage) and maybe a couple twinks to bully low level players when you're really bored.
---
colloseum
---
None on his hunter?
---
These are cool and good. Keep up the good work!
---
I am leveling duo on a pserv now, consider myself reasonable, and don't think it's that bad. Sure it take longer, but would prefer that over changes to the game as we knew it.
---
*Deep Ocean, Vast Sea*
---
Without water breathing...
---
Would it be best to quest till you get to the inn, then switch to the lock?
---
Everybody still remembers taking all the quests in shimmering flats and seeing all the drops slowly accumulating and seeing all the quests slowly completing...
---
Except for the venom. So eventually you have done all the quests and are still on 2/6 venom.... WAAARRRRGHHHH!!!
---
Private server. I.e. only the more dedicated fans of vanilla will be on them. Classic will have a mass population of retail players considering its free with their sub. 
---
Only level a warrior as your first character if you are masochistic. If you have a guaranteed group to play with warrior is great. But pre lvl40 soloing with a warrior is a lesson in pain and tedium when compared to other classes.
---
Excellent stuff! Nice work.
---
Thanks! I just love looking at footage from actual vanilla but it's really hard to find because private server vids are everywhere. I did find the vid I was looking for on Vimeo [here](https://vimeo.com/258962694). 
---
Makes the stakes that much higher, and the revenge when geared at level 60 that much sweeter. 
---
your right, I must have dropped something in sub, can't remember what though lol
---
You comment made me think of HK-47 hehe
---
Don't gouged people just spam an instant cast ability to get the rogue back in combat, keep their pet on the rogue, or restealth at the same time?
---
I also tried to make a decent Hemo/Imp Sprint build inspired by my favorite TBC play style in lack of Cloak of Shadows. Pretty much ended with the [same build](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fhe0oZhbG0bZxMe0cGRo) as you did, except I didn't go as far as taking Riposte but instead distributed points between Precision and Deflection (depending on +hit on gear) to reach Imp Sprint.
---
I share your opinion about Cold Blood and Lethality bringing fairly little to an Hemo build that is more about control but at the same time I can see the argument about cheesing a duel with double Cold Blood'ed Evis. At the end of the day I think you have to choose whether you want to reinforce your weaknesses against hard match ups with heavy control or cheese even more with 100-&gt;0 combos. If you're already playing a gnome with a 1min CD escape, maybe Imp Sprint is overkill tho?
---
I actually played Legion a bit. I lasted a couple hours in BfA and haven't touched it since. Do not waste your money. I know there's an itch, but BfA will not scratch it. 
---
Yep, minimum 3 months. That is is you got very lucky with drops. First you need the Sulfuron Hammer plans, which requires you hand in a quest if you got a sulfuron ingot which isn't a guaranteed drop.
---
Once you have the plans you need to create the Sulfuron Hammer, and here are the requirements for it: [Holy shit!](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17193#created-by)
---
After you got the hammer, you need an [Eye of Sulfuras](https://classicdb.ch/?item=17204) which drops from Ragnaros, which means you're guild needs to have MC on farm in order to get one.
---
Once you have that, you need to find another BS to make it and you're done.
---
This is all predicated on extraordinary luck by the way, on average it might take 4-5 months to get Sulfuras and even longer to get Thunderfury.
---
Correct me if I'm wrong. But in Classic WoW, you needed to level skills like Enchanting to the appropriate level to D/E certain items. I know it's not really like that now. But, just some food for thought.
---
*plays gnome* 
---
Can confirm.
---
It‚Äôs nearing the end of summer already and won‚Äôt be summer again till about November. 
---
What's level do you need to get your Alt to in order to be able to create all Alch consumables then?
---
Condescending retort: That's nice.
---
I've traditionally played warlock, but I'm strongly considering mage or rogue. I intend on clearing naxx this time (guild didn't even attempt it because of tbc, despite clearing AQ) how do mages do in naxx gear vs other naxx geared players compared to say lock or rogue
---
With stam and a little bit of +fire dmg gear, the warlock can solo DM lashers. EZ books, greens, and top tier vendor trash! Then just reset. 
---
Exploring the world with a friend - yes. Finding herbs and minerals - ok, technically, yes. Do I enjoy the process of leveling herbalism or mining - absolutely not.
---
Male Dwarf Priest. I think we might be inundated with healers if private servers are anything to go by but no other class speaks to me like Priests and maybe Paladins. But I‚Äôm not gonna alt a Paladin. Nope. Not gonna happen...
---
The question is not if you are good enough, but if you have enough time to farm all the consumables....
---
I need to make a video on my channel that goes over the basics of Vanilla tanking to help folks like you out.
---
What the fuck is a b11
---
I need a BFA account in order to play classic though right? 
---
(I sold my old account from legion)
---
Orc male Hunter
---
I find the Class rather rewarding at those early levels. Not saying it's an efficient class at those levels by any means, but it is fun and really steps up the challenge of the game. Now you want masochistic? Try leveling your first toon as a Prot Warrior as I will likely do in Classic. :D
---
dwarf female paladin or tauren female shaman
---
Well arrows and guns aside, you can make goblin sapper charges which greatly improve your aoe abilities (which hunters sorely lack)
---
September would be perfect so I can harvest some sunshine before.
---
Hey Josh if you read this can I make a request for a topic. I always found the what do you do after you hit 60 is not covered enough, at least not in depth. Also, if you level say a holy Priest on a PvP server how do you make money. Just run dungeons all the time? The whole post 60 thing is a bit of a mystery to me.
---
Engineering is for pvp and minmaxing raids with sapper chargers. 
---
Alchemy is great for gold making and obviously has great synergy with herbalism. 
---
well, i have a screenshot for one of my runs [1-10](https://i.imgur.com/Nr0GoL2.jpg), no videos though.
---
but it honestly comes down to the optimized route, more than anything. shaman or not. 
---
for shaman specificly you buy white weapons from the vendor in lvl6 town, and primarily should hit mobs of your level (as for most classes). thats about it.
---
TBC ret wasn't great. If you were alliance you didn't get seal of blood which means you either chug mana potions or go oom. Even BE ret's dps was one of the lowest of any spec.
---
Why? It's not the first time a big game dev decieve their fanbase by ambigious word usage and certainly not the last.
---
I never felt there was an actual monopoly on pservers. They were just very expensive, because people start flasking in premade PvP and gimmick raids like MC. 
---
Nobody needs a flask in MC, though recommended on main tank. But when a good 10people per raid take one, usage spirals out of control. I suspect anywhere from 50-80g for a lotus.
---
The horrendous 140g per BL in the final stages of Daemons and Viper's  pserver will hopefully be a thing of the past.
---
Alchemy is not an alt profession. All the the good recipes are rep related or BoP which means they‚Äôre impossible to get on an alt. 
---
It‚Äôs level 35. But you won‚Äôt have access to all consumables since lots are bop. 
---
Thanks. I was just looking for some stuff to watch :P the hunter and warrior videos are really cool. Being able to push their resources all of the time while leveling is really cool.  (Warriors constantly having someone hit them for rage and hunters melee weaving).
---
you don't get either spec as a fury warrior
---
I'd guess late July or early August. 
---
8.1.5 looks like it's launching the new 2 boss raid in early May.
---
They'll follow up pretty quick with 8.2 and a new 8-9 boss raid, likely in mid - late June. 
---
Hopefully this will keep people interested and subbed into summer, which has always been a rough time for wow subs. They always dip in summer. 
---
Then, in late July or early August they'll drop classic, not too soon so that people are too busy doing summer things to play, but not too late so that the subs never really dip that far. 
---
This keeps subs up all summer and locks in the classic player base for winter.
---
Everyone who plans on raiding should have engineering.  This isnt for arrows but sappers, grenades, pets, and trinkets
---
You can always get a guild mate to make your pots for you.  
---
35
---
Engineering is simply very, very good for all classes. For ranged to open gaps, for melee to close them. Netomatic to net someone for 10seconds and just buttblast them into oblivion.  
---
You are hamstrung, the warrior is wing clipped, you will be able to outwaddle him, but with a nade you can sometimes escape 2 autos and a mortal strike which might end you. 
---
If you fight a hunter who has engineering, you already lost.
---
What I suggest is: get a level 35 to gain 300 (perferable a warlock for summon duties for your guild), give him alchemy. You wont be able to craft flasks, because you need to be in Scholo or BWL to make them, but all others are easy craftable. 
---
Now you get herbalism on your hunter alongside engineering. Herbalism nets tons more gold than mining ouside a couple few excepions like DM:E node farming as warrior. 
---
Have your guildie make flasks for you.
---
This is why you need a farming alt if you want to have alchemy
---
Engineering is a must have
---
I previously played a lot of feral druid, sadly in vanilla feral is not what I got to know in TBC so I chose to roll a rogue instead of feral. My favorite thing in feral was it's mobility so maybe that's why I am looking ways to integrate that playstyle into rogue. Having more possible ways to brake roots/snares give me the opportunity to stick to targets easier or to escape when it is needed. I value mobility and the extra disarm posibility more over a guaranteed crit, maybe I am wrong about it.
---
I was more interested in the differences between backstab and hemo specs. Hemo seems more sympathetic, it has a better flow. Does the backstab spec require more skill, does it have more outplay potential, does it have better overall dmg?
---
It's never bad to roll any sort of warlock for PvP.
---
Not being able to fear the undead rogues and mages will be a pain but you will still be a killing machine 
---
When is the beta and how long should it be then. July/August release won‚Äôt work out. 
---
Sometimes it's warranted though. When the healer has full mana, the dps has full mana, the mobs have been marked, and everyone have the buffs, then there's nothing worse than a tank who just stand there for 20 seconds doing absolutely nothing.
---
That‚Äôs dumb and wrong, when blizzard says summer they don‚Äôt mean at the very technical last possible day of summer. If they need more wiggle room they will just delay it instead of toying with people. 
---
Eng is better hands down iff trib solo runs are possible. Alch is definitely good though - being able to make your own pots makes the demon quest eay easier for one, and having your own res pots and geese is generally great.
---
Eng trinkets are definitely the way to go for hardcore raiding or pvp though.
---
Skinning is only good if you can farm your own devilsaur and after that it's not worth anything. Someone else can skin ony.
---
Other than what's already stated here, engineering also allows you to do dire maul north runs (using bombs to open locks) which is great gold per hour and instance based.
---
The best thing you can do is run dungeons as often as you can while leveling. I do this with my Priest. You get used to the timing and used to how much damage different classes will take etc. YouTube is a godsend, as a tank you‚Äôll usually be the lead and need know where to go, which mobs should be cc‚Äôd etc. Communication with your group is key. And keep an eye on your healers mana (!)
---
&gt; It is honestly both ridicules and laughable
---
With recent events in addition to past experiences I think it was a legitimate concern by the community. 
---
Soon‚Ñ¢ was coined for a reason
---
You can disenchant (almost?) everything on a lvl 5 char with enchanting
---
Heh this is my experience as well. While most classes are decent for 5mans, hunters range from the absolute worst to one of the best depending on the player.
---
As someone who recently played a rogue on a private server, this is what I got from it. Great competition was no fun at all and I was the most well geared. If you're looking for low competition, druid and warlock imo. Shaman and pally wouldn't be too bad either.
---
At a 0.5 multiplier (0.25) for paladins, divided between every mob in the pack. The chance of pulling aggro is quite slim.
---
Orc stun resist &gt; escape artist
---
Working as intended. The game throws current customers under the bus in favour of new ones. Similar to insurances that rely on long time customers to pay premiums so new ones get better conditions to join.
---
I have a question.
---
I hear engineering is amazing for end game PvP.
---
But is it useful at all for levelling? I mean atleast with alchemy, you can stay high on potions. With tailoring etc, you can get some useful leveling items etc. 
---
&gt;Note that on some private servers I believe some of the Shouts did too much threat (particularly Battle Shout) so some Warriors think spamming BS is the way forward. It helps, but it's certainly not the best vanilla option.
---
I'm not so sure. I played a warrior tank up to Naxx in Vanilla, and my guild used warriors on both twin emperors spamming demo shout on the caster twin to hold aggro and it was fine. Battleshout threat cant have been that low if it worked for us.
---
I think quite a few will make it to 60 so they can say how easy it is. But they'll end up hooked along the wayq
---
I hope all of you who played retail vanilla understand the gaming experience will be much different in classic.
---
Everyone in retail vanilla was clueless but now people will be min maxing the content 
---
Yup, we‚Äôre getting the asshats!   It‚Äôs part of the experience!   Looking forward to being told that I can‚Äôt heal for shit by pugs because they won‚Äôt get out of the fire!   Seriously, I miss that.  LOL. 
---
I must be really bad at retail WoW :S
---
&gt;Tier3 your hit rating is trash
---
Accuria, Onyxia Neck, Chromatic Boots, DFT, Don Julio, Abyssal Shoulders, Lionheart Helm. Plenty of sources for hit early in the game.
---
Definitely rolling Horde. Troll Shaman was my first ever character 14 years ago. I suspect I will keep that going to where it all began.
---
&gt;And let me tell you right fucking now, I have really missed that methodical tactical sort of gameplay. Modern day pugs who just want to AOE burn everything as fast as possible so they can grind out everything and blow over the experience of it grind my gears.
---
Going to add that pulling everything and aoe/cleaving it down is still possible in Vanilla, but it takes an exceptional and well coordinated group to pull it off, which makes it feel much more rewarding when you get to do it rather than aoe pulls being the norm.
---
Idk if you're scouring the sub, but someone just posted a forum post from a blue on the wow forums confirming summer again.
---
Goblin or gnomish engineering for hunters?
---
That's why more developers should just tell big publishers like EA and Activision to go fuck themselves and go independant. Make smaller budget games and work your way back up, like CDPR did.
---
If they have a pet, then yeah. But that's just locks and hunters which you'd depend on vanish more anyway.
---
Imp gouge was extremely good for restealthing. Otherwise without it you had to run so far away out of range and slowly stealth back. But then they had enough time to eat/drink/bandage/heal before you reopened up, and they end up not really affected by your first opener while you probably blew some cooldowns.
---
I'm not aware of any instant cast ability inhibiting restealths though. I remember using it frequently on most classes pretty consistently when the combat bug didn't happen lol
---
My favorite trick for tanking aoe packs is to run in, grab initial threat with demoshout and then drop a dense dynamite on top of the pack. You can also use sapper charges for even more threat if you have the gold to spend.
---
Yet I get lambasted every time I say that Classic should have a separate sub to Retail.
---
The only people who want a shared sub are people who still play retail. I give zero fucks about retail, so why should I have to pay for it to access Classic? 
---
Imo, Classic should be a separate $5 per month subscription, since it requires no post-launch development and very little upkeep.
---
I don't want to pay a retail sub and support something I wish would just die.
---
I will :) And I do upload some of them into my print shop: https://www.inprnt.com/gallery/dlikt/
---
Iirc, eventually you will need to level the character up to level enchanting past a certain point. Right now, you can disenchant practically everything because that's what Live has become. But in Vanilla, I believe you need to get to at least level 35 to get 300 skill in a profession. 
---
Paladin heals have a 0.25 threat multiplier split between all mobs. Healing yourself with single target heals is not a very effective strategy.
---
I feel like this is quite the opposite. If you look at the polls, around 6-7 % choose pala and shaman, whereas warrior is close to 15-17%. However shaman and paladin are divided for two factions, making them around double total amount for your faction. This would mean around 12-15 % shamans on horde side and same for paladins on alliance side. Shamans and paladins are among the most played class for your faction.
---
Tera has just put out a Classic server if you want something to pass the time, and for a change of pace.
---
And Onyxia, AQ, and Naxx are faster to reach as horde.
---
Cool thanks for the info. Im very interested in joining, I'm just struggling which class to main.
---
I think cyberpunks been and gone already.
---
Nothing at all that hasn‚Äôt been already discussed in depth, but it reflects how most of the community feels about these issues.  
---
This is a great idea.  With classic coming, you might be able to monetize this badboy.
---
Yeah but orc male looks RIDICULOUS on the horse mount lol
---
What a big, honkin‚Äô comment!
---
As rogues in combat allready get 5+ weopen skill to swords. So you get 305 and the boss def level is 315. You get 0.1 hit per skill as long as the difference is 10 or less. So as a combat rogue its 0.5 % hit. So for rogues it is not as important as for warriors.
---
I remember that. 
---
Unless you are undead...then you have a spine through your robe lol
---
well i prefer to do all the quest its always good to have level advantage i dont really rush it, i cut the footage between the silence, in fine with having it there for the moment i use " q r c e f " and other keybinds more than the 2 key we all play different mate.
---
That's the great thing about that panel. Right there is the Hammer, not Sulfuras. You gonna waste a whole lot more hours getting Sulfuras.
---
We are not here to make money. We are simply passionate about the game and the classic community just like you. However, we do accept donations to help us keep the site in the air :)
---
You can find it on the 'About' page.
---
Not me but some did a con where they put shit in a wrapping paper and send for 1g to pick up. 
---
Orc Rogue, level him up to 5 ASAP then park him in Orgrimmar as my disenchanting bank alt. 
---
Then I start up my female undead mage.
---
Mages arent very gear dependent so take that for what its worth
---
I found BFA fun for about 3 weeks.  If the classic game play is what you are after you will probably not last the entire 6 months with BFA.
---
Whats more stupid though, the tabard or this post?
---
improved voidwalker and decent geared leveling warlock basically has 5x HP.  basical HP=1, sac x 2 (requires 15min cd)=2, healthstone+HP pot=1, soulstone=1
---
good luck getting thru that as anything.  a sham/priest can purge/dispel the bubble but you can pressure them to heal/dispel themselves.
---
&gt; Make smaller budget games and work your way back up, like CDPR did.
---
Not the best example to be honest. While they did put out smaller budget games, they also launched GOG which isn't exactly the kind of thing any developer can do.
---
Your face
---
BfA has one of the highest declines in player numbers of all the expansions, probably similar to MoP. While the raids are great and all, the concept of the expansion just failed.
---
That being said: I'd suggest to simply play other stuff until Classic comes out.
---
How much of their profits are derived from GOG?
---
That site was founded as another passion project. They go out of their way to make it affordable and pro-consumer.
---
I don't think people should put too much weight on these words. I highly doubt that a german CM has much knowledge about the actual timeline that's been going on. In business terms his words basically state "Some rumors you've heard are untrue. We have no new information about any deterrence from our original timeline."
---
TL/DR we gotta wait for news as he can't tell us anything.
---
I don‚Äôt doubt that. But as a tank? 
---
You can‚Äôt realistically assume that you‚Äôll get priority over DPS classes. 
---
Onyxia‚Äôs neck means that you are passing over one of the greatest starting tank trinket.
---
Keep in mind that you always have to be defense capped in a raid environment. Losing critical defense pieces to hit rating ones might make being capped one of the hardest things, perhaps impossible.
---
On the other hand, you could probably get away with it in a dungeon setting since the need to be capped is less. But then again, it also depends which dungeon you are doing.
---
&gt;fire resistance gear
---
Bears actually have the advantage here. A lot of the good fire resistance gear is leather, which means the Bear really wont lose a lot of armor from wearing it compared to what a warrior would. At least in early progressing until tanks start getting Dark Iron gear, a Bear can easily cap out fire res while having a lot more health than a warrior.
---
This kind of belongs to the "Warriors are insanely hard to level" stereotype.
---
You can farm 40-60 g/hour as a warrior at lvl60 if you know what you're doing.
---
Damit, goodbye afternoon
---
Also check out 'The Noob Comic', start of that was amazing
---
&gt;Warrior threat will always outshine in the longer fights but Druid is no joke
---
Not even sure this is true. There's a lot of theorycrafting on Bear threat. The main thing with Bears is that the only real ability they use function similar to a warriors heroic strike. But instead of adding a flat amount of threat like a lot of warrior abilities, it just deals massive damage with an enormous threat multiplier.
---
This means that the more gear a feral tank gets, the higher this threat gets. Add in Manual Crowd Pummelers from Gnomeregan, and this threat is increased by nearly a straight up 50%.
---
A correctly geared feral can theoretically compete on threat with a dualwield fury warrior while also taking less damage. The only real issue ferals face is the lack of a defensive cooldown, fearbreak and the inability to use potions in Bear form.
---
Join us on discord, lots of discussions ongoing. You don't need to decide you main right now :)
---
Nice work! The Haunted Mills definitely stirs some deep nostalgia for me. I haven't been there in so long. 
---
Tirisfal Glades was always one of the most atmospheric zones in WoW imo. 
---
You can try it out but I bet the reasons you quit will come back to you pretty quick
---
Any class should be more than capable of farming 30g per hour.  30g per hour is easily achievable by farming certain mats like essence of water or elemental fire/earth, etc.  You can make over 30g/hour just by running around and herbing/mining.
---
That's corporate-speak for "we're lowering our bottom line so the executives can cash out."
---
It's hard to find exact numbers since they don't publish them, but I did find this from their own financial reports:
---
&gt; GWENT was the most important product of the third quarter in the GOG.com segment, which reported over 33 million in aggregate sales revenues
---
Now that 33 million is PLN, which is roughly $8.6 million USD. While that is their biggest single seller, I can imagine that the rest is earning them at least that much if not more.
---
Frost DPS spec and leveling primarily through dungeons with promises of water and polymorph.
---
No offense but if every raider had engineering, then who will make your pots for you?  There are very few hardcore guilds that require all raiders to have engineering, and those are the top 1% of guilds that are speedrunning.
---
You can be a more-than-capable raider by being an alchemist and by always being prepared with your own consumables.
---
This is not true. As a warrior you can easily do 2man DME jump runs once you're geared enough, and you can easily 3 man it before you are. Even splitting your earnings, you'll on average be on par with how much gold per hour a hunter makes farming Maraudon. And this is excluding lucky book drops, like priest/pally/hunter/rogue/shaman or a Foror's. Plus if either of you have herb on top of the required mining/enchanting, you can easily get close to a stack of dreamfoil/gromsblood per lockout which is a lot more money, but obviously depends on your server.
---
I like how the first two replies to this question are:  rogue will 1-shot you, and mages are the counter-class to rogues.
---
I don't think people are taking it as anything new, just a confirmation that their original plans haven't changed. It's in response to all the concerns about Acti-Blizz's comments in their earnings call.
---
Hmm, interesting.
---
Are there any differences between mages in Vanilla and mages in most private servers that I should be aware of?
---
For example, I've had mages polymorph me and it's lasted the full PvE duration.  But I've also heard that it should only last 10 seconds on a player.  Which is correct?
---
We‚Äôre doing speed runs over here if you‚Äôre interested!
---
https://www.barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=3&amp;t=904
---
I feel personally attacked 
---
You just need a subscription, not BFA.
---
If I plan on leveling mainly through dungeons (i.e. my focus when questing is dungeon quests, and then I farm dungeons for gear), should I...
---
1. Use a leveling spec (either Frostbite kiting spec or AoE grinding spec) and then just DPS with that
---
2. Use a frost DPS spec
---
3. Use a fire DPS spec
---
4. Use an elemental DPS spec and pick whether to use Frostbolt or Fireball based on whatever got ranked up last?
---
Still the gate opening and boat in Stonetalons is better ;)
---
You are extrapolating much.
---
1. I run a business.
---
2. I am a capitalist.
---
3. I did not criticize the layoff itself, I criticized the larger trend of humans using a relatively new tool in crowd-sourced funding to improve the welfare of people who have suffered -- whether that's a layoff or a cancer diagnosis. The problem with this movement is that it causes wealth redistribution by playing on the sympathies of middle class people.
---
Read some books. Maybe it'll help you avoid leaping to conclusions that happen to fit the overarching political narrative that you've tied your identity to.
---
They meant southern hemisphere summer, classic coming december 30.
---
what.. you are blinded by your emotion. In their quarterly call they state: 
---
‚ÄúThe number of developers working on Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, Warcraft, Hearthstone and Diablo in aggregate will increase approximately 20% over the course of 2019.‚Äù
---
so over all they are hiring 20% more software devs..
---
Nope, lvl 5 is all it takes for enchanting.  
---
What was your plan?
---
Because I memorized exactly which skin color I want, by numbering it from the most palest to darkest, because it's how retail works.
---
So i know I want number 6 on Vanilla servers, when doing a human.
---
I think you don't need it for any other race because the colors are much more different to eachother.
---
Disclaimer, I didn't main rogue during vanilla and my rogue was an alt during this time. I didn't really get into rogue PvP before TBC so I have no experience of a true lvl 60 pvp decked in epics.
---
My understanding is that Hemo spec is more about generating a lot of combo points to better control the flow of the fight with access to more finishers and the infamous stun lock, very much like your typical TBC rogue opening, while Backstab packs a lot more punch but is also more reliant on gear/big crits to finish the fight quickly because you have a lot less combo points to play with due to the high energy cost of the skills.
---
I grew fond of my rogue especially for the very methodical and controlled pace of the cookie-cutter TBC hemo "rotation" with a long stun lock chain so naturally that's what I'm looking to replicate for Classic, instead of the flashy crits playstyle of an ambush/backstab oriented build. 
---
It is a lot more fun with people to play with.  I recommend joining a guild.
---
I hope not.  I truly don't think it would be polished given the short time since the 'proof of concept' demo.
---
Because it‚Äôs a subscription to World of Warcraft, not retail. 
---
Think of BFA like the stripper that gets you revved up so you can go home to Classic.
---
They're completely different games with entirely different teams, development costs, cycles, etc.
---
The only reason Actiblizzion isn't giving people the choice to only pay for Classic is because they are a bunch of anti-consumer fuckwits who care about nothing but the bottom line.
---
Thank god we keep getting these confirmations that we got back in November....  peoples theories are really getting full force with the wait of classic everyone lost their ability to think critically.
---
Everything in alchemy is BOE, unlike engineering which has requirements on trinkets, bombs and sapper charges. 
---
My comment was not intended to argue that Ythisens was screwed over. It was instead intended to shine a critical spotlight on this relatively new practice of shoving crowd-sourced money at people who are in a jam.
---
I happen to believe that the Ythisens _was_ screwed, though, but I really don't care to litigate that.
---
Doesn‚Äôt matter, your paying to play the World of Warcraft IP and it happens that classic is a World of Warcraft IP. 
---
Ok so, theoretically, orcs have higher potential with windfury outputting waay morr than kings or might, even accounting for the shittier endgame weapons. Realistically though, humans will output more damage purely due to salvation, as it allows 42% morr damage to be dealt. This can change if you eventually get a fury warrior tank/bear on some fights, but most fights orcs are dancing the limit of threat, and bloodfury is very little damage that can't or shouldn't be used on aoe fights.
---
Engineering only takes 1 out of your two profession slots. 40 people with engineering is still 40 people with every other profession as well. 
---
You are extrapolating way too much into my comment.
---
As an example of how far off you are, I not only run a successful business, but am also decidedly a capitalist. I'm also pragmatic, and have no problems pointing out the weaknesses of something like capitalism because I don't have my identity tied to a political alignment -- people who do that are suckers.
---
Have a nice day.
---
I have no idea.
---
Classic to launch on Oceania realms on March 19.
---
Gnome Mage. I'd rather play a human, but human racials are garbage for both PvE and PvP.
---
No, the whole experience is just boring.
---
I have no problem competing with Human combat-sword specs, as a Dwarf combat-dagger spec rogue.  My guild isn't a top 1% guild or anything like that , but we have all current content on farm and everyone is pretty decent.
---
Know the fights, know your rotations, and be prepared with consumables and you will have no problem competing with sword spec rogues.
---
no offense but that was a really dumb comment.  you get TWO primary professions in vanilla wow.
---
so when you have engineering as one profession you have the ability to also have alchemy 
---
Do you think Alchemy and Herbalism is good for a beginner mage? 
---
Is it more important to go tailoring instead, for Robe of the Archmage?
---
I feel like a newbie having potions that are easier to get, from recipe drops, and just more of them, would give more breathing room.
---
But then maybe also going engineering for pvp.
---
Is it really? Delays happen all the time in game development
---
Part of an RPG is the continual growth/progression of your character. You are going through a story or open world and you are improving your character either through gaining levels/abilities/skills or through gear. So the content drought, as you speak of it, is time in the life of the game where you can not progress your character in some meaningful way.
---
Without raid content in vanilla wow there was no other meaningful way to progress your character and so the world became boring.  There is a point in the game where all the other things have been completed and conquered and unless you are really interested in trying it out as a different role/class the game is done. Alternate advancement/achievements can help with creating new goals and offer new way to improve your character but  raiding was the traditional and mainstream direction for continual character progression and that is why it became the focus of vanilla wow and stayed that way throughout the expansions.
---
Any horizontal type of progression, such as non-raid ways to improve character performance ultimately affects the vertical gear progression and they tend to conflict with each other in-as-much as the raids need to be scripted to a certain level of difficulty based on this horizontal progression, which adds extra gates to the raids that wouldn't be there otherwise.
---
The key to successful gear based progression is to keep all content relevant some how. I think "Catch up" mechanics nullify the need to start at raid 1, and that ultimately hurts the raid scene.  Theoretically a healthy game will have a population such that there will always be enough players to start a guild/raid at raid 1 and begin the journey. Being given the carrot/expectation that you can get to the end-game and jump right into the deep-end is bad for the health of the game.  So while it is not profitable and perhaps quite absurd to create a game where you create content for the few with the promise that given enough time it will be seen by the many, that is what makes a true MMORPG.
---
female orc has a smaller character model (so its better)
---
plus a pro warlock will use a regular mount over the summoned mounts. this prevents curse of tongues or being out of mana affecting your ability to mount up.
---
Actually, no I'm not paying for that at all.
---
What's actually happening is that I'm forced to fund development of a product I hate in order to play one I don't.
---
Might just be your internet speeds or computer power? Loads pretty quick on my end. There is a lot of data being pulled on the first load in, so give it some time. We arent funded by Amazon if you were wondering....
---
gnomish.  when you have engineering you can use both gnomish and goblin BOE items but some gnomish recipes are BOP.  
---
8 hours?
---
8 HOURS?
---
8 FUCKING HOURS?! I WANT TO KNOW WHO THE FUCK GOT SULFURAS IN ONLY 8 FUCKING HOURS.
---
Nope, your paying for the world of Warcraft IP lol. Oh Gg Netflix didn‚Äôt cut my subscription price even though I hate half the movies. Not how that works. You subscribed to World of Warcraft. You do not get another price option if you do not like every available WoW version. 
---
Ores and herbs are subject to market prices which depend on server population among other things. Mara gold is a consistent value. From experience, when farming herbs becomes a better alternative it simultaneously becomes more tedious as you're competing with others in wpvp for them.
---
&gt;No offense but if every raider had engineering, then who will make your pots for you?
---
Alts.
---
You should clarify, you dont need a BS to combine the Eye and the Hammer, just a BS to craft the Hammer.
---
you can never go wrong with herbalism, as it does not cost you anything. Leveling and then dropping a crafting profession later is a big time and money loss, so make up your mind beforehand. Also there are no perks you can only get as an alchimist (like e.g. the trinkets in TBC), so its one of the professions that works well on an level 35 alt.
---
That being said you cant do anything wrong with herb/alch on any class. So to answer your question: yes it is good, although not optimal. Tailoring is mandatory if you want to min max because of archmage robe early and bloodvine set bones (2% crit is a LOT) after ZG lands
---
I am well aware that you get two professions.  Most raiders who have alchemy are going to take herbalism as their second profession.  Not everyone has a level 60 alt that they can use specifically for herbing because their main has two crafting professions.  The point of my comment still stands:
---
" You can be a more-than-capable raider by being an alchemist and by always being prepared with your own consumables. "
---
\^\^ I think more people will agree with that statement than yours, which was " Everyone who plans on raiding should have engineering".
---
I was thinking Curse of Agony, Fire Blast, Moonfire, Shadow Word:Pain, Holy Shock, etc. Instant cast spells which will keep the rogue in combat in the half second window between gouge ending and combat ending. The only class I can think of that would struggle to stop a restealth is a warrior.  Improved gouge will give you an extra 1.5seconds to run/limp behind a rock so you can break LoS to avoid being kept in combat by instant cast spells I guess.
---
This isnt Lion's Pride Inn though. why would they go to the trouble of making it, only to get the name wrong?
---
&gt;Athene
---
Yikes
---
Can‚Äôt remember offhand (there‚Äôs definitely a Bow upgrade) but should be able to upgrade weapon at Sen‚Äôjin. It‚Äôs worth going as far as selling other your items for the cost as the DPS upgrade is obviously more impactful than armor for your time and getting 1-10 done quick is super important for fresh servers.
---
prepare to be disapointed, leveling though dungeons is horribly slow, sadly :-(
---
I'd go with any frost spec, since in fire you spent too much time drinking while your group moves on killing. Its jsut much more mana efficient and after 40 ice barrier helps a lot if you pull agro 
---
You don't pay a subscription for an intellectual property...
---
If it's a shared sub it's because they want it that way because it's to their advantage.
---
If you have a sub to FF14, that doesn't mean you're entitled to one of FF11 also.
---
I had something similar happen, got party exp on a 19 rogue and hit 20. Wasn‚Äôt in a queue tho unfortunately. Ended up taking him to the 39 bracket shortly after TBC launched and parked him there for eons. Had dw dazzling longswords with mongoose enchants and would 1 shot casters with SS enchant/wep procs. Fun times!
---
Only Horde :-P
---
locks and mages are insanely good in T3 gear. On the other hand mages are already good with green "of the eagle" gear so... :-)
---
Closed server or popular* server?
---
Only reason to go goblin is to make sapper charges (which can actually net you some money), all other significant stuff can be done gnomish.
---
You also don‚Äôt sub to Final Fantasy, you sub to Final Fantasy 14 lol.
---
 Do me a favor, go to BNET. Your retail account is going to say Battle for Azeroth. Click to renew your sub, it‚Äôs a World of Warcraft sub. 
---
Your Classic ACCOUNT and your BFA ACCOUNT both fall under the WORLD OF WARCRAFT sub. Lol. It‚Äôs not that hard. Your subscription is to WORLD OF WARCRAFT.
---
Just because you don‚Äôt like it doesn‚Äôt make it not true. Stop your whining. 
---
Oh right, yeah I was more thinking if the rogue had the opener. In that case the rogue should be able to restealth no problem before the opponent has a chance to make a move.
---
But if they get the opener on the rogue, then the rogue can control the fight by hopefully starting a stun lock as the dot is about 8 or 10 seconds from running out. About the time a KS/gouge lock end the debuff is gone. Or also another option, which I used mostly, is just ignore the dot and try to restealth between dot ticks and get your stealth opener quickly.
---
While your statement is true, it is also true that for jump runs you are relying on others for your farming. If your warrior wants to farm ele fires or go for mining nodes out in the world or whatever, then you are also relying on available resources out in the world with no competition.
---
However, with a mage alt, you can afk-aoe-farm DM East or DM North while literally at work and alt tabbing between pulls, or in the middle of the night when no one is on, or when you can only squeeze in 15 minutes you can do a run or two. For me this was a big game changer and allowed me to farm up gold for epic mounts for both of my alts easily, edgemasters, lionheart, 2x freezing band, etc the whole 9 yards.
---
Basically it makes the farming "on your own time" instead of relying on others, which I really enjoyed as someone with a ton of stuff going on IRL while still pushing for #1 tryhard status lol
---
Great then, wake me up, when September ends. 
---
Worst expansion ever. Anyone who disagrees is retarded.
---
Sure, it's not alchemy that does the job for him though. If you actually compare similarly capable raiders with engi and alch, engi will always outperform the other one. It literally only takes 1 active guy per guild with each profession and even if those few dedicated ones also had their gathering prof (herb f.e.), you would still end up with 35/40 engineers per raid, which still works almost as well as a full raid. 
---
Is this confirmed somewhere? People have been throwing this statement before anyone even knew how the payment model was going to be handled. I wouldn't be surprised if ActiJew would want us to have the current expansion in order to play Classic.
---
Well paladin is fantastic healer, you want ideally 8 shamans in raid. And druids? Ye one is enough 
---
Yup there are even fights that you will excel at and beat the sword rogues, like on veal with infinite energy you will be living the dream! Haha
---
Still, it has a more vague connotation. The GM states the release is planned for 2019, and adds in the brackets that it is probably summer. Why add this information afterwards and not just say straight up summer 2019? 
---
Nobody seriously use that trinket. Threat is far more important. You can tank with Hand of Justice/Blackhands Breath, or use the BRD trinket if you really need the defense.
---
Ony neck on the other hand has both crit and hit, stamina, a little over 0.5% dodge/crit worth of agi and some fire res as icing on the cake.
---
I have experience as druid, great leveling but sadly a bit boring endgame, I like healing, but timing a good healing touch wasn't for me. Then I played hunter, quite tricky to get a raid spot, but I had much more fun. So you should play what you like mate and not think about class representation. Since guild needs like 50 active people to be alive and people are quitting all the time, you should get spot as any role..maybe apart from main tank 
---
I agree with that, but I'm not sure the time investment of leveling a mage to 60 just to farm is worth it. You could've spent that time simply farming instead. Though I'm completely ignoring the fact that you might just want to have an alt mage, in which case go for it.
---
Since Horde can get Salv and stuff through MC, Id say Horde.
---
&gt; I just log in and sit there in my chair for 2 or 3 minutes before exit.
---
Haven't played BfA but I resubbed for a bit in Legion and have had this exact experience. How sad that they have this massive virtual world filled with potential content and they've managed to make it so lifeless that people have converged on logging out as the desired gameplay experience.
---
Thank you again for sharing, just had contact via this lovely site from friend from vanilla. Awesome resource ;)
---
If your alt is just for PVP then you can roll it anytime. PVP premades always need a little stream of new players because one PVPers get the rank they want they stop grinding BGs.
---
Most classes can enter raiding with epic PVP gear as well.
---
In vanilla I uses PVP rank grinding as the gear catch-up for my warlock alt and ended up being able to raid on him.
---
I've not found it horribly slow.  Maybe it's technically slower, but I find that going with a purpose of "do Blackfathom Deeps" or "get 2x cruel barb for my rogue" is a lot more fun than "where do I quest now?"
---
Haha I'm also changing my mind weekly.... I guess I will just make my mind on the character creation screen :D
---
Typical Rogue
---
Divinity: Original Sin 2 is a very Left column game, I've been playing it for a few days and I get a lot of early WoW vibes
---
Yup.. thats also true haha. Good point. Would be interesting to do the exact math and figure out how much gold leveling the mage from 1-60 is "worth". Like total amount of hours it takes vs how much you could farm in the meantime. I really liked being able to farm on my own time, but that also might not be a big deal on classic depending on how big the server is. When the pop is 10k+ it gets a little ridiculous trying to be efficient with anything outside of an instance.
---
For me personally I started with a mage as my main, leveling duo with someone else, and my warrior was my 2nd character so I could level it with fully enchanted gear and Kang the Decapitator all twinked out style and have all my epic gear ready for me when I hit 60, even wearing Lionheart helm early at lvl 56 and all haha. That was fun
---
Then you are the perfect person to talk to, because you are exactly the person I was talking about when I said ‚Äúcomplete the highest tier of the last raid and quit‚Äù - why did you quit? Was raiding the ultimate reason you played WoW? Did other activities not interest you? Was your hunt for the best gear driven by the desire to USE that gear in other aspects of the game (PvP for instance) or simply because you wanted to show it off as a badge of honor, indirectly telling other players ‚ÄúI beat the game‚Äù? Some other reason?
---
Hits cant crit either. Crit is its own category on the damage table. It‚Äôs not calculated by rolling to see if you hit, then rolling again to see if you crit. As far as I know anyway. Glancing blows might push crit off the table, but hits can‚Äôt then become cries.
---
&gt;For those curious [https://youtu.be/nZMwKPmsbWE](https://youtu.be/nZMwKPmsbWE) is the first reverence.
---
Woah. Blast from the past.
---
on nost mc buffing was rare. on 2019 servers most guilds are mc buffing.
---
Yeah exactly. It is possible you will lose against shaman/priest, but that still doesn't make warlock weak in low lvls :D
---
Frost mages are strong vs any melee. The crappy ones tend to avoid you all together. But, a good rogue is still a challenge. They usually only open if they think they can end the fight quickly. If you ice block or get distance they can't close they vanish and wait on CDs or just move on. Really good ones will wait out ice block and try to gouge your blink. The longer the fight goes the more it's in your favor. 
---
Yeah, I mean by now everyone knows how powerful engineering is in a raid environment.  What I'm trying to say is that its very unlikely to get 35/40 engineers per raid (unless you are in a 1% guild).
---
Additionally, most engineers who plan on making the most of it, will have mining as their second profession so that they will have the mats to craft all the bombs/mines/etc.
---
It's not always as "easy and convenient" as it sounds to just have a few alchemist alts in each guild to supply EVERY raider with their consumables.  Good luck having "1 active guy per guild with each profession" to supply 40+ raiders with their consumables every week.  Also there is a benefit to having an alchemist in the raid so you are able to make a few more potions on the fly while your in the middle of a raid, in case someone forgot something or runs out of X potion.  Even in high end guilds, people will still ask for someone to make them some fire protection pots while you are buffing to begin pulls.
---
There's too much information on this forum that leads you to think everyone will be part of a top 1% hardcore min/max guild going for world firsts and its ridiculous.
---
Trinket sap lol
---
Meh....I honestly think that bfa sucks, but If you gonna have fun, it is worth tbh,
---
I‚Äôm making a Shaman.
---
I'm actually considering going Gnomish to make the two BOP trinkets, and then reskilling it as Goblin so I can craft my own sappers for the rest of the game. Sappers have that 60 second cast time, I hate bothering other people for them. 
---
I want to finish as Goblin so I can craft my own sappers. That 1min craft time 
---
I bought an apple and an orange - which do I eat first?
---
That's what these subjective questions are like.
---
leveling as a tank is the worst thing you could do in vanilla, you can tank every single 5 man dungeon as an arms warrior 
---
For people who‚Äôve followed the gaming industry for a long time, developer radio silence followed by announcements of delays are not a rare event in a game‚Äôs launch cycle. 
---
That said, I think Blizz are just remaining tight-lipped on a downporting project of secondary/tertiary importance to their business, and they should be able to finish on time.
---
The Deadmines as a Hyman Warrior. I don‚Äôt remember it all that well, except that we got killed by patrols a few times.
---
I understand that but I'm just saying that with my rogue on a popular pserv with blizz-like population, I can think of like 15+ ways to farm 30g+/hour in multiple different ways, most of which any class can do.  Not picking a fight, just my experience.
---
I'm not experiencing any emotional response one way or another. Have you studied corporate PR much?
---
They're not laying off people so that they can free up budget for more game development. Publicly traded companies have ready access to capital, and the value of their stock is proportional to the confidence that investors have in the company to get a return on capital investments -- layoffs do _nothing_ to increase that confidence. They're almost certainly laying off people to make existing game development more profitable. Executives generally get to enjoy huge windfalls of cash when they increase profitability.
---
Also, it's doubtful that they're hiring 20% more software devs in order to produce games that are 20% better. They're probably hiring 20% more software devs to produce 20% more games, but with a substantially _diminished_ overall experience (far fewer CMs, for instance). But let's be honest, this is PR... they don't actually have to follow through with this hiring spree.
---
On the contrary, pick green hair. Green hair rinds me of fel flames.
---
Indeed, I regularly surprised groups of questers 2v1 and 3v1 and fear / charm juggled with fairly high success rates.
---
A human warlock lady, I think.  I actually wanted to recreate the belf warlock lady I abandoned early in WotLK when I started playing, but then it hit me ... wait a minute ... there are no belfs in Classic WOW.
---
Yeah, my computer is to weak to render a table with text...  Ohhh ur not funded by amazon? well color me shocked. Besides i dont know why you have an email function when you dont bother doing the updates requested per email, for shit and giggles i guess. Also they use Youtube for their "banner"..
---
Dungeon runs are relatively easy compared to other MMOs. You pick a class suited for tanking (either warrior or druid), get the basic concepts right and you are good to go.
---
I'm tanking with my druid as I level up and I find it quite simple. The only difficult or different thing in vanilla is more emphasis in proper pulling. Apart from that, it is a cakewalk.
---
Now I've never raided much in WoW, so I can't really talk about that part.
---
In this sub the majority of players never played vanilla on private servers. They only have experience about vanilla where the majority of the playerbase was noobs. Most of WoW's mechanics were 'inspired' by EQ, true, but majority of the players only experienced them first time in WoW. Today's MMO market is different. The basic principles are the same in almost every MMO and the genre advanced, so did the players, but this game is still the same (obviously).
---
I've never seen such terrible tanks in today's MMO market as there were at WoW vanilla back in the day. So there won't really be as horrible tanks in Classic either. But people live in nostalgia.
---
His old WoW stuff is hilarious
---
Paladins and shamans are plenty common, that 5% is really 10% because they are faction limited
---
I would like to be in a place where I am waiting for something to happen and I have the luxury without FOMO to duel people outside of Ogrimmar to pass the time. 
---
Speaking of which, where do people duel on Alliance side? 
---
&gt; Even in high end guilds, people will still ask for someone to make them some fire protection pots while you are buffing to begin pulls.
---
Lol no. Nobody brings mats to raids. Especially hardcore guilds that have 20 stacks of consumes.
---
Even in a non hardcore guild the guy would just borrow pots from someone that brought more and would send them later.

Female Human Paladin. I like the animations and class fantasy. Armor tier sets are dope. Versatile spec options. I enjoy being a support role, so healing and buffing in group content are both up my alley. AOE farming, tanking. LolRet. Can‚Äôt wait!
---
&gt; Hits cant crit either.
---
dude what the fuck lol
---
crit chance
---
thing is when all the hits become crits you are crit capped and hit becomes super valuable again
---
This is more for dungeon pugs. Guild groups are different. But when you lack a tank sometimes you still don't have a choice 
---
My first character in Vanilla was a male undead warrior. I found a green shovel and travelled all the way to TB to learn how to use maces... ahh the good times. 
---
That's horrendously adorable, sounds fun nonetheless
---
&gt; Lol no. Nobody brings mats to raids. 
---
Again, another ludicrous comment that clearly isn't factual and only applies to the top 1% guilds.
---
I recommend everyone try to join a guild now with others from this sub. 
---
Undead mage enchanter and tailor. Going to try for end game PvE content

If you have time, play the auction house. If you dont, just piggy back off each others professions.  Is your idea to make money together or as a group? also time is important, how much time can you spend?

Forgot about rested xp, good idea

They across the street from each other. However, think of it from the Vanilla perspective. The Alliance has no reason to venture to RFK because its a 24-27 zone IIRC. To get there you need to take a boat from the Wetlands to Theramore and then walk through a 30-45 zone and then walk through the Southern Barrens to get there. The instance I think did not have any alliance quests short of that escort one at the very end. The time it took to get there just wasn't worth the bite or squeeze IMO. 
---
The reason why I favored Razorfen Downs is the rewards were great. You had a quest that directly took you there. Furthermore, it was the first dungeon that started dropping Plate/Mail for users who were Mail/Leather wearers. Plus some of those rewards / drops would carry you to 60. Now some people might argue you still have to travel there, but at this point traveling to RFD makes sense because you need to eventually go to Tanaris. 1K Needles was a great hub in the Shimmering Flats for experience. After doing that, you could walk up the road to Tanaris to grab the flight path. When you did that all you have to do was fly to Tanaris and walk on over to RFD. It wasn't a terrible journey, but it wasn't undo-able. 
---
Human pally, was a warrior OT (molten core and zg) want to go paladin for free Mount and survivability. I want to be that pocket healer for dope pvp‚Äôers and get through more content than I did first time around

What does this have to do with shadow priest abilities?

I know that, im interested in what a max geared frost mage is capable of compared to lock or rogue
---
Every email has been checked and responded to as of this morning and is done daily. This is neither mine or Halwin's full time job and is more of a hobby helping out the community. I appreciate you understanding this.  
---
Thank you for noticing the video in our page banners, it allows us to customize the website towards a more WoW theme! 
---
My exact point.
---
I disagree.  It's perfectly acceptable to tell someone that has never used a system that their presumptions about that system are wrong.
---
I sent an email 2018-11-27 and the change has not yet been made so i doubt that.  
---
If you want performance, linking a youtube video with a timestamp is a poor approach if you wanter a quicker browsing experience, just some advice. 
---
Doubling only works if you assume that the choice between Shamans and Paladins has no effect on the choice between Horde and Alliance.
---
All we can say about Shaman's or Paladin's popularity is that it's somewhere between the stated percentage and double the stated percentage.
---
At the very beginning, I started out planning to be a solo player, and not doing any dungeons or raids, just random battlegrounds because they don"t require all that grouping. I was too shy to request invitation, not to mention starting my own group.
---
And I was planning to be a resto druid healer.
---
I ended up being a well-known raid tank on my server, being an officer of a raiding guild, and leading one of the constant raid teams myself.
---
With a passion for WHAT?!? oh.. yes. FisHing.
---
I'm sure there will still be guilds using Vent or Teamspeak.  Discord will probably be the go-to.
---
Discord - primarily due to it being free. Pretty sure some guilds will still use the likes of Ventrilo / Teamspeak, or even Mumble. But most are likely going to be using Discord.
---
True true. The point still stands, presumably they are more popular that what the poll suggests
---
I don't think many videos exists other than videos from hunters since that's the best class to speedrun with. If I remember correctly though, it took me with my shaman roughly 2 hours to get to 10. I only used two "GY abuses" to save probably \~10 minutes of walking. I'm pretty uncertain though since it was a few years ago since I last ran a timed 1-10.
---
I might give it a go on a pserver just to get the stats and to refresh my memory.
---
I'm going to roll a warlock again as my main either human or orc depending on whether I go alliance or horde.  As for alts, I'll have two:
---
If alliance: Gnome Warrior, Night Elf Druid
---
If horde: Troll Shaman, Undead Priest
---
WAIT
---
You the real mvp
---
Rogues are actually fairly crap unless people are either undergeared or low level. Warlock is arguably the strongest 1v1 class, they would kill mages too but they can simply sheep and run, avoiding the engagement.
---
&gt;It's like pvp without alliance
---
to me everyone was alliance
---
You might need to refresh your cache on the page. Your email was updated when it was received.  
---
I agree, I could just download the video and upload it. I might give that a try tonight. Thank you
---
I asked to change the guild name as i entered it incorrectly, nothing about updating the email. This was done on another machine even :) 
---
I was meaning the request in your email was updated. Looks all good to me. Thanks for joining the community
---
No single alt-friendly system, apart from the gold you have on your main. Though, that gold quite changes everything - with the items you can buy, everything becomes easy. Still, nothing to shorten your exploring/running/flying time.
---
I don't know how it works back then, but mobs can't heal self forever, mana is a thing. 
---
Great idea and well executed, I see people and guilds I recognize already. Is there a way to edit my entry to add other guilds I was a part of?
---
Early on in vanilla it lasted the full duration, and was patched midway to only be around 15 seconds in PvP. If the mage times sheep's diminishing returns well they could extend that to around 30 seconds until you're immune. Some private severs were bugged with either the correct duration being too long or the diminishing returns not working properly. 
---
PvP wise the biggest difference I noticed was just the overall quality. Spells not landing for no apparent reason, server lag delaying damage, incorrect resistances, debuffs like 3/3 imp blizz having incorrect priorities. 
---
I also had issues with the way ignites would stack. It was wrong one way or another on every private server. 
---
Lets be honest the issues started way before Activision. Would it be that bad? deffo not. But lets not completely ignore the fact that Blizzard itself made some very abd changes on the way
---
Discord 100%
---
Hmm, maybe try practicing a little bit.
---
Memorize the right hairstyle, face, etc, then try to redo it in like 10 seconds. After creating, take your time to check if everything's right - the name is already reserved and will stay that way unless you delete the char.
---
Yeah but getting a permaban and losing hundreds of hours you put into your account doesn't really seem worth it just to mess with someone you don't like. 
---
but mobs, just like players, regen mana over time. With low enough damage, it will take long enough to damage the mob, so it will regain its mana.
---
Except battle for Azeroth is far from being a king.
---
You're not a real healer if you think healing is simply about green bars.
---
When you healed the lich king fight and you got the defile debuff and you had 3 seconds to get away from the group, select your own frame, heal yourself back to 90% health, drop the defile on the edge of the platform, run back and continue healing the raid...how did you do that without mouse-over raid frame healing? Because it was already tricky being able to run and heal and target switch all at the same time.
---
what you CAN do is make any throwaway character with your name, and then when you are ready to make your main, delete your old one and make the new one right away.
---
Yes there is a risk, but its a much lower risk since they would have to try that name literally within the 30 second window after you delete it, as opposed to just letting them have several minutes while you take your time deciding on all the other options
---
&gt; Not everyone has a level 60 alt that they can use specifically for herbing because their main has two crafting professions.
---
but the person who does gets alch and the person who doesnt goes herb/engineering.
---
as a hunter it might be wise to skip herbing and go enchanting to burn items from DM N farming
---
With a mustache as big as the rest of your body no doubt
---
Hey guys,
---
Recently, I've been thinking a lot about Zul'Gurub and how much innovation it brought to the raiding scene. Whether it be class gear-tokens, smaller raid sizes, or raid mount drops, ZG introduced them all. 
---
I hope you enjoy this tribute to one of the most remarkable and unique raids of all time.
---
\-Tips &lt;3
---
Thanks for including what level your characters will be starting at.
---
That's a release season, not a release date.
---
Considering the toxicity of the private server community a system definitely is needed.
---
The punishment for abusing the right click system by creating false reports (getting your account permanently banned) is devastating for Classic. There are no catchup mechanics, you can't just get a new account and be back on your feet in a week. 
---
Yep.. I was so excited to get that on my paladin as I leveled and then DERP.  Not even an upgrade.  Big sad. 
---
Orc females are hideous
---
i see more people with herbing over the mining.  herbing is more profitable so they will herb for $ and buy the mats for sappers
---
one thing to keep in mind with gear distribution is whilst rogues fight for daggers and swords, on horde side the warriors go for axes if they are orc so there is somewhat less competition whilst alliance most go for swords and maces, mostly the same as you.
---
is this a fashion show or a video game?
---
The reason Path of Exile became so popular, they designed a game they wanted to play (Spiritual Successor of Diablo 2) and over the years as people have discovered it, they wanted to play it too.
---
Based Chris Wilson of Winding Pier Fame now can easily retire very, *very* happy and control the underground New Zealand fishing blackmarket.
---
Dwarf Paladin is one of the GOAT class combos my friend. Do it.
---
"deceive" 
---
lol, right because they should be able to predict all delays. You know how much this community would have raged if they didn't at least some super vague date to us during blizzcon? 
---
Ventrilo is still used but not nearly as much as Discord these days sadly
---
The long con
---
you mean people lost their minds the other day for no reason? oh.
---
Blizzard is known for taking forever to do anything, however I don't think they've ever actually delayed a launch at any point. 
---
^*whelps*
---
I hope they release it when its ready. Whether that is July or September or February next year I personally don't care. 
---
mumble has kind of replaced ventrilo. but most people use discord since its free. but mumble has less delay between when you say something and the others hear it than discord though. I know a lot of CS pro teams use it instead of discord for this reason, but not that important for wow.
---
ad rep is overblown. getting to friendly or revered just by playing the game is enough to just pay your way in once naxx releases. the amount of time you would spend specifically grinding AD rep is incredibly time-inefficient compared to just farming gold like you should be doing anyway and buying the mats
---
Got ourselves a funny guy over here.  My guild on my pserv has all current content of farm right now, clearing BWL/MC/ony in about 3.5 hours.  Improving every week as people get geared up.  Not a top guild for sure, but if you consider that a *bad* guild, then your comments clearly don't apply to majority of people of this forum.
---
1.9 is after 1.12 dawg, lol
---
Date means day/month/year, not season.
---
That music is shit and it's too damn loud. I'd rather stay at home.
---
You could have left he party tho
---
I know you're right, but it's so weird to me reading that now, and makes me realize more than ever how different the experience is going to be. Cause I remember when I used all my dkp to get vis'kag from onyxia, I then went for hemo and was top 3 dps in my guild and nobody gave a damn about debuff slots or anything. Man how bad were we.
---
Undead Warlock
---
You forgot about deathchargers reins
---
It makes you resilient against ganking. For example a warlock opens up on you as warrior, you pop zerker rage, so you cant be feared, you cast death ray and it recks him for 1.000-2.500dmg oneshotting him. 
---
You can make a decent coin by selling deadly blunderbusses, gyrochronatoms and other quest items. The gadgets are very good in late game and probably even more OP at lowlevels. 
---
Iron nades are cheap even for levelers and a 3second stun for aimed shot, frostbolt, walking up to the enemy as shaman/warrior, shadow bolt, lightning bolt etc. is always very good. 
---
Strat was technically a raid at some point, but I think most can agree that the ZG mounts were the first raid mounts. Depends on definition, I guess.
---
I agree, we've always expected the release as summer 2119, and this post confirmed it.
---
Allow me to clarify. I didn‚Äôt mean tank spec while leveling. I meant tanking.
---
A million guides on youtube, tanking bosses is easy AF, trying to aoe tank when you keep missing and cant generate rage is the only hard thing. Your build will make it easier or harder, I like to get the skill that allows you to keep rage when switching stances, so you can Battlstance &gt; charge in to get rage &gt; thunderstomp &gt; Defensive stance &gt; sunder armor things. Something like that
---
I meant tanking while leveling. Not tank spec.
---
&gt;I would wager they had it narrowed down to a particular week in Summer 2019 before even telling us that much.
---
You are most likely right which is why it was unsettling to some people when it was reported 2019 recently without the summer attached to it.
---
isn't this what a guild is for?
---
This is specifically in regards to ragneros and the armor loss from the fire resistance gear is to much to withstand his damage and crushing blows.
---
Don‚Äôt forget polymorph turtle
---
I didn't know too much about how the classes worked until TBC, but one thing I do know is deadmines, and every server screws that up.
---
Warrior, be man
---
In 2005-2006 I had 0 alts above lvl 30.  It was time consuming and fun (challenging) enough to concentrate on 1 character. I played quite a lot, we were a semi-harcore guild, from MC till some bosses in Naxx. 
---
A lot of guildies had 1 or even more alts, and in the second half of our vanilla raid journey those alts also got decked out in epics, as they were useful backup raiders.  Personally I never had the time for that, but it was certainly doable. 
---
As for rep grinds.  most people chose concentrated that on their main.  If your main is exalted with faction A, it's not very useful for an alt to also be exalted , so why not concentrate on faction B with your alt?    
---
The only exception is 20 man raid reputation, that is needed to equip  some of the raiding gear from ZG / AQ20.    You need to ground it out or be content with non set pieces for the alt (certainly doable) 
---
In the past years I played a more vanilla.  What I liek doing is not so much playing alts, but rather, raid with a chareacter and gear him up, then I usually take an extended break (up to 6 months or so) and when I return (sometimes same server, sometimes a fresh one) , I just go with another character and make that my new main.   
---
Yeah guilds make up the smaller units.  But you would not want your guild to server transfer because your population clasped on your server, and your friends are now looking for greener pastures.  I am trying to make sure the server is strong so people won't want to leave.  
---
Best instance/raid in vanilla hands down. 
---
Really good video too. Some points I would add were how awesome the coin/bijou system was. The fact that there were 9 different coins, one for each troll tribe, and also different color bijou's really added to the immersion of the game and made it feel like alive rather than just a turn in piece. 
---
It also introduced not only new craftables but also new resources in order to make them such as souldarite, bloodvine and tiger/bat leather. 
---
i had a big bit about the coin system and ZG trash farming for bijous, as well as a bit about the Hakkar aspect buffs, but I've been engulfed in influenza and couldn't get everything in the video. Great points though, and I;m sorry for leaving it out :(
---
Are mages better than Warlocks in group pvp / battlegrounds? Also plan on playing a Human mages over gnome. Will I be losing out on a lot for not playing Gnome?
---
That‚Äôs a rather flimsy argument. Your theme about the overall zone being innovative does ring true though. So much goes on with ZG.
---
A lot of great items drop in ZG, but I don't know what they were thinking with the Edge of Madness trinkets or some of the ZG armor set bonuses (reduced casting cost for Arcane Intellect? Really?). There's a reason no one does Edge of Madness on pservers.
---
ZG was also a great catch-up raid. The crafted pieces are BiS until Naxx for some classes.
---
More like a Bear Den
---
Truth. It only became viable in s2/3 of TBC when they nerfed HARP spec and took AR off of Prep reset. This led to the rise of shadowstep/hemo builds as the FotM
---
Yup. I'd be surprised if any dungeon on any private server was 100% accurate. From a mage pov dire maul, brd, zg, and stratholm were inaccurate. Either just generally wrong or altered to discourage farming. 
---
I love ZG and how it added variety. CAN'T wait to go back!
---
Every warrior is a tank!
---
Yup. You cant argue with math haha
---
If "that great rogue" played swords instead, he would do slightly more damage if all other variables remained constant.
---
I do not regret spending dkp to turn people into adorable turtles before mercilessly burning them alive and/or freezing them to shatter *into a tiny bits*.
---
&gt;!In thy mercy.!&lt;
---
Most people do strat 5 man
---
Hey tip! Do you think the more 'casual' entry of ZG lead to the eventual breakdown of 40 mans into 25s a little over a year later? I only ask because ZG seems like the weird middle child of vanilla in my eyes not having a 40 man variant(it really should have imo).
---
Primarily for being free? I'd say primarily for being reliable, user friendly, good etc. Can't think of any advantage Vent has over Discord. 
---
Still need alchs for raiding...those bop alch recipes are invaluable.
---
Played a mage Kelio Bloodfeather EU thanks to my shaman friend Tarmax from &lt;We Toss Dwarves&gt;
---
Still not sure on which faction though. Depends if anyone I know will start playing again, to perhaps decide on a same server / faction.
---
prolly undead shadow priest. faces will melt.
---
I mean, you're willingly rolling as a gnome -- so that is already a hellish punishment I'd not wish upon my greatest of enemies. Could you imagine? Being a gnome? Disgusting.
---
Oh, you mean like in terms of actual game play. Well deathcoil still works around  fear immunity, and the int bonus racial is always nice on a caster. Escape artist is OK for getting out of poison and other snares.
---
But I mean, at the end of the day you're still a gnome. Not sure if it's worth it even with the racials.  
---
that is a very slow clear time
---
Yeah but compared to a gnome?
---
C'mon, easy pick for female Orc or undead.
---
what are you doing to make the instance so slow? lots of wipes i assume?
---
Thank you so much for sharing the channel.
---
Good call. I don't think we have talked about spreading our professions around yet
---
I think ZG was more of an experimentation in catch-up mechanics, but it very well could have contributed to smaller raid sizes. Whatever the case may be, I love troll raids and am always down for more of them in future expacs :)
---
They have a completely different role I bgs and I'm different stages of the game they shift too. Mage is mainly there for CC, decursing, kiting. Warlock is there to Curse of Tongue casters, deal damage. Mage is gear independent, warlock is very dependent. While Escape Artist is great, if you don't like Gnomes so much, you can go Human, it's not a deal-breaker.
---
Yea it is pretty pretty laughable. Activision Blizzard cuts non game dev staff, somehow people think that affects game development?
---
Mine dropped well before we had the Ingots. Had to fucking stalk the other guilds running MC for almost a month, buying them one at a time. I refuse to ever fish again after all the stonescale oil I had to get to pay for the damn things.
---
Really wish the old legendaries could've been used as heirlooms afterwards. I miss my hammer.
---
I asked because I actually experienced the opposite on the servers I played. Bosses felt rather easy compared to back in the days. Could also be the 1.12 talents. Never had a server disabling worldbuffs in raids.
---
Deadmines I've simply never seen the pats trigger correctly.
---
Also, the server I'm on has both the Goblin Engineers and Goblin Craftsman create mechanical golems, when only the Engineers should.
---
How old were you when you started playing World of Warcraft? 
---
I was curious one when people started playing, this could be any expansion and yes I know the WoW subreddit exists but I am curious of the average player age then vs when classic comes out. 
---
I like the idea of farming the last few levels, I will be going skinning to start but will drop it for enchanting at max level. I was already planning on farming warbear leather so I can get a LW to make me a warbear harness. I guess I could just farm a lot more than planned and sell off the extra.
---
Also thanks about the not skinning too much at lower levels, I recall reading about how it's a waste of time to gold; now that you mention it again. 
---
Shut up Billy!
---
That is good to know. Do they use rain of fire I assume? Since hellfire would kill them too fast
---
I would say on average we will make money either solo or in groups of 2. Odd are based on our exact schedules maybe once a week we can farm together
---
It‚Äôs the talents too but it‚Äôs mostly the players who are infinitely better than 2004 vanilla players. 
---
Is e'ko Horde only? We will be Alliance 
---
Bfa is bad
---
Autogrowl
---
Yeah another thing to consider is leveling aoe is hard depending on the server population cap. It only takes 1 other mage being there to ruing your exp/hour and fuck up your respawn cycle. And if he is same faction as you then GGWP you cant even stop him unless you sheep his mobs or break his cycle back, but then you are just pvping and not gaining exp hahaha
---
if its a lower pop, and you are ahead of the pack.. aoe will definitely work well after 28-ish. The worgens at the bottom right of duskwood in the cemetary are a good 1st spot, you can do the whole area in 2 pulls alternating between them.
---
I am old I dunno what this discord is. I use vent because at thirty I will be turning 70 next year lol.
---
Discord is garbage. The sound quality is a joke compared to teamspeak and probably even vent. Tried it once and couldnt stand how low quality everyones voice is.
---
He is implying that all mages are dickheads of course!
---
You might say... That he was out of time.
---
It's weird watching people try to control things that are out of their hands.
---
The reason why I am making this poll is I see a lot of people posting about how they don't have a lot of time to play anymore due to adult obligations, and would like to see how the player base will change. 
---
I started playing young and WoW was the cream of the crop then and I remember a lot of younger people playing then, which I am doubting kids now would even try it.

Shadow priests perform above average in pvp because of a few important mechanics. First, fear is a particularly strong crowd control mechanic, and having an aoe version is pretty nuts. Warriors can break it, but only if they are in zerk stance.
---
Second, the discipline tree was originally meant to be a melee style tree, like the monks in SM, and had a lot of tools to increase the priest's defensive capabilities. Due to strong low tier defensive talents shadow has access to interrupt resistance, resistance to stuns, and boosts to Fortitude and Shield.
---
Third, PW: Shield prevents damage dealt. Warriors are typically the strongest of the melee dps in organized pvp. A warrior requires rage to be viable however, and shield starves rage. A warrior will generate no rage while his attacks are being absorbed.
---
Finally random stun chances, Mind Flay being particularly mana efficient, and access to one of the strongest blanket silences in the game left shadow as a rather well rounded spec. They suffered from a lack of mobility, but so did nearly everyone but mage.
---
I prefer Warrior sorry
---
&gt;why did you quit?
---
I came to the conclusion it was too much effort for too little reward.
---
&gt;Was raiding the ultimate reason you played WoW? Did other activities not interest you?
---
Yup. No pvp, no pet battles, no mount collections or anything, not an AH gamer, just raiding and farming. Maybe I'm just old-fashioned, as most of these side activities didn't really exist back in vanilla/tbc.
---
&gt;hunt for best gear
---
I raided for fun back in vanilla and at the beginning of TBC, it was only when I saw a mage decked in T6 with the coolest armor I've ever seen in a pug Arcatraz that I found real hunger for it. The damage he was dishing--the other dps may as well have been afk.
---
The gear in WoD was very rewarding--queuing for daily heroic, I just melted everything, doing easily ten, twenty times the dps as any other dps in dungeons. But that alone wasn't enough. In the end, I'm also a lore nerd--what drove me so hard throughout TBC was the idea that there's always more. I salivated at the idea of entering the Eye, or seeing the second boss of Mount Hyjal, or Archimonde, or even so much as getting past the first trash of Sunwell Plateau.
---
In the end, I didn't even manage to clear BT by the time WotLK launched. In the end, what I really needed was real content. Doing the same bosses, **over and over**, with multiplied damage, hp, and some new mechanics just isn't enough. It's bloody nuts. I beat the bloody raid, let me put it on farm, I'll patiently wait for the next raid.
---
Or let me come in mid-expansion and properly progress normals -&gt; heroics -&gt; t1 -&gt; t2 -&gt; t3. Instead of jumping right into the final tier of the expansion. Give me something to **hunger** for. In MOP and WoD, there was absolutely zero hunger.
---
I thought I could refind my hunger if I started competing for the sake of wowprogress rankings. Seeing that purple indicator for top 100 in the west. But I still felt nothing when Archimonde died, so I just quit then and there since I just can't justify putting in so much time into it.
---
Edge of Madness trinket is actually super good for priest, druid, and hunter. All of my guild‚Äôs priests on Light‚Äôs Hope have or are working on getting their ZG trinket.
---
Still using our Ventrilo server from 08, had a few oil changes but she still purrs. 
---
So doing this is bannable but during wsg , if we mananged to push the enemy team to their gy, I‚Äôd mind controll people and walk them outside of the battleground, giving them the deserter debuff. And denying them a Pvp mark for losing. I did get a 3 day suspension though! Well worth all of the tears that was redirected at me!
---
Discord, kinda like using vent - the sfx are so nostalgic.
---
I agree with you there - the continual growth of a character is what people are looking for. The issue is that if you put a hard ‚Äúcap‚Äù on how powerful a character can be, then once people reach that cap, they have no meaningful reason to keep playing (though someone like me would simply try a different class/role/faction). Though not an MMO, Borderlands comes to mind in that they had a system called ‚ÄúBadass Rank‚Äù - for completing specific challenges (headshots, kill an enemy in a certain way, etc), you would get ‚Äúbadass points‚Äù which you could spend to EVER-SO-SLIGHTLY increase a certain attribute of a character (we are talking 10th if not 100th of a percent) - thus, the more time you played, the more points you gained, the more powerful your character became, but it happened VERY slowly. Though the number of challenges were limited, they could be completed unlimited number of times, but with each completion the requirement rose higher (if the first challenge was ‚Äúkill 10 enemies with a headshot‚Äù, if you wanted to repeat it after completing that challenge it would be ‚Äúkill 25 enemies with a headshot‚Äù)
---
Now, I am NOT suggesting this be implemented in Classic (like I mentioned, this ‚Äúcontent drought‚Äù is only an issue for hardcore players - I will play Classic for decades before I am tired of it), but I am saying that this is a somewhat decent solution to this problem of MMOs because:
---
 - it continues the progression of a character
---
 - it does it in a way that is challenging rather than plain grindy (complete challenges, much like achievements, in order to unlock attribute points)
---
 - it paces the progression enough that you won‚Äôt have someone becoming an ultimate ‚Äúgod-character‚Äù in a span of several months (maybe in a couple of years, though by then more people will progress, and thus no one person will progress so much that he will be absolutely better than everyone, and even if he will be, it will be by a tiny, barely noticeable margin, which is my next point)
---
 - due to the increasing difficulty of each repeatable challenge, gaining more attributes becomes exponentially more challenging and time-consuming, thus it will deter even hardcore players from climbing so high that they become all-powerful and will always be only marginally better than not-so-hardcore players.
---
This ‚Äúsolution‚Äù also has a sort of ‚Äúcatch-up‚Äù mechanic in that the first large set of attribute increases is attainable much easier and quicker, thus even though hardcore players will still be ahead, people will be able to catch up in a way that will make them only marginally worse than the hardcore players - not enough to make it seem utterly unfair, just a bit of an advantage.
---
Or melle the boss if you have t1
---
Yeah knowledge is king in this game, that's for sure. Looking forward to those raid speedruns. Dreamstate did some crazy stuff already. To conclude back to the topic, I heard bear tanks are amazing for speedruns because of ST threat so dps can go wild.
---
Age 9 I got my 1st 14 day trial in BC, Age 10 I got the full game, Age 11 I cleared my 1st raid in Ulduar - WoW was so instrumental to my social development at that age, completely changed my life honestly.
---
My first raid was a ZG PUG. This is when I was a young and ignorant tank, but was more than willing to tag along on this mysterious adventure in hope for some sick loot. 
---
The next day I went into our town's summer program and told everyone how we downed Venoxis. My one friend asked "did the sick dagger drop?". He was a rogue and I think thought the dagger was a good melee option as opposed to caster. Really outlined how innocent and clueless we were - the world felt so large and much of it was still untouched by us. What a feeling!

They don't need to decide. They have the data and  running reference client and servers. I think alot of mechanics are wrong or just inaccurate on pservers, and it will be a big surprise and the meta will change.
---
Outside Stormwind and outside Ironforge. There‚Äôs barely anyone ever in Darnassus, unless they are low-level NEs or someone who just traveled there to learn weapon skills
---
You can't chain trap for long in vanilla. Can't drop a trap without feign death and after a trap or 2 your not going to be able to get aggro off the healer to pull to your trap
---
Thank you for the extra details, you've sold me on this now.
---
Roughly how long is Strat Live? I assume the more we do it the faster we will be. But for a *Super Rough* ballpark, what are we looking at?
---
I have. And I played the shit out of Pvp. I joined in a server that was progressed though naxx for 4 years. And it was the best time I‚Äôve had. I killed KT, got bis, and then did a lot of Pvp. I know some people who quit after we killed KT, but just because you I‚Äôll quit, doesn‚Äôt mean everyone else will. I continued to play on that server until the devs decided to force everyone to play BC and merged the vanilla server with the bc one.
---
Long duration Vanilla CC are broken by the heartbeat resist mechanic. I'm not 100% certain of the exact details of the mechanic, but basically every second or two there's a chance that the CC will break. And this chance increases the longer the CC has been in effect, going from negligible chance for the first five seconds to being extremely likely to break past the fifteen second mark. This chance is definitely impacted by resistance stats so for example hunter pets with high trained resists will break out of CC relatively early. There was no hard cap on PvP CC duration in Vanilla, that was implemented in TBC.
---
Discord improved quite a bit in audio quality. Afaik only stereo sound is missing for normal use.
---
There are FAR too many people on these threads trying to figure out the fastest way to rush to 60.  I know it's each person's perogative to decide how they want to level, but dungeons help break up the monotony in various ways. Interesting bosses, different scenery, cool/flavorful dungeon drops that are usually better statwise than gear you get from questing in the related zone.  
---
Overall, IMO people need to relax a little on this "power-leveling" idealogy.
---
This is such a silly idea. A tiny percentage of classic players are reading this sub. Even smaller read this post, even smaller care. You won't affect a thing with this.
---
Oh, yeah!
---
Paladin or warlock. Plan on making both not sure which will be my main. Will probably level a hunter too for gathering profs
---
The key issue in calculating the time is whether or not you're going to stick to your guns on 4 manning, or if you'll find a 5th.
---
Unless its been fixed in the past 6 months i disagree. There was an obvious drop in quality when we switched from teamspeak, so much so that i ended up refusing to use it. Even steams voice chat seems to be better in quality nowadays.
---
Yeah, I was thinking that AE would be great for that extra DPS and also that it would be a forgiving ability. If you used your instants too early, AE could mop that up for you.   
---
Looks like I'm going to be running this, cheers! Loving the mage so far.
---
I would say we will likely stick with a 5 man until we get more geared then drop down to a 4 man. But I would have to discuss with them to be 100% sure on that
---
It's hard to pick which one to main and the other 6 as alts.
---
Any 5 man is probably fine, but you're screwed as soon as you step into MC as you need to remove curses for Lucifron.
---
Winter is coming.

Are you partial to WoW lore? The reason I ask is (as much as I hate pointing people away from WoW - I want it to succeed, so I want everyone to play it üòÖ) I feel like there may be other games out there better suited for your style of gameplay. You may not be a fan of FPS games, but if you are, Destiny had amazing raids (just about one of like 2 things they got right). I have not progressed far enough in ESO, but I believe they also have decent raids. I‚Äôve heard that FFXIV has great raids too. While not raids, GTA Online has 4 person Heists that are loads of fun (as an example, there‚Äôs a mission where one person has to quietly drive an EMP vehicle into a base undetected and communication is key because the other 3 have to tell him when and where to go and have to line up three headshots on three guard patrols, count down and take them out at the same time so none of them alert the system)
---
Personally, I‚Äôm partial to WoW, so I understand if you don‚Äôt want to try other games, but I‚Äôm also someone who tries something different in WoW when I get bored - I set a random goal and go for it, kind of like achievements, but I was doing it long before achievements became a thing. I also loved exploration and finding niche items to compete for - I‚Äôve really wanted to win the fishing extravaganza so that I could get a trinket to breathe and swim under water. Trivial, I know, but the actual process of setting a goal and completing it was what I enjoyed.
---
So Everquest has something like this. It is called Alternate Advancement (AA points). I absolutely loved it while playing, but I also understand it's drawbacks. So in EQ, you can xp for AA points. It is the amount of xp it would take a player to go from level 50 to level 51. And you would spend those points on minor upgrades to your character - increased base stats, more mana or health regen, increased movement speed, longer lasting buffs, buffs to specific spells, new abilities all together, etc. Some AA "talents" could cost 100 AA points and others may cost just 1. 
---
The problem was, all the end game raids needed to be balanced for people with a ton of AAs. So entrance to those raids were no longer just gear based, but you needed like 100AAs or 200AAs to even get to join the guild doing that content. If you don't have the gear, the guild can just run your through the "farm" content and gear you up, but if you don't have the AAs - well there is no easy solution for that.
---
I liked the achievements that rolled out in WotLK. It gave you some fun objectives to earn titles or mounts or baubles. I definitely remember going back an searching every corner of every zone so I could get the Explorers title/achievement [Ultimately a waste of time, but was something to do]
---
&gt;release as summer 2119
---
I'd sure hope so. I don't think I can wait 100 years.
---
I was a bit older but my story was similar. I played in Classic got to 60 a few days before BC and raided Gruuls Lair at 68 with a cool guild who was down a healer and ready to go. They let me join though I was terrible and even gave me a piece of gear. I got to 70 the next week and eventually became their #1 druid healer.
---
/u/GSD_daddy and /u/piksaus are correct. 
---
Level 5 is all you need in vanilla.
---
/u/baltzy69 tagging you too for visibility since we are replying 1 response down the chain. The changes you are talking about did not come until a later expansion. You can absolutely DE everything on a lvl 5 alt. I did this on multiple different pservers when I would AOE farm on my mage in DM N and DM E, disenchanting level 50-60 gear all the time.
---
Disagree, it added the god awful token system, adding an unnecessary step to getting gear.
---
I bet that's going to be a lot more commen when classic is released.
---
I'd love to see a full paladin raid try to kill Shazzrah or the Bat boss in ZG. But you shouldn't have any problems in dungeons.
---
thats what bubbles are for
---
&gt; [Ultimately a waste of time, but was something to do]
---
I agree, but in a sense, isn‚Äôt ALL gaming ultimately a waste of time? They are meaningless goals, BUT, I have SO much fun doing them, especially when friends are involved - so the goals may be a wasted but the actual time spent playing isn‚Äôt (at least for me)
---
Yes, it also depends on server population as well. Mage farming (or hunter mara) is the best because you can do it solo inside an instance with ZERO PERCENT chance of fuckup other than your own mistakes. You can even just play at work and afk when needed and alt tab and stuff like that while watching netflix haha
---
If you try to do stuff out in the real world, you have not only enemy faction ganking to deal with, but also just the sheer numbers of FRIENDS who compete too. It gets pretty ugly out there on the 10k pop servers with same-faction fighting each other over mobs and griefing each other too by pulling aggro and resetting them on purpose, sheeping the mobs to grief same-faction, etc.
---
We don't wipe, but we dont have 40 ppl throwing grenades every pull, and popping invis potions to skip trash mobs etc.
---
For you to be talking so much, you must be in a top guild on a pserv right now... mind sharing what server and guild and your character's name so I can check out your logs?  Always looking to learn..
---
That means your gold per person goes down.  
---
However, if you guys perfect your craft and improve your gear, you can do some mind blowing fast runs.  
---
I think the runs you guys do after you've had your first trial run will take 35-40 minutes. Just being a safe group. Definitely not buying a lambo with that income but you'll only get faster.  
---
You'll get so fast to the point where, if you're CC'ing, the CC is happening without anyone saying a word. You'll reach a point where you can all do the run in complete silence because you all know exactly what each of you and yourself is supposed to be doing.  
---
When you reach that stage, it becomes less of a chore and money seems to flow a lot easier.  
---
However I would advise the following: Find something you can farm when this 5 man group is not available. The hardest part of most groups is keeping it all coordinated.  
---
And then they reapply it when your bubble is gone and you all die.
---
Thanks for the post but also U/mariobaslerxtreme, thanks for such an amazing username
---
Well we do high level mythic dungeons on retail so staying coordinated should be an issue.
---
That time isn't too bad.
---
I super appreciate the info! It's been a huge help! 
---
Tanking the Magic Emperor on the Twin Emps fight due to Arcane Burst.
---
Really though, classic was fun at the time but in retrospect it was a broken, unbalanced mess! In PvP you were either a warrior, rogue or eating shit and similarly in PvE, if you picked paladin all you did was buff people and stay out of combat to res people.  Sorry for stumbling across this post and not realizing how many people I'd offend with my heretical views, but I'm in it deep here so I guess I'm gonna keep digging!
---
You just use the rage you get from charge to thunderclap ot battle shout before swotching stances. Ypu dont need to stance dance for t clap religiously
---
ZG was a nice casual raid, we would run it on off nights usually with lots of peoples alts.
---
Damn it, your poll made me feel old.  I was in the 31-35 range...now........
---
Black. Because warlocks are all emo.
---
You are correct. It was fun to travel the world my with guild mates to achieve the achievements. Whenever we felt like there wasn't anything more productive to do we would open up the achievement page and try to knock some of them out of the park.
---
I don't disagree at all, I'm just pointing out that they are hiring more developers, which they are. Just a counter point, you could say the exact same thing for EA. Yet Apex legends is one of the hottest games right now.
---
Any fight which requires:
---
* Ranged DPS
---
* Dispelling curses or offensive magic dispels
---
* Taunt
---
I imagine something like 4H would be impossible.
---
I don't think 40 paladins would be able to kill lucifron fast enough to get around curse removal.
---
Even with 30 seconds from everyone in the raid having cleansing potion + bubble. That only gives you ~1 minute to kill him.
---
That's still pretty damn fast, and even with 40 ret paladins going ham seems improbable.
---
All 5 + UBRS should be possible.
---
27yrs old, AQ had just been opened but I was single and could stay up as late as I wanted playing WoW. In MoP I /wowquit and found someone 6 months later who I've just married, so I definitely won't be able to PVP until 3am. Saturday day and a couple of week nights will be fine, plus I can raid the auction house while I'm at work so won't need to farm much.
---
You don't engage by charging 90% of the time.
---
It‚Äôs been a while but I think I was using vw pull, rain of fire (until they‚Äôre on top of me), sac vw (as soon as it was about to die) then hellfire + healthstone. Need to have voidy‚Äôs aoe taunt up unless you have very high spell dmg. Not as easy as a mage lol
---
I was gunna go with druid but seeing as I don't want to be forced to heal mainspec I'll probably go with Nelf Hunter for that Wpvp doucheyness with a cat pet
---
OK, you made me mad. You win.
---
I get really annoyed when I find a chest only to discover that the only thing in it are a few bananas.

I understand this reference.

This.

Or any fight which can't be done with 30 shitty melee in your raid.

ReT DpS lOl. By which I mean any fights with an enrage timer would be impossible.
---
I already have 10% of what I need to make this dream of mine work
---
&gt;I hope that when classic comes they take a very hands off approach to griefing punishment like they did on live servers.
---
Sorry to tell you, but Classic with use the automated mute/kick system from retail. If you say fuck and people report you, congrats, you can no longer communicate with anyone in-game for days...
---
BFA is a worse version of Legion.

It‚Äôs sort of like movies. The blockbusters are all big pocket investments from big name studios and big name actors. Flashy, CGI, etc. People will go, laugh or cry a bit and enjoy their 2 hours.

Indy films are risky as hell, but are more ‚Äúart‚Äù. They‚Äôre trying to tell a story, and people pour their blood/sweat/tears into them. Most don‚Äôt get more than local exposure, but leave the audience feeling moved. 
---
Yea for sure. Thunderclap isn't used most pulls.
---
I don't understand how they're super good for PVE. I guess I should ask, super good compared to what?
---
Like the hunter trinket, you can use it to get an extra ability rotation every three minutes. That seems pretty weak in PVE but it can guarantee a kill in PVP.
---
This sub is super weird about downvotes, so I try to just ignore it. 
---
Oh man these comics I remember them

Cost is a big factor in why a guild would now use Discord. Not everyone wants to pay ~¬£25 per month for a 100+ slot server, when they can just use a Discord server and pay ¬£0.
---
Same man, I can‚Äôt believe I got to level 60 at 11 years old. My /played was 30 days. But you‚Äôre right it changed my social development in a crazy way, I remember always lying that I didn‚Äôt have a mic because I didn‚Äôt want my guild to find out I was a little boy lmao

No, my guild is middle of the pack.  No invis pots skips and they are just getting their sappers now .

Surprised no-one's suggested the integrated social chat/voice chat within the [b.net](https://b.net) launcher...

I think that's reddit in general. You can say the same thing one time and get -3, say it again and get +50
---
I did it without addons... no idea why you think its so difficult. 
---
Lucifron is a 30-40 seconds fight. 
---
I was 23 or 24.  One of my high school friends got me into it, and said "12 year olds hold this game together."  She was right.  I learned some 12 and 13 year olds were more reliable guildies than some adults.  Age doesn't mean much in Azeroth, as long as you're not an asshole.
---
But they didn't specify which PLANET'S summer. Mars' summer starts on Oct 8 2019, and doesn't end until April 8th 2020. Confirmed Classic is being pushed back!
---
/s
---
I've basically become set on making a gnome mage. It was either that or a warlock.
---
I'll have to make do with being a bit overpopped, but I've little concern with that. Mage just has a lot going for it in general. It's one of the core fundamentals of what cements that "Classic, Vanilla" nostalgia for me, even though I'd never been one.
---
&gt; It only became viable in s2/3 of TBC when they nerfed HARP spec and took AR off of Prep reset.  
---
HARP is also a hemo build.  It's literally the "H" with Adrenaline Rush and Prep, in that build name.  HARP was a pvp build, but with so many pve-useful points in combat, and in BC+, the difference wasn't as shocking as vanilla.  My post is about the pve portions of this.
---
I feel like I'm the only person from classic that didn't like ZG.  I hated running it.  Naxx was always my favorite raid.
---
The mechanics could have been added in 40 man. It split guilds and added in rep based gear rewards and awful bijou/coin system. 
---
Unpopular opinion:  I kind of hated ZG.  It was easily my least favorite raid in vanilla.
---
I read these all the time! Very nice. The one about the opening of as is good, has a nice screenshot too.
---
Yeah I asked the same question when a guild recruited me.  Apparently all the whippersnappers are using Discord.
---
he would be 86 now, probably dead rip
---
Tell me, before they invented sliced bread, what was the best thing before that?
---
I call BS.  No way anyone wasted _only_ 8 hours on the hand of Rag.
---
Wailing Caverns was my first ever dungeon, and the place where I learned what Polymorph was for. Before then, I thought it was some weird flavour spell that wasn't really any actual use, so I ran around sheeping critters for the fun of it. I think Crescent Staff from the quest was my first ever blue.
---
I'm sure many here have seen Ret raid metrics from private servers. They can raid. They take 100% dedication to min/maxing, buffs and consumables. 
---
There are videos of Paladins tanking certain raid bosses but this reliant on the mechanics being paladin friendly ... as with some fights needing to be Dire Bear friendly.
---
I'm with others here though, It would be funny to see a full raid of Paladins. Success would be highly situational and some fights couldn't be done, I am sure, merely do to group dynamic limitations.
---
5 man dungeons with paladin? Easy.
---
Your biggest hurdle is 40 paladins. I would extend your original RP idea to include all holy users and have a priest/paladin guild. These people would need to be dedicated enough to learn unique strats to accomplish raid bosses. I think MC and BWL would be possible, but would require a lot of fancy tactics.
---
What are your downsides??
---
1. No taunt. This means very good tanks who are on the same wavelength to swap threat from each other like limited inv. Potions and bubble to let 2nd threat overtake them.
---
2. No decurses. This is a spooky one because MC has a plentiful amount of nasty curses.
---
3. Min maxing. All your dps need to be on their A game because paladins naturally do lower dps.
---
What are your strengths?
---
1. Low healing threat 
---
2. Higher paladin tank threat, you have access to sanc. Aura from your rets to buff your tanks holy damage.
---
3. Access to unique debuff slots. (I'm sure there are some silly items out there that would benefit your raid greatly)
---
Calling it now, it will release November 23rd for the 15th anniversary.
---
You always lose a lot when you don't play Gnome. 
---
&gt; I've heard people say that battleshout only generates threat when your party members are going from the unbuffed state to the buffed state.
---
It's not true. I was the main threat magnet in nefarian phase 1 in my guild, and all I did for it was battleshout. And I didn't have points in defense for the +threat talent. Never played a private server, so I can't be getting confused on that front. 
---
Are you implying that you should pick a race you hate looking at because it has theoretically better racials? It IS a video game, and thus you should have fun and play what you like, right?
---
What information? I asked a question. I did not provide any info. 
---
Name the last time actiblizzard has released a date for launch and pushed it back?
---
I'm sure *some things* are wrong on private servers but it would take a lot more than slightly wrong armor values or threat ratios to actually change the meta considering how dominating Warriors are. I'm looking forward to changes to keep the theorycrafting fresh but I don't see Warriors falling from their pedestal.
---
I vaguely remember this differently. I remember in vanilla, items required 4 "tiers" to  disenchant (requires lvl 1,  75,  150, 225). Pservers may have gotten it wrong, or my memory is getting it wrong.  
---
You said there is a possiblity. Where and when was this possibility ever stated? 
---
AQ is so far beyond reach, should be looking at the immediate goal of "how do we clear MC"
---
Even if you never attempt to join organized raid schedules, you can eventually enter frequent pugs up to ZG. AQ and beyond would take more dedication, but D2 set is out around that time and you can supplement your gear with that or grind some pvp ranks too. 
---
I believe the hunter D2 set is a decent BM set. Mage of course can get you that AOE and dungeon grind coin.
---
I have heard ip addresses are easy to get from some of those voice chat options. If you plan on doing anything at the high end of gameplay, getting ddosed can be very costly.
---
I think all 3 classes would be insane in T3.
---
I wouldn't support them until classic is released.
---
It's really not, by technical definition strath is not a raid, it's an instance because you can reset it manually it's not on a weekly reset schedule. Also the deathcharger is so rare it basically doesn't exist. 
---
Yes. There will be more paladins and shamans on their appropriate sides than Druid per side. Druid collectively may outnumber either when considering both sides.
---
Per side, Druid is least represented ... nearly always, on every server, private or historical vanilla.
---
onyxia?
---
As a mage you can blink out of the cheap shot opener, and have high survivability against a rogue. A druid can theoretically get stun locked to death.
---
Furthest my hunter kited him to was feralis
---
You can use a resto pot and it be easily healed through as well.
---
No one even decurses in my guild for that fight. 
---
You could LOS curses with most of the raid, for example after bubble/cleansing potions are done offer a tank and healer as sacrifice to the 3rd wave of curses as everyone else outranges or hides from it. Then you can play an attrition game and extend the fight at least 3 more rounds of curses. I think we look at fights in such a linear way and a group of all paladins would need some unique strats to accomplish what for other raids is an easy boss.
---
Probably the most alt friendly thing in vanilla was dungeon boosting strats that let you level very fast with a lvl 60 helping.
---
No one has mentioned the real problem yet which is no tranq shot
---
For me, when it comes to Hunters and Paladins, Engineering is the ONLY option. I can debate between Alch and Eng for certain other classes at times.
---
Does anyone remember rpgworld and ohforf ucksake?
---
The only one I can think of from Blizzard is Starcraft Ghost, which they announced would be released in late 2003 but eventually the whole thing just got canned.
---
Before sliced bread... In the way back time. When we still frolicked through the fields and streams wild and, free. We ate our bread unleavened and flat as our earth. Really wish we knew about taco's back then.
---
Go to youtube and look up "Strat Live speed run"  
---
Fastest one I've seen is 10 minutes from gate to Bal.  
---
Switching stances does not incur a normal GCD so you should be able to do a thunder clap in the same time it would take you to use any other ability
---
That spot for me is reserved for AQ20. I've always loved the troll content, especially ZA in TBC.
---
Organized guilds on private servers gain control of nearly everything. They dominate the AH and control prices, they lead raid progression, they shut down any area of the open world on pvp servers at will, they dominate BGs, and they have in game political influence.
---
You sir, have no played private servers much have you?
---
Can't show off my armor as a gnome though :(
---
The damage debuff is a magic effect, so that wouldn't be a problem. But the curse increases the cost of all abilities by 100%. I'm sure at a certain level of gear 40 pallies would be able to do it with the curse up, but OP was asking about progressing as a full paladin raid.
---
If you are into RP then go for it.
---
I am not talking about that type of game play
---
Discord, Teamspeak and Mumble (in that order) are the 3 popular choices today.
---
Hey Fandabidozi_2203,
---
Thanks so much for the suggestion will put it on the list and try to find someone for that call or dog up some forum posts on it. Cheers.
---
It's like IRC with voice channels.
---
Zg from an art and lore perspective is great. It's a very immerse and cool instance. From a gameplay perspective? Oh god do I hate ZG. It was fun maybe the first 5 times but then you're forced to run it every reset (every 3 days or so) if you want your raid enchants (any good guild will make this a requirement). Not to mention even long after you've outgeared the place you still need to go there for the powerful raidwide buff granted by turning in hakkars head. once you reach this point good luck getting your ultra geared guildies to help you do it bc they can't be assed either. So you pug and then you have to deal with new players who might not know all the mechanics making the run take even longer and you know where I'm getting at.
---
In mumble/ts it's a serverside option that's disabled by default, in discord it's not possible.. Skype however you can get the IP of any user currently online.
---
ZG was the start of the decline. 90% of these "accomplishments" are filth
---
when you are fighting a boss that only takes 20-30 seconds like Lucifron, having that extra burst is going to be a huge dps increase for a hunter. its also basically free to swap around and use liberally since hunters can swap trinkets during fights so easily and often
---
My first real raid as a newly minted 60!! Ohhh I have some amazing memories about this place. I can‚Äôt wait to set foot in it again!
---
iirc you can trinket swap during/after feign death during raid encounters
---
Og furious makes this hilarious
---
See, personally I see it the other way around.
---
I see it as being incredibly alt-friendly. The fact that there aren't a bunch of catchup's added constantly means your alts progression isn't constantly being pushed back.
---
This is weird...
---
I assume an all druid guild would get further? Then it would mostly come down to the first boss that requires dispels?
---
It also depends on what tier you are running. If you are t2.5 geared and doing an MC farm raid, you can just have fury warriors tank the boss in which case Horde warriors will do a RIDICULOUS amount of damage.
---
On your first pulls of AQ40/Naxx bosses you are going to wish you were alliance for that sweet Salvation. Not to mention Onyxia and Nefarian with their fears (Fear Ward &gt;&gt;&gt; Tremor Totem)
---
&gt; " You can be a more-than-capable raider by being an alchemist and by always being prepared with your own consumables. "
---
That statement is absolutely true. But it has nothing to do with being an alchemist and everything to do with bringing consumables which doesn't require alchemy... it does however require engineering.
---
but... this is an effort to put things IN their hands.
---
&gt; No offense but if every raider had engineering, then who will make your pots for you?
---
There's 2 options and both will work.
---
Either you buy them on the auction house or you find someone who's an alchemist and get them to make them for you.
---
Alchemy and Engineering both make insane consumables, but only one of the professions is required to use them.
---
I was 11 when I first started playing, which was roughly 3-4 months before TBC came out. Didnt hit max level on a character until the ladt few months of TBC. 
---
&gt; armor is broken on that server.
---
You should know that the bug report that led to the armor reductions for bosses was based off very well sourced videos from original vanilla. It felt weird to me as well but I wouldn't be surprised at all if Classic ends up this way.
---
Remember that for a significant portion of original Vanilla, Warrior talents were dogshit for both Fury and Protection, so both tanks and DPS raided as Arms. The low armor values were probably required to make them even semi functional at that time.
---
Personally I wouldn't mind a non-"classic" change to balance out the power of the 1.12 warrior talent trees... Just buff all bosses armor to 6000.
---
&gt; I hate bothering other people for them.
---
If that's the main reason behind the switch, there is an argument to be made for simply just buying the charges of the auction house.
---
&gt; ^^ I think more people will agree with that statement than yours, which was " Everyone who plans on raiding should have engineering".
---
I agree with it. I'm a healer, so DPS from sappers is pretty dumb for me to even consider.
---
I miss vent. Discord is just so buggy. Audio always cutting out or glitching. And no it's not my connection.
---
That's nice. But I don't believe you. I'm not saying it couldn't be done, I'm just saying I doubt your claims.
---
Maybe you healed 5 mans without addons and people told you that you were a great healer. Maybe you were a holy paladin who had one job to spam FoL on the tank and therefore consider all healing is the same. Maybe you "raided" solely in LFR and consider that the same as a raid healer pushing current 25 man content.
---
But you most certainly did not do progression raid healing with a competent group sans addons. Because others would have to pick up your slack and any decent raiding guild would boot you for someone else.
---
MC could probably be done, the true test would be BWL. 100% no way you could beat AQ or naxx.
---
they deleted my comment where i posted the guild raid information.
---
this sub has a dumb rule to delete anything that mentions a private server
---
Was a pleasure being on Josh!
---
Yeah but if you do all that stuff but you aren't Orc/Human you will still get outDPSed by someone else who is
---
You can't play the attrition game when the tank goes OOM. Also assuming you can somehow beat lucifron, the next boss requires tranq shot, so that's another cock block for the pally raid
---
On Nost core I could pull threat on just about anything with a few lucky windfury hits. Razorgore add spawns, you need to start dpsing it quickly. Well, you got a windfury proc, now you're taking 2000 dmg melees to the face. Hope your tank has taunt up cuz he's not sundering that off before you die.
---
Welcome back anytime!
---
facing a raid boss and getting crushed is unnecessary and easily avoidable. Most gear that has the defense to push you towards cap also has other stats that are helpful for tanking. Losing some stamina etc for defense cap makes up for it in spades when you don't get crushed.
---
Mc couldn't be done. First boss requires decurse, and the next requires tranq shot
---
ZG was great. I had three raiding toons when it released. I lead SOOOO many raids in there on the different toons.
---
You are wrong. No tank in any legitimate progression guild goes for Defense Cap. No other way to say it..
---
19 and I'm 33 now.
---
Well, to be fair they never clarified north or Southern Hemisphere.. it‚Äôs probably their delay back up plan XD
---
So pretty much the entirety of MC, and since you can't get through MC you can never get gear to do later raids, so pretty much the entirety of raiding.
---
Yeah, for sure. If you have to rely on that though it‚Äôs a long wait between cooldowns in strat live :P
---
You're expected to dump most of your time into your main character. The game is designed to reward sticking to a single character, or rather you won't really have time to keep up with several characters.. maybe 3 if you're really living for the game, but not 11 like retail.
---
Cleanse should get rid of the fears.
---
Sorry been a long time since I played.  What is the optimal strategy for fighting a rogue? As I recall, you want to tank out the cheap shot, so you can blink the kidney shot, then ice block the blind. Am I way off base here?
---
Lucifron dies in literally 2 minutes with 1.12 talents. Bring potions and you should be ok. Most of a paladins damage is from autos so damage wouldn't be an issue it would come down to killing the boss before the healers go oom. I think it's possible especially with some decent gear ret can do respectable damage in MC they just fall off in bwl/AQ. I'll admit magmadar would be quite tricky but maybe with some healer coordination you could heal through the enrage. You would need some pretty sick gear tho.
---
Perfectly acceptable clear time. Back in the day it was much, much slower. Not everyone likes being a tryhard. 
---
Youre telling me that tanks are just taking crushing blows they don't have to? Thats funny.
---
Oh boy Zul'Gurub was crazy for Hunters beyond that disgustingly good Zin'Rokh greatsword. You had the infamous 1.0 attack speed bats, the color-changing-on-resummon Son of Hakkar wind serpent, then a treasure trove of other level 60 pets to tame with no need to level up besides Loyalty.
---
Link me the LegacyPlayers armory of a tank in top 5 clears that uses Defense Cap. 
---
What do you think is the best class for herbalism pvp? I made my alt a Rogue with mining/herb because then I can at least pick my fights and vanish if  things go bad, but I think Mage might be better with polymorph for instant win?
---
I never did ZG much at all in vanilla. Definitely looking forward to getting in there this time around!
---
Yup that is correct - Hemo Adrenaline Rush Prep and it would use a bunch of pve talents like having 2 imp sprints and such, glorious times lol also had the mace stun talent which was on a separate DR from other stuns at first LOL and ghostly strike for a 2nd mini evasion 0/31/30
---
just realized you guys are talking about pve though and you are correct hemo was never viable there at all most people would have variations of 41+ points in combat, either daggers or swords, not maces, and never having hemo
---
Zul'Gurub... picture of Zul'jin, an Amani troll. Yep, checks out.
---
the OG Rakhastan island
---
method uses teamspeak for their WF progression as discord is pretty unstable
---
But then you find that lucky black lotus and make two hours worth of running Mara/diremaul in 3 seconds.
---
Orc shaman duo lvl w/ my tauren warrior friend
---
Play a 19 troll priest wand twink in spare time
---
When gf plays, duo-lvl with her as druid
---
RIP
---
8 hours? Let me tell you son.. Nah you wouldn't believe it anyway.
---
Nowhere, as far as I know. Why? 
---
I can understand why you think that but it‚Äôs not. 12 is later than 9. I agree the formatting is weird but you can check the patch note order here: 
---
https://wowwiki.fandom.com/wiki/Patches/1.x
---
Wait for classic.  Legion sucked, BFA is more legion.  Blizzard hasn't had a decent class design since MOP. 
---
I'm doing the same quite. Priest as always but gonna do shaman duo-lvl w/ my warrior pal, that will be fun.  
---
Off time I will PvP @ 19 &amp; 29 w/ a troll priest, wand thinking @ 19. Can't wait to PvP with priest.
---
Discord is slow, buggy, has that ugly web 2.0 look and the dev's terrible sense of humor all over it, it tries to integrate with everything on your computer and chugs resources in the background. Vent is simple and beautiful, little lightweight window with perfect functionality. But yes, for over 10 people or whatever the limit is on vent servers, the free option is going to be used. 
---
Looks like the guy who posted the video streams these days. We should ask him. 
---
For crafting professions you don't have to follow the standard profession leveling guide. Those guides seek to minimize how many resources you  have to gather in order to 300 skill level; they don't consider the sellability or utility of what you produce. For example with Tailoring you can get skill points from crafting Shadow Weave and wear it or sell it -- you have to get the shadow silk somehow.
---
I think it is your memory but of course I can't say for certain because mine might be bad too since it's been 1.5 DECADES haha we are old :(
---
Here are facts I know:
---
-on private servers there is no brackets you can DE anything bc I have just done this recently
---
-on live, my priest was a mess and i never did his professions well. I distinctly remember going into TBC with 2 professions on my priest.. 300 skinning and ~15 enchanting lol. Never had a proper 2nd profession and I only skinner as a priest. Made no sense but i had finkles and would skin the corehounds
---
+++ not a fact but my theory.. adding level brackets.. that kind of change would be something you do to patch things up and fix a broken accident. I dont know why they would ever go from yes having a system to then removing the requirement.. which leads me to believe that's more evidence pservers have it correct.
---
Also there IS a level cap in terms of what you get from disenchanting.. like greens that are 55+ give different chances at loot from 51+ and 41+ etc. You can use the mod "enchantrix" to find these brackets in a tooltip mouseover view 
---
Ahm i hate to tell you but this is true for 99% of products. Including it in the retail subscription doesn't change anything.
---
Legit question, are the pets any good? The cooldowns on those are so long that I never gave those a second glance, and have no private server experience to tell me otherwise.
---
Na I get bored after running the same raid like 5 times. Doing MC literally forever is such a chore and it inevitably burns me out from the game. Then I take a break and come back on a new character/role. It helps alleviate the issue but not really. What really excites me is the progression raids. The first BWL clear is always great. This is why 2 years of icc was sooo miserable for me. There needs to always be a new raid looming in the horizon that you're grinding gear and consumables for otherwise the game feels really stagnant. This is why classic needs to have an optional tbc or do seasons like Diablo (or both) and why it's so important for them to get the content release cycle correct and not skimp on stages.
---
Go dual-gathering and once you hit 60, then drop one and get a gathering.
---
&gt;And no it's not my connection.
---
It is though. Discord works perfectly fine for me and everyone I've ever used it with. 
---
Why is that sad? Discord is objectively superior to Vent in nearly every way.
---
Shamans are one of the easier to get to 20. They barely require gear (just buy a vendor white weapon if you haven't found better before 10. Staff will maximize your dps. Shield makes little to no difference at this level). Sadly shamans have a slower period between 25-40 decreasing over time unless you really keep your gear up. 40+ gets better but puts them about the middle of the pack for leveling efficiency.
---
Don't waste time on quests that reward less xp than killing. Typically EVERY class to 10 is about killing everything in site and quests only done if they chain to important ones later or are fast quest. Many in noob zone just start killing, do quests that align well with this, but chain killing easier mobs will likely get you your 6 slot bag and get you out of a packed noob zone faster. 
---
Grab those quests though if you are in a lightly populated noob zone.
---
An all druid guild could go quite far i guess. MC at least shouldn't be that difficult. I don't see how they could go past chrommagus tho and even if they did, then there is nefarian and his class call which would wipe it in no time.
---
That does nothing to discuss the effectiveness of the crafting profession while leveling.  The picture at 60 is largely irrelevant to this post.
---
well I never played on a private server, and I don't really plan on controlling people.  I just want to hold the server to be high pop.  I guessed that all the zones in WoW could handle 6000 players playing at different times a week.  Some people would have no life, others would only play a couple hours a day.  I figure 2,000 players would make a big impact on the health of a server.  Healthy server, a better place to play with your friends.  The more of your friends who will want to play longer.
---
You can blink the cheap shot if you do it right away and just keep distance for 15 (or 13.5 if you have 3set rank 13 or 4 set r10 gear).
---
The real question is whether or not to iceblock the initial sap that a lot of rogues will use to stack combo points- this will open you up to a blind so you do need to skull right away but if you use it to aoe the rogue while using skull it can net you the duel in that 10 seconds alone- plus you can coldsnap the second block during the skull's 10 second timer while using it for two novas, two cone of cold, and two barriers.
---
Even still, those guides pretty much work even if you're using it for gear or money while leveling the profession.  If you have 10 points to go before you're done with wool and onto silk, and you can get it with 10 items that are easy to craft or 50 items that are high profit, you run into the issue that 1) you make 50 and that lowers the value of the item, and 2) you needed 5x the amount of wool in order to move onto silk, and held yourself back.
---
Typically I'll make what I want to wear, and I'll try to pick the best-selling items, but I also want to get leveled up so I don't leave the profession behind.
---
Uh... if this isn't some meme, 9 is less than 12
---
Enrage timer aren't tight at all in vanilla, for example patchwerk only need 9500 raid dps. Even with only 25 dps, that's only 380 dps. A good ret in pre bis can do that even on non undead target.
---
There's not really crazy aoe healing like on retail so you won't get that satisfying moment where your screen is filled with green numbers anyway.
---
not for content on farm.  i really cant figure out how it will take 3.5 hours to do these raids with no wipes.
---
i am not talking about try hard guilds. bwl should take about an hour for a non try hard guild farming bwl with no wipes
---
Awesome thanks for the reply!
---
Why release early? Are yiu on a timrtable to get these out before classic drops?
---
Filthy Wrath baby here. I started playing at 23, after I made new friends who all played. 
---
Can honestly say it completely changed my life.
---
Divine Intervention and end it all right now.  
---
15 or 16, started playing in patch 5.4.8 :(
---
Stealth of course. 
---
I would steal shit. Scare people. Spy on women. 
---
Dude, I loved that HARP build so hard in BC.  Even in LK, one of my specs was SHARP, where I kept going down combat to get that anti-melee trick.  Obviously not in raids though.  
---
HAT is what ultimately made subtlety viable in pve.  By delivering free combo points directly, the core issue where subt could not be given the same dps as the other specs as it would cause issues in pvp was finally resolved.  
---
In vanilla, you have like two or three combat specs that are viable, and one assassination spec for seal fate.  For raids- in pvp you have even more choices, depending on what you are trying to do.
---
Warrior fear isn't magic-based, and I'm pretty sure practically every boss fear isn't either.
---
&gt; I didn‚Äôt want my guild to find out I was a little boy lmao
---
For some reason I laughed out loud reading this sentence.  
---
if reagents are allowed, Portal: Stormwind (y'all can come, too)
---
if not, arcane intellect, hopefully with super smarts I can figure out something to do with half an hour of super smarts
---
hey grandpa
---
You can't.  But if there's 39 other Paladins (and it's cleansable)...
---
Warlock fear is magic, or at least it is in later expansions.  You're probably right though about most bosses.  Otherwise Dwarf Priests wouldn't be as good as they are.
---
Play classic then return to wow when 9.0 drops.
---
The 'nearly' every way is important. Sound quality was better on Ventrilo compared to Discord the last time I tried it and you actually have control over your community/server outside of Discord. It wasn't that long ago the entire FFXIV community lost their subreddit Discord server because of a lewd lalafel picture that got posted.  
---
The fact you can't host your own Discord servers is a bit of a dealbreaker especially when they don't offer E2EE or anything similar.
---
Do you have pserver exp? How prevalent will shamans be? How often do raids actually get 5-8 shamans?   
---
In that same regard what about horde priests?  
---
As you can tell I'm torn between the torn and have found every reason against the one another
---
The ignore option is enough. GMs can handle bans. Never give the player base these options it will only be abused and exploited.
---
I'd want battle rez so I can bring you back to make you suffer all over again.
---
What region would you be in? I wanted to do something like this myself as well, though my head-mutterings included Priests (holy or disc).
---
Idea spawned from a combination of the Scarlet Monestary/Crusade, and the Kingdom of Heaven film. Taking the.. fanaticism of the Knights Templar portrayed in the film ("There must be war. God wills it!"), farming the Monestary for tabards (and armor for RP events), and playing either as an extension of the Scarlet Crusade or forming a new idea around a militant order similar to those popping up in medieval Europe (Templars, Teutonic Order, etc).
---
Not completely true, i just leveled tailoring to 300 EARNING money from doing it. How u may ask? I just make stuff that sells. Every time i can make bags for skill up i do (10-1g for free each time) when i get  250 i get the gadgetzan 20 slot soul pack for warlocks (sells for 2-5g more then cost) i make all type of speel/frost gear. 
---
Guides only consider "what is cheapest way to skill up fast with the least cloth"
---
but chain heal.... its something!!!! haha =)
---
Portal to Stormwind
---
Are you trolling? Thats the person humping the duelers nonstop. Literally harrassing people hosting an event.
---
Dang, I hadn't thought about that at all. I like the idea though, full Scarlet Crusade based gear and guild name would actually be a blast. I'm in the NA region and was probably going to aim for an RP-PvP server provided there is one for Classic.
---
14 and 29 now. Started playing as soon as WOW went live on Magtheridon NA.
---
Always loved ZG/AQ20/UBRS10, it's still Vanilla raiding, but gave everyone a chance to shine a little brighter than in a mass of 40 people, as cool as 40 mans also are.
---
You didn't love having half your guild sit while you try and kill bosses to get items you can't use until you come in after the raid, sneak by half the trash, and have a mage aoe farm crocs for you? 
---
Wow. I was 15 years old and I couldn't get past mid level 30s. I just kept getting bored and rolling alts. I didnt run dungeons or quest much. I didnt max a character until BC. Man I was terrible Haha. 
---
Rob bank. Bubble hearth. 
---
You would never be able to stop crouching or walk at a normal pace for the rest of your life then.
---
I have literally never had a problem like that with discord, and I've been using it for years.
---
Stealth is faster than walking speed. 
---
I do think tailoring is maybe a Tier 1.5.  Especially since it doesn't require a gathering component.
---
The server I'm on, bags don't go for nearly that.  6-slotters barely make their cost, 8-slotters maybe a few silver over vendor value (and you'd be better off selling the wool).  Higher level bags make a marginal profit over simply selling the cloth.
---
Hellfire so I could kill myself
---
When leveling you earn more cloth than it takes to level tailoring using the guide. I've consistently leveled tailoring alongside first aid and still had cloth left over.
---
I don't understand how it lowers the price of an item if I myself have 50 of them. I'm not going to undercut myself on the AH.
---
You make too much sense for the internet.
---
As soon as he takes damage it would all be over too. RIP.
---
no death coil
---
The people in this subreddit though are the hardcore people who are going to minmax the hell out of everything. Hunters are extremely popular with people who dont read forums and only play casually.
---
Well, tbh only 10/12 slot u really earn money from, didn't really talk about 6/8 :D
---
ZG, AQ and world dragons were so much fun.
---
&gt; Can't think of any advantage Vent has over Discord.   
---
1)- All of Ventrilo doesn't go down on the regular  
---
2)- Way less centralized spying concerns.  Ventrilo doesn't scan your drive for installed games and programs and upload that, nor scan your process list and upload that.  
---
3)- Understandable business model that isn't just waiting to bite you.  
---
4)- Solid customization available in ventrilo.

Mumble has even less privacy issues because you can actually run your own damned server.  
---
Obviously, Discord brings way lots of other things to the table- I'm just telling you some advantages that other things have over it.
---
In retail. Not in Classic. 
---
Actually yes, for example the Battle Chicken provides a small amount of DPS, but has a "battle shout" ability that grants your entire group +5% attack speed, which is honestly insane.
---
Summon succubus
---
Would be nice to have an official date to be fair, we already knew this really.
---
Hell yeah haha. Thanks for the info, I will have to save this post for later if I ever get into WOTLK. That was actually when I quit but I would definitely give it another go once we progress there through classic and tbc on official servers that we know are stable.
---
Ventrilo, Mumble, and Teamspeak don't upload your process list and various details about your installed programs to some giant centralized place.  Hell, Mumble you can run your own.
---
In wpvp/duels, I'd agree. Not in BGs.

&gt; It wasn't that long ago the entire FFXIV community lost their subreddit Discord server because of a lewd lalafel picture that got posted.

I mean, I know this is a serious issue about censorship, ownership, and privacy, but like.... *lol*
---
Why should it be reportable for going to an event and not following their rules? They are an equal player. You should not be able to report someone for going to someone else‚Äôs event in an MMO and playing the game the way they want that they pay for.
---
That 2 minute kill time is with normal DPS classes and decurses. I don't think you're going to get a 2 minute kill with only Ret as DPS and no decurses. With the double mana cost on all the rets, they won't be able to seal or judge very much at all.
---
It's very alt friendly because people are always running mc/bwl/zg/ony weekly.  People will always do reserve runs for thunderfury and ony for bags /class quests.  The best part about vanilla is people needing items from every raid until naxx.

Damn, 8hrs for Sulfuras - not bad. I guess someone had a buttload of Gold or the Guildbank helped out :p
---
You can talk down to me all you like but that doesn't make your reading comprehension skills and better.
---
OPs primary focus isn't to make some awesome imaginary guild (sure he plugs a hopeful tidbit at the bottom), it's to make a bubble to control faction balance and server population.  He doesn't have the power to make people choose specific factions or force them to play to keep population up or faction balance equal.  It's a pipe dream to recruit a whole servers worth of players that share your single niche idea.
---
In Classic too. It‚Äôs faster than walking but slower than running.

I got bored and started playing BFA around Christmas. I‚Äôve been having fun with it. The game is a lot different than classic. So it‚Äôs kind of a different experience. Everything is pretty casual now which is cool cuz you can see all the content and not have to devote all your time. 
---
This is an amazing question. I'd honestly have to take Teleport: Moonglade and if that doesn't work I'd take Devotion Aura.
---
I know where this is going.. HEHEHEhehehe...

Hope you feel better soon dude!
---
I think the US-West timezone servers will have the highest likelihood of accommodating West coast raid times.
---
I think stealth would be the most useful, but lets be honest, polymorph would be absolutely hilarious!
---
NA here as well. I'd be intrigued by this. I'll be starting with the warrior as the main, but I'll definitely be playing some alts.
---
I actually had a group of 4 paladins and 1 priest healer in SM once. It's where the idea spawned off of, along with the film as I mentioned. It was a random group that formed and just happened to have that composition, doing Cath. We had just entered the courtyard, and I forget how the first adds were pulled (someone got feared? Lost control of a running mob?). But then more mobs started running, and more adds got pulled. Before we knew it, we had probably 60-75% of the courtyard mobs on our group all at once. The healer ran out of mana, so one of us paladins stepped back and healed a bit. He ran out, so another took a rotation.. and so on. We cleared it, no one died, and it took F-O-R-E-V-E-R. But it was some of the most fun I had in that dungeon, and that's one of my favorite dungeons. We were all laughing pretty hard.
---
Anyway, got me thinking about all- or mostly-paladin groups. No idea how viable such a thing would be, but I thought adding in an RP element to it would be fun.
---
It was actually the only reason I had been looking forward to the transmog system when they first announced it, as it wasn't then known that you couldn't transmog different armor types. This meant that one couldn't put on plate gear and transmog it to appear like the mail-type Scarlet armor. So it would be an RP novelty only. 
---
(Although in Star Wars Galaxies, I had been known to run around PvP'ing in full stormtrooper armor even though it only offered 30% resists before the CU. Armor be damned, I must look SEXY to my enemy!)
---
Why I added the edit, pre merger blizzard did it often (even as late as BC) since then they haven‚Äôt done it once.
---
No, but in order to free up bag space you might lower the price.
---
You don‚Äôt even need taunt if the 39 other paladins bubble on command 
---
WoW Vanilla dropped when I was a sophomore (19) in college. My grades tanked! Worth it though. I didn't enjoy my major and it led me to a career I enjoy today. 
---
Life grip and a trip to the grand canyon.
---
Same here - it's really weird to think that I've been playing WoW for over half my life...
---
I was thinking of the default moving forward as walking not running. If your talking about the keybind that makes you walk then at max rank then yes I think Stealth might be slightly faster. 
---
Damn that just killed the hype a bit for me.
---
It's better in bgs too. 
---
Orc stun resist is OP.  Much better than any gnomish racial

Are you retarded? He's intentionally griefing it. I would assume your biggest dream of classic is grabbing the flag in a 9 man premade and refusing to cap it. Maybe play a mage and sheep mobs your faction is trying to kill?
---
The battle rez was banned from this discussion.
---
Yeah I don't know why, but this bothers me unreasonably much as well. ZG has so many iconic characters on it's own, no need for this cross-over :|
---
To distract a guard while he robs a bank?
---
Not a spell but, if i can use item then... Piccolo of the Flaming Fire, probably somewhere on the busiest subway station in morning rush hour
---
My point is that is not what should be reportable. This is. It a snag this is a community event it‚Äôs totally different. Just throw the guy on ignore and avoid him don‚Äôt even give him attention. Abusing right click report for someone playing an MMO in a way you disagree with is what will hurt classic. 
---
This is from "classic wow universe", not just "classic wow class abilities"?
---
Open Dark Portal.
---
&gt; I don't think people should put too much weight on these words. I highly doubt that a german CM has much knowledge about the actual timeline that's been going on
---
Jesus Christ really? So they confirm it, but leave out the season, and its panic. They confirm it and include the season and its... Panic anyway because what to THEY know? I love this fucking subreddit.
---
Literally, with a dragon breath wand and a set of dots you are done. You have to fight a fear and a bubble plus instant hot and a few other factors.
---
When i played spriest i had the most trouble with well geared warriors, their burst damage was fucking nuts.
---
Maybe rain of fire, but on such a large scale that it would convince an entire world that the apocalypse was here.

So where do we go from here now that we cannot freak out about the release date? Return to the old reliables of "Full game Sharding" and the new hotness that is "Spell batching"?
---
I can't remember if i started playing in 2004 or 2005 but i was around 7-8 and i barely knew any English either.
---
I mostly guessed my way through the game. I usually ended up doing like 1/10 of all the quests and just farmed mobs or explored.  I also really liked the satisfaction leveling up so i just  created new characters all the time since it begun to slow down past 10-15.

Zul‚Äôjin was also a very cool bossfight though :)
---
In real life you‚Äôre always walking and hardly ever running. 
---
Very not.  
---
me too damm
---
I was talking more of an "in-game" type of context.
---
I thought I had it rough in the 21-25 section.
---
Yeah, its wild. I saw a post on the WoW subreddit of a guy who was holding his copy of BC and he looks maybe 9 years old. This was a LOT of peoples first MMORPG for sure.
---
I was 22 when it launched.
---
Yeah it was pretty funny in a "this is ridiculous" kind of way when it happened but it did highlight how negative it is building communities on a platform you don't have real control over.
---
Good read!
---
Then you realize hearth counts as a spell and you already chose to learn Bubble. Now you're just standing there with a bag full of cash and a dumb look on your face as the bubble dissipates.  
---
You're going on that kodo repgrind huh?
---
But what counts as damage? I can't think of the last time I sustained damage in real life.  
---
If I go out in a snow storm, is stealth over for me?  
---
In all pservers, seal of wrynn is green and crap.
---
It was later they changed it to blue.
---
Could your data indicating when it was changed be wrong? 
---
Good god. Devotion Aura? Why did you choose that?  
---
Like true pally with a hearth on CD. Then say Lol jk. 
---
I love this idea. I hope you guys get far!
---
Imagine a Raid full of decked Fury warriors. Just trying to rush bosses down before they all die.
---
it's a crossover that comes naturally to those whose first encounter with Zul'Gurub was in Cataclysm, when it came "packaged" with Zul'Aman as a new dungeon tier.
---
Gnome Warlock is the best warlock for killing horde.
---
Strat was raided at the beginning of vanilla.  And most of the level 60 five mans too. Therefore  the ZG drops weren‚Äôt technically ‚Äúfirst‚Äù.
---
&gt; Ofcourse you can realistically assume this. Tanks should always get priority on anything that can help the raids as they are by far the most important player to give gear to. Especially such key pieces as Accuria.
---
I agree completely with the philosophy. Though, I have a hard time seeing that happening without creating a riot x lynch mob.
---
Good Old Zul'jin from Zul'Gurub :)
---
I may use my vacation early this year.
---
I thought of it too, it's something that you only cast once to get a permanent bonus.
---
&gt;and have a mage aoe farm crocs for you?
---
??? At what point do you ened mages to clear crocs for what?
---
&gt;So pretty much the entirety of MC, and since you can't get through MC you can never get gear to do later raids, so pretty much the entirety of raiding.
---
This is assuming a linear progression, which isn't part of the prompt
---
Oh man I haven't thought of of keydar in years! Time for a binge. 
---
I imagine there would be all kinds of uses.
---
Everything yes. Skill requirement to DE high lvl items was added in TBC.
---
It's TBC what you are talking about.
---
This is actually a great vid, I was just thinking I couldnt remember much about ZG.
---
There are videos of it from vanilla. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mtdik-lF1ik
---
haha yeah, I get into the same argument with a friend regularly when we talk about optimal speccs. He always says "yeah, but if the player sucks he will still do shit damage". It drives me mad  &gt;.&lt;
---
As a fellow video making enthusiast, earlier is better 
---
Nah man, it's going to be November 22nd because classics go first haha.
---
You‚Äôre both kinda right and I‚Äôm not sure which side I agree with more. 
---
tipsout never played vanilla, just private servers so I'm not surprised tbh
---
This is probably how I feel about *any* club.
---
I much prefer to go to any place where the music isn't obnoxiously loud, where you can sit down and talk shit with friends.
---
The problem with leveling crafting on a fresh start is that you're absolutely not going to be able to craft the best items for your current level, because those items generally require drops from mobs 5-10 levels higher than you and the AH isn't going to be flooded from people leveling through 60 yet.  Example is spider silk boots.  Wearable at level 20, but requires silk cloth, iridescent pearls, and spider's silk.  If you're alliance, you can farm level 20 spiders and merlocks, but if you're horde side you're pretty shit outta luck because the zones where you find those mobs are going to be flooded with fresh alliance players.  And then you need the silk, which you absolutely will not be able to find at level 20.  
---
It's a complaint I've always sorta had with WoW's crafting system; crafting anything useful for leveling all but requires you to have a high level main able to feed you mats.
---
Any suggestions for professions?
---
Would it make sense to level as Herb/Alch, then drop Alch for Tailoring at 60, to create (pre-raid) BiS items?
---
We can disagree.
---
Male troll rogue, and I'll fight anyone who shames me for not picking orc/UD
---
Ugh I fucking hate that place. We go through MC or BWL and then we have a ZG after. Problem is that everyone focuses hard on the 40-man and treat ZG like boosting your friends through Deadmines. So we wipe, and wipe, and wipe and people won't focus, the berserker trolls comes out of nowhere, the nolife GM warrior gets MC'd by the piles and one-shots the priest.. best strategy for ZG is being an officer with tailoring and alchemy so that you get all the coins and bijous for crafting bloodvine and pots to the raid. Then you get enough idols for every enchant you'll ever need and never step inside that dreadful trolly raid ever again. 
---
From your experience as a Warlock, do you do more do than Mages in Naxxaramus? Also do you think Warlocks are more impactful in group PVP?
---
Good shit I was scared.
---
I was in this boat. Was scared itd be like fall/winter '19.
---
Aspect of the Cheetah, walking speed stays the same but you run 30% faster, and I'm not getting hit IRL often.
---
The only ridiculous and laughable thing is how there have been zero news and updates regarding Classic when there's only a few months left before the supposed launch.
---
Yeah, mage is the go to 1v1 class and is better than any other class. Even rogues struggle when all cooldowns are on the table and the mage is PvP frost specced. 
---
And youre right that the mage can sheep half the classes for easy pickings. 
---
However rogue can be really fun too like this one: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzHiL5qFPA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EtzHiL5qFPA)
---
Why don't you want to record ignite damage?
---
I still read the weekly comic, but more often than not I don't get it at all.
---
Should really re-read again.
---
Same with The Flaming Ruby comic. Unsure if it is actually still out there. 
---
Then stfu and stop spreading misinformation.
---
Depends on your goal. If your goal is to be raiding top end content or grinding high end PvP rewards, then an alt is unrealistic. If you just want to experience the content from a different point of view, and making your main the best X on the server doesn't really matter to you, then do whatever you want.
---
Vanilla rewards time investment in a way retail does not. It is honestly disgusting just how much time it takes to accomplish things.  
---
The only 'meta' reasons to level alts would be either a mage to AoE farm for gold, or making level 35 alts to transmute arcanite bars. Takes a LONG time before either of those pay off.
---
Right haha. Its wild.
---
Its like.. "Car A is faster than Car B"
---
Friend: "yeah well.. if Car B keeps it in third gear and keeps the brake held down halfway the whole time then Car B will still be faster"
---
.....................lol ok
---
I think I was 12.. it was nearing the end of wrath.. I dont remember too much about the old world. So I cant wait for classic.
---
I like your way of thinking. 
---
I'm glad I get to live in a time period where the Germans are the good guys
---
I wonder if we could have gotten CM's to confirm more important things, but we wasted these two attempts on literally reconfirming what we already knew...
---
I don't want everyone to go to the faction.  I am giving people the option to choose amungst their friends to what faction they want.  I talked my friends into the faction I want.  If my group seems to have a majority to join one faction I will recruit for more of the other faction.  If the balance is way off then I will try to predict server balance before launch to find a server that will balance us.  I have not yet asked people to choose their faction yet, but when the time gets close I will have to ask people to.  I did a few polls a wile back asking what type of servers people will choose for classic if only their choice mattered.  Most people are hoping to find old friends.  So population balances in classic should be near what they will be when classic launches.  If my groups size never hits past 1,500 then I am not going to worry about it.  My biggest worry for the group is picking a server and walking the group into a terrible faction balance.  I am keeping a close eye on this.
---
Track humanoids would be pretty nice, always know the names and locations of anyone nearby.
---
No. That's the same as responding after their previous pull, which dps 2 does.
---
I've leveled crafting on a lot of toons over the years, and I've never had trouble keeping up.
---
Maybe making the blues is hard and I'll agree with you there.  But especially with Leatherworking, and to a lesser extent tailoring and BS, I've always stayed caught up or even ahead.
---
On my hunter, I got to a few points with LW where I either:
---
*Couldn't level because I was too low level to upgrade past 150 or 225
---
*Was making gear that was 9 levels too high for me
---
I'll be 23... when I start this summer haha. I'm ready to invest hours upon hours of my life.
---
Nefarian class call is only 100yrds theoretically you could split the raid in half. 20 people jerk off in a corner as cats until it's their turn to take the boss back
---
Close, but your order of operations is out of whack.
---
How it really goes is:
---
"Sweet, the eye dropped! Who's gonna spend 6 months worth of dkp on it?"
---
Followed by..
---
"Sweet, I won the eye! Now I need to beg borrow and steal more gold than I'll ever be able to repay in the years I'll play this game in order to afford the mats needed to make it"
---
Conjure food. I'm hungry
---
Stealth is a pretty poor choice, you couldn't eat or drink without breaking it.
---
Wasn't that talented though? 
---
That‚Äôs a good thing. I don‚Äôt want to be in stealth forever.  
---
Whoever has ignite has the bar none highest dps in the raid, mages tend to be slightly ahead overall but its not by much.
---
For group pvp I suppose the question is premade or not? In random BG's I would say it can go either way, if your good at using trinkets and CD's and getting a flag out of the flag room as a mage, however locks have a much better CC for random bgs, poly gets interupted by everything because people just have to shoot at sheep for some reason.
---
In premades mages for sure, you want like 3 on your team as opposed to only 1 lock.
---
Haha yeah I never did this personally, but I remembered it from playing and it made me rage every time. Very inconsiderate thing to do. 
---
skinning/leatherworking I would say is an exception.  Level up in the barrens and you'll have all the leather you need, and leatherworking has the advantage that you can upgrade your materials, i.e. light crafted to medium leather.  BS I haven't tried fresh in a while, but tailoring absolutely puts you behind.  I'm level 25 on a pserver atm, and crafting anything my level in tailoring requires silk cloth, which nothing in that range drops.  
---
I'll probably end up going tailoring again on my lock from the start in classic, but I really think there's a lot of merit to running two gathering specs and either banking mats on an alt or selling them on the AH, especially on a fresh start when people are going to be wanting those mats.
---
I'm not even sure what you're trying to argue here. But every time you swing, the game rolls a d% against a table. The table is modified based on your chance to hit, crit, weapon skill, etc.
---
So the table will be something like:
---
1-7: Dodge
---
8-14:Miss
---
15-24:Glance
---
25-35:Crit
---
35-Whatever:Hit
---
So, what hit rating does is actually decrease your chance to miss, which causes more spots on the table to fill up with hit. Crit chance causes the crit section to get bigger, pushing hit off the table again. So, yes, theoretically you can't have 100% crit chance even if you had gear that gave you that much crit chance because skill doesn't actually decrease the chance to glance. But realistically, you're not going to get 100% crit anyway. So effectively, it's about the same to say that you're turning glancing to hit if you are skill capped because rolling in the glancing range will still result in the same amount of damage as rolling in the hit range.
---
Too true üòÇ
---
Did you know that you create many level 1 alts to hold non-BOP items for you? It takes about 5 minutes to run a level 1 to a major city to access the mailbox and the bank. Hell, the alt doesn't even have to put the stuff in the bank. You can store it in the mail system. Mail stuff to your alt, never take it out of the mailbox. When you need it, push the "Return" button. It's free.
---
Storage for items you don't need to accessin the field is nigh infinite.
---
I don't think you could steal things either, opening chests/containers breaks stealth as well. Pickpocket allows you to but that's another spell. 
---
Let's be fair. He never hit 60 in Vanilla. 
---
Still, all his "Vanilla" end game experience is from private servers which have little to nothing to do with Vanilla even if some were pretty good.
---
Shield Slam is 8 more rage than Sunder. If your DPS is going so hard off of the first global cooldown on the boss that you literally drop aggro and wipe if you miss Shield Slam, then you would *also* wipe if you miss the first Sunder.
---
Actually, you would always wipe spamming Sunder, because it provides low threat per second and threat per rage.
---
Your argument is that on specific boss pulls on progression gearing levels where you can't get enough rage, but farming trigger happy DPS who don't wait even one global cooldown to begin max DPS, but somehow have bad gear and tolerate having an incompetent MT who doesn't use high threat abilities, and you calculate you can get exactly 24 rage, but have no way of getting 32 rage, yes, there are times when Sunder comes out to five stacks before you shield slam.
---
Yeah I have played on a few. First I am assuming you are talking about healing because dps on either class is sort of rare. Shaman aren't as prevalent as priests, however you won't have trouble finding a raid spot on either class as long as you show up on time with consumables and don't drag the raid down substantially. You generally want more shamans than priests, however that also just means more people to have to fight with over loot.
---
Honestly the biggest factor I would say is what are you planning on doing outside of healing raids? PVP? Serious PVP? Farming? etc.
---
I don't meant values only, but mechanics like the one described.
---
Or procs.
---
Even if the numbers are correct, the rng algorithm may be different.
---
Much fun ahead
---
Degeneration of wow from the original idea and philosophy definitely already started in TBC, and partly in the end of vanilla. I think when Allen Adham left the company the main visionary and ideologist of vanilla wow design philosophy, the game slowly (or not slowly) but steadily started to change and rot.
---
When did multiple difficulties came into play? - TBC  
---
When did they introduced flying mounts? - TBC  
---
When did they homogenized factions with shamans/paladins for so called balance (over identity and diversity)? - TBC  
---
When did they gave horde a pretty race, for so called balance (cos more ppl were tend to pick alliance races, cos they were prettier) - TBC    
---
When did made dungeons into a streamlined linear crap, from adventures journey cities of vanilla? - TBC  
---
When did they first started to optimize questing, making it into a grind, instead of a journey rpg all over the world? - TBC   
---
When did further locked ppl in instanced pvp instead of developing world pvp? - TBC  (also more accent on crossrealm shit).
---
When did they introduce pvp gear and resilence, instead of all gear be universal like in actual rpg? - TBC  
---
When did they made ONLY the current expansion zones viable and used, instead of involving pretty much the whole world? - that approach  also started in TBC. 
---
etc. etc.
---
There is no better choice than stealth. 
---
And the best thing about this is, that he is much more into a scientific mindset than me. You know, a mindset where you keep other variables equal to see what a certain variable does.

He could stumble upon this and know who I am btw., since he knows my nickname :D

Holy f... the guy got 2 ashbringers. That sword was just a 2h weapon right? Or it was class specific?

June or september right, I live in the south of the Ecuator so just checking.

Out of curiosity, what server?
---
If you drop tailor, you still get the +2 crit bonus on the spellvine set, right?
---
Game plan atm is duo lvl w/ warrior friend as hybrid. Endgame resto, not too concerned about gearing or anything. I like dungeons and raiding, would love to have an easy spot on a raid. Going herb/alch on him so I can fish and forage in azshara &amp; Winterspring for gold.
---
I've always mained a priest and love them so much. It's hard for me to not have it as my main, however I want the shaman flavor and have leveled a shaman to 80 in Wotlk and it was super fun. I plan to play a troll priest on my solo time. I want to half-ass twink him at 19 &amp; 29 to farm AB n WSG rep. Obviously going the meme wand spec @19. Anyways I want to feed my priest awesome gear and take as long as I need to get all the epics for him from the bg factions. I love pvp and pve as priest.  
---
My biggest fear is not having enough time, considering I would have to do ~300 WSG &amp; ~250 AB to roughly hit exalted with them (after Mark turn in calcs). Basically I do not want to be without playing a priest, but also like the synergy of shaman + warrior.   
---
I am thinking I will do a cheap twink build for priest, get gravestone scepter from a friend running me through BFD and see how good the 19 scene is again. If the queues are too slow and I've had my fun, I will just level him casually.   
---
However I could just be simple and go priest and devote most of my time to him rather than split it up
---
Same, though since WoW only had like 4 servers or something ridiculous on the first day I very quickly switched to different servers as they came out. Eventually settled into Shadow Moon.
---
Blacklisted? What do you mean?
---
The whole honor system was pretty poor. Some kind of rated battleground system would have been much better.
---
US Alliance Terenas 
---
Everyone knew everyone, I was often kicked from any groups I joined if I got that far
---
Mind control, why has no one said mind control???
---
I think devotion aura is the best option. Gaining that much armor would make you invincible against other humans. You could for example become the best professional fighter ever because you wouldn‚Äôt feel any of your opponents hits. 
---
That's not a problem with ZG though that's a problem with your guild wanting the benefit of the raid wide buff without anyone being willing to put in the work to get it. 
---
No but I mean the term or meaning of blacklisted what do you mean?
---
Ninja or just a prick in general?
---
20 at the time, same server!  I didn't start until that Friday, the day after Thanksgiving.
---
Ninja prick
---
Why do you thin private servers have nothing to do with Vanilla? Its dam near the same game for one. For two, private servers are the reason classic is coming and that this sub exists.
---
Yeah if your doing a duo with warrior I would for sure go shaman, windfury totem is insane on warriors.
---
Even better strategy for ZG is not being a scrub guild, we down it in like 70 minutes 
---
Who would give that sword to a hunter?
---
If half your guild is sitting they could just form another 20 person group and run it like they are supposed to. It's not coincidence that 20 is half of 40...
---
Not to mention aoe totems. as soon as I get magma totem we can round up a bunch, have the warrior get some aggro, cleave, drop magma, heal warrior and stay with the totems.
---
Ah, nevermind. I was in the outer orbit of similar drama on Uldum around the same timeframe and am curious if I‚Äôll ever run into those guys again with Classic.
---
They are just very different. Nothing wrong with that but a lot of people like to act like having only played on a private server is the same as having played vanilla. 
---
As someone who's played both vanilla and on various private servers I tend to agree that they are indeed not the same.
---
Private servers were great at highlighting the need for Classic but not so much for retaining what made Vanilla a classic.
---
C'mon, this is IT, our projects are always delayed, cause of reasons.
---
So pretty much.
---
Googling says it's not class locked
---
This is absolutely hilarious. I remember doing something sort of similar. I didn't want to admit to my guild that their OT had to leave the raid early because his parents would get pissed off at him for staying up all night, so I made up excuses if we ran late. Pretty sure they thought I had a kid lmao. 
---
All of our 5-6 Hunters had one! Our Warriors never wanted it and we didn't have Paladins so nobody was losing out on the sword.
---
Not the same in what way? Are you talking about differences in coding? Or Are you talking about differences in community/player attitudes?
---
THEY SHALL SNUFF IT
---
There are much better one handers for hunters in ZG.
---
I‚Äôm always impressed by the young uns who managed to get their parents to pay for a subscription. Great powers of persuasion. No way mine would have let me, not that there was internet when I was a kid anyway.

Feign death
---
Best. Actor. Ever 
---
Yeah I actually agree with what you're saying, and have talked about it before, but I would take it a step further. Vanilla changed a lot throughout the course of the game, and you even started seeing some things like the optimization of gear and the token system being put in by the end of vanilla. AQ40 and Naxx had tokens, Naxx gear is INCREDIBLY well optimized for each classes "raiding spec" until TBC took it a step forward and added sets for each spec.
---
Battlegroups were added in patch 1.12, and ended up being a big part of TBC in how the arena ladders would play out.
---
The game was constantly changing from the day it was released until now, and that includes the beginning of vanilla vs the end of vanilla as well.
---
You didn't really answer the question. There's no denying that there's distinct differences like itemization, patch progression (to a degree) and slight numbers variations. But to say they're "very different" is a huge stretch. They're pretty damn close and dismissing someones knowledge because they played on a Pserver is pretty foolish. 
---
(I don't even think Tipsout has Pserver endgame experience, never heard of him/seen his characters. So I'm not defending the guy)
---
They are mostly the same .... its the people that change... or you could say "meta changed".
---
That's pretty funny shit. Everyone start with 100 rage and carry rage potions is about the best you can do.
---
\&gt;50% in the 11-15 bracket, hmmm. This explains a lot about the degree of "no changes" sentiment around here, all about precisely recapturing the feel of a certain period. 
---
This has to be summon Succubus. And not even for the freaky stuff that immediately is assumed. Just raw utility. Shes the only one that you don't have to worry about someone seeing because of invisibility. You can use the demon for spying, stealing, errands, cleaning the house etc.
---
Only one I can see coming close in utility is Demon Armor, as it will over a long enough period of time restore your health to its peak no matter what ails you because of the HP5.
---
Not mages ofc... I mean Warriors/Hunters etc. who can do full DPS while kiting, while taking less/no damage. And I don't mean because the Tank pulled too much. It is for example completely standard to distract a mob and kite it into a trap with your hunter. Those are just examples. If you want to clear a dungeon faster you are bound to the skill/coordination of your group. Slow, safe pulls are smart if you are in a PUG but it is by no means the optimal or only way to do dungeons in vanilla.
---
I believe you but we only ever saw them once or twice versus every run giving us Zin'Rokhs like they were guaranteed. Sometimes a boss doesn't care what a best-in-slot item is and drops something slightly worse.
---
Hahaha. Tips videos, 10/10. All for the memes and likes.
---
No. You need to stay tailor for the set bonus.
---
Both.
---
Encounters, drop rates and the general gameplay experience is very different and the player attitude can never be the same as it was due to social changes. 
---
If you didn't play vanilla there's unfortunately nothing that can give you that experience as it was more like Woodstock than anything else. And that's totally OK.  
---
There's nothing wrong with them being different and I enjoyed vanilla and private servers in different ways. It is wrong, however, to act like they are the same.
---
So, then, does my original plan make sense?
---
Pick up Alch on a level 35 alt.
---
The Warrior I play with atm while leveling usually has enough rage because we pull fast and big. Idk about you but a 1.75 threat multiplier on an AoE ability is quite good.
---
None of those will be in classic correct? They ended dungeon tagging after athene did it I believe if the people helping aren't within a few levels of you. 
---
Great video it was a pleasure to watch, thanks 
---
Ya makes me wonder how many expansions they thought they could work with. Most of theirs games had 3. A lot of games were like that then. 
---
While game breaking in the long term. A lot of those changes over the course of of 1 or 2 more expansion aren't bad. If that was the end. Obviously didn't work out that way.
---
I guess you would only become untrackable to other people who happened to choose track humanoid.
---

It's like this controversial event where people gathered for in-game "funeral" and the opposing faction raided the shit out of that event, resulting in a massive bloodbath.

Um...  Reincarnation.

I replied to your comment before watching the video.   
---
It was like he was describing that ancient Chinese were the first to develop gunpowder. ‚ÄúFirst time ever in WoW history!‚Äù Pretty absolute statement and now I can see why challenged it. 
---
I was Sneakius undead rogue.
---
Sure but kind of weird to call Zin Rokh disgustingly good for hunters when really its a melee pvp weapon and there are better weapons for hunters that drop in the same raid.
---
There's a massive difference. It's like asking a person to take the same exam a second time with the same questions. 
---
Vanilla can't be replicated and that's why private servers are different. Nothing wrong with that, it's just a fact. 
---
It's not about dismissing knowledge and no-one has done that. It's about differentiation between people who experienced vanilla and people who didn't as the private server experience is different. And again, as some people seem like they can't handle having missed out on something, there's nothing WRONG with that. 
---
You can enjoy private servers and say that you enjoy the old philosophy behind wow more and that you prefer it but it didn't make you play vanilla where everything was unexplored and untested for everyone.
---
Heck, I enjoy both types and don't see anything wrong in that, but I enjoyed them for what they were. 
---

Investing in alchemy isn't worth it if you're going to drop it at 60.
---
Having "little to nothing to do with Vanilla" is a massive stretch from being "different from Vanilla". Noone acts like they are the same. (Maybe tips out does but who cares). 
---
You can't immune every year as a warrior, there is a CD. I've seen multiple horde guilds use 2 tanks for ony/nef progression because that's the only way to prevent a turn to the raid during a fear. 
---
Drain Soul... take Madame Tussaud's to the next level.

You know you summoned a demon right? You ain't no warlock son. I hope you know what a colonoscopy bag is. Your going to need it when she has other plans for how your intimate liaison will go lol.
---
There is a non-zero chance of there not being a Blizzon this year.
---
Are you new here? I dare say that a majority of players who only played on private servers claim to have played "vanilla". 
---
And the differences in itemisation, code and encounters combined with the different community and prior knowledge of the game ans systems makes private servers their own beast and extremely different from the Vanilla experience. 
---
What did you have in mind? Big ass bear? Blue whale? A pig?
---
&gt;When did they further locked ppl in instanced pvp instead of further developing world pvp?  
---
I love how you  word it just to avoid it being "classic" at the end.  
---
&gt;When did they ~~further~~ locked ppl in instanced pvp instead of further developing world pvp? - Classic

Won't even bother with the rest, so much bs in this post to go through.

&gt; And again, as some people seem like they can't handle having missed out on something, there's nothing WRONG with that. 
---
Dude people aren't arguing with you because they think they missed out. They just honestly don't agree with your opinion of it being **very different**. Since you don't know how they felt playing classic or private servers, why don't you just leave it alone? We get it it, they are objectively not 100% the same. That's about all you can say for how someone else actually perceives it. 
---
How'd you kill Rag if everyone didn't like you?
---
Unless they played both their opinion on this doesn't even matter :)
---
Which goes against game design. You are your character, people know you for your spec. You were never meant to be a different spec every day. 
---
Ugh.
---
You're gross. 
---
Server and name change when it was released 
---
it made all the mobs attack slower so it was definitely a thing to charge in and thunderclap.. not saying it's effective (I don't know), but it was definitely a thing
---
How? We are discussing how things are different. 
---
In order to discuss that you have to have experienced BOTH alternative states. 
---
Nothing gross about that isn't just how it is. 
---
Keep in mind if you charge out of battle shout range of your party it generates significantly lower threat.
---
Best because it persists indefinitely.
---
Yeah, it took me a minute to understand that that image was of the OP, not their child.
---
I was in my mid-30s when WoW launched. The fact that I was apparently surrounded by a bunch of 11 year olds explains... a lot, really.
---
I don't know why you're assuming I was ever talking about people who have only played one, not both. 
---
Is mining or herbalism worth it for hunters since you can‚Äôt use track humanoids or beasts etc at the same time?
---
I threw a +25 Agility enchant on it and its 3.8 attack speed made it great for running through and Raptor Striking stuff for big damage. 72 AP is nothing to sneeze at!
---
Was like 7 years when I found the box in stores, and played those 7 days free trials, loads of times until I was 11 and my parents decided they were okay with the whole subscription thing.
---
Today I'm 21. Time sure flies.
---
We'll probably have to wait and see because it's something a new engine could work a bit differently with. I think the easiest lvl 60 methods were nerfed during vanilla, but I know for TBC launch out-of-group tagging boosting was very strong and was the method people used to hit lvl 70 within the first day of launch.
---
I didn't do it in classic but in TBC i fancied myself to be an Arena lord. Got all the way up to 2342 pretty good for a 15 year old with 3 months experience in MMO's. What got me so far so fast. Anger lots and lots of neck beard anger. I once berated my arena warrior buddy so hard he broke down in tears crying. He was 54 and a father of 6. I don't even remember what I said. It was just mean. Super mean and personal. I dunno why but since I was a kid I have always had the "gift" of being able to spot some one insecurities and I used to be a little douche snozzle about it.
---
His pronunciation of it was really bothering me for some reason.  Like nails on a chalkboard.
---
We were a decent guild. AQ down in first week and Naxx in two weeks. For some reason people just turn off their brains in ZG. 
---
Yea it is actually pretty good for PvP hunter I guess. 
---
This will be impossible to spread properly with sharding.
---
&gt; Absolutely right, but if you're looking at it long term, you'd want to take the decrease in performance so that you can step into T5 with a fully geared warrior tank.
---
The claim I took issue with was "prot's still "rough" compared to wotlk onward and you'd never choose one over a warrior for main tanking bosses". If we agree that prot is superior for most of T4, fine for all of T5 barring one gimmick fight (IIRC) and very good for Hyjal adds in T6, I don't have a problem with that.
---
&gt; Short term, paladin is objectively superior for T4, but you want your warrior tank to be fully geared as well as if they're new or out of shape to use this experience to master or remaster warrior tanking.
---
Nobody knew at the time how paladin tanking would turn out, and the only reason paladin tanks fall off in T6 was wonky scaling, which bit a lot of otherwise very well designed specs.
---
But regardless, if you're a 25-toon guild you'll have two Kara raids and a warrior can tank one if you want a warrior tank. Protadins and warriors don't have that many drops off Mag and Gruul they want and you should be able to get everyone what they want by the time you are ready for T5.
---
Exactly! It's a travesty!
---
While leveling my priest my talents will look like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bVZf0xZxM) at level 31, and [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#bV0bZfxx0cbVZxMb) at 50. Spirit Tap and Wand Specialization are essential, and investing more in Holy is great for boosting smite's damage which is a much higher DPS spell than mind flay.
---
Wh...what? 5hrs to 10? That's not speedrun at all my man. I'm regularly dinging 10 just at or below 2hrs on mage which is not even impressive for some of the runs I've seen. 
---
I'm typically 14 and some change by 5h. What I'd recommend is planning your quests in batches in a word doc, including footnotes on any tertiary goals (ex grind until 700 XP away from level 5) that you'll need to make sure you ding when you turn Q's in, and to preempt future quests (like killing boars or to kharanos so you can front load boar ribs and chunks of boat meat). 
---
Organization, planning and practice will make a huge difference.
---
Totally agree that ZG was a great way to fix not only the catch-up mechanism for newer guilds / players. But also a great retention tool in the raiding calendar. Although I am not sure it actually had a shorter reset time from the start. 
---
Blizzard needed more ways to keep players who couldn't get better gear through normal instances engaged and actively playing the game. Having smaller raids with shorter reset cycles was a great way to keep those players from finding other games or simply quitting.
---
Then AQ turned this up to 11 with both a full scale raid as well as one with the same cycle as ZG. 
---
WoW follows the same reward system as a casino with loot basically being rewarded like from slot machines. Blizzard simply added more slots to their floor with every new raid ;)
---
The smaller size in TBC probably had more to do with how consumer characteristics changed with time during the on demand era and how getting smaller, faster bites became the norm across many industries. But that's all speculation :)
---
"Oh god, they're IN me!?"
---
Literally a private server running a version of the same game has  "Little to nothing to do with" that same game. Huh. 
---
I am talking about vanilla... before LFR was a thing. I was a raid healer all the way through WotLK. You don't have to believe me. I don't care if you do. I am just saying healing addons arent necessary. It's possible people are better. How will a raid know if I have addons or not? You can believe what you want. I was there. I know what happened. Sounds like you are salty there are better people out there.
---
Oh dang you're all over the board! I dig it! See if I rolled priest (or any other class) I most likely would stick to one spot but all that makes sense... Highest I got a priest back then was 19 to heal a twink rogue friend of mine. 
---
I was 19 so already in college when i started. Damn i feel old starting that late lol
---
If all the circumstances change and the entire game is based around social interaction - then yes, it's a completely new experience. Private server's also run on a "Blizz-like" structure and not a carbon copy of 1.12 although they've gotten much closer to the original with time. No matter how close they get they can't replicate what Vanilla was like though. 
---
Anyways I feel like you are just here to mark words by now and don't really bring anything to the discussion. :/
---
A hard pick between devotion or retribution aura.
---
More fun choice would be ritual of doom
---
We can always fall back on the tried and true "*haha you guys are idiots for trusting blizzard to not fuck this up! they're gonna fuck it up Classic is going to fail!!!!*" which seems to be ever-popular.
---
Anyone with a brain realizes it's in game harrassment.

Feral Bear Druid here!

I technically ignored a few pieces from PvP and I also ignored the Warden staff. Costs a lot of money and is bearly(hehe) any better than Unyielding Maul
---
Because it all goes to one mage.
---
The best would be a dps tracker that ignored ignite and then added 50% to all mages fire crits if they have ignite as a talent.
---
Yeah I think the only thing to choose is summon succubus, as someone else said.
---
I mean, there's just nothing else that'll compare.
---
They could increase their dps substantially by putting 6 debuffs as Judgement Crusader
---
I was 29 and already had two kids.

Human male Holy Paladin.  Blacksmithing and Mining.  The very first class/spec/race/profession combo I ever played in WoW back in the day.

You know, the whole purpose of a voting system is to express your opinion on a comment. I assume people are allowed to dislike your preference?
---
I was 23 when the game launched and a friend gave me a guest pass. Miss that dude. 
---
That‚Äôs actually not what the karma system is for at all.  
---
I would suggest that you first look at the Debuff's you plan to use in your 16 debuff list.
---
I've seen suggestions around using all 6 tiers of Judgement of the Crusader to massively increase the holy dps output of holy damage users.
---
This can further be supplemented by having some upkeep judgement of wisdom.
---
DPS paladin's actually have an interesting metric of dps scaling the more there are and the more debuff slots they are allowed to buff themselves with.
---
Never hurt to Raptor Strike in PvE either, not every fight had us at 41 yards to avoid stuff.
---
Met someone who was playing a female warrior, and I myself was playing a male warrior.
---
They brought me into some inn, maybe Southshore. Told me to strip naked, and we both were about to lie down on a bed together, until my older sibling asked why my character was naked.
---
And uh yeah needless to say muh fuckin immersion was broken

and many others

What is it for then? The purpose of upvoting and downvoting that is
---
Quality.  It‚Äôs not meant to denote agreement/disagreement.  
---
I was going to post "That explains a lot" too.
---
For a lot of those kids WoW could well have been their first real CRPG. So the weren't exactly going to be experienced, critical players who see the strengths and weaknesses of a game.
