People are just salty they are wrong, as evidence of my comment being downvoted.  The values that they have from the original 1.12 client can easily be tested and are the same as 1.12 that we played in 2004-2006.   
---

---
A lot of people's only experience with Vanilla WoW was only on fan-made servers, so that is all they know.
---
---
---
lol i think the fact you named not a single one that was wrong says it all.
---
I'm very good at this patch. I'm very right, it's not exactly a hot take this is universally accepted in the private server scene. The pet alone adds so much complexity because their performance is directly related to your tanks. 
---
If you think feral dps is impressive you have no idea what kinda game ur playing. "ohhhh he shifted and got some energy ohhhhh" lol christ dude
---
No the only thing impressive about Feral DPS players in good guilds is their willingness to farm gnomer forever. Real autism right there for the ultimate benefit of just maxing out your warriors logs. At least they'll love you if you do this
---
&lt;3 these

I think you need to update your graphics drivers, you’ve got a bit of a shading issue there lol.

---
Nice misinformation

I already knew what they said to be true, lol.
---
Of course it does, it was done by a friggin laser beam!
---
I'd participate like mad in the stress test and hope.
---
I checked 2 hours ago but no invite. And now I just got the stress test invite. 
---
And no I didn’t create my account in 2005. I created on 2011 or so during end of wrath,
---
Ah damn, I'm a 2008 account (3 months before WOTLK) and I was sure I had no chance if I subbed.
---
Topping healing meters is not the same as being best. It is all situational anyways. All the healer classes plays very differently overall. The most basic one (the one easiest to master) is by far the paladin.
---
Everyone in pribate servers have been saying the game is overtuned. Glad to finally have confirmation.
---
Balance didn’t even HAVE Moonkin form till 1.12 (hurricane used to take it’s spot) when they removed “weapon balance” from the balance tree.  Does that mean Moonkin isn’t needed?  Sort of.  It’s absolutely worth taking but 99.9% of the Vanilla content was designed without it in mind.
---
Keep in mind however that balance is a very poor spec in general in Vanilla and it’s not likely someone is going to take one to most high end content at all; let alone one without its biggest talent choice.
---
So you're resorting to the nostalgia argument now. Stand down sir, I believe you've played all your cards.
---
And servers are down
---
you dont get portal until lvl 40, and only UC/ORG or IF/SW. At that point you can sologrind with or without skinning to outpace the gold, and definitely benefit more if you aoe farm. Selling portals is extremely low gold, do it if you want to do it, I'm just making it clear mages have much more lucrative prospects than being in a town more or less afk.
---
Advertise while you train your first aid or fish, do it while you craft or organize your bank, open mail. It's free money, but it isn't free money once you can choose another way. Time is money fwen.
---
Wack
---
Now you gotta set all your keybindings.
---
Also people can report people falsely and destroy their reputation, its not like there will be a trial or ways to contest it, I realise that can happen without a website, but a website might cause harassment.
---
Hm, good point never thought about that. Back in the day I'd essentially PvP with both hands on the keyboard and never used the mouse, so this whole "only use 1-5" is new to me.
---
Give it a rest you jive turkey.
---
Not gonna lie, as a huge twinker in retail, the fact that they added TF/WF to quest rewards kinda sucked the wind out of my sails. Now it feels like if I don't get my BiS to upgrade I need to completely redo my character from scratch.
---
Ugh. Hate it. I know I'm not supposed to expect an upgrade, but this is twinking we're talking about. The last bastion of retail where you knew what to farm and there was a clear end goal in mind.
---
Thanks friend
---
I just got access tonight and that's the name of my client - I can't access the beta servers so I think that's the name of everyone's client.
---
Right or wrong, its a beta TEST. Sure, people are trying to make it into some sort of right or wrong competition, but at the end of the day this is precisely the point of a beta. EVERYTHING should be looked at under a magnifying glass, twice over.
---
Now, if its happening after launch, then yeah... we have a goal post argument with validity, and those people need to eat rocks, relax, and enjoy the damn game.

Looks like some light scorching also, perfect effect for WoW

I wonder if stress testers will have priority for full access invites AFTER the first stress test.

Private servers though are best guess reverse engineered, and many many of them are customized for damage out out put loot and xp gains. Not all were even as close to being like blizzard as much as Nost was.

there aren't any herbs higher, BUT they are orange and that means you have a ~25% chance to fail when gathering. Which can screw you if you have competition.
---
That's wrong. They went into detail in a panel at last Blizzcon: https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=250
---
TL;DW:
---
- They have the source code from even before the beginning of WoW (1997)
---
- They have the database data from "patch 1.12 and a slightly before", so presumably they don't have the complete database from the very earliest versions of vanilla but they do have the complete 1.12 data and probably also the data for eg. 1.11 and 1.10.
---
- They have the art assets for 1.12. These were almost lost, as in they had to go to their tape drive backups to find backups of them.
---
Also they aren't 12, have more than 10 FPS, and have an extra 15 years worth of gaming skill.
---
I'm gonna hit it in 5-6 days as long as layering allows me to get out of the starting zone within 4 hours. 1-10 in 4 hours is my goal and from there it's doable.
---
Just got mine downloaded! Free all day tomorrow! where should I take my level 5.. uh whatever it will be!?
---
Not married eh?
---
It's actually great to see Blizzard taking this serious checking our concerns. But what I dont see a lot of people thinking or writing about is the fact that mobs that is 20 lvls higher than you seems to hit very low. I just saw Monkeynews in Badlands trying to mine in the Beta and had two mobs on him that is around 18-20 lvls above him and they hit for 60-70, Would be interesting to see you test these things, Blizzard. 
---
I have a feeling the damage values get wrong from dungeon elite mobs / higher outdoor lvl mobs because some missread of the data. This is not a PS thing or anything, if you ran into mobs that were 20 lvls above you or going into dungeons with 35 elites when you are 30, you took a loooot of damage and most of the times died.
---
Would be interesting if you look into this instead.
---
https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=250
---
Are you daft?
---
hmm dude that's not how you play vanilla. you should be practicing 1-60 at least 3-4 times before classic drops if you want a chance
---
there are so many things that will slow you down and only experience helps
---
Well we speculate, argue and eventually blizz shows up and says how it is. For now it's mostly feelings over facts, but we don't really have the facts on everything either. For example the stoneskin totem bug. I wont take stance on the matter yet but who knows what good could come from some paranoia.
---
You couldn't get the 30 days until you applied the serial number in the card or set up a subscription.
---
I still remember that first day having to convince my parents to buy the card even though it came with 30 free days.
---
It's P real my dawg.
---
Been single and dating for the last year, when I found out classic was coming out this summer I decided to just be single.
---
Please let me into beta afterward I promise I will test every little thing :(
---
I really haven't seen anyone try to use pservers as "proof".  Most people try to find footage of actual vanilla dungeon runs to corroborate.
---
Engaged and the fiance has seen me level multiple toons to 60 on private servers. As long as i dont outright neglect her for days at a time she jusy does her own thing.
---
Obviously i dont mean going strait up no life mode for months on end. But im still planning on taking a week  off for classic and literally doing just that the gym and do whatever chores need to be done etc. She literally could care less or is even happy about it
---
It would only work for PvE.
---
Another thing I'd worry about is the fact that so many parts of the game weren't designed with perma-death in mind. Just think of mob pathing. It's wonky enough to result in tons of cheap, unfair deaths.
---
You'd need to redesign and reprogram waaay more than just stat numbers. That being said, a version of Classic where mob health and damage are scaled higher would be pretty fun.
---
Have had a similar mouse but from Razer and Corsair.  I sadly have to admit that I struggle a bit with them. 
---
Firmly holding the mouse, I am very effective at buttons 4-6 and somewhat effective at buttons 1-3 although pressing 1-3 puts some pressure on the mouse and causes sideway movement sometimes that I have to overcompensate.  It’s ok in MMOs but slightly tiring for me. 
---
I struggle far more with 7-9 and never use 10-12. 
---
It’s a good mouse and I still use it for WoW but it wasn’t as “easy” or comfortable to use as I thought.  I have used a mouse like that for definitely more than 5 years, so it’s not something I think will change for me.  
---
But I’m not trying to imply that others can’t master all 12 buttons :-)
---
I think a lot of it comes down to the level. The mobs are green to him which means he will be taking way less damage due to the enemies not being able to deal crushing blows. On top of that he also has higher armor values and IIRC (YES JUST MEMORY OK) the armor  calculation works differently for higher and lower lvls.
---
If a lvl 19 mob hits a lvl 60 player, the lvl 60 players armor will be calculated as if he was Lvl 19, so he will have much higher percent damage reduction than he would have against a Lvl 60 mob.  
---
While a 4-5 levels isn't THAT much more, it still adds up combined with the extra stamina from the level ups and better gear.
---
If you run the dungeon at lower or equal level, you should definitely have more trouble surviving.
---
Check Preachs dungeon runs on vanilla. Heres WC:
---
[https://youtu.be/SGeqlaB2\_98?t=2271](https://youtu.be/SGeqlaB2_98?t=2271)
---
You can see he's getting chunked pretty well by pulling 4 mobs. Right after that he pulls the boss and he's also taking some serious damage there. (Being equal level!) Getting crit for 64 at one point.
---
And then you have to consider it's a tank wearing a shield, mail and being in defensive stance for -10% damage, so as a regular clothie or rogue would definitely take some big hits there.
---
The early dungeons were really not that difficult, even back in Vanilla. Me, my cousin and my bother 3 manned the first few dungeons at appropriate levels (Deadmines, Stockades and gnomergan) because we didn't know they were supposed to be for 5 man parties. Uldaman is the dungeon that broke us, that's the first one we couldn't 3 man.
---
If you are in the stress test, chances are you aren't getting in the beta. The stress testers are the lowest priority of sign-ups, and are just going to be used occasionally. I would just not even bother testing it and wait for the actual release.
---
also got the stress test, but honestly i wont log in to play to lv 5 and nothing more, we should also recieve beta invites as a \`\`thanks for helping us test the server\`\` kind of thing.
---
1 to 5 is piss easy, its past 5 where xp and quests start to nose dive.

But this way they can clearly show everyone what is happening and can 100% re-create the situation they want to test.
---
Because PoM doesn't give you that much in a raid. It gives hardly any dps boost and only adds some occasional situational ability (like an instant polymorph). 
---
Also, you're already putting over 31 pts in frost anyways, not leaving enough points leftover for PoM even if you wanted it. Ice Barrier is a nice survivability talent for 1 pt

You'll see a lot of videos of back in the day with people keyboard turning, and clicking their ability's, but i've legit never heard of someone pvping with both hands on keyboard lmao. But yea most people say 1-5 and not 1-6 cause that little extra reach your index finger has to make to press 6 can sometimes throw off your hand placement, or make you press the wrong key all together.

---
As others have said, you should play what you like more.  But, there are a couple of major differences that make Retail (BFA/Current Expansion) better for a new player., but these do come with their own drawbacks.
---
The game is faster paced, but can feel very shallow with how you can steamroll certain content.
---
There are more convenience features, such as the automatic dungeon finder, but this means that communities aren't as strong.  Many of these conveniences remove the need for player interaction.
---
Each specialization is much more fleshed out with their own unique mechanics, but this means that class identity isn't as strong.  You are no longer a Mage, you are a Fire Mage or a Frost Mage.  
---
Goals/Activities are much more defined, but this also makes the game feel like it is keep you on the rails rather than letting you explore the world on your own.
---
In line with the exploration theme, the questing experience is very streamlined, but that also means you finish each leveling bracket by completing half, or a quarter, of all of the zones available.  This leaves many areas of the game unexplored until you go back there at max level and that neuters much of the wonder since you one shot everything.
---
The story narrative is much stronger, but it feels more like a movie than an open world.  Many of the 'mystery' hooks in Retail are intentional plot hooks that they want you to think about before they pull the sheet back and reveal the big surprise.  In Classic, there were many mysteries that went unsolved or met very ambiguous ends.
---
Classic is a slower, more dangerous world.  You aren't a hero destined to save the world.  You are just some guy/gal trying to take steps to make it a better place.  No matter how small those steps are.  If you like pushing back against the oppressive despair of a supposedly doomed world, then Classic is more your game.
---
In Retail, you are the hero.  You are the one saving the day over and over again.  You are known far and wide and are expected to take up the mantle as a champion to save those who need saved.  If you like hero stories, where good triumphs over evil, and want to be the good that plays a part in that, then Retail is for you.
---
lol the goal is to be as mana efficient as possible. Priests use quick heal because if they do what the meta suggests they would, again would not even be on the meters. Because they would spam ehal instead of quick heal and have to cancel half their spells. They're the ones with the mana problems they should be saving their mana
---
Druids spam downranked healing touch 95% of the time......Priests should spam heal, they spam quick heal.....Paladins flash heal.....Shamans at least have totems to move around. but again just spamming same heal over and over at different ranks  
---
The proper way to play any healer in any game like this is be as resource efficient as possible if you're farming it. Time is of the essence and you want to be prepared if you need your mana. The only time you would be more aggressive is progression. And progression doesn't take very long in vanilla. 
---
Any time you don't ideally spam one spell things have either gone terribly wrong or you knew ahead of time and there is no skill in it. Just fulfilling your assignment.
---
It's all about speed and efficiency when you're raiding old content. No1 got time to be fucking around while you play around smashing buttons on ur priest

---
Oddly enough, this is one private server bug that I wish could be incorporated. I believe there was an issue with bones not disappearing for an inordinate amount of time. Like clearly, obviously unVanilla like. I remember logging out in the morning and logging back in at night and seeing the same bones in the same places.
---
It added so much to the feeling of particularly dangerous areas, or to WPvP battlefields.
---
Probably not. WoW was built around the concept of dying a lot. Deaths are actually more forgiving in WoW than other early MMOs (you used to lose experience on each death in EQ). BGs and Raids are practically designed as instanced wipefests. 
---
Maybe if they altered uninstanced deaths to have a chance of causing your body to become lootable, dropping several random items from your person/inventory and some gold. 
---
Permadeath wouldn't really mesh well with how the progression system is built.
---
\&gt;  If you want to sit and stare at a dps meter, Classic may not be the right version of the game, for you. 
---
That's like *all* I did during MC raids back in 1.12, what are you talking about?
---
Hi, /u/fabybaith
---
It's been called VC since pre DM east/west/trib.
---
Vanilla players were just a bit lazy and stupid. I can confirm, as when i played vanilla at 12-13 i was also lazy and stupid.
---
They dont care about game time they even said so. 
---
Just have an active sub and hope to get lucky
---
Account created in 2004, no stress test invite.  I guess it really is entirely random lmao
---
But it only takes 10 seconds to hearth
---
it was a joke you crybaby
---
I wouldn't say they "ruined WoW" by themselves, but add-ons can definitely be detrimental. The issue is not with the principle of add-ons in general, the issue is when an add-on becomes "mandatory" for large chunks of the game, and gets ingrained in that particular scene.
---
In particular, I would consider add-ons that automate various elements of play (including decision making and interpretation) to be detrimental to the game. Decursive is and one-button rotations are prime examples of this, but even popular stuff like Deadly Boss Mobs I would consider detrimental, because it automated out a lot of situational awareness and learning moments from boss fights. There's a big difference between "this boss casting animation is taking a long time, it must be using X ability, that does a lot of damage to nearby people, so the melee should back off" and "the add-on told the melee to back off".
---
The other problem add-ons are those that facilitate gatekeeping. Gearscore in particular bad for the game, because it encouraged an atmosphere where players would be accepted or turned down from raids with minimal social interaction. A highly skilled player with a perfect rotation, but less time to dedicate to gearing up, would be turned down ovet a higher geared player that performed comparatively worse in the raid.
---
Hell, even damage metres could be considered somewhat detrimental to the game, because they facilitate a focus on individual rather than group performance, which in turn encouraged the whole "only minmaxers allowed" raiding culture that exists today. A lot of players like minmaxing though, and that would be harder without damage metres. I'd guess that if damage metres didn't exist, utility and support roles outside of healing would play a much larger role in the game.
---
Literally. Right in the feels bro :( I even knew it was going to happen like this and tried not to get my hopes up, but I still made that face when I launched it lol
---
i rather level and go where i want at my pace. don't care for these guides. whats the hurry lol
---
There's literally a whole post on the top of the subreddit about how everyone is claiming that Private servers referenced old wow videos and filled with people arguing their own special private server was the best reference they had because "the guys who make private servers put so much hard work into them"
---
Its easy to act like its a strawman if you want to ignore everything that confirms your own bias.
---
Shutdown the blizzard launcher and start it again. I did that and boom was there.
---
It is worth investigating though. Of course, not based on private servers but maybe videos of vanilla.  
---
I really wish they gave some people access to the original 1.12 so they could test these mobs one-by-one, it wouldn't take a lot of time and we could be 100% sure that everything works fine.  
---
It would really suck if we dismiss concerns and say it's probably fine and then end up with bugs in the game.
---
Maybe I should try logging in again, mine only has the stress test server and it only appeared my launcher in the last ~8 hours
---
warframe devs reign supreme in that department for me personally
---
What do you mean by active sub?
---
I don't understand are you purposely acting stupid?

You don't generally engage in role-playing with people on non-rp realms who aren't even remotely interested in that scene.

The ui for healing in dungeons and raids was basically unusable. Healbot made it so that you could actually see wtf was happening as a healer. I never played past wotlk so maybe they changed the ui to actually work for healing?
---
Well hopefully blizzard tunes damage for 2019 standards. I want mobs to hit like they do on krns, can prove to all you kiddos I played vanilla as well. Upping damage is a good change
---
Shadowpriest is among the weakest classes in vanilla, better brace yourself.
---
About as useful as a ret paladin (a wingclip spam hunter is a better ret pala for raids so you can compare how useful you are).
---
You might be considered if your guild feels like carrying someone who wants to meme and his 15% damage amp is more dmg for the locks than another warlock/other dps would provide.
---
You'd never get Benediction early over the actual useful priests, healer. Poverty gear is your gear.
---
Shadowpriest is still better than the druid class as a whole tho, but druids are essentially "take one for the buff".
---
Please don't even attempt enhancement...
---
PvP wise both are bottom of the barrel as well, no decent premade would even consider you.
---
Priest is a healing/dispel support class. Pick priest if this is what you like.

Shaman is also a support based around casting/healing.
---
Has anyone that wasn't subbed got an invite?
---
After leveling/exploring; farming the 0.5 sets was one of my favorite things to do in vanilla!
---
I have the option to download the client now, with no email notification.
---
Troo.
---
Bro your whole reddit history is just shit spewing
---
they just wanna hop on the circle jerk that classic is the greatest and retail is shit.
---
Amazing news
---
An active subscription. As in, being subscribed to BfA
---
That's hilarious lol I'd have died
---
Try hard no lifing was always a core tenet of vanilla, I’m sure it’ll be the same this time around. If you have the time to grind all the best stuff people will want you because you’re geared. If you’re behind then you’ll have to rely on friendships.
---
Lol! I thought that was normal! I got pretty good too! As a mage I got to arean season 3 2500 in doubles to get the S3 arena shoulders!
---
This was my set up I think:
---
1- Blink
---
2 - Counterspell (macro that could also CS the Focus)
---
3 - Ice block
---
4 - Frostbolt
---
5 - Ice Barrier
---
6 - Fire blast
---
7 - [dont remember]
---
8 - [dont remember]
---
9 - Arcane Explosion
---
0 - Frost Nova
---
- - Ice Lance
---
= - Polymorph (with macro to CC the Focus)
---
Then I had ALT + 4 to summon my frost minion and F binded to my frost minions nova. 
---
Looking back now it makes no sense, but I knew it all like second nature. I'm definitely gonna set it up proper this time.
---
Classic devs are so much more active
---
&gt; EVERYTHING should be looked at under a magnifying glass, twice over.
---
I think you'll find if we make Blizzard manually recheck the damage of every single mob in the game, despite the fact that those mobs are verbatim using the actual 1.12 vanilla data, this beta will still be ongoing this time next year.
---
The way this thing works is that if one mob has correct damage they will all have correct damage. It's basically a copy-and-paste matter. Manually checking them is nothing but a PR move to placate clueless loudmouths. I guarantee you Blizzard knew that boss was doing correct damage before even checking it.
---
Ive said it before on this sub but its supremely ironic that there is a large overlap of Private Servers Players and No Changes Crusaders.
---
Clamoring for 'no changes' ...from their private server experience haha.
---
Hi, /u/Gima44
---
I disagree. Most people will level very slowly and most didn’t scratch the surface of raids back in the day. There’ll be plenty of people still playing in 3 years time. Not to mention the alts.
---
He’s a scrub
---
Yup. It me. Damn.
---
Honestly the devs are face palming right now. They're only doing these tests to appease the vocal minority, and the vocal minority just keeps moving the goal posts, and it's wearing them out. I'm not going to be surprised when they stop being communicative in a month.
---
Wenn can Just Hope th y Convert our Beta.
---
Moot point.  Level cap for the stress test is level 5.  You're not going to be encountering opposite faction at that level.
---
Pretty sure classic exists because it was created in 2003
---
K
---
i remember all those small corpses of gnome in IF, writing some URL to a gold seller website. It was sad and beautiful at the same time
---
&gt; Maybe the private servers did it better then?

Oh right it's been awhile. I do remember arcatraz being very difficult on heroic though.
---
Well there was a real Wave now xS with No E-Mails.
---
Out of curiosity, what were the steps they asked you to take prior to the CD key trick? I don't have my CD key nor the email I used to set up that account (I was hacked after foolishly sharing my account as a 12 year old and they nabbed my email too). 
---
Wondering if it's feasible at all to try and get that account back without the email associated with it.
---
World PvP on a PvE server is just not really a thing.  Yes I’m sure you had your one offs in various zones because people flagged for PvP a couple of times.  But for the most part that just isn’t what happens on a PvE server, and I only played on PvE in vanilla.
---
This was reported in the huge bug thread.
---
QQ
---
Thats not what the team said.
---
Also its nostalrius
---
Pssst, it’s not TBC :P
---
no it isn't you bunch of spergs. also tipsout is a retard.
---
When you jump against a wall from a side angle and fload on a pixel. Any movement will make you fall. But jump against a wall to "float" on a pixel, followed by a jump will give that little extra hight. 
---
Its really not that intresting or exciting since there are not many places where this can be usefull.
---
Don’t get too excited.  Only tomorrow and up to level 5.  Will be turned off on Thursday.
---
I wish I could get that far into the PTR.
---
They already confirmed that your creation date has no impact on whether or not you get the beta.
---
Imagine getting this upset over some blue pixels on a BETA server of all places.  LMFAO.
---
The insults arent warranted. If you get upset about a little roleplay, you should stick to fortnite.
---
No - report anything and everything that could be a bug so we can get official confirmation from Blizzard. This is the purpose of the beta. Over-reporting is better than under-reporting.
---
My memory is shaky, but I recall that dual wielding at low levels was a good way to end up dead. MISS MISS MISS MISS MISS
---
Better than I thought It would be tbh ! Before clicking I expected to be below tanks since speed runners tend to go fury duel wield tanks and they go ham.
---
Literally anything is viable for leveling.
---
private server retards BLOWN THE FUCK OUT LOL
---
Because UBRS and LBRS has a lot of depth.  Think of the lore, the quest chains that lead you to these places so you can acquire that awesome weapon or gear or so you can get attuned.  There are a lot of layers.   
---
Mythic plus doesn’t have any layers and it’s the same crap repeatedly with really no goal other than beating it on time and hoping you get that 5 I’ll upgrade aka not rewarding at all.
---
The hurry is to not be stuck with 500 other people trying to farm the same wolf as you with non dynamic respawns. I think you underestimate how bad it will be on launch day. Good luck!
---
My fiance, who is so nice to me, said she was going to intentionally try to stay out of the way and not be a bother on release week.
---
Stress test is now up. I’m logged in now!
---
I remember having these macros! The conc/wing clip one was my fav.
---
Good gatekeeping retard.
---
Nothing wrong with raider.io score in retail, just shows who can be bothered to push their own key competently and who relies on leeching other peoples groups.m
---
@snakertf It's a video game
---
Human, warrior engineering and mining :)
---
I'll be going arms. Reducing heroic strike to 12 rage is very helpful toward the beginning and I love making things bleed.
---
More like S8 of GoT with the plot holes left...
---
Looks like, I'm in game now.
---
Yeah I’m in too!
---
What are you talking about? Hunters have a deadzone on every major project I've ever played.
---
Retail is friendlier to new players, especially those who haven’t played many MMOs. It’s also more modernized and streamlined and has a good deal more content with new expansions every couple years. 
---
The appeal of classic is largely for veteran players to return to the system we remember. That’s not at all to say new players wouldn’t enjoy classic - you totally might! It would depend on your history with MMOs, your amount of free time, your patience for grinding, etc
---
Each time I check and see no beta invite I die a little. Each day I die more and more. If my calculations are correct, I'll survive till August 26 at the very latest.
---
Blizzard plz Betaize me my life depends on it!
---
=(
---
And they will crit a lot more since the defense rating of the player is way too low for their level.
---
I asked [a question about specs](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aeumlf/relaxing_warrior_leveling_builds_without_the/) a few months ago, when I started leveling a Warrior on a pserver, and the comment I found had the most accurate info was [this one.](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/aeumlf/relaxing_warrior_leveling_builds_without_the/edv0fxw/)
---
Essentially, a 2H, Deep Wounds / Imp OP Arms build.
---
I thought stress test is tomorrow?
---
Sauce readings TBD...
---
We’re all a bunch of edgelords
---
Well, it was fun while it lasted.
---
can't let them all have thunderfury tho we gotta draw a line somewhere
---
Decisions were made then, hard decisions. Happy cake day!
---
 **Plasma**: we're a bit like the gas. An enjoyable, positive environment that's relatively low pressure overall. With a split emphasis placed on socializing, and PvE progression, the guild's ultimate goal is to reach the end of Classic's lifespan as friends who got to experience all this awesome revival has to offer.
---
We'll be pushing to see everyone enjoy the leveling (and raiding experience) in a way that both encourages a strong, tight core, as well as making sure the concept of "having fun" isn't lost along the way. Druid tank, Shadow Priest, some other weird, frowned upon spec? No promises, but we might try it! This philosophy extends to any other games the guild plays together, too; be it a MOBA, a competitive FPS, or some one night stint with any other game. We're simultaneously a guild, and a laid-back community. 
---
* Intended region (NA/EU) - NA, English speaking.
---
* Intended server type  - Large, non-streamer PvP server.
---
* Intended faction - Horde
---
* Any priority(ies) the guild may have - We understand Vanilla WoW is a viscous beast to take on, especially if you're going in blind. Because of that, most raid roles will be assigned based on who reaches level cap, and when, and we'll be helping each other out along the way as much as possible.                 This mentality spills over into the guild's other facets, too. We would rather have a fun, shared experience than an all consuming one. We hope our members all share this same outlook to make it as easy on one another as possible. 
---
* Any pertinent rules - All we ask for is some form of mutual respect for one another. 
---
* A preferred form of contact - Discord: fuppy#8621.
---
Down now
---
You have that many IRL friends who play? 
---
Also rip to the stragglers who won’t have a group
---
Hell ya man. That’s awesome. Sadly it will just be me (my wife hates video games) but she cool to let me play when I want. I’m thinking of going Warrior myself and tank as of now. I might make a mage and just be the guy spam trade chat saying tip for ports....lol anyways happy for you and that really cool to have the whole family play. You are one lucky dog.
---
You'd have to radically change the game. If it was pve only it would mega boring I think, because you'd just always play super safe. You're at absolutely no risk of every dying if you stick to green mobs, so that's just what people would do. You'd just wait till you very safely outlevel and outgear things before you do them.  
---
  
---
I think a much more fun version would be on a pvp server with something like the current beta - lvl 30 cap and strictly no instances at all. If you do it this way you have to play in the world where it's dangerous to level, but at the same time it's really not the end of the world if you do die, you can hit cap in a few days (or more likely a week or two) if you really want to. You'd want some kind of end game that incentivises combat but I dunno what that would like. It would be difficult to do in a way that everything always just comes down to massive zerg raids and whoever has the biggest wins.  
---
My idea would be to one a week or something make a zone the 'combat' zone where you can't be in a raid group and the whole zone gets arena flag rules - ie it's groups of 5 all against each other. So at 7pm saturday wetlands becomes the combat zone where it's a ffa of 5 man groups and you have a chest that spawns somewhere within a time period (shown on map) and whichever party loots it gets something awesome like a title or mount or something to really set them apart.  
---
Would be hilarious and fun to watch on stream. Obviously a lot of people would die but that's the point, people get culled off and have to start a new character for next week. You'd need something else to do at 'max level' to make it fun in the downtime outside of the arena night but I'm sure they could come up with something.
---
I like how even in his dream world he doesn't get real beta.
---
got about 1/2 way through the nelf starting cutscene and got kicked.
---
formulas don't change like that you moron
---
it was active for a couple of minutes
---
When stress test option doesn't even appear.
---
lmao.
---
Does John's GF not have a name?
---
Strong response
---
lol
---
Feral druid is hard herrrp derppp hahaha
---
Its up it seems
---
who cares, it's a girl
---
Part of me wants to go pally but..... alliance ... yuck
---
Lmao those other 3 have other friends they know that my group of friends dont really know too well, theyll be fine :p
---
Thanks! We could use a guild mage....sweet, sweet ports lol!
---
Where are the Trolls 'mon?
---
They can literally run their own keys but they are too lazy to. It is good at filtering out lazy/bad players although it can’t guarantee you’ll group with good ones.
---
more than you apparently.
---
Armor is a big deal in vanilla. So much so they had to normalize it in TBC+. It doesn't take much to create wide swings because the armor par values are a lot wider in vanilla.
---
&gt;Way to just parrot the streamer and not have an original thought yourself.
---
just look at his profile picture
---
I'm still waiting for a few of my favorite YouTube channels to get in. Shame it seems to be mostly streamers.
---
aaaand its gone
---
I still have trouble connecting that rant post to Daddy Jeff. You watch his OW videos and its pretty hard to imagine that coming from him.
---
Granted, I guess it was something like 18 years ago, give or take.
---
k guy
---
I'm in, unfortunately I don't have access to the actual beta realms so I think we all just got Jebaited for an actual stress test.
---
It was up but got dc'd and now its down.
---
I'm not good with names, and at the time of making this I couldn't remember &gt;.&gt;
---
I believe they do, but it gets less and less effective. It reduces glancing damage but every point reduces it a bit less than the last.
---
I hear ya :(  
---
I'm going to minmax the shit out of my lvl 5 over that 24 hours, I can tell you that much lol
---
Kicked out during character creation. Likely a mistake that it was up.
---
Biggest case of blue balls in my fucking life.
---
it doesnt matter man my account is from the beginning and I got no beta invite or stress invite lol
---
&gt;johns gf
---
group 2 is already doomed
---
Don’t forget the dog who wanted two bones 🦴 haha
---
Be thankful that you have stress test access, sadly many don’t. 😓.
---
I'm trying to convince Justin to go troll hunter to add some diversity!
---
Just subscribed, or do you need to own BfA too? (I wouldn't think so)
---
ok retart
---
Paladin. They rarely go OoM, they have a big bag of raid utility buffs, and their healer spec can still be decent at PvP and can even AoE grind in PvE. Also, there are SO many shenanigans that Divine Protection lets you have.
---
Whether or not a guild performs well as a team and efficiently clears content depends on a bunch of different factors. Min/maxing on race is a net benefit if everyone does it, but it is absolutely not necessary for any of the content in vanilla. If you have a good crew with consistent attendance, great focus, excellent preparation and thoughtful planning and coordination then it really does not matter what race anybody is. Certain class/race combinations are more beneficial than others. Orc and human warriors' weapon skill is a pretty big benefit to their DPS. However, if you absolutely must be a tauren or night elf warrior because you love the aesthetics then go with that. If you are a great player then it really isn't going to matter to anybody.
---
I almost got in! Made it to the loading screen.
---
Yikes
---
Armadillo, turtle, snail, beetle, uhm... that's just off the top of my head though.
---
Fuck it.  I just did.  Haven't played since wotlk.  Gonna go out and see the world while I wait.
---
It is going up and down a fair bit
---
wut, how did that trick you
---
Thank you. Raider.io is hated because the lazy, babies who feel entitled to be carried wont do the work of pushing their own key.
---
Except they didn't even address the actual concern the community had. Boss damage always seemed fine, trash mob damage in dungeon seems off to many people still.
---
It was up and now it's down :(
---

---
The spell interactions/procs/coefficients that this build relies on is one of the things that gets pretty murky on private servers so it will be interesting to see if it's a thing in classic.
---
Haha. Watch out for raptors in the long grass. 
---
Red level Sun scale raptor calls for aid: rip...
---
Keeps DCing in Undead starting area :(
---
MMOs that have hardcore implementations don't go for the perma-death approach since there are too many unbalanced pvp/pve aspects and it's barely rewarding.
---
A lot of mmos tend to make hardcore modes with the following rules:
---
\- Loosing experience per death.
---
\- Drop gear per death.
---
\- Give pk experience per death.
---
\- No access to safe zones on pk/No Logging out after certain time on pk.
---
\- No factions, each player party is a faction.
---
This kind of mechanics make more sense in games where your skill doesn't imply your survivability, E.G a healer/tank goes afk middle raid, a dps pulls on accident, high levels camping low levels, and many more little things could mean certain death.
---
that’s insane bro wtf. those are the craziest keybinds i’ve ever seen. binding 1-0 doesn’t make sense in my head but once I put both hands on the keyboard I think I see how you would have made that possible. You used your hand to hit 6-0?
---
Need to be active sub
---
You have to be subscribed.
---
Am I wrong lmao?
---
I don't give a shit about my history
---
you will not get invited without a sub.
---
I remember back during pre-POP Everquest you could /who GM and get a list of GMs to personally message if you had a problem. They had senses of humor, would RP, etc. EQ was a big MMO too.
---
Then as the years went by they stopped being permanently logged in and the ticket system was implemented. If you had an issue a GM would login specificially to discuss the issue with you then log off when it was resolved. It made players feel isolated and stressed out if a problem occurred because you didn't know when a GM would come online to address it. Keep in mind EQ had corpse issues where you sometimes couldn't retrieve your body when you died, ending your playtime indefinitely.
---
Every time you spoke with a GM after that system came about it was standardized communication protocols and formalities. All personality went out the window. It really felt like you were talking to a robot and they were indifferent about your grievances. This carried over to all future MMOs I played.
---
I wish more devs realized how nice it is to talk to other people like they're actually people. Infusing customer support with humanity and whimsy leaves consumers in a better mood.
---
Thanks! lol fuck, think its worth subbing for?
---
I played my entire wow career with two hands on the keyboard. It was years, and I mean years before I learned mouse turning was even a thing. No one had ever mentioned it to me. 
---
I've tried so many times to switch to the mouse, and my brain just cannot be unwired. I know it makes me worse, but I just play for fun, so I eventually gave up on trying to teach myself something I clearly couldn't learn.
---
thats kinda the point of a stress test
---
I got in for a brief minute, almost managed to set everything up in terms of action bars, graphics and keybinds :C
---
The Blizzard giveth and the Blizzard taketh away
---
Maybe we crashed it. Good stress testing boys!
---
I thought I might have to change a setting on the battle.net app to download test realms and was going through the settings.
---
Multiple world firsts, impressive raid achievements, gladiator, scrub btw lol.
---
Jealousy is a disease my friend.
---
Feels like everyone gets into the stress test, started cata, just gon in
---
Savages that are gonna whoop your ass! Alliance are such whimps...
---
same
---
Damn I was hyped but it’s gone now lol
---
indeed
---
I can say for sure I've never been drunk enough that I deleted my own foot wear. My hat is off to you sir lol. Need to get on that level!
---
the stress test is just two days right? not the same as the beta?
---
I've already come to terms with this. I will be leveling all my characters in rested, 2 at a time (dual boxing). It is way more efficient to level two at a time instead of one. In the end I will have 8 60s that I can be behind with!
---
No race to 60 for me.
---
Must be nice
---
&gt; and a number in a private server database.
---
The funniest part is that the OP went and used classicdb.com, saying it was "**the only server agnostic database for vanilla content I could find**". The very first thing you see on that page is 
---
&gt; **This website uses the Nostalrius database.**
---
Hunter.
---
Yes, it is
---
Are you sure the people who made pirate servers happen are the same people who are flooding the bug forums with "bugs" that consist of "I don't know anything about WoW except pirate servers and classic is not like my pirate server ima report it!"?
---
Or are you using the first group as a shield for the second group?
---
Amen. Beta &amp; Stress Test.
---
# &amp;!!!!!!!
---
DID YOU JUST SAY LASER BEEEEEEEEAM???!?!?!?
---
No. I have been subbed for years with an account from 2007 and didn't even get a stress test invite, beta invites are even more exclusive.
---
I didn't play vanilla/BC (besides a free trial) while most of my friends did. I started in Wrath and then they were on different servers then they quit around Cata and I was alone, I played with one of my buddy's through cata and quit in MOP, came back in legion for a month and BFA for a month. Legion wasnt too bad but it didnt draw me in like Wrath did. I played Nostralious with a couple of them for a few months until it got shut down. We all have a guild name picked out and our group chat is non stop Vanilla talk. We are absolutely hyped.
---
Spent 15 on subscribing kinda regret it because didnt get in anyways so a waste of money only pary
---
Looks fully down again, might have been accident, might be crashing from stress lol.
---
That link is fantastic advice.  The only thing I'd add is level herbing/alchy.  Having a million health pots can help optimize your grind and helps with sudden PvP encounters(rogues).  Pot early, and pot often.
---
We crashed it! Good stress test everyone!
---
2008 account EU, got invited to stress test. I am also subbed.
---
definitely  not everyone seeing as I don't have it with an account from early BC :(
---
I understand where they are going with it.
---
Totems are incredibly vulnerable and a huge aspect of the Shaman class. Being able to negate that entirely with just an addon/Macro was silly.
---
Thanks, appreciate the reply
---
😂😂😂 hes gonna die when he sees this lmao
---
See you there
---
are you a hunter?
---
Can we get a copy/Paste \*cant access Blizz from work\*
---
Tell your friend that I’ve got a woody too
---
Those damn raptors are to busy stealing all the silver! Wtf :)
---
This whole journey of learning about keybinds is seriously blowing my mind cause I played since 2004 vanilla to level 85 Cata like that!
---
Yup, I'd use my right hand to hit 6-0. I could jump with my left hand and spam AOE with my right hand. I'd TAB to target everybody. 
---
I think I set it up like that just because that was the order I added them. There was no thought behind it and I just got used to it... really, really used to it.
---
Annnnd.....its gone
---
Nope. 2006 account here, didn't get in.
---
Didn't get an email but it was in my launcher when I got home *shrug*
---
Thought I had invite to beta and hosed with a stress test invite ... Nobody is going to log in just to get to level 5 lol
---
 not really lol https://imgur.com/Kq9oPoN
---
Do people in the stress test get to keep being in beta afterwards?
---
Its showing offline for me :(
---
Managed to get to level 2 by the time they shut it down.
---
only goes to level 5 as well
---
would really like to see the ability break down, looks like a lot of it is just the sustained aoe and consumable damage
---
Don't forget the king of the warriors, the bane of the paladin, the greatest tank who ever lived, Furor Planedefiler.
---
seems like its down now
---
i mean, are you really that excited to kill wolves and kobolds for the first 5 levels?
---
It is a gamble dude. Hope you get it then...
---
Hi, /u/TogarTheGreat
---
I would encourage people to report something that might be a bug, but this is a different issue entirely. You  have the freedom to report possible issues with the elites, but it gets to a point where r/classicwow shouldn't be spammed by people talking about something that likely isn't an issue.
---
+1 for south park reference
---
reeee
---
They were by 1.12.1, I remember how much I hated it because I never saw my horde rivals any more.  In my mind that was the first step down the destroy community path, but I also get why it happened.
---

---
imagine thinking that blizzard does not have backups of their own games.
---
fucking lol :thinking:
---
My point is, instead of properly interact in a discussion you spew shit - thus further making people stubborn and unable to discuss important stuff and as a result, help further dividing retail players and pserver players. We are all here for Classic Wow. 
---
Despite almost being a 15 y/o game, people act more childish.
---
bruh, are u taking photos of a computer screen
---
I fucking loved cata heroics until the troll dungeons came out
---
"I never played retail vanilla but I ran around on pirate servers ganking people and spamming racial slurs, so *basically* Classic only exists thanks to me personally."
---
I think warlock is the best solo leveling class. Followed by hunter. And then mage. I’m personally going rogue like so many others are because i want to pvp. Alt will be shadow priest.
---
Sorry for the blurry picture, I should of screencapped this but was in pure hype.
---
He's been carried in literally everything he has ever achieved.
---
I would if they gave me a fuckin invite
---
Any pet class is pretty decent for solo cause you can get your pet to tank, imo warlock would be best cause they have siphon life soul link etc and can resummon voidwalker tank pets
---
Yeah this is what I don't get. If they want people to join they need incentives to play so why cap it at 5? Do they think people are just gonna mess around at level 5 for two days straight? I was hoping people who got into the stress test would at least be able to keep playing the regular beta once the stress test is over but it's not looking that way... sigh.
---
also rebind a/d to be strafe instead of turn :')
---
Guys i'll tell you a secret before you make a terrible mistake
---
Horde is terrible on 1.12 go alliance
---
Member this when you don't heed my advice and a group of 20 alliance wipes ur raid for buffs every week. 
---
I like fast ques and lots of enemies tho. So have fun hopefully see you soon
---
omegalmao
---
I'm gonna try and teach myself to turn with the mouse.
---
How does it work. Basically W = forward, A = strafe left, S = back, D = strafe right?
---
Then double mouse click + hold = turn the camera?
---
i momentarily traveled back in time to 2005
---
Your brain shouldn't be wired to take pictures of the computer screen in a panic though.
---
doo doo do do do
---
Lmao
---
Nightfall increases Spell dmg taken, not shadow dmg
---
Yeah I agree, it’s one of the many things I hope to test in the near future. I’m very excited to have professional servers that will be up for as long as we please.
---
Would give you mine if I could :(
---
Speak for yourself not everybody. I'm there to help stress test the servers tomorrow.
---
I’m still not invited. :(
---
I did some tanking before LFG was added, never had to deal with DPS complaining other than when I was first learning. Since you can’t just click a button and get a new tank people want to stay on your good side and run more dungeons with you later. 
---
It was also nice to not have to wait very long if I want to run a dungeon tanks were always needed.
---
 [Got in long enough to make a character and run around for a few glorious seconds.](https://imgur.com/a/gLlVamn)
---
It's pretty evident at this point that private servers are way harder than Classic will be. This is the main reason why private server players are so shocked with the beta.
---
No.
---
no i don't underestimate stuff. as for every exp launch since 2004 its always been a horrible day. thats why they are creating layers... (sharding) besides that, i dont mind fighting over mobs.. i might just ask them to group up you know be social? aslo im not impatient and itchy to just rush by. if im stuck with 500 people gathering wolf pelts then fine. its not like the end game classic content is gonna dissapear.
---
Lol I checked my battle.net app and sure enough I saw that nice Region/Account drop bar and saw “stress test: Classic Beta” 
---
And literally this was my exact same reaction and funnily enough, of course I go on Reddit to see if anyone else was having the same issue or made a joke about it lol 
---
They keep playing with my emotions 😭
---
Might as well. BFA isn't that fun if you take it seriously but theres plenty to explore and have fun with if you haven't seen a lot of it before.
---
haHAA stop with this fake shit
---
I was able to get 3 jumps in before it got shut down!! And it was glorious!!!!
---
OR they are just pirates trying to justify not paying a sub fee forever
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M so much for private servers getting accurate data through Beast Lore.
---
Strange. A nude dancing orc was all it took to make me nostalgic.
---
Dumb question... I was given the ability to download the client but I can't play? The only server available is "offline" for me. (Or do I need to finish the whole download?)
---
unlucky
---
That’s great, then the videos not for you! It’s obviously for people who like leveling quickly and not taking 2 hours to get 1-6.
---
weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
---
Arms or fury is fine. It's not going to be a huge difference either way. Arms is slightly better, especially for pvp, but fury you can use any weapon you find instead of having to chase specific ones which can be nice.
---
Here's how I see it.
---
Group One put an enormous amount of effort into researching, coding and maintaining pirate servers. Without those people there is a meaningful sense in which Classic would not have happened.
---
Group Two played on those servers, is enormously sensitive about the fact that they never played real vanilla, has a massive emotional need to believe that they are vanilla experts because they played pirate WoW, and is spamming bug reports based only on the pirate servers they played when they should STFU unless they have hard evidence from real vanilla to back up their feels.
---
Now Group Two is trying to hide behind Group One and take credit for their achievements.
---
Your access won't be revoked per se, they'll just shutdown the one realm you have access to.  A blue post recently said you'd still be eligible for a possible invite to the general beta.
---
T'is why I used gold I had on my account for a token but it seems to have been in vain as well.  2006 account here.  Maybe they will send more later this week after the stress test?
---
ayyy ! are you cloudbells ingame ?
---
World first level 2 stress test!!!!! Grats!!!!!!!
---
stress test is 2 hours long but youre right that there will be pvp for sure
---
Super geared fury can do ok (Alliance side, with heal support). Same with super geared combat 
---
Hunters have a square peg round hole MM spec you can force into PvP if you take scatter.
---
Shamans (maybe) with 30/0/21 but tbh in early content mana tide is really handy so you probably can’t go this until later. You won’t have the HP to survive as 30/0/21 early on anyway. 
---
Disc priests do quite well as heavy support/mana burn. 
---
Variations of Druid hybrid specs can do well but miss key talents due to the nature of the spec. 
---
Tbh healers can brute force into PvP with a pve spec provided their team mates are specced appropriately, as healing is healing. It’s not ideal but it’s better than a dps pve spec which lacks basically everything.
---
Damn, I'm tempted to get one. But you're saying you use those mouse buttons for those "side things", but the main spells are still on 1-5?
---
Shame we can't transmog... most of these sets look better than most of the higher tier sets.
---
&gt;Save
---
Private server players are the sole reason you will get to play Classic.
---
It's only the stress test.
---
Did this change between open beta and vanilla to 1.12 sometime? I'm a pretty hard altoholic and I recall instant, but just like all memories from a decade ago I might be wrong
---
&gt;Act like an ass
---
&gt;Get downvoted
---
&gt;Claim it's because "the pserver players are butthurt"
---
[Outstanding move](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/439/580/d14.png)
---
if the only realm in your realm list is "classic stress test" you only have stress test access.
---
I got to character creation!
---
BigCritties the Paladin exists.
---
Just log in and check
---
how is that a pserver thing? there's databases for that (e.g. classicdb.ch), no need to have to play on  a pserver. also, the point was about people making bug reports that are likely not bugs. and there are valid arguments both for and against the point.
---
sure seems that way. :/ I’m wondering if I’ve been blacklisted or something. I’ve had a few silences in the past due to people reporting me for “foul language” and I’m honestly worried that that may have something to do with it lmao
---
wait so in order to know if you have access to the beta is to look under that region tab?
---
Should be just the stress test.
---
Can confirm only stress test. I was so happy when it was downloading too.
---
Well when my friends are in beta and I only have access to stress test its kindy a bummer for me.
---
"I have my football, my WoW and my kids". Thats all I need.
---
**HEALER LFG - NA - EST**
---
I'm a former BC, WOLTK and early Cata hardcore raider looking to join a semi-serious raiding guild once Classic is released. I rolled a druid during late Vanilla, and raided as a bear through Kara, SSC and TK before rerolling as a resto shaman, which became my main for the next four years. I have multiple server-firsts and top 50 US kills on my shaman. I quit wow after killing Sinestra and haven't really missed the game, but I'd like to experience Vanilla wow.
---
My raiding experience is old but extensive. I cleared all BC/WOLTK and early Cata content pre-nerf and was part of server-first kills for most raid bosses. Even though I quit in Cata, I have Mimiron's head and LK's horse, Val'anyr, and lots of those shiny realm-first achievements. I can give you more info if you need it. 
---
I'm available to play during the day and some evenings. I'm not looking for a hardcore guild anymore because I have a PhD to finish and a life to lead outside the game, but I have lots of free time and love healing and would enjoy being part of a semi-serious raiding guild again. 
---
I want to heal. Before I quit, I had a max-level healer of every class, so I'd be comfortable playing any healer in the game, but I'd prefer to play a shaman. I'd also be happy playing a pries or a druid that swaps from tanking to healing as needed. 
---
I've never played horde, so that would be fun, but I'd be happy playing as alliance as well. 
---
*My one hard rule is that I have zero time for douchebags who don't know how to game with or respect women.*
---
Oh my God those starting areas are going to be a shit show at launch.
---
ahahaha , nice , RETBULL GIVES YOU CRITS
---
I give John's GF mad props for choosing Undead Rogue though!
---
I appreciate your concern, but everyone in this group is very competitive and will reside on a PVP server. So hopefully we'll see you on the battlefield ;)
---
Add this please, "Realizes you don't need to have perfect min-maxxed comp to kill Ragnaros" lmao

# [A] Seven Sins Late Night Guild EU
---
Started by a bunch of irl friends (**and already at 40 members**) with top tier experience through all expansions. (**including world 8th kill TOTC**), Seven Sins is here for all the nostalgic nerds out there that wanna play Classic and cannot do so the normal raiding hours.
---
***General info***
---
* We want to make a **semi-hardcore PVE** guild that will raid 2 times per week(3 on progress) and rest nights run dungeons,world PVP and all the good classic stuff.
---
* If you dont wanna go hard on launch and just wanna chill out but night is your time of the day you can play you can still join the guild as a social and play with more people at night!
---
Raiding info
---
* We aim to clear all content available at the highest pace as we can for a late night guild.
---
* We wanna give everyone a fair chance so if you wanna be Role officers or Raid leader the challenge is here and we will make you feel at home.
---
* We will have application forms as we get closer to the launch and we have a good amount of people.
---
* We plan to raid around 23.30 (Server time) probably Wed/Thu(+Sunday on progress). Exact hour and days will be discussed later on.
---
* We will probably use Loot Council but DKP is still in discussion.
---
* Raiders should have 100% attendance especially when we raid 2 days only and be ready with consumables, enchanted gear.
---
* We will be a fun late night community but on raid times we expect everyone to be serious and focused so we are done with raids in 2 days max and have some world fun the rest of the days.
---
* People should be able to take criticism and have full knowledge of their class.
---
So if you looking for late night raiding,late night pvp or just to chat with someone late night Seven Sins is the guild you looking for.
---
For more info add me on Discord **KingMavros#2601**
---
or join [**https://discord.gg/3wj8duk**](https://discord.gg/3wj8duk)
---
aww :( hopefully not.
---
Maybe we all just gotta have hope
---
who ran deadmines at 20? I always had the quest list ready long before 20. The elites did more damage back then because they crushed. Elites have more health, they live longer. It takes longer to kill them, and being lower level, you take more damage from them. Same as outdoor elites. There are some special cases where some named elites had some special attacks that did more damage.
---
Who remembers pulling a named elite thinking you could get a drop, but it was a level or 2 higher than you and you got destroyed? (ya ok, kiting classes could handle it).
---
Who remembers running these dungeons while you were leveling up and going in as soon as you could, (earlier than we see on a lot of streams) and it was hard?
---
I remember both. Running them on equal level with some gear and smashing it, and running it early with leveling gear and it was hard.....
---
Im open to try some runs at 16-18 if anyone else wants to try. (wailing caverns?)
---
Please explain this sentence from the word 'when' and onward because I'm not quite sure what you're trying to say
---
A lot of them are but we both know you didn’t do the research before spouting off hate.
---
Ha. The habit.  It took .e a second to realize what you meant.
---
Does a shot at beta require an active wow sub?
---
Does this at least mean we are in the "pool" for future beta access? I take that away from the blue post, at least. Maybe we will get an upcoming wave.
---
I mean, I didn't play vanilla, and they're ruined for me too. I'm not gonna feel badass wearing anything that looks like heirlooms cos I've already been wearing them for years as shitty levelling gear...
---
As a human, run to Nelf zone and level there confirmed.
---
lol Venruki doesn’t realize that in vanilla, mages are squishy
---
I received an invite to the stress test a bit ago. No email but have it installed now.
---
Which world firsts?
---
Same spot too. I’ve read orc racial is op. However since shamans have no cc they need all the stamina they can get. Tauren seems to get both those birds stoned at once. Also plan on going mining and engineering
---
At work. Trying to download it now with phone internet. May take forever lol.
---
that would be awesome, but there’s been no confirmation of that. :(
---
Holy fuck you're dumb
---
To be honest I'm going off memories here as well, but I don't recall ever having sent an item to an alt with instant delivery. I was under the impression that item mail taking ~1 hour was entirely intentional.
---
I'd assumed the rest of the thread would downvote whoever is wrong, lol
---
This so much. I played before heirlooms but it was so long ago now that they are ruined for me. When I was a kid I used to think that plate set from molten core looked so cool and maybe one day I'd be max level to get it. Now I just see it and think: gross, heirlooms...
---
Why would they do anything about this?
---
I didn’t have a drop-down box either.. but I just checked today and I got one due to the beta invite
---
Dawg servers were up for 10min 20min ago
---
Did you all get banned for "exploiting"?
---
True. It's the way the post says not selected 'yet'
---
Either way I got the stress test and I am a willing &amp; happy participant. :-)
---
Could you imgur a picture of your launcher? Is it just showing up with the rest of your games?
---
No it's not. Stop parroting what corporate shills tell you.
---
Bobby B bot is sentient don’t @ me
---
hell yeah homie me too!
---
They did not. It's a real screenshot from the beta I can tell.
---
No email but the option just appeared for me in my battle.net app
---
All the more reason to be alliance, lol
---
This is 1.12
---
Member, you were warned
---
Large Western video game development companies never not have a parent company
---
pretty much.
---
nah I'd disagree... a lot (by far not all) pserver numbers based on evidence, not guesswork. now I agree that the formulas and boss mechanics are all recreations, but there goes a lot of work into making these things accurate.
---
unless you have a different understanding of what "guesswork" means of course ;) but yeah it's definitely not all 100% correct, and it has to be taken with a grain of salt... but it's also not 100% off ;)
---
I'm currently downloading the Beta &amp; Stress Test!!! So excited. My account is currently subscribed, and started in TBC, for the data point
---
It shows up in the Region/Account dropdown box above the play button on World of Warcraft, if you only have 1 account and the box isn't there, then it'll pop up when you get invited.
---
You think you do, but you don't!
---
Where are you getting 2 hours from?  
---
The [official announcement](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule) says the stress test rund for 2 days.
---
Should test the mobs at Jintha'alor in Hinterlands
---
You nailed it, since consecration is a moderately low threat AoE ability I’m able to keep it down the entire fight.  
---
 Mages and locks have to focus on their AoE, where rets just have consecration in their single target dps making it effortless.
---
That with dragonbreath chili and oil of immolations can create some mean AoE dps.
---
i downloaded it about an hour ago. no email
---
The issue is on every single one of these threads someone links a video from 2006 that shows the numbers are inline, then the vocal minority realizes they're wrong and moves the goal posts.
---
It's happened with RFK, DM, SFK, WC and those level 50 mobs from dead wind pass, and now it happened with  Rhahk’zor.
---
These devs have a laundry list of current issues to fix. I'm a software developer and I deal with this stuff at work. Someone screams everything is broken, it gets escalated to dev, we check and it's something simple and they didn't do their due diligence, but it's a whole ordeal.
---
Did the same but happened to get the stress test server! Don’t lose hope my friend!!!!
---
John in more trash than his GF but don’t get me started in Trevor and Doug..... I’d be here all night with those two trash trucks.
---
Not likely according to you - sorry I missed the part where you (some rando I haven’t seen on here in a year on this sub) get to decide what is and isn’t legitimate to report.
---
And you're an idiot
---
Lol blatantly not true. How many assholes do you have to blow shit out of? Where are you even getting this from? From what the Nost team and Blizzard themselves have said, Nostalrius was absolutely the catalyst for moving Classic forward.
---
The years I spent playing on pservers have helped pass the time, wax nostalgic, and in general be in a better state of mind.
---
I got in. 
---
I re-subbed on the 15th May, not played a single expansion since TBC. I am an early 2006 player.
---
they did a stress test only wave around 5:00 EST
---
I woudnt expect a regular wave until Thursday at the earliest.
---
I thought I was on time?
---
? It's very obvious how entitled and mad these pserver people have been on this sub lol. It was massively toxic a few days ago to the point their was upvoted posts about how toxic it was here. Keep making excuses lol but their is definitely a vocal minority of twattish pserver people.
---
super bummed, my husband got in but i didnt T\_T
---
Varies from mob to mob but at least some of them definitely hit a lot harder than normal mobs
---
Shamans also aren’t abundant. I’m sure other guilds will want my totems ;)
---
These are actually getting depressing
---
I got the stress test invite today. 
---
Hopefully they let us play the beta after but I dont think they will.
---
We played as a family back during vanilla, our kid was 10 when we started. We ended up in an awesome casual guild who made him the new member greeter. He was a gnome rogue with engineering who made mechanical squirrels for all of the members :)  He's not interested in coming back, but my partner and I are really looking forward to it :)  There's something to be said for sharing the experience, I wouldn't trade it for anything.
---
Yes, it's stupidly loud.  Especially when you can spam jump (like going up a hill.)
---
He spent so much time talking to himself...he might have been able to enter the world.
---
Streaming is a culture I just don’t get 😐
---
Yes I've been playing on a private server between a Night Elf Warrior which was my first ever class I played and maxed.... so more nostalgic 
---
And what I really like was playing a Dawrven priest. I think the racial buffs are pretty incredible with instant healer when almost dead, fear ward, and stoneform.
---
The only thing I did not like is the EndGame classic 40man raid makeup is only 1 shadow priest so not having the best gear/stats over one other person may restrict me being more solo than anything.
---
But I really like a show priest I think, I'm gonna go try one a instant 60 server right now I think lol
---
I’m in that pic!
---
awesome, thanks.
---
Just unlucky man. I've had a couple bans in the past for being an asshole, and I still got in. Granted it was from Vanilla/BC/and wrath when I got them.
---
Also hoping I can play on a potato. Retail semi-decently on lowest settings and I'm hoping it'll be leaner than that, although it's more likely to have the exact same hardware demands as retail.
---
Can you re explain that? The event is I guess the time frame that they WANT everyone on, but they're leaving it up for a full day? Is that what you're saying?
---
Playable ninja turtles confirmed!
---
They can do whatever they want.
---
hm. damn.
---
Interesting, thank you! Is gnomeregan solvable at 60?
---
I think is Sara fam
---
Literally unplayable
---
Good point.  I wonder if Blizz will resort to artificial means to keep us bottled up.
---
Right!? And he rolled a warrior even! Would be more efficient to roll hunter but warrior is the better bet if you want to kill that which has no life.
---
Thanks T-bizzle
---
I’ll trash your whole group with my mage.
---
I'd like to think I am the reason as I stopped playing when the game went to shit and Blizzard's data clearly indicate in which period I liked the game more
---
w00t
---
😂😂😂
---

---
that guy is a fag, I wish his face wasn't everywhere on youtube when I'm looking for classic wow stuff
---
got in myself, not sure if it was for beta or stress test. likely stress
---
No
---
wait so does yours not say Beta &amp; Stress test? It just says Stress Test? Please respond :D
---
Not too worried about min/maxing as much as we are in having fun :)
---
No, you people running with this delusion are being awfully narcissistic and it has me worried how the community for Classic will turn out.
---
Thats a no
---
Well thats dumb, it would reach so many more people if they ported it with cross play. I can't see how the current gen of consoles couldn't handle it
---
Keep your head up and one should eventually come. My friends who have played since Vanilla didn't get in either. It's frustrating for sure. I'm still hopeful for a regular beta and not just the stress test
---
With classic being "Vanilla in it's purest form" or whatever they want to call it, I am sort of mad right now.  
---
That they couldn't give us a proper class review during vanilla affects us AGAIN, so many years later.
---
Druids or Warrior should go group 2 so that both groups has a tank for dungeons.
---
Unfortunately that's probably against the rules of his work.
---
As I said it’s going back a bit now, I think I just rang them up and told them the story and that I didn’t have the original email and that they changed all the account retrieval stuff. I may be remembering incorrectly but I’m 99% sure I gave them the CD keys from the boxes and some other info to get it back.
---
Pls never
---
If folks go out looking for it, they can still flag themselves.
---
NOMEGALUL
---
Sure seems to be favouring people with accounts from 2004 though?

---
I’ve only been around since 2007, I was quite young as well so I didn’t really start consistently playing until 2008. I might’ve just missed the mark. who knows. if not, I’ll gladly wait until August.
---
hmmmmm with actiblizz focus on mobile i'd not be surprised to see classic on switch at some point
---
Booze MC for me, here we come.
---
Paladins with HoR is still garbage. The HoR usually goes to the highest rank warrior going for R14
---
I don't comment about streamers at all, but good LORD this guy is toxic. He's emotional, he's negative, he's rude, he's basically an asshole. I don't understand why people watch him. He's not nice. He's not fun. He literally just turns into a crying whiny titty baby whenever things don't go exactly his way, from a duel, to pvp, all the way down to loot he wants and opinions he has that others may or may not share.
---
I could give a damn about the downvotes from Asmon fans, but the facts are there. He is not a nice person. And it shows when he streams.

Stitches 120 triple raid anyone?
---
That's some stress testing for Blizz.
---
Unfortunately the set just isn't good for tanking or dps. The shoulders and another piece or two are okay for pvp but other than that offpieces are better for both dps and tanking.

people still dont get asmongold stream is 100% written by blizzard PR department?
---
You'd be at a severe disadvantage since you can't download any add-ons, and mapping that many spells to a controller even with modifiers will be a bitch.
---
I got in!!!!!!!! I can't believe it!  Does that mean I get to stay?!
---
There's only like 50 mobs and 10 quests in elwynn. And there'll likely be hundreds of people around.
---
[Try this instead](https://youtu.be/rscZrZ4JppY?t=1) 0 competition from 1-5 and a ton of flight points.
---
You are right that I don't get to decide what to report, but being a bunch of spergs on reddit is not reporting a bug.
---
I just received an invite to the stress test. I was checking every 30-60 minutes since they first went out a few hours ago. My account was made late 2008 and my little brother who's account was made early 2007 HAS not gotten one yet.
---
If there were separate servers for the console players, sure. Let them have it. Otherwise no. That would be an awful mess. I wouldn't want to end up in a raid wiping because someone's on a controller and the batteries die.
---
It's literally "do the first and only quest available. Then do the second and only quest available"

I'm more excited for the crazy chain to upgrade them.
---
This sucks. No beta inv, no stress test inv. Mid-2007 player, played several betas with bug reporting, played the demo. Feelsbadman, oh well.
---
I got in.  Subbed a week ago for the first time since 2012.  Account was made in 2004.  Pretty excited for hogger raids!
---
There's literally a guy down-thread unironically saying he wished those two were gone too. :/
---
What class is that? It's cool to start with a shield and mana.
---
I don't see why everyone is so opposed.
---
my guess would be, they're just testing layering for launch
---
Same boat dude, got a home gym set up to use when flying.
---
considering more complex games like PoE and DayZ are making their way to consoles now, wow will definitely get there at one point, but its more likely to be retail than classic
---
It's not that hard in FFXIV
---
Thats true but consoles accept mouse + keyboard
---
Did phones Even have cameras back then, hmmmmm
---
And he’s terrible at this game while pretending to be some sort of authority

Does he hear the music? Because i made it 2.5 minutes before i had to throw in the towel

That is my understand, correct.

From their blue post on official forums:
---
&gt; We’ll be performing our first stress test for WoW Classic on Wednesday, May 22, from 4–6pm PDT.  
---
&gt;  
---
&gt;...  
---
&gt; The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT).
---
So it actually sounds like it will be up for around 26 hours.
---
Hi, /u/gy-psy
---
Nothing for me.
---
/sadness
---
Absolutely not.
---
I’ve thought about it and totally want to, just a chilled out questing/dungeon/playing with friends kind of stream. But I don’t want to make a super low budget painful to watch experience. I also have to learn how to operate some of the software.
---
It's an act.
---
Yes
---
Just got mine, EU, started in Cata, active sub
---
Holy shit thank you so fucking much
---
zero chance of that happening with all the moves in the game.
---
your right. I was going by memory but I looked it up and it says "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic" to be precise
---
Excited I got into the stress test, have had an account since TBC and just subbed again last week
---
The people that got this wave get to level to 5 for 2 hours.  I'm not sure you missed anythgin.
---
Shit like this is what made Vanilla fun
---
Yeah. Account created day 1, played Vanilla beta. Neither me or my friend in the same situation got in either test.
---
I have a friend who I’ve mentioned this too and he just tells me that I don’t understand the twitch community lol.
---
I got an invite today also for the stress test.
---
consoles have keyboard and mouse support now
---
never i hope
---
These groups are mainly for release night, after we're all around 15-20 we'll mix em up.
---
For us not in the beta but who has played private servers it can be interesting to get an idea of if it's harder or easier than what we are used to.
---
If they decide to release other Classic expansions, I hope they call this one Vanilla Classic, so the VC vs VC wars can begin
---
too soon to tell probably
---
What he does on stream 8 hours a day doesn't have much to do with what he's like as a person. He's found a character that entertains people and he plays that character. If you can make $300,000 a year or whatever from doing that than yeah, that's probably what you're going to do.
---
I'm pretty sure that's just what time all the GMs and devs will be online to monitor things.
---
I actually had this same conversation with my fiance on the couch yesterday.
---
Me: "Babe, we need to talk real quick. It's serious"
---
Her: "Oh yeah?"
---
Me: "WoW classic is coming out. It's a re-release of a game I fell in love with 15 years ago. It's like a black hole. I don't think I'm going to be able to resist it. I just felt like you should be aware of what's likely to come."
---
By the end of it, I think I talked her into pocket healing me. lol
---
Without Omar having figured out the modern client tech, Nostralius would have meant NOTHING. Blizzard couldn’t have even LEGALLY released a 1.12 client if they WANTED TO, let alone the technical debt that would’ve made it the stupidest decision ever. 
---
Nostralius wasn’t important. They had the most followers, the most user data, and the most community buy in *at the time Blizzard overcame the only issue that mattered*, the technical one.
---
No it actually is not! Nobody Knows and its all over the place :D
---
https://youtu.be/WtR0fT3Hz3M
---
Nobody is even talking about that. The problem is when blizzard tests something thats being reported, people go "okay but actually I meant this", and then blizzard tests it, and again people move the goalposts instead of admitting they were wrong.
---
What inaccuracies do you see? Most of the pre-raid items are similar to other guides, I figured it wouldn’t be perfect, they never are.
---
on this subreddit a scrub is someone who's a vanilla scrub. whoever you're describing is not in this video. gladiator wasn't a thing in vanilla, FYI just to blow your mind, scrub.
---
These are amazing. Thanks for sharing them!
---
Im pregnant
---
That's what I was curious about. Got into the Beta and Stress Test, I wonder if they'll allow everyone who got into the stress test into the actual beta after tomorrow night to push the servers a bit.
---
I don’t think the current wow devs have the ability to make classic content after naxx without fucking it up. They’ll most likely just release TBC instead.
---
If you login and only aee the stress test server as a server option you are not in the beta.
---
Not sure why there is confusion about this, thought they were pretty clear. Stress test invite is totally seperate thing from a beta invite, and does not increase your chances of getting a beta invite over someone that wasn't in the stress test.
---
Bigger market on mobile. More children
---
yea ill be grinding mobs to level 12 then hitting up LM while people are questing.
---
Yep
---
3 months ago this sub trashed Blizz and had 0 faith. Hopefully everyone else starts to trust them as much now.
---
&gt; I don't comment about streamers at all, but good LORD this guy is toxic. He's emotional, he's negative, he's rude, he's basically an asshole. I don't understand why people watch him. He's not nice. He's not fun. He literally just turns into a crying whiny titty baby whenever things don't go exactly his way
---
I have not yet seen the video, but I am 100% confident you're talking about Asmongold.
---
You should indeed feel happy buddy, there's many others who have missed out not just on the Beta, but also this coming stress test, myself and many friends have not received any invites, and I don't think we will.
---
Have fun and happy testing!
---
So he is like 9/10ths of the Classic WoW community then. I guess he fits right in.
---
Hold her horses! I have to get BfA AND have an active sub? I reluctantly got Legion when my nephew started playing but never BfA... I have to now pay for BfA too? I just resubbed in hopes I'd get a beta spot.
---
acc since 2005, subbed more or less regular, no invite:(
---
Asmon is so average as a human. he does not bring anything to whom who is watching him. Not even a smile.
---
There is so many streamers that are fun to watch, fun to listen, knows how to play.
---
Dang I really hope we get classic BC and WOTLK servers in a few years.
---
Whether you’re correct or incorrect, this is the exact demeanor I don’t want in my community.
---
Correct. They do send an email also, but sometimes not till the next day.
---
&gt; Do you know what it takes to do a 40 man raid?
---
Raids in EQ were 72 people. My guild would run 2 full raids.
---
How about every death permanently reduces the durability of your gear?
---
That would require a lot less tweaking, but still have pretty serious consequences. Especially at the raiding level or for PvP.
---
I think this could work if the permadeath only occurred after a PVP kill.
---
That means no PVE hardcore servers, unfortunately.
---
Have done all of that. But also no mercy for my faction who were in the mafia and sent horde to try and gank me. 
---
I was solo but it was so much fun. Nostalrius Mafia was full on. I got a lot of hate texts.
---
I was orc hunter on release and dwarf on a private server. Might say fuck it and try a night elf after all these years. Shadowmeld will be nice to have fun in world pvp with, although I know I'll get pissed every time a shadow priest devouring plagues me
---
Unless classic literally kill retail and the retail servers all die or overall subs at least double. 
---
Not a chance in hell
---
How could they sell mounts in OSRS? lol
---
That would be them basically now having two MMO's connected to the same sub. That is clearly not their plan
---
This is all a ploy to get us subbed to retail. "You think you do but you don't" is what they said, they still believe that at least over the long term. And P servers back that up they tend to start losing population after AQ releases
---
 Well I def don't wanna play retail at the moment sorry blizz
---
It's a character that fuels the worst of people. I would play on Asmongold's server if it were just him.
---
A server full of his followers? Fuck that.
---

---
Id imagine it is per a bnet account since you can only opt in once for each game per a bnet account and not wow account.
---
It's no long term beta...but I got the stress test invite. My account was created January 2006.
---
I was so hyped when I saw the Beta &amp; Stress Test Tab on my WoW; I downloaded it and et voila you got no beta invite bruh. FeelsOmegaBad man. :(
---
Also talks about being fury, but mentions arcanite reaper. Talks about weapon speed but weapon normalization was in 1.8. They also cant decide if they want to talk about naxx gear or preraiding. Then brings up pvp suggesting gear with no stamina. It’s obviously a troll post.
---
grinding WHAT mobs? there won't be any?
---
No, they really can't. There are technical limitations.
---
Get another warrior!
---
Is your username a reference to HOMM3? By god I hope so
---
Good point! Another detail that is known to the "modern" Classic meta is that there can only be one Rejuvenation applied to each individual. 
---
AFAIK, if two Druids attempt to cast Rej on one target, the Rej with the higher +healing overrides the existing one. Then, if the now-overridden Druid attempts to cast Rej again they lose the mana but nobody gains anything - the spell doesn't even fizzle (or return any error message at all).
---
Think about it this way, is the orc racial helping you when you’re down and depressed because you wish you had the looks of a troll?
---
Classic is a test of endurance and keeping your morale high is KEY to success and longevity of your character.
---
No one can get over the fact of how handicapped warriors are. I for one dont give a crap! I mained Warrior since the day I started playing :p
---
Dreadmist looks like an intellect heirloom set I can't remember which.
---
nope i was killing wolves and looking at the UI
---
I suck at PvP too and get annoyed when people use the simple tactic of running in a circle around me so I lose line of sight. Very relatable!
---
Mine shows up as a PVP realm.
---
wolves bears - murlocs  etc.
---
Aight haha
---
Is same faction griefing a bannable offence?
---
Cause that's always been the most annoying thing about pservers, I hope blizz is willing to butt fuck the assholes of azeroth
---
I won a lot of PvP as a warrior sub 60 and lost a lot too.  However, fighting a pally who heals early and often, and a frost mage isn't a winning fight for a warrior.
---
Beautiful man, this is amazing.
---
Just got into stress test  
---
account created in 2012
---
the same wolves, bears, and murlocs that 500 other players have camped?
---
I put a picture of what it will look like in the post
---
&gt; wait so you want every spec to be good at everything then?
---
I literally never said that, you're arguing in bad faith.
---
Spriests and Shamans are amazing for about 60 seconds at a time because of severe mana issues. Boomkins face the same mana issues but are even less potent.
---
What parts of Arms do you feel are underperforming? Probably none. Fury is the best DPS spec in the game. We aren't talking about every spec being good at everything, we are saying that each spec should be good at *something*, geezus.
---
Just do whatever you want I won’t be that challenging as long as you pick good weapons he’ll be fine
---
I can link the PDF if anyone needs it
---
I just checked at 9:11 EST and I have an invite. I did not have one at 7 EST.
---
Not true!!  Look at all the funny memes!
---
LET ME INNNNNNNN!!
---
Made me laugh lol
---
That would be really cool. It'd have to be a balance. A big enough durability hit so that only a few deaths are enough to completely obliterate your gear, but not oppressive enough so that leveling is impossible due to the reliance on non-repeatable quest rewards.
---
Although, that would incentivize the market for BoEs and white items! Hm. The more I think about that idea the more fun it sounds. Kind of like EvE Online, the king of massive WPvP MMOs, where the saying goes: “Don't Fly What You Can't Afford to Lose.”
---
I wonder if you could also make a flag where deaths by PvP don't count, for griefing purposes.
---
It depends on the server. I played on a couple a few years ago (Nostalrius and Vengeance WoW), the latter of which being a TBC server. AFAIK, Nost had the authentic health values, and any difference from actual values was an error as opposed to an intentional inflation, whereas Vengeance massively buffed mob HP values to compensate for running on the latest TBC patch and bugged mechanics.
---
There are some values I know were preserved, such as Rag/Ony, so I guess it depends on the server. I've not been on pservers since Legion, so I can't speak for the current ones for Vanilla. I did hear that older servers, such as Feenix, had bugs where you could stack consumables/buffs in ways you couldn't in actual Vanilla, as well as flawed(?) boss scripts, so boss HP values were intentionally inflated over there to compensate.
---
Haha we did this too..
---
I know I feel bad for people who got nothing. Your time will come, don’t worry.
---
press the print screen button or take upwards of 30 seconds getting your phone out and taking a picture of your monitor
---
hmmmm
---
Still more fun than retail.
---
It's a product (service?) that costs a monthly fee, man. It's an attempt to capitalize on a market trend, not a museum piece.
---
i never said it wasn't easy, but, it's not "green dps".
---
I love these man!
---
Mine is on a PvP server
---
You should look up Sl spec for locks, and Horde.
---
Same fucking boat. Biggest Blizzard jebait ever.
---
It's becoming apparent people have missed the point of this route. It's quite simple yes, but the value from being on the Goldshire quest line with a handful of people while the other 400 are stuck in Northshire is a massive speed increase both from not having competition on top of continually being a quest ahead of the majority once they do get out of Northshire as well. I don't really know how else to put it.
---
I doubt they will add new context to classic.
---
I would absolutely love for them to add the content they wanted to back in the day though. Things like the Vault dungeon in Stormwind and even the Emerald Dream raid/zone or Karazan crypts etc.
---
I'd love it.. But doubt it will happen.
---
Been watching Asmon awhile, mostly cause Mcconnel cracks me up.. Asmon is not very good, gets carried a lot.
---
Technically i've been playing WoW for literally most of my life if that makes you feel any better.
---
If this is for levelling. Don't spec protection as a warrior. Your main concern in groups is keeping aggro, you survive just fine without any survivability talents (assuming you have a healer). You will be seriously rage starved while levelling, so getting talents that either boosts damage/rage generation or make you in other ways keep aggro better (anger management for example) is priority. If you have a healer you trust going with a two-hander instead of shield is probably also a good idea in many situations for exactly that reason.
---
Says (PvP) on mine. On that other thread it says "Normal" so I have no clue what's going on. I'm EU.
---
i have 2 wow accounts on my bnet account, one was created during the first month of vanilla and was banned before tbc came out.
---
second was created after tbc came out and doesn't have bfa and is only kept alive from redeeming wow tokens
---
still got beta
---
I ran a guild and we had an older guy named Jim in it who was in his mid 60s. Who literally just button smashed, but he was the nicest guy in the world. Miss that guy to this day and its been 10 years since I've talked to him.  WoW has such a great way of letting people of all ages connect.
---
Hi, /u/ThenStart3
---
Enhance ewww make that guy go hunter
---
You just got in right now sir? Or you just checked?
---
Oh baby I just got in at 6:12 PST
---
Warlock / hunter 
---
(I play a prot warrior)
---
except they've specifically said IT IS a museum piece
---
TIL Reddit has profile pictures.
---
Thanks for the update. Makes sense requiring the beta for the information to fill out the database. I'll keep an eye out for the announcements.
---
Haha this is awesome thanks dude
---
These early dungeons were super easy, to the point I could tank them on an enhance shammy... I am really struggling to see the argument people are trying to come up with that they had some crazy damage modifier.
---
People are going to find bugs, but seriously this isn't an issue as far as I can tell.
---
Post the specs.
---
Your username is spot on, retard. Asking for more attention to be paid to the worst specs in the game--nobody debates this--is not the same thing as class homogenization, but please do continue arguing in bad faith and deluding yourself into thinking you're clever. I get a big kick out of it; the dumbest among us are always the most smug.
---
I quit WoW in 1.12 before the first expansion, but I knew a bunch of people who kept a bag of stuff that looked good together as their 'cosmetic' set. I myself farmed up full Shadowcraft on my warrior (when no rogues wanted it, I'm not evil) to wear as a joke. How is that different from transmogs, short of cluttering up my bank?
---
was checking every 5 minutes or so and a min or two before i posted i was in
---
well then lol. either way i didnt even get into the stress test feelsbadman
---
Thanks for the tips! Yea I was planning on speccing mostly arms and fury but using a 1h and shield so I can tank since I will have a healer
---
If you only see stress test on the realm list when you login then you only get to play for the stress test
---
Let's gooo!!
---
Warrior has a built in miss %. Dual wield is a very unreliable leveling choice.
---
But I cleared naxx at 60 bro.
---
I just shit the bed when I (when EU retail went down for maintenance) checked the launcher like I do every day to see if I got a beta invite. I saw the beta &amp; stress test invite. I installed the 5 gigs (to my pleasant surprise). I got a coffee.  I launched. Server down.
---
Those were the most exciting 20 minutes of the year so far.
---
You're all competitive but won't min max......Mkay
---
Windfury weapon thooo
---
From the OP: " *An argument will surely be made that  people’s memories have been corrupted by Private Servers and 15 years of  time passing by. This isn’t an invalid statement, and is probably true...*"
---
You should've just stopped there. Or are people actually claiming that Blizzard is lying about their 1.12 information? It really looks like people are "remembering" that the game was way harder than it really was, particularly on patch 1.12.
---
Until the welsh arrive.
---
this sub needs to start banning these shitty clickbait youtube vids people are posting trying to get more views and ad revenue
---
^mon (because he said he wants to play a troll)
---
The strafe right forums had a ninja looter list. Not sure if that sites still a thing tho.
---
with my hands. Kappa
---
We wouldnt be here today without STpeach
---
How vanilla
---
You get it. We loved every minute together after I transferred my main to its own account. We killed together, we shared victories, and defeat. It is odd, but it strengthened our relationship. You're welcome to my guild as well! Save the post. I'll update with server choice and all that as it happens.
---
That sure sounds like marketing to me, man. :/
---
Came here with the same question, hopefully this gets cleared up
---
I'm hoping for both but I'll take what I can get at this point!
---
It's not me doing anything. Imagine taking an something so obviously tongue-in-cheek that personally. Yikes my guy.
---
Are you clicking?
---
That’s because nobody during Vanilla called it DM, and if you do now, then it’s an alliance private server bias.
---
The "dwarf priest" is what got me XD
---
What you can do it suck my ass 😂
---
4pm pst thursday afternoon. 7pm est so prolly like midnight UK
---
If you this this is an accurate representation of asmongold and not him just being silly/feeding the trolls then you don’t watch asmongold. People are talking down on him but he genuinely is a nice guy but has the twitch personality that makes him money. Just like dr disrespect. Asmongold is very informative and articulate. Most of the time the this is what you see because this is what the kids like.
---
We're not going to switch up our entire faction for the sake of a slight advantage, I'm positive we're still going to do great in wpvp and BGs. Sorry we're obviously not AS competitive as you.
---
Orc/Troll starting zone. https://i.imgur.com/y38soQM.jpg
---
Hell I even switch to the beta client saying “hey blizzard I like beta shit”
---
viewers like you
---
why would you take a day off for a 1-5 stress test
---
Half this sub swears that Private servers are easy and Classic will be some rude awakening for the people who played on them.
---
Then Private servers started to make the game harder.  They would rather been seen as too hard instead of too soft.  This sub still called them easy, broken, anything else to invalidate them.
---
Some of those same Private server players are now playing in the Beta, and finding it easier in some regards.  They submit a bug report because they've had it drilled into their heads that Classic should be harder.
---
The community on this sub continues to hate.
---
yeah at the time where I screenshooted this picture it was PvE but then the server was online for a few min and was changed to PvP
---
No need to create a war. And no, people cant just not vote if they dont want that to happen.
---
Good to know, but I still havent gotten mine. Dec. 2005 is when i started playing.
---
Since you have a healer warriors do really great damage, so playing with a two-hander as much as possible is best. Obviously you still keep a 1h and shield around for whenever things get hard, like any warrior.
---
OP reposting his F Tier video
---
Just so i follow he blinked into the battle for no good reason...he froze the pally but pally broke it and bc he wasted blink he couldn’t kite?
---
just got in too?
---
Lucky bastard how did you get the Beta? Are you a streamer?
---
Yep!
---
I think it's weird that they have nothing to gain by just saying 2004 in guild/general chat, yeah.
---
&gt; Lol I told my wife about classic and she was like No and walked away.
---
That seems like a weird reaction.... 
---
&gt; She was there when I played the first time. 
---
Oh....
---
Oh yes, I know their potential when paired with a healer. Wrecking balls! Cant WAIT!
---
&gt; but the value from being on the Goldshire quest line
---
The earliest you can start questing in Goldshire is level 3, and there's 1 quest. Most start at 4.
---
How do you get 2,700xp to ding 4 to start questing in Goldshire? Killing level 5/6s in a group? [It's slow as fuck to leave and kill levle 5s in a group](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/alu1bz/dumb_thursday_math_rushing_out_of_starting_zone/)
---
I don’t wanna sound overly nerdy, but there’s a lottttt of books to read around the land and plenty of people to talk to :)
---
Yeah, plus an appropriately leveled warrior can spam Shield Block every 5 seconds to minimize half of Verdan’s hits.
---
Woah, gamers really are the most oppressed group
---
Bottom Text
---
Hopefully
---
Have fun guys...seriously! Crossing my fingers for any kind of Beta invite at this point.
---
Beta and Stress Test refers to the client. They share the same client, however when you log in you get the realm list appropriate to your access.
---
Otherwise they’d need to host two copies of identical clients on their CDN. One named beta and one stress test. You’d then need to install both, if you were in the beta and wanted to participate in the stress test.
---
Not at all! 
---
Honestly, I just get insanely lucky I think. I can’t express these emotions at the moment.
---
Ah awesome, thank you :)
---
vw sac x2 &gt; felhunter any day
---
dam lucky. hoping i get into actual beta on friday :(
---
Wow these are incredible. Really really incredible.
---
My account is from the week of release in 2004 and I only got the stress test too, guess I should have been a streamer. lol
---
Wow this sub is weird.
---
I think if they add poll booths, get competent writers, and keep the feeling of Vanilla WoW, it can work.
---
I don't see why they would. I would think having players roam around the world and engaging with each other would only help the stress data.
---
Doug will be very popular and passed around the groups.
---
Keep these coming folks, it's much appreciated!
---
welcome to the stress test

I’m guessing if you got a invite to the stress test that’s not a beta invite? Does everyone get a stress test invite?

Someone in the comment made a good suggestion. Kill the lock pet during a polymorph. Also did he have amplify magic on??
---
The cap doesn't make any sense. Its already a limited time frame, just let people get however high they can get in that time frame that way they will actually want to log in the first place and stay logged in for more than 30-60 minutes which a stress test needs...
---
Arms is significantly better, a slow 2h allows for hamstring kiting and fury dual is a rough leveling spec because of miss chance. There isn't enough +hit on leveling gear and you fight too many things higher level than you.
---
Absolute madman. 
---
The Wire aint got shit on you!
---
Hunter is the best solo class and you can eat and drink while your pet goes in to reduce down time
---
Money = instant.
---
Items = an hour or less 
---
Items with money = an hour or less
---
It simply makes no sense why items with money would follow the same rules as money. Else you could add a copper to make all alt mail instant.
---
Got the invite on a second account that isn't even subbed... my main WoW account (and oldest) did NOT receive the invite.
---
I would take anything at this point. 
---
Glad to have such a brave band of brothers.
---
Hmm I see, ok. :D
---
Damn you just got it like that? I’m happy for you but admittedly also jealous. I can’t wait for August. It’s going to be great.
---
Correct, except that you only need about 800 exp if you're 3 1/2. it would only take 10 mobs solo or 20 mobs in a 2 man group. In a group your killing them x2 as fast so its basically the same time in that scenrio. Also you would literally be the only people in that area having no trouble finding mobs to grind. Whereas in Northshire you will be running around trying to tag mobs, esp worse if your class can't tag mobs well.
---
&gt;The mobs are green to him which means he will be taking way less damage due to the enemies not being able to deal crushing blows.
---
Mobs can only deal crushing blows if they have more than 15 weapon skill over your (base) defense, ie. if they're 3 or more levels higher than you. So while you're not wrong (green mobs won't deal crushing blows), the mob being green isn't a requirement for them not being able to crush you. Basically orange mobs and above can deal crushing blows to you.
---
I'm trying to mentally prepare him to be used and abused 😂
---
Yup, both mouse buttons, or w,a,s,d + right click (moves camera) to move. You'll use both, just depends on what the current situation is. 1 second you could using both mouse buttons to run forward, but next second you need to run away with strafe run left/right + right click to be rotating camera, all just depends. Looks confusing in text, but once you're actually doing it you'll get the hang of it pretty fast
---
That exact post says that the numbers are off by using 2 things, an old post(have no way to say if its true) and that the numbers werent the same as other databases(pservers).
---
&gt;reddit is cancerous as fuck.
---
I am wondering, even though damage values are lower, if there will be totally forgotten mechanics in the lvl 40+ dungeons that do make them harder, just in a different way.
---
&gt;  Renew is stronger than Rejuv 
---
Unfortunately, you're right about this one :(
---
&gt; priests are much, much better healers overall 
---
Priests are the most *versatile* healers in Classic, Priests are the **only** healing class with a "complete" healing kit - they have an appropriate healing tool for any job:
---
* ST (Single Target) fast heal: Flash Heal
---
* ST big heal: Greater Heal
---
* HoT: Renew
---
* Group Heal: Prayer of Healing, Holy Nova\* (not used in *most* standard healing cases)
---
* Out of combat res: Resurrection
---
* Debuff Removal: Abolish Disease, Dispel Magic 
---
* Emergency Scenarios: Power Word: Shield, Desperate Prayer\* (self heal for Dwarf &amp; Humans only)
---
* Buffs for group/raid: Fortitude, Divine Spirit, Shadow Protection, Fear Ward\* (Dwarf Priests only, not big deal if not Dwarf Priests)
---
The above said, a key detail to remember is that Priests have the most *diverse* kit, but aren't necessarily the most mana efficient healers, or best group healers, or best single target healers - those are Druid, Shaman and Paladin correspondingly. Priests can satisfy each of these roles adequately though, and are enjoyable to heal with overall. This doesn't mean they are the best!
---
omar, yo

The scarab lord in my guild has 0 interest in classic whatsoever

oh god the starting quests are going to be so much worse than private servers arent they

I think we are here today thanks to the good folks at Squarespace.

I love me some squarespace.

Don't worry I bet this rando is gonna get dumpstered in stv and never play again lol

It's best to level with a 2hander. I think you should go fury 1-39 and then at 40 respec to arms for mortal strike
---
3440x1440 Ultrawide please.
---
Great work btw!
---
Looking forward to it.
---
Bruh do you have any idea how long AV takes?

I’m honestly surprised that thebmobs were 50% correct on private servers.

Nobody debates this?
---
What?
---
Haven't you seen retail? They were approaching true symmetry in the name of balance lol. Everyone has everything. 
---
Balance = symmetry, again welcome to the most basic of game development concepts. . . 
---
Balanced map? needs symmetry. Same with classes. Differences in kit surprise will make a hierarchy.  You need to shrink those differences 
---
Paladin needs gap close. Paladin needs some answer for using mana instead of rage. Paladin needs something like mortal strike. Ret paladin needs some symmetry with warrior or other good specs if they wanna PvP as a bottom rung choice.

I did that the other day. I didn't even register it as a bug, I didn't even register it as "wrong" lol.
---
But then again I was ghost walking through STV and fatigue reseting in Ratchet, so I was preoccupied with that.
---
A lot of his "elitist behavior" is an act, but in this clip he is obviously getting legitimately triggered.
---
Healers don't level in their healing spec tho, so that's not really valid.
---
Do i really need to practice 1-60 ? i mean 1-40 multiple times to get self ahead and rest  should go smooth  right ?
---
On both sides it seems.
---
You misspelled Valor....... :p
---
I have an error: 
---
I was not invited to the stress test. Help
---
I still have my old Auctioneer data thanks to perpetual backups of the Interface directory. :-D
---
Mind if I ask what time the email came through to you?
---
On the bright side you can still click "Cinematics" at the main menu and check out their opening cinematic for classic!
---
This. I dont understand people. They just don't get sarcasm and dry humor. Asmongold's stream goes above the heads of almost everybody. He's so sarcastic, so frequently that 99% of viewers just dont get it and rage at hime.
---
Its fucking hilarious
---
Didn’t exist until tbc
---
Orc hunters are the best PvP hunters
---
Pretty much. He should have saved blink for the Hammer of Justice stun and then continued to kite. Frost Mage can easily kite a Ret pala into oblivion in vanilla if he plays smart. Venruki played cocky and reckless, and it cost him here.
---
I distinctly remember being able to 3-4 man DM with an organised group that was decently geared but I also remember it being hard to pug, I honestly think scrub tanks and healers combined with scrub DPS pulling random mobs is what made it hard and that's just not something we will experience in a majority of groups like we used to.
---
I still remember no one dying in a pug DM and someone calling us an Imba group too lol, but I bet zero death runs will be the norm now for most content.
---
I've tested both with a variety of gear and at different levels on my own PS. As I said arms is better but fury is within a few percent, not a large difference. Piercing howl is very nice in many situations, enrage is a great talent, getting mass OP procs is really nice. By far the biggest difference is sweeping strikes is amazing at multi pulls but you can really only exploit that with a healer.  
---
There's nothing magical about dual wield miss chance that makes the spec immediately bad. Your rage generation is similar in both specs and your special hit chance is exactly the same.
---
Swooooosh
---
Ahh just heard about on this sub, played a mage back in the day lol
---
[DONT GO INTO THE LONG GRASSSSSSSSSSSS!!](https://youtu.be/Cr1MvzAr26E?t=10)
---
It’s not like these pservers had no information to go on. Besides the mangos core as a starting place, there’s was a ton of theory crafting, class guides, profession guides, leveling guides,etc. there was a ton of information that’s still available today. I know, because I reviewed that information while playing pservers. If something didn’t match up, things were discussed ad nauseam. Changes were definitely made, intentionally and unintentionally, but to say they had no idea if anything was right is an injustice to those pservers and their developers.
---
Sweet atmosphere, you got to wittness two mighty fine horde crackheads doing there thing
---
People make mistakes too you know. They may remember things wrong and bring it up. It's good that people are trying to find bugs.
---
its because most of these constant stream haters lack social interaction on a daily basis.
---
are they still giving keys?
---
Probably so. Worth a try either way. That’s super cool.
---
Apparently not, even though Customer Support Agents seem to imply it, there's a lot of suggested evidence to the contrary, as people who claim not to be a content creator nor on the friends- and family-list are saying that they received the beta without an active subscription.
---
Perhaps it's not required, but I'm pretty sure it improves your chances a lot compared to an inactive account.
---
I literally just posted a similar post and it was removed for rule 7 even though I had a fleshed out question in the comments.
---
The mods here are pretty weird considering the number of shit posts I see all day.
---
Grats man none the less. I'm installing mine as we speak haha.
---
Back in my day this was called "a joke" and trolling was a bad thing
---
Mana as a warrior? I can confirm that this is fake. ;]
---
His sarcastic/dry humor just goes over the heads of too many kids. I feel bad that they take every word he utters so seriously.
---
Yeah adding the screen shots was a nice touch.
---
They are not doing e-mails it seems. They are flagging accounts as beta active and you can download it through the drop down in the battlenet launcher.
---
Lol this is amazing.
---
I feel like people are probably better at games in general than they were when they were playing Vanilla, so now in actuality it seems easier than they remember.
---
Is there any class in particular you think you're most in need of? Also how exactly does loot council work? Are there more factors than just topping the meters?
---
Launch Day Account, Collector's Edition WoW.. Not in beta :)
---
I honestly have no idea about the rules, lol. 
---
Nothing could wipe the stupid smirk off my face right now, I’m glad to have you along as well :)
---
It's good for hunter. Ok for warlock.
---
Garbage for rogue. Have you ever tried to face tank lvl 37 elite mobs at lvl 32?
---
I feel people misunderstand the difficulty of vanilla. When people say it was harder they don’t mean raiding. They mean questing, gaining gold. Obtaining BIS, mounts, professions. Things such as micro managing pets, farming herbs for potions, getting attuned, getting keys, literally taking 30 mins to travel places. Finding a group of competent people then running to dire maul and taking hours to do so. Everything wanting at the convenience of pressing 1 button and going it was harder than that.
---
same just got it a few minutes ago, NA account, started in august of 2006. Quit in MoP. Resubbed the day they announced you needed a sub for a beta invite. I tried to intentionally leave the client open all the time , maybe they have some sort of metric that knows how much youll be able to play and factor that in in some way? Probably not and is entirely random since they want people of all and any type of backgrounds / playstyles to know what to expect on launch day.
---
Hello 90% Rogue population!
---
I would love that... but no, I doubt the "muh nostalgia" playerbase will want any changes to happen.
---
Why when I launch the game I'm brought to a realm list with just a greyed out "Stress test" realm option?
---
What Bishop stated is exactly what happened. 
---
Logged out of a different game and checked just in case and boom there it was!
---
Are the servers officially temporarily down or has it just not started yet?
---
&gt;you're arguing in bad faith.
---
Not even close. using your flawed logic of every spec needs to be useful in every part of the game which is the exact opposite of what makes classic wow feel special. which is why you play the CLASS and not a spec in classic wow
---
&gt; What parts of Arms do you feel are underperforming
---
Raid DPS, solo farming, self sustain and leveling.
---
&gt;Fury is the best DPS spec in the game
---
doesnt mean its good at small scale PVP, large scale PVP, farming, and leveling.
---
do you see the point now? some specs are good in raids and shit at other things. some specs are good at other things like balance and ele being the go to pvp specs. if you buff those are the things they are bad at and dont buff things like arms at PVE or fury at PVP then your just unbalancing the game.
---
prot paladins, balance druids, ele shamans, shadow priests all have things theyre incredible at, its just not raiding. just like something like fury is amazing for raids and shit for aoe farming or how you wouldnt play daggers if your trying to level on a rogue.
---
different specs to different things, stop trying to unbalance the game
---
I was the one screaming for a duel
---
That's exactly what I remembered doing, adding 1c to make alt mail instant.
---
nah bros i was gloating to my bud on messenger. it was most convenient to snap a pic in the moment.
---
You can watch the cinematic from the main menu at least
---
no phone mentioned my dude
---
But it will have to because that was the nature of classic. To get things done you actually need to have a good reputation, help people, and grow your realm's community. Guilds are important, professions will be spammed in trade again. I'm one of the people that believe WoW was ruined by LFG and cross-realm.
---
You know what is even more annoying? Having people like you turn every thread into a crusade against private servers when all we want is for the game to behave as accurately as possible.
---
Man that confused me for so long. I looked at the map, saw "Scarab Wall", but also saw a level 20 human fighting an ogre. I felt like I was going crazy trying to remember where this could possibly be located. Fortunately, my memory wasn't the problem.
---
They dont/cant. Have to grp up.
---
I find joanas guide to be a hunter leveling guide. Which is how it should be described. It's kinda miss leading for new players for how much praise it gets from fans. If you try to do some of the things in it you will greif yourself till you are tilted as fuck, calling joanna a liar pos
---
Just got mine too. Account since beta vanilla. Only renewed game time when the announced the beta.
---
Why arent the mages ae'ing? this is some dps cheese from cheeseman &lt;3
---
Voting would be a pretty bad idea for WoW.
---
How do you convince everyone in TBC that flying is going to end up ruining the game. Everyone was so stoked about flying. The chance *to fly* in WoW!? Who the hell would argue against that!?  You'd be an anti-fun enemy if you blocked flying and other “epic” additions like that.
---
What made Vanilla great were the following:
---
* A relatively small team that was passionate about making a cohesive, **holistic**, closed MMO
---
* A clearly defined end goal: Level 60, which inhabited the same exact world as level 1s.
---
* Every system was built with the whole picture in mind—nothing was added nor removed without looking at the big picture.
---
This is why any progression in MMOs is doomed to following the retail path. Even back in Vanilla there were players who blamed the addition of 40-man raids for *killing* what made WoW great.
---
Kevin Jordan, one of the principal Vanilla designers streams on Twitch and I'll always remember an example he gave, it went something like this:
---
&gt; Lets say metrics tell us that Paladins are refusing to do Sunken Temple because it turns out there's nothing worth it for them there. What do you do? Do you consider that as an organic outcome of a naturally divergent world, or do you see it as a problem to be fixed?
---
&gt; Lets say they decide to incentivize Paladins by adding a drop just for them. Sure, now Paladins start running ST, but that item is going to be better than items from elsewhere. If a blacksmith made a comparable item, now they're disincentivized from making it. There are huge ramification to “shoring up” content. By trying to patch every hole you've ended up destroying the original flow.
---
The more I read about and discuss MMO design the more I'm on the side of MMOs completely being redesigned from the ground up for each expansion.
---
I remember. I was spending a lot of time at a really cool cyber cafe back then. Great group of regulars, and a few had beta access, so we all watched them play. It was really a special time. I wish cyber cafes were still a thing. I enjoy the convenience of gaming at home but that feeling of community was really fun.
---
Dual spec isn’t in vanilla, so if you intend to level and heal dungeons, you have some hard choices to make
---
I would wager most people didn't actually level DURING 1.12, so with talents/other changes its very possibly easier than remembered for some, I leveled my mains prior to 1.5 so I really don't have much reference for the 1.12 versions of leveling content.
---
&gt;I like the sustainability of mage, being able to craft your own drinks is pretty handy
---
Alterac Manna Biscuit is cheap and good.
---
Yeah, I gotta say I was pretty excited when I saw it, only to have my dreams shattered moments later
---
Recommend specs are the same as retail but with smaller storage requirement due to vanilla being significantly smaller than retail. Unsure how it would actually work out on a dog shit rig. Best of luck m8.
---
Dual wielding arms is awful. You get minimum value from sweeping strikes, mortal strike, Deep Wounds. It really is designed for 2handers.
---
😂😂😂😂
---
 Nice.  Congrats and enjoy.   Hope to see ya soon
---
just now or just checked?
---
they didnt spend the last few years making import tools to not continue to use them, TBC is practically a certainty.
---
You bastard
---
Decursive broke after the first expansion. I'm pretty sure, or there was at least a workaround till then involving macros and one of the programmable add-ons. I want decursive for classic. AQ is impossible without it. I have a Grand Marshall Shadow priest, and I got that rank one or two weeks prior to the end of GM. Pretty sure, I was decursing when it was raid time, prior to getting to the higher ranks.
---
There's a bunch of balance changes for making those 40 man raids runable without it.
---
Why the fuck are people making a guide on how to do 8 quests???
---
Days, I hope.
---
Oct 2005 account w/ a bit over 2 years /played. Not in beta :)
---
Even AQ40 Gear is better than the best pvp gear iirc. the r14 2h weapons is kinda equal with ashkandi (BWL endboss) for some classes aswell.  
---
So yes, you absolutely have to raid when you want the best gear.
---
I just checked about 10 minutes ago and it wasn't on my launcher, checked again and it just popped about 3 minutes ago.

Dont do me like that man
---
Manual Crowd Pummeler
---
Gnomes are great, I will meet you for that drink to discuss further short issues.
---
Powerleveling fishing and farming one specific item for maybe the first day or two. After that gonna start leveling and hope i can actually get some quests done.
---
I know people who started in the actual vanilla beta that don't have a beta invite. The guy actually reported bugs way back in the day too.
---
Just now
---
Mine JUST popped up too! Sadly it's only Stress Test but hey, I'll take it!
---
lol the amount of people who got in just makes me feel even worse, over 2/3rds right now.
---
Wow after seeing the results I feel even worse about not getting in
---
I thought it was Faerie Fire
---
Live to Win will be blasting my first 72 hours
---
Can confirm they are rolling out, i checked at 7 EST and nothing, checked again just now 940 EST and i got an inv for the stress test. Account created in aug of 2006.
---
If he's able to create a character then he is in the actual beta. Stress test server isn't open yet and only beta players can see the beta server.
---
I don't think many people would be opposed, as long as the buffs aren't egregious. For instance if you buff something too much, classes/specs that don't perform as well might go from being sub-optimal to non-viable. That would be a very bad thing.
---
I think it's more important for the game to feel like it was than it is for it to actually be like it was. Vanilla fans have been happy with private servers for years, and if private servers were harder than the original game, maybe being more like private servers is the solution. That's Classic's audience, after all.
---
If you're able to create a character then you're in the actual beta. Stress test server isn't open yet and only beta players can see the beta server.
---
Yeah I mean even someone who played it live has had almost 13 years to misremember things. My perception of games I played that long ago would probably change if I booted them up again today too.
---
Im pretty sure its beta too, they are just sending out a new wave of invites to prepare for the stress test coming up
---
I just got it literally minutes ago too, I’m sure it’s just stress test tho.
---
Agreed. To me the fact that 99% of the people didn't even get into naxx before Burning Crusade came out, means that for 99% of the people the expansion came too fast. The pace and content shouldn't be made for the 1%.
---
And if someone points out that wow is more than just raids I strongly agree. But why then whenever someone suggests new content it always means "new raids" and the justification for new content is always "stuck in latest raid"?
---
 IF they make new content I hope they make raids something fun to do but not necessarily the only way to attain good items. Crafting and 5man dungeon rewards should definitely be boosted, and I am fine that their difficulty would be boosted too. No changes, but if they have to come that's my take on it.
---
Yeah 2.0 breaks decursive. Decursive is a feature in 1.12. The raids, especially Naxxramas are balanced around requiring it. It was 2.0 and 3.0 where more active playstyles were added.
---
I checked an hour ago and didn't have it, checked again 10 min ago and have it.
---
Tfw you get into the stress test but work tomorrow :):):):)
---
Because there have been a ton of changes to the backend since then, tons of anticheat anti exploit stuff, along with improving data flow for a more seemless experience. Doing the legwork now pays dividends down the line if they have to hotfix something or if they decide to do future content.
---
that content isnt tuned for a raid of lowbies to get it, esp when lowbies are 30s. lvl 1 raids killed hogger for example. you wont miss every single hit that you do on a skull. if the skull isnt elite, no reason it should be doing insane damage that would 6 shot a lvl 56-60. Healers and lots of them trivialize it . good thing imo.
---
That's your opinion and I have a different one.
---
&gt; I thought about NightElf Druid but from the quick facts ive done it seems to be hard to find late game dungeon and raid groups since most only require 1 or 2 druids for group makeups.
---
For dungeons, healers are always in demand, for raids, while you are correct that most people only bring 1-2, druids are also exceptionally underplayed in classic.
---
The real underlying problem is many players have a chip on their shoulder because they didn’t play on private servers and they want to invalidate the experiences of players who did. 
---
The beta is about testing, not about you being right or your beef with private servers. If Blizzard says something is working as intended it is. In this case they tested one boss and confirmed the damage is working properly, but overall damage instance damage should be compared to the reference client and confirmed accurate.
---
It's not a day or two, it's a two hour window from 4-6pm.
---
I used a bunch of them for housing other games I had lost the cases to until they switched to an actual card holder inside.
---
This was what I was worried about. I hope that those of us that got into the Stress Test will be placed into a separate pool with a greater chance of BETA access.
---
me aswell, although we would need to grind humanoids for bag money, which isnt easy on new servers.
---
I just got the ability to download too, appears I can't play on the beta servers, just the stress test :/
---
Yeah that made me so fucking depressed
---
There's a stress test tomorrow that's for a wide audience. You have access to that, but not the full beta
---
I'm not a streamer or content creator and got in the 2nd day it was out. It's just more waves which is great because the beta servers are starting to feel pretty quiet atm. I hope they increase the cap or something so people get back into it!
---
I'm hoping that after the stress test, we will get beta access. Crossing fingers! Right now all I have available is the offline Stress Test server.
---
that bucket hat is ｓａｄｂｏｙ　（ヽヶヴ）
---
 ａ　ｅ　ｓ　ｔ　ｈ　ｅ　ｔ　ｉ　ｃ
---
It's different because you are physically wearing the gear, rather than just making it look like it, while keeping the stats of your actual gear.
---
To be honest, you can click and keyboard turn and still play quite well, especially in PVE. It's at best a sign of a worse player, but it doesn't necessitate that.
---
Stress test
---
They fired this employee and had his family arrested
---
True
---
 I mean, you could not even get to play the stress test like some of us
---
fml
---
I did, can't wait to play for two hours tomorrow and I've cancelled all other plans during that time-frame.
---
It's at 7pm and it's limited to 2 hours
---
Yes. Forsaken have an early lvl 5 or 6 quest to kill some and I died numerous time attempting it.
---
DM is still around on live servers...

Fucking kill me
---
Gamers rise up
---
Its just the stress test, you'll get to play to level 5 for like 2 hours tomorrow and then its done.
---
&gt; Theres people who pretend to know classic but all their knowledge obv from pservers
---
Not only that, 15 years ago IS A LONG DAMN TIME. Most people's memory won't be so reliable as to be trustworthy.
---
instead of _just_ down voting me, would anyone care to explain why we should use world chat over LookingForGroup chat?
---
Exactly
---
aw rip
---
Not anymore.  You used to be to almost instantly chat with a GM in game.  Now you're lucky if they respond to your ticket within 24 hours.  They are always really cool though.
---
Take what you can get in my opinion.  Some won't even get to stress test.
---
just play a lot with different people - be nice and respectful! This will lead to you getting added to friendslists, which in turn will net you some discord/teamspeak invites and ultimately guild invites / roster join requests
---
I know you're just trying to help but this sounds like a win-win to me.
---
Dude this is totally fake. A warrior with mana?
---
Honestly I got nothing left to say to you, you’re obviously stuck in your ways.  Is it that hard to admit the model you seem to think is so great actually sucks?  Look how unhappy people are with BFA, you’re delusional.  
---
At least I’m not that guy who is subbed to classic wow reddit so he can shit on it and praise retail, yuck...
---
Yeah, most of my leveling definitely came before 1.12. Most of what I remember from vanilla was pre-1.12, I think that's an issue with a lot of us--if we started earlier most of our memories will be older vanilla. It definitely skews perceptions until I realize a lot of what I remember was probably before a lot of class balance and formula changes.
---
Unfortunately the same for me as well, my friend. 
---
Even if it’s only for a day, I’m still very fortunate and grateful I even get the opportunity to run around and hear all my favorite music and chat with some people I run into. Hope you have a good time as well!
---
In a group of casters.. lol
---
Learn how to jump-shoot. Basically just turning your character real quick to fire off a shot while still running away. Concussion shot is your best friend while doing this. Know how big your dead zone is as well as you don't want any caster standing in it while you're stuck in place, Scatter Shot is the only attack I remember that could be used in the deadzone.
---
Me and my buddy did the same thing, though more focused on PvP music.

Mage is the best AoE class so and what I used personally.  I can see lock being very good too standing in the back dotting and coil anyone that tries to get the jump on you.

Definitely not everyone because I haven’t gotten either :/

&gt; Provide free potions to group members as an alchemist
---
Lol wut
---
saved, and looking forward to jumping back in. We played both sides and are planning to do it again :)
---
Yea what I thought, guess we'll see. Thanks man
---
I'm sure I will. Would really just like to to start getting accustomed to leveling again.  Oh well. I even added a subscription to my early 2005 account just in case I got selected on that one, ironically, I was selected on my cata era account.
---
Met my husband in BC. Been married since 2009. Heard of Classic and we're heading on in. I'm going Warrior and he's going Holy Paladin 8)
---
That’s hilarious. Love both of them, but you can hear Esfand’s confusion. “Uhh, Ven, what are you doin?”
---
I'm in. US, played since 11/04 off and on through WoTLK. Re-subbed a couple days ago.
---
It defiantly shares assets since the download was only like 4gb with bfa already installed. Not separating them is a good design choice, since it saves having to download redundant files, about 3gb worth iirc other people saying their downloads were 7gb.
---
Hi, /u/pikkl_rikk
---
can you tell him collect my email too? i'm your friend :(
---
Nevermind my soul is crushed
---
im not sure resistance materials will be that valuable early, MC and BWL are way too easy for them to be in high demand in my opinion
---
I subbed a day after the announcement, and I am in the stress test.
---
Probably just the stress test, don’t get your hopes up.
---
I hope lots do!
---
Average age of vanilla players was 28. Now granted people playing classic might have been in their teens at the time, but at least back in 2005 most weren’t
---
Yep, just got stress invite and subbed two days ago
---
Mostly because ironfoe is a one hander and using a single one hander isn’t particularly great for dps :p
---
If you sub RIGHT NOW at this second you still have a CHANCE to get into the beta.
---
I resubbed the day after the announcement and got into stress today.
---
Why is everyone naked ?
---
Still no beta here, but sort of relieved about not being in the stress test tomorrow, that's tabletop night here.
---
We are alliance, thinking about pve this go instead of pvp. Really wanting top relax through content. And own bgs (my side goal)
---
I remember. I played a Tauren Hunter in Beta and thought it was the greatest. Then a played a Paladin and got hooked.
---
Then launch happens and Paladin changes and so on from there.
---
Now I’m just sitting here waiting for an invite so I can enjoy this game again
---
how about those that sub with game time and not recurring sub?
---
Beta &amp; Stress test, but yeah monkaS
---
Ill paypal you $50 right now to have him put my email on the list

Buddy subbed a few days ago and got into stress test. I have been subbed for months, played vanilla and almost all expansions and got nothing. Seems random and I am ok with that
---
Don't lose hope. Mine just popped and my wife got super pissed (her account is from 2004, mine is MoP) then a few minutes later she got hers. it'll come.
---
The way they like to. Not the player base likes to. Metrics support vanilla to wrath are the best designs for the game. The MMO community has shrunk and divided a little but the gaming community has only grown. MMOs have lost populations as they have gotten easier
---
For real. I'm even seeing people say stress testers should get closed beta priority. Like fuck outta here lmao just be happy that you're actually getting to play.
---
They've become the ultimate trolls now. They delight in player anxiety. I mean, why else would they include layering
---
I didn't downvote you, but on the biggest private server right now most people know about and use LookingForGroup. 
---
It's sometimes the most active chat, too, especially for more serious groups that aren't just questing.
---
&gt; Now we're finding out private servers actually had things tuned too difficult.
---
This isn't surprising. I mean you sometimes see Naxx and AQ guilds that had the dead specs ( DPS Feral/Shaman/Paladin ) with them.
---
It only makes sense that the content was far easier if they could afford bringing useless classes.
---
...What? Warriors are over-saturated yet you'll still have a perma raid spot because they are so good.
---
The server will be up for a day. But the cap is level 5
---
Totally agree with your core point, but isn't 
---
&gt; this would not be happening if it wasn't for Vanilla private servers, mainly Nostalrius, and that is a fact.
---
the same as 
---
&gt; If private servers players did not actively play Vanilla private servers, Blizzard would not have gauged significant interest in Classic, and that is another fact
---
? Doesn't that mean it *isn't* another fact, but in fact the same fact?
---
I'm convinced that it is entirely random. I re-subbed 2 days ago and got my invite for the stress test. (Account created during Cataclysm and I have played every expansion since but dropped during early BFA)
---
I'm referring to my group of friends and referring to  wpvp and leveling.
---
Active sub?
---
Yes, if you get in 5mins late you'll be hours behind the first wave.   
---
It will be interesting to see how the community reacts after months of screaming #NOCHANGES when they experience how bad lvl 1-10 is on populated vanilla zones.
---
Was able to jump 3 times in the stress test server before it got shut down....and it was glorious
---
Got into the stress test just now on my wifes account which was started in 2013. Yet my account from 2008 got nothing
---
I'd pay 15 bucks to experience it. 15 dollars is not a lot of money to me. The problem is I dont want blizzard to have that 15 bucks.
---
That’s what an MMO is all about though man . And classic does it the best !
---
I got one and I didn't buy the game till 2008.
---
He's excited about the weapon buff, not the totem lol
---
those log-in screen wardrums...

---
They should’ve never left me in charge of my personal information. Me and noreply@blizzard have a lot of catching up to do.
---
Oh hey, I grouped with you and buffed you a few times a few days ago in durotar (esh, troll priest)
---
I remember playing a Tauren Hunter in the open beta too and loved it but then rolled something completely different at launch. Feel like a lot of people made the same decision (don’t remember why we all changed).
---
I fucking feel ya lol, I might have Woohoo!’d loud enough to annoy neighbors and don’t even have anything to show for it. I feel mad trolled, happy, but still trolled.
---
The servers are up for a day. They just want everyone on for that 2 hour period. But still seems like a little much to miss work for.
---
It was an archived post on Allakhazam from 2006.  And the database he's referring to is not a specific pserver database.
---
More importantly, people in the thread are referencing old videos and such.  Bornakk himself just commented in that thread telling people to continue submitting information, which means that it's still a topic of interest to Blizzard.
---
If you want to pvp at all you will need to raid to get raid gear, or else you will get smashed and never be able to rank at all
---
You have my support friend, stay strong.
---
Theres also no email for the invite.
---
He works at riot
---
99% of people in the beta are using world chat atm... :-(
---
I dont quite get the desire to play beta. Everything in classic is about building his own char (RPG) in a closed off community (server). Beta reset takes both these things away, so whats left? the joy of spamming frostbolt for 10hours?  
---
How people consider spending hundreds of dollars for a tiny chance to get into the beta is beyond me. (people even bought the 15th anniversary CE in hopes to get priority o.O )
---
Ahhh okay, that makes sense.
---
Is that some sort of rehab program you’re on?
---
I would guess that it will be a lot different this time around.
---
I love these drawings.. i mean.. screenshots, way too much.
---
I’ll Rez you!
---
This sub is slowly becoming 2007scape
---
Hmm, I remember that a little bit differently. The way I remember it was that standard MT was much more difficult to tank than any other non-heroic 5 man, but heroic didn't increase the difficulty all that much.
---
It's not a guide on how to do 8 quests, it's a guide on how to get ahead of the crowd logging in. :)
---
Nope, sorry
---
no you don't. any dungeon can be healed with an off spec while leveling. just collect a set of gear with int/spirit (which you're going to do anyway leveling as shadow) and you're fine.
---
Yea sucks, once again, should have been a streamer. I'd probably make more money too. lol
---
&gt; Correct, except that you only need about 800 exp if you're 3 1/2.
---
So your alternative to doing the starting zone quests is to do the first few starting zone quests with 400 people, then move on to hard mobs that you can't hit 20% of the time. Cool.
---
Yes you should play and raiding in vanilla is not like raiding in retail.  There aren't a bunch of stupid mechanics DDR fest, it's more fun, try it.
---
Of course, but I can use the historical data to figure out what sells high at each phase.
---
Are they stress testing multiple realms? My stress test is a pvp server
---
the spell books are in aq20
---
You need to do this.
---
Yo, I'm a bit late to this party, but here's my fresh take. Hope you're ready for this, cause I have way too much free time at work today, and I'm gonna go into details.
---
If you're going human, with swords (optimal for sure), then I would say that going for MoD/Camo first doesn't make much sense, since your general strategy for fighting most mobs should be to wail on them with (improved) Sinister Strike into Evis finisher. Using an opener from stealth is usually considered a waste of time when grinding with swords, and getting precision &gt; dual yield spec is pretty essential.
---
However, since you've mentioned liking to pick pocket, and enjoy the stealthy life class fantasy, perhaps you might want to consider going with daggers? Forget about precision, forget about Sinister Striking mobs down like some kinda warrior brute; feel the pure joy of getting consistent Ambush crits that wipe out half a mob's HP in a single blow! Here is how I plan to level my totally chad non-obtimal NE rogue:
---
- First of all, unfortunately, daggers really suck from levels 10 to ~20, so I'm going to get a leveling partner for these levels. They can pull, and I can backstab. I'll put my first 2 talent points into Remorseless Attacks, and ask my partner to let me get the killing blows. Then, I go 5/5 Opportunity. Next, I improve my stealth, because stealth is essential to this built, and because I'm going deep Sub anyway. 
---
- At level 22, I get Ghostly Strike, and at this point, I can go solo. Ghostly Strike is kinda like a better improved Sinister Strike (both being 40 energy) that you can use once per fight (20 sec CD). Ambush &gt; Ghostly &gt; SS &gt; Evis should take care of single targets quite nicely. At level 25, I now have Improved Ambush, the most beautiful talent ever made, and I have a near 100% crit chance on every opener, provided that I can chain kill mobs fast enough for Remorseless Attacks to do its magic.
---
- Fast forward to level 37, and this is what my talent tree looks like: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZZA0Ischoo . Hemo is a nice pickup, even though it's not as good on daggers as on swords, it's still a good replacement for SS. Ambush &gt; Hemo &gt; Hemo &gt; Evis is the new bread and butter. Ghostly is still useful against tougher mobs / multiple enemies, and improved sap is both a fun and useful addition to my toolkit.
---
- Level 49, I've now picked up some combat stuff, to make me stronger in dungeons, and to get the beloved improved sprint for world pvp. https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZhfM0bZA0Ischoo
---
- The last 11 points are pretty flexible depending on your goals. Personally, I'm thinking of going for a bit of a PvP/solo/PvE hybrid for pre-raid gearing: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#fMZhfV0bVzZA0eschoo
---
And then, once I'm ready to raid, I'll go with the more conventional combat daggers spec: https://classicdb.ch/?talent#f0xfoLZGcV0rEz0boV
---
Daggers are a bit tricky to find, but I've made a list of obtainable daggers for leveling on Alliance (from quests / dungeons and vendors). Let me know if you're interested, I could make my word doc into a google doc for ease of sharing. I think I made it more clear and informative than the list by the famous Kargoz. 
---
Hope you'll consider this fun alternative to the conventional sword grind! Perhaps I should polish this up and make a guide out of it xD
---
I mean, if that's the distinction then you could have transmogs turn off outside of towns or whatever. It seems like people are forcing the idea into the worst possible implementation and then arguing against that as a straw-man. 
---
Also, I *did* run dungeons in the Shadowcraft, if not raids. The plate gear was all awful for DPS.
---
thanks, didnt know that :)
---
Mana bar..... Clearly a warrior... Damn this must not be real... This whole time!? O.o
---
Well this changes everything. Better set up text alerts.
---
I really really really wish people would stop casting doubt about things because it's not as hard as they remember.
---
There's no possible way you remembered how much damage something is supposed to do from 15 years ago, every single person who reported this is dumb. The footage from vanilla people bring up is often just as unconvincing as well.
---
People need to realize this game is not as hard as they remember instead of demanding screenshots of the reference client for every little thing, I've even seen people asking for reference screens after blizz confirmed it was working correctly in a blue post.
---
Please just stop.
---
True. GL with your secret fishing ;) 😅
---
no at the time i screenshotted it it was a pve server but it was online for a few minutes and it changed to pvp then
---
Mage/Warlock/Ele Shaman/Hunter are really the only choices. I'd put Mage is as the best in a league of it's own. Talented Blizzard/Blast Wave/Nova/Iceblock are some of the most powerful group pvp spells in the game, it's ridiculous that they're all on the one class.
---
100% this. If they just said "we tested it and it's fine el oh el"  people would have been dubious
---
Thats what I'm hoping -- I started playing just before TBC, and didn't hit 60 until after it launched, so I never got to experience any classic endgame content (raids or dungeons).  I want to level casually and then run all the 60 dungeons that I missed out on -- would love to experience the raids, but it'd have to be casual and weekends only. Like you, i'd be totally fine just wasting an entire Saturday/Sunday to raiding if I had nothing else going on.
---
Nice enjoy
---
Rogue will be harder to gear then before. You will have to out roll warrior druid hunter and other rogues. And every now and then you will have a shaman rolling in his offspec gear.
---
the guy who claims to be 'the literal god' has over 1200 days played and still bad at the game
---
My dude, enjoy! My DnD group stopped earlier this year, I've been lost without a group to do silly fantasy stuff with.
---
in court too, tbf
---
I would choose Druid or Hunter, mainly because your post made it seem you are more interested in world content than raiding, and Druid and Hunter can be very good at world stuff. I guess paladins are ok but they don’t come to mind as dominant world pvpers or gold farmers
---
Doesnt mean they wont roll on your shit
---
I remember being left out of it just like this one!
---
I see the ERP is already strong in beta.
---
I was an edgy teenager, i liked some badass music for my PwNaGe!!  
---
Soil - Halo  
---
Guano Apes - Open your Eyes  
---
Linkin Park - Remember the name  
---
etc
---
I mean, I edited the post. The entire thing was about the letdown of not actually having the whole thing. Stress testers aren't gauranteed access afterwards either. Sorry you're super salty, but there's no need for that level of hostility.
---
there's a quest chain at 51 called linken's adventure. if you don't know how to effectively optimize all other 51+ quests while you go around the world then i feel like you're gonna be frustrated when you realize how you could have optimized continent hopping for a good exp quest without capitalizing on other relevant quests. some of these quests you could have avoided at earlier levels than 51.
---
it's all about experience.
---
if you're confused what i mean then GL bro.
---
Don't get me wrong, I love transmog in retail.  But I don't see it having any place in classic.
---
It was the worst feeling but the commodity was amazing.
---
They normally dont let lore character names to be created like Thrall or something
---
People report for the wrong reasons.
---
If you look at a stream and go "I remember it being harder than that"
---
That's a terrible reason to report something, but it makes up like 80% of the posts I've seen complaining about something being wrong.
---
damn, THIS weirdly is making me want to roll undead mage and not gnome...
---
Sorry I didn't know hating retail was a requirement on this sub, I'll show myself out
---
Wait, you think the writer of a book stole the name of your character, and your character is based off of someone in the lore? Dafuq I just read?
---
They are underplayed because they are poor healers when there is more than one or two. Their rejuv ticks don't stack, so having more than that is a waste of space. In addition to that, all the other specs were so bad that you just didn't go anything but healer
---
It is a bit lame. No one is going to want to level to level 5 for a day and then be locket out of the beta.
---
Orc something or other. Actually probably one of orc everything and a troll mage most likely.
---
That /train emote off in the distance... 😂
---
In order to recreate the Classic experience as closely as possible, the difficulty of all quests, dungeons, and raids should be tuned up a bit to account for increases in player ability.
---
I don’t know if it was closed or open beta,but it ended with big ass infernal just spawning everywhere and raping everything in towns lol.
---
Even with this there's plenty of people in the official thread saying it's wrong lmao.
---
Considering how toxic, elitist, gatekeeping, and non-constructive this sub is, I wouldn't trust the general classic-wow player base with any kind of game feature.
---
Nope DR vs armor is close to linear
---
stress server was up and down for a minute or two, idk why but it was
---
lots of people, myself including, made a character on it already
---
Haha you got downvoted by all these ape brain retailers for stating the truth
---
stress test only :(
---
What's a boomer?
---
Insane Catch! Witchhunt all the streamers!
---
Max level 5 and it's only up for 2 days
---
Me too bro, I was fifteen.
---
I could be looking back at all this music I used to listen to seriously, and cringe at it.
---
But instead I'm making this list with a good sense of humor, and it's much more enjoyable that way.
---
Yes but you're going to spend at least a couple of hours if you want to have enough pummelers to cover all the bosses in one raid. All this just to have viable dps and even then not the best compared to other pure dps classes. 
---
Also, keep in mind that you'll never have a full set of gear to farm for, your BIS gear is going to be a smattering of gear from everywhere and you'll rarely get any upgrades. And again...all this just to be able to be within a reasonable dps range of other classes that don't need to put in such a tremendous effort.
---
Oh yea, and if you really want to max your dps, you will also need tons and TONS of mana pots because optimal druid dps comes from shapeshifting too.
---
All in all, do you really want to be that guy who people point at and say he has no life because he spends farming \~4 hours a day just to be let into a raid (and pug raids will rarely if ever take a dps druid over another pure dps).
---

Make sure to email Trump to surge troop count in Iraq. Or just start another invasion of a dusty country.
---
You really need to hear the full impact: [Here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBkEMI9tt3w)
---
Are you kidding? I'm getting excited for the prospect of a gigantic pvp raid of all 5s!
---
Well it's only a good design choice if they don't corrupt each other's files easily, and right now that's clearly not the case. I will just manually install them in different locations for now.
---
I just got stress test as well.
---
&gt; By far the biggest difference is sweeping strikes is amazing at multi pulls but you can really only exploit that with a healer.
---
Fight a mob, conserving rage &gt; Bloodrage/bandage &gt; start next fight with 70+ rage, and use SS and whirlwind. You can do this every other fight.
---
Thanks fam, kinda lame its only max level 5.
---
Horrific
---
I mean if you watched it, you would notice you skip the first 2 starting quests and rush to unlock the quest that not many would be on and have significantly more spawns in the area, then move on and grind 10-12 mobs on your way to turn in so you could unlock the level 4 gold shire quests.
---
Did you get an invite today?
---
Yeah, im kinda sweaty aswell that i cant get my main names (and my guild name) :/
---
The goal isn't to redesign Vanilla or improve upon Vanilla.  The goal is to reproduce the game as we played it in 2006 as closely as is feasible.
---
It's funny because when I read this sub I almost exclusively see people like you trash talking private server players. Very rarely the other way around.
---
They really be giving out stress test to everyone
---
Nobody is arguing that private server data is accurate.
---
Whelp, this made me feel like shit. Account has been subbed since early 05, maybe I’ll get in on another wave?
---
Yeah, like its 100% going to be necessary to find some spots to just grind away at mobs and figure out if theres any quests that are actually worth doing
---
Man I freaked out so damn hard when I refreshed it and saw I had it
---
I actually stopped playing WoW in 1.12, so I never got to use transmogs, but always wanted something like that.
---
I feel like there are ultimately two camps of people; the ones who just want Classic to be 1.12 forever down to the smallest details, possibly with a repeating cycle of progression resets, and the ones who are hoping for an OSRS sort of thing where WoW goes in a less awful direction than it originally did.

Hi, /u/Kyul

I remember it being instantaneous outdoors and in dungeons in vanilla. Come to think of it, I don't think that it froze everyone in my party during dungeons neither.
---
70 silver for x5 is cheap? It's like the most expensive food in the game lol. One stack will cost you almost 3 gold
---
https://i.imgur.com/vp6PbtV.png Wrong.
---
unfortunately I doubt we're going to see decursive for classic, unless blizzard decides to open up the API to make something similar to it? though there are some clever devs that could figure some stuff out
---
I wish that they would just give the people who were invited beta access. It is going to be hard to convince people to level to just go to level 5.
---
But you can banish demons and since it's a "devil" saur it counts. 
---
Also works on Rob Zombie

Funny enough mine was also created in August 06, as was my best friend's. I'm so glad she and I got in but I feel for everyone who hasn't.  Don't lose hope!

I just got an invite 7:00 pm pst

All i'm seeing is a confirmation email for cancelling my subscription?

/s
---
been playing since cata 
---
been subbed for about 1 year 
---
thats my Criteria
---
I would agree that a paladin with HoR is still garbage in pve but, despite what people claim. Ret paladin is a very good pvp class. It just they get overshadowed by holy pally because it's the best support in the game. After all ret paladins still have access to all their most powerful support spells. Like BoF, Bop, and cleanse.
---

Who knows, maybe this Blizzcon will break that spell.
---
Or not. We'll see.
---
But....WHAT IF THAT MEANS WE GET ACCESS AFTER THE STRESS TEST?  Maybe we will find out tomorrow!
---
Ya no kidding. Random people donate outrageous amounts to them. Or they donate to themselves to encourage others to donate small amounts. That's what I keep saying to myself so I can sleep at night
---
The ice cream speech is so... cheesy.  but honestly it worked really well because everyone knew as soon as he started talking about flavors what it was going to be.  But the idea was so far fetched you weren't 100% sure it was happening until he said the word vanilla.
---
Nice.
---
Not mlme a thing of value was lost tbh
---
Obviously relying on private server emulation is faulty and trying to remember something from 15 years ago is bound to fail. That said, do keep in mind when most people initially did these dungeons (and considered them 'tough') wasn't 1.12. 
---
Throughout the lifespan of vanilla almost every facet changed and by-and-large classes and gear got stronger while the older content got relatively easier. So one could make the argument that it'd be more authentic if Classic would emulate that experience, rather than stick to the weaker numbers. But that's highly up for debate.
---
Hi, /u/Shittyadviceguy6075
---
Also got my invite.
---
@
---
I saw the server but it wouldn’t let me in :( I tried a few minutes later and it said all servers were down or something to that effect.
---
Eye of the Tiger.
---
The final countdown.
---
&gt; **We’ll be actively monitoring the server, sending server messages, etc. during the 4-6pm PDT period** and it’s important to have as many people as possible log in during this window! **The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23** (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT).
---
This is an awesome video. There's another one I've seen with Jeff going through a presentation on game design that's pretty neat too.
---
same here
---
I just got my stress invite 5 minutes ago, despite having been able to download the game about 5 hours ago
---
I just got an email too! But I don't see anything in my launcher... Hope I didn't just get jebaited by Blizz
---
So I have this email but it's still not on my launcher?
---
Me, I'm ready. You need to realize vanilla wow wasn't only about raiding the way retail is.
---
Are you a detective?
---
Still nothing for me, been subbed since early 05. I’ve clearly pissed off the wow gods.
---
Thanks!
---
It’s the same client for both
---
Huh? If private servers were tuned more difficult than actual vanilla then why would that explain the prevalence of offspecs? That would mean they are even more viable in classic.
---
no he made the char then after he made it a book released having his name included as a lore char
---
nothing yet here. 2004 account.
---
Re open your launcher. Or wait a few hours. The emails go out before it actually hits your launcher.
---
I don't have it in the launcher yet either, but I think it'll be there in time.
---
Hello! I got an invite too but I don't see the option for the Beta Stress Test?
---
My account to date was 2009. I used to play on my uncle's account in 2006 but this account is when I was able to afford my own account.
---
Yes it's worth it for warrior. It's literally double the regen compared with private servers on TBC core. It dramatically cuts back your reliance on first-aid and food.
---
See the sticky
---
If you didn’t get in, there’s always two more stress tests and more waves of beta invites :)
---
same for me
---
Same, Got the e-mail, not in the launcher though. 
---
doesn't seem to be int he list of downloads in the link either. Anybody know?
---
Hahaha I never said I got into the closed beta. I remember being a 15 y.o. kid wondering/dreaming if he could somehow swindle enough money from his parents to buy a closed beta key hahaha. Obviously it had no chance of succeeding and I never got in.
---
 Hello! I got an invite too but I don't see the option for the Beta Stress Test?

You should watch Classic Winds’ video with know beast.
---
I did start before vanilla weather patch. Put in many hours. Sorry. It is shit timing, I'm really busy tomorrow lol
---
Imagine being that delusional.

should've read the comments first before going through their wikipedia... lol

i knew i recognized him

&gt;the internet is cancerous as fuck.

My guild is, we’re going PvP Horde and have played together since 2006 on Blackrock horde. We had a RBG team in BFA but all unsubbed. Chill but serious environment is what we go for, all specs welcome, check out our site at https//www.sacwow.com.
---
Everyone says Warrior are over saturated yet they are always yelling LF tank in trade chat. Fact, I’ve you need one warrior for every five man dungeon and/or would like at least eight in any raid group then 20% of all players being warriors is actually balanced. Both of those statements above are true and I doubt 20% of endgame characters are warriors. QED WoW needs Warriors.
---
#nochanges
---
I mean we ran raids with levels 58s. Back in the day, and people were playing on modem having like 5 fps doing boss fight, no wonder everything will be a walk over now that everyone are elitist and want to min/max while also having better hardware.
---

:DDDDD
---
I’m glad to just get into the stress test.
---
Don't worry, I still download at about 300-500 KB/s, so I still get the true experience.
---
Not before I do ;)
---
&gt;It’s well documented
---
Lol at people throwing out phrases like this like it somehow make them sound like they know what they are talking about.
---
Best! Thanks
---
maybe the whole retail horde badguy shitstorm finally balances the 55 horde - 45 alliance-thingy out :3
---
Seems random. 2004 account here and I've yet to receive any notice.
---
When you launch the game after installing you’ll only see the stress test server.
---
I stand corrected I just got an email. It has a giant picture of ragnaros. 
---
This wave of invites is only access to the level 5 stress test.
---
no
---
Yeah ill wait, id hate to add to the flood of support tickets for minor things like this
---
If you get into the stress test you don't get to continue after May 23, but you have a chance to get beta access later like everyone else.
---
if you truly knew rogue and hunter, both classes, playing them till 60, you'd never say that.
---
it's entirely contextual. What level you are dictates your spells. At certain stages rogues outclass hunters and vice versa. Hunters generally wreck them early, rogues win later on once they have vanish blind kidney etc. Who engages who makes a huge difference. For example if a hunter gets a poison sting on rogue he can win at any level.  If the hunter is dwarf he has a massive advantage vs rogues. Etc, etc. 
---
it's ironic because your blanket statement about hunters sucking if they lose actually betrays the fact that your knowledge of pvp sucks

vanilla probalby won't be difficult for you , but you're asking how to level fast. you can be the best gamer in the world but in unknown territory how can you expect to know that you should max out a couple professions in order to make a wand to help you level faster, then drop those profs, know how to route your quests into areas with the next best wands efficiently, know what quests to tell ur other race friends to go... dude you can have played harder mmos but there are people who have played nonstop vanilla for the last 15 years who know it like the back of their hand. you're fucked. you're a complete scrub noob. no mercy for you in all your deaths , though im sure you will die way more to pve mobs questing 1-60 than the players who will destroy you in pvp.
---
People in my guild have been playing since 07-08 and got in lol. I think I’m just cursed.
---
Ya it was the first step in the gram. I actually haven't been interested in much of their content in a long time. The micro transactions pissed me off and my pap always said "ignorance is strength son, you remember that" and I have.
---
I got it too but the stress beta doesn’t show up on my battle.net yet.
---
You're one of the lucky ones experiencing the true classic experience. Hopefully Blizzard will put a download limit so we all can.
---
I plan to do the same but I will not buy rend they will have to wait to bleed.
---
I got that email as well, but my bnet client doesn't show me having access.
---
I'm sure you took into account the reduced crit rate for a 39 vs 24 mobs and the absence of crushing blows.  Right?
---
Rogue is great fun in pvp but its strictly a duelist. It sucked not being able to do much in group fights
---
I just got an email saying I was selected for the beta stress test and I can download it in my launcher.  I went to my launcher, but it doesn't show up...hrmm.  I'm in NA, anyone have this issue?
---
You can get to rank 11 playing casually but anything higher than that will take some actual time and dedication. R13 gear is about equal to AQ40 gear just that it has less dmg and more stamina. Naxx gear blows it all out of the water.
---
hemet is resilient. fucker returned basically every expansion
---
Might as well skin to 60 for a little extra cash for abilities do alchemy at 60 so you have an easier time nabbing herbs in lower lvl zones.
---
I don't how likely it is, but it's possible they will select future beta testers first out of the ones that log on for the stress test.
---
I ignored critical strikes, misses, parries and dodges.
---
Happy cake day! Have some silver :)
---
I mean, look at how this sub views the opinion of people who didn't play vanilla or TBC for that matter.
---
All luck of the draw it seems. It's not beta, but I didn't think I had a shot at anything. Unsubbed at Wotlk. I am lucky to at least get a taste to level 5. I can hopefully do 3 chars tomorrow and 7 on Thursday.
---
I got to play for 2 mins before the servers went offline.
---
Apparently SS&gt;Cleave does not give double damage in Classic though, so this method got a significant nerf.
---
Or maybe the genre is less in favor?
---
You're never gonna win an argument in a corporate decision without metrics or a track record so golden no one could ever question you. 
---
The metrics do not support what you say, if they did they'd design teh game that way.
---
I love how dedicated OP is to this joke. Keep it up!
---
Looks like it. Best of luck to you!
---
Yeah, I got the email as well but I don't see it in my bnet launcher
---
I got the same email. Installing it now. I can't play after the stress test is over though? :(
---
Yes real info is important, videos are the best evidence, info you found on some database online? Nah.
---
So thankful I'm in a relationship with a cool ass girl. Instead of rolling her eyes, she actually wants to join me :D And yes, I've already put a ring on her (currently engaged).
---
I've received an email, and restarting the battle.net client hasn't revealed anything in the Region / Account dropdown, other than my accounts and my PTR access.
---
I do have a sub going on one of the accounts and I started playing in 2006, but stopped when Cata hit.  Have re-subbed a couple of times to check out most of the expansion packs, but never played long.
---
Make GMs be people again.
---
Don't even care that the servers aren't up for the stress test; I just sat and enjoyed the original log-in screen and soundtrack. The feels, man!
---
TBH...Although it's not Official Classic WoW... I've been leveling up to 20 on 3 classes I'm torn between on Private to help me decide. It's working and I think I know what I'll be playing now.
---
***TO ANYONE SAYING THEY DON'T SEE IT YOU HAVE TO CLICK ON THE REGION/ACCOUNT DROP DOWN LIST AND SELECT "BETA/STRESS TEST WOW CLASSIC"***
---
I didn't get this email but did just get the beta / stress test on my launcher
---
I got the option to install it as early as 5 PM ET today, about 5 hours  before I got this email. I'm not sure if this means more invites are going out, but I'm sure you'll get the option to install it sometime tomorrow before the stress test begins.
---
Literally 90% of the hateposts on this subreddit are bashing on private server players. Not to other way around. You guys are seriously deluded.
---
I will be that paladin in 5years time
---
I don't really do private servers but I'll admit it's tempting
---
Isn't there for me.
---
I know right? I hope all the skilled players stick with retail, they'll be sooo much happier.
---
Interesting - my stress test invite was opposite of others. I got the email but did not get the option on Launcher. Either way, stress test email :(
---
These are really well done sir.
---
I just checked my email and i got that message as well. It hasnt shown up in my battle net profile yet
---
I mean this really isn't true - getting R14 is purely time commitment + playing with premades, and for a lot of classes the blue pvp gear is actually not that bad, especially before people start getting AQ40 / Naxx gear
---
Already did that, not showing up
---
Welcome to the moon! Diablo mobile! Don't you guys have phones?
---
 **The** ***World of Warcraft Classic*** **Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test. Once the stress test period is over, you’ll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.**
---
yeah its offline now, i assume until the stress test starts
---
like i said, no idea why it went live for a that quick minute, but i made an undead, got in, saw a mob of other new characters in the crypt, and it went offline in like 5 seconds
---
Yeah no dice. Got the email but all I have on my drop down is my 3 wow accounts and the PTR. Hopefully it's just lagging behind though, seems it's the same for a few other people. Otherwise mega blueballs RIP.
---
I remember once my guild was going to raid ZG and for some reason we all fell through a hole in the ground and wound up dead in Tarran Mill. Lol. It was pretty funny but a pain in the rear to get back.
---
Cold winter in December 1842 account just got mine there's hope
---
wishing you good fortune in the battles to come
---
yeah. i've seen some very good clickers just because it's so ingrained into them. i'm just pointing out that if those same PVPers or w/e made those videos now-a-days, they'd be getting mocked/flamed in comments for this same stuff.
---
Same here...I'm so excited to play and so nervous it won't show up! lol
---
As a parent of a 3mo, can only wish you a good luck. Pregnancy is nothing compared to this first months.
---
But the people playing it are real, and the social interaction is real. "It's a video game" isn't an excuse to be an asshat.
---
Seeing the cinematic in reverse gives me chills... I LOVE IT
---
Do you guys have room for a rogue? I played rogue in vanilla and BC mostly focused on pvp but did MC and BWL to get gear for pvp.
---
I know of a guy who posted on some forums about a guy that wasn't him that did it, so it's confirmed.
---
I do modem repair and way more old people play mmos than you would think. They qre games they can play at their own pace without feeling like they are losing.
---
If you're afraid of just never getting to cap with these characters, then consider twinking.  
---
  Doesn't requires near as much time and effort as getting a char to 60 and gearing them up, allowing you to also use your main.
---
[This](http://wow.allakhazam.com/wiki/HP_Regen_%28WoW%29) shows why it's good for a warrior especially compared to other classes. It's from BC though so I'm not completely sure how accurate it is, though it does have a "Pre-BC" entry for warriors.
---
Thanks for sharing buddy. Hope you and your dad enjoy many more years of adventuring and life together. Cheers.
---
I believe SS+ cleave is 3 hits and SS+WW is 5 hits.
---
Same
---
haven't unsubbed in a few years :)
---
Have a upvote!
---
I wish they would just go in another direction. An alternate reality where the dark portal never opens and we get a completely new expansion with the same vision as classic.
---
I'm thinking generally aliance will have 1-2% more.
---
Email says we can play till the 23rd on the test server up to level 5.
---
If you select a different install directly than retail, it actually tells you it's not able to locate the shared files, and the install will take 9GB instead of 5.  They have shared assets, so it makes sense they'd make it so you didn't keep two copies of 4GB worth of files.
---
Yo the dude from super spike volleyball made it
---
Based solely on streamer feedback and additionally Blizzard's twitter poll, it seems like Horde has a pretty big numbers advantage
---
I'm afraid of never hitting 60 at all lol
---
Chuck Norris runs so fast he can punch himself in the back of the head
---
Oh, it should be... but it's one of the highest in court which is backwards.
---
A guildie told a guild member to progress further in blacksmithing he needed to go too Stormwind 
---
(We played horde) like 5 hours later he comes back angry becuase guards killed him all the time
---
This subreddit before the beta was a bunch of toxic p-server players saying 
---
"what character did u play send me ur armory u shitter lmao ur garbage u must not have played nost lmao c u on netherwing xD"
---
P-server boomers are the worst kind of players, they're gonna be the ones screeching about blizzard programming the game wrong when glancing blows lower warrior's dps
---
2 hours in the middle of the work week. Pass.
---
I've had the same account since early 05, give me actually beta or GTFO, Blizzard.
---
Feelsbad.. I really hope they keep us in the regular beta.
---
I got mine at 9pm central time (half hour ago). Dec 05 account. NA region. Received an email. Subbed.
---
And what's the most likely way to get there? Shove old data that you refuse to change though a massively different engine and try and get that to match up with the end-result of vanilla, or throw out the 1.12 data and rebuild vanilla such that the game works the same, then work your way back to the database.
---
It's not about the goal, it's about what's the best way to reach that goal, and I think they way they chose, ie sacred 1.12 data which is meaningless without the same combat code, was the worse choice by far.
---
Over a decade is a long time. Last time I played Vanilla I was in middle school. While I remember the overall structure, it’s still going to be a “new” experience compared to retail. Trying to prolong the magic.
---
&gt; u even have to raid for some spell ranks in AQ20
---
Those are BOE.
---
But I agree you'll be at a disadvantage if you don't PVE. If you're a warrior, you'll be stuck using Ice Barbed Spear for 6 months until you have a Rank 14 weapon. That just doesn't sound very fun.
---
Anyone, from my server, will know of this person. If at least one of them reads this and confirms it, that's all that matters.
---
Shame on you.
---
Do you have to download the entire 60gb full game in order to see the drop down menu to select the beta test? Beause i dont see that drop down menu atm. i got invited.
---
Grats! I think I will have to do the same with the one I have. Anyone as cool as she is with how I mess with her AND will let me game as I want is pretty epic.
---
Asmon was taking crushing blows. That should mean he would be taking a lot more damage than the 39.
---
Sparkles?
---
2007 account, invited. Sucks tho because unless it increases the likelihood of getting actual beta access after the stress test, literally feels irrelevant to get to level 5.
---
Got the email for the invite to the stress test, but my launcher doesnt have the realm dropdown above the play button. Restarted several times.
---
Any ideas?
---
The follow up phone call asking me "what the hell is wrong with you with scaring me!" would say elsewise.
---
&gt; I mean if you watched it, you would notice you skip the first 2 starting quests
---
I did watch it. Bruh grabbed every quest available, and does not skip any.
---
Though he does say to get bandanas at level 2.
---
But Bandanas is literal cancer on launch. Seriously the WORST quest to do in northshire when there's more than like 5 people in the zone.
---
"You should get your 12 bandanas in 15 mobs"
---
Wat?
---
"If youre in a group, just go until you finish the quest"
---
Bandanas in a group of three will be approximately 60-80 kills. When 400 others will be trying to get bandanas.
---
&gt;then move on and grind 10-12 mobs
---
A group of three gets abotu 20-25xp per mob
---
I have a couple of spotify playlists ive bookmarked that has old pvp style music. Worth looking through. Maybe find that old song you haven't heard in a long time and turn it up
---
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/05w0PAbC9wsteIq0PDV1on
---
https://open.spotify.com/playlist/0UZC3SdtPB33FbroY9J1nl
---
You know that is not true. Sigh. I dont even understand the point of lying about this stuff. What do you hope to accomplish?
---
i created and subbed an account yesterday and got a beta invite
---
I’m sorry man. I think beta invites will resume after tomorrow? I’m unsure at this point.
---
Exactly, which is why twinking is a good alternative.  
---
  If you're really high on the altohoism scale then twinking still allows you to have goals and progression for different characters without putting in a shitton of time for 60.  
---
  Yeah the journey to 60 is to be enjoyed but for those alt lovers, this is kinda hard to do when you got like 4 characters all various levels.
---
They're making bank
---
The actual WoW soundtrack.
---
I appreciated Alterac Valley quite a bit as it changed themes.
---
It absolutely was impossible before they changed how AV honor worked on a server that had dedicated teams pushing to 14. The AV honor change made it possible to solo the grind.
---
I smell rum
---
Just got an invite to the stress test ~15 min ago. 2005 account
---
I was actually doing the grind on my warrior back then, another warrior ended up in all my bg’s, we rivaled each other for a month or so, became friends, I lost interest around rank 10, a month or two later he was rank 14, he was always ‘that could have been me’. We were both solo.
---
This guy has multiple subs and there’s me, can’t even sub neither to play retail or have my chance at Classic beta. WTT some kidney?!
---
Duel people that claimed to play vanilla on the Zeppelin then mind control them off while I whisper, "I thought you played vanilla?"
---
I feel like one of the YouTube content creators said they were going to do this. I'm glad someone is doing it, even if its just to level 30
---
Yeah how ignorant can you possibly be. They literally show it's the exact same on actual classic... But they think private servers are more right?? Wtf
---
How much time did you put in and how populated was the server?
---
Possible, yeah, but probable within most people's play time per week is a different argument.
---
I got into the closed beta and rolled a gnome mage.  I actually got bored REALLY fast just casting the same spell over and over again, so I just let my friends play instead.  I didn't even buy the game until December, like two weeks after it was already out.  I should have played more in the beta, so I could get more buttons to press.
---
Yeah, shame on me for pointing out the fact that this is just hearsay.  Plus it's not like this was ever a hard thing to do.  It was just time.  If you had the time to sit there in AV for 20 hours a day you could be R14.
---
Pretty jelly! Would do the same tbh.
---
Im rolling a fucking warrior and im goona get world first level 5 bring it
---
Nope, a paladin named Einheit.
---
Plot twist: I’m not wasting my time. I’ll just wait for a beta invite(if it’ll happen) or wait for release
---
Top quality post dude, made me lawl.
---
It’s not even a day it’s 2 hours when you’re probably at work (if you’re pst)
---
Special  characters and alt spellings are your friends
---
A baby gnome rogue named AnkleBiter
---
That's bad ass. At first glance I thought he was holding a toy brontosaurus in his hand LOL. Then I looked again and saw it was the serpent mace.
---
My first wow statue is going to be the ragnaros from the new 15th anniversary collector's edition. I managed to be one of the lucky ones who pre ordered it before it went out of stock. Cant wait.
---
Probably horde had always been the pvp faction
---
Wow lvl 5 you're crazy that's impossible
---
What made it possible was them fixing it so everyone was in the same raid, instead of dickheads not joining the raid to tap things first and leech all of it.
---
I can’t remember when my battle.net account was created. Started playing WoW in July 2017 though.
---
Got my beta invite though I can’t actually do anything... and I have a job interview tomorrow so that’s going to put a damper on the amount of time I can spend in Vanilla for the first time.
---
Same here. Trying to figure out why.
---
&gt;only 2 characters have the name
---
If people haven't taken it by now then why would it go away right at launch?
---
And you can just resub early to get into character creation and reserve the name.
---
[BigCritties the Paladin](https://i.imgur.com/hDOEmri.png) (already made during the 2 minute open window) will be remaking her 1-5 fedex . exploration video for youtube.
---
Cause launch will be a massive clusterfuck, it seems.
---
how do you distinguish the closed beta from the stress test on the client? it says i can install beta &amp; stress test not sure which one i was invited to
---
I wish :(
---
No, they literally increased the amount of honor you gained in AV considerably. I remember it vividly because it happened on the final week of my push and I had to make up like 100K honor going into the weekend because of someone soloing it.
---
I mean, he has a job now and part of that is being professional. It's not really that shocking all things considered. Back then he wasn't working for Blizzard and he was just a gamer like us. There wasn't even this PC culture we have now either, you could say literally anything and most people would laugh it off. Most of us act like that with our friends still but if we are at work or speaking publicly where it's not going to go over well, we act like decent human beings.
---
Right now we are recruiting every class, we don't have a set roster so we aren't in *need* of anything... Maybe Shaman, i'm the only shaman so far. As for loot, we are looking for people who will be apart of the guild. Topping the meters will help you get gear, we want to gear the best up, but we are also looking for commitment, looking for dedicated members who are active and willing to help the guild. Standard loot council things. Show up, do well, be a part of the guild, and you will be rewarded for it.
---
 
---
Hope I answered that, if you have any other questions, feel free to let me know!
---
Ah, I was on Aggramar back then.  Memory may not be 100% accurate but I want to say a Paladin named Sparkles did something similar on that server.
---
I had 12mbit in 2004 come at me XD
---
I will say theres a pretty high chance that a few days after this stress test they send out some more invites to that actual beta.
---
i got the invite but the option isn't in the dropdown.  am i missing something?
---
it says i can download now
---
By logging in. If you only see the stress test server, that means you're only invited to the stress test.
---
US player since 2005.
---
Just got the stress test email. I restarted the Client a few times before it showed up in the drop down.
---
Right, like I said, I ignored those hits. I'm only interested in comparing the baseline damage.
---
Some people need more to do with their time...
---
lol it's legit
---
Bruh, I got rank 14 solo on your server MONTHS before that guy did! So confirmed, it's possible and also confirmed you paladin friend was a chump.
---
About to go watch the south park episode now
---
A regular at the internet cafe i worked at did it solo (to a lot of hate from the premades who had planned the order of people getting it).
---
It was definitely possible. Whether it's the most efficient way is another story.
---
the realmlist
---
Hi, /u/Flexplexico
---
The stress test is 4pm-6pm the server will remain open for one day
---
Got my email
---
https://i.imgur.com/ebebcsQ.jpg
---
I played horde and he was on all day - at sometime after the third month of my grind - he had already hit rank 14 and was the highest ranked person for a week.  
---
I'd say we were a medium to medium-high population server.
---
I don't think they care about how old or how long you have played your account it seems to be mostly random. I didn't get the closed beta but i did get the stress test beta for tomorrow. My creation date was early 2007 around TBC release. but there was a like 9 year gap where i didn't play or pay.
---
Mine showed up in the client about ten minutes after I got the email. Just long enough to start wondering the same thing.
---
No, in real court it's so low that romans invented a phrase: unus testis nullus testis or one witness is no witness, implying they need at least two, because then at least you can cross-examine testimony. In the movies and other media it is different of course, as you say.
---
I’m in the same boat.  Hoping that it will show up in the launcher tomorrow.
---
Lol. Ok thanks
---
I cant see the date changing in any way.. It was an official release date announcement. People plan vacation days around wow releases.
---
The server will be open for a day, but anyhow it’ll be a fun community event
---
Did you know they planned this date when they announced the release date of the game?
---
A quick scroll around the thread, there's so much toxicity coming from them that it's concerning.
---
I totally forgot undead started IN the crypt before. Why would they change that?
---
They are testing the server for those specific hours but you're allowed to play until the next day. I'm CST so it's 6-8pm my time. I work till 730pm and have plan's after work so I won't be able to play during that window at all.
---
I'm running into the same issue. Got the email 7:13 PM PST and it's still not showing up in my Region/Account Section.
---
Everyone already knew private server data was wrong, was there ever a question of this? What people wanted to know is if the mobs in Classic were just undertuned because they hit like wet noodles.
---
https://i.redd.it/dv8t1lg2x9tx.png
---
Maybe it has something to do with the fact that I saw the server offline this morning listed as a "normal" server, but now this evening looking at it, its been changed to PvP.
---
I got the stress test invite but no email.
---
VC because DM = dire maul
---
I'll use either one. I legitimately don't understand why people get mad about this.
---
give it a couple days, people will find something else to be outraged over
---
Only if right click &gt; invite is in. Otherwise, good luck getting groups!
---
I’m in the same spot
---
2004 pre-release beta account. No invite.
---
Sams
---
Same!
---
There's basically no healing power or spell power available at that level either so I'm not sure healing has much variability.
---
It's a nice, hopeful thought, but I highly doubt it'll change.
---
Crushing blows aren't critical strikes.  You said you ignored critical strikes.
---
I imagine the main purpose is to see how the layering system works to generate and place new players smoothly when a starting zone gets hammered. And also to see what a starting zone feels like with vanilla respawns and 500 players or whatever.
---
Just got my invite!  With in the last 3-4 hours.
---
I got the invite but nothing popping up in the drop down menu. Did I just get played?
---
I’m setting up TeamViewer now to check it at work tomorrow and get it installing lol
---
not knowing anything will make it better you get to discover everything for the first time
---
Same thing happening here.
---
&gt; All we can do is use our memory and experiences on private servers
---
Actually you can:
---
1. Use your memory of real, retail vanilla WoW. If you have one.
---
2. Check your claims against screenshots or videos from real, retail vanilla WoW.
---
Poor bastard, check your email though. I just got mine 32 minutes ago. It is for tomorrow 4-6 pdt
---
Play Eve online
---
Someone else mentioned that it's possible the game tries to reference generic elite mob damage but accidentally finds generic normal mob damage. In this hypothetical situation, the same thing *might* not happen with a boss.
---
It should show up as PTR active in your account/games 
---
I got into the stress but not email so far.
---
"optional to skip wolf quest, but you can probably do it while running back and forth" 
---
Like I get you may disagree but I've tested this multiple times with the sole intent of getting ahead on classic launch day assuming i just logged in with 400 other people.
---
That would be an experience to say the least
---
I remember I was a dwarf mage in beta lol
---
Just wait, mine came 40 minutes later, they are stagnating the download option so too many people don't download at the same time.
---
I just had that happen too.
---
His toon’s name is Livetowin. 
---
Classic.
---
Yarly
---
I just got invited to the stress test the server is not open yet
---
I had my account since early vanilla and stopped early mop 
---
resubbed 3 days ago EU
---
Ah ok thanks
---
Weird, I got my stress test invite and yet I don't have the download option...
---
But nobody just runs Dire Maul. You run DM:N, DM:W, ETC
---
No, my invite did not arrive :) thanks for reminding me pal
---
The email comes before your account gets flagged. Check tomorrow morning.
---
Yeah because people played so much Deadmines in 2004-2006 that it burned itself into their brain and they remember what they are supposed to do. Oh wait... Anyone claiming Deadmines Elite damage is off has played way too much of a private server and that means shit.
---
Nope, never was in the beta, my first log on was on December 25th 2004
---
I need to reiterate this. Explore and enjoy the game man. The magic of classic will reveal itself.
---
Ok what about the rest of his post?
---
&gt; should
---
Key word.
---
no way they will move it up, people already scheduled PTO around the release.
---
I got an email 3 minutes ago so not sure if I literally just got it or since the last time I checked 3-4 hours ago. 
---
I did not have to reset blizzard app to get it. 
---
I payed for an active sub 1 week ago and haven’t been subbed for 8 months.

I do play OW a couple times a week from same account.
---
Got mine. Don’t stress about it, only seems to be 3.8 gigs. Note: I have bfa installed.
---
I’m wondering if someone accidentally sent emails out :(
---
In all seriousness I would love to see a m+ version of all dungeons for classic hahaha but like 3 years down the line when everyone and their mom has everything completed on multiple people Haha only a dream but would be fun I think haha
---
No, this is dumb. All these dates have been previously announced
---
This seems quite important. Seeing corpses and skeletons is, to me, an important part of vanilla!
---
I'm convinced now that he is in a payroll
---
the cinematics in WoW have ALWAYS been so fucking amazing, the wrathgate still brings back so many memories.
---
Anybody else get an invite, but not the option to download it on the battle net app?
---
It annoys me as well. All of these people are convinced the the private server teams who reverse engineered the game from YouTube videos have created more accurate systems than the people with the original game code. In all honesty, this is going to be a mess for a while. While I’m sure everyone reporting differences is doing so in good faith, there have been dozens of major private servers, some more accurate than others. Each player who has played on different major servers may have a different opinion on how something “feels” based on how accurate the private server they played on actually was. The end result is going to be Blizzard essentially getting a shit ton of reports that are likely wrong. The only value in all this is that they can pinpoint obvious issues - like everyone being in agreement that elite damage feels off. Otherwise, it’s all just noise with everyone on this subreddit thinking they know vanilla better than the people staring at the code base.
---
Kinda jealous of the people who didn't get invited right now. I was invited but I have no way to download the client. I tried restarting battlenet laucher, computer, anything. Nothing there.
---
100% sure it wasn't like this on Nost.
---
Shift+click name: Level 20 -Deadmines
---
What a joke, at least make it 15.
---
they dont give a shit
---
they just want to trick people into subbing for no reason
---
This.
---
Not to mention you have something (although subjectively criticized) we were not lucky to have before... a plethora of data from the Vanilla days. 
---
So not only will you get to enjoy the excitement of the old days, you’ll also have the ability to look up anything that you may feel “stuck” on.
---
DM, because it was in before Dire Maul.
---
I abbreviate Dire Maul by the wing: DM:E, DM:W, or DM:N. (Or Tribute)
---
see you there if you are horde :)
---
Did you opt in on the beta page?
---
Do you need a subscription to do the stress test
---
Probably about 70% of why I'm going to be playing Classic is because I want there to be a BC Classic server in the future.
---
Dis you have to restart the launcher to make it show or was it just there
---
im so excited!
---
People are over leveled, people min max gear better, people spec better and people buff/play better. Putting out all the numbers is fine but I think this mindset that some people in this thread have that even though they confirmed at least 1 mob working they still are convinced the damage is wrong and there must be other underlying bugs. Another more likely option is you are remembering wrong or were really bad back then.
---
dude i got in too, sweeeeeeeeeeet
---
They keep getting better.
---
BfA was my first beta in any game. Been playing since Vanilla.
---
Yeah, always have. Anytime a beta gets announced, I update my beta profile settings.
---
All other countries have inferior potassium
---
I agree, it's really stupid to stop at such a low level.
---
I should've worded it differently, it of course depends on a number of things. But I was  trying to say when all things are equal, like both are prepared to fight and know what they're up against. If a hunter catches a rogue out of stealth fighting a mob its game over, and if a rogue catches a hunter without CD's he's done as well.
---
I actually played Hunter and Rogue extensively from Vanilla until Cataclysm when I stopped playing. I have over 100,000 HK's, the vast vast majority of which are on those two classes so I know both pretty well. On my Hunter I would easily handle rogues, and I think actually playing the class and getting to know it better gave me an even bigger advantage.
---
But you're right about context. My pvp knowledge from these days is pretty good, I got my shoulders in arena and got to Champion rank, + 100,000 hks
---
A priest buffed me while I was out world questing today and I was legit floored by it I was like omg thankyou! and I actually said it before he flew off.
---
Doesn’t really help a higher raid :P
---
stress test, wish it was beta lol
---
I just got one for the stress test too. Have you been able to get the client to download?  Mine isn’t doing it.
---
Sorry, you can imagine our sensitivity to trolling, and you seemed to have no post history!  Welcome!!  Please repost this info if you haven’t
---
I’m kinda in the same boat... I think they both have good strengths.
---
I thought I was the only one.
---
Always
---
It might be easier to just type out 'Deadmines' to eliminate confusion. It's not like we are playing on a mobile phone where everything is abbreviated.
---
My first beta been in since launch of wow.
---
Oh well, might be some reason your account is flagged to not get invites or something. Old account infringements from years and years ago maybe.
---
I never got in the closed beta but I did play the open beta. I don’t remember much about it. My memory is shot.
---
thanks for  your suggestion, lambro101
---
Good call, I've added both
---
Did the stress test download for you?  I got the invite recently (30 min) and it’s not available yet to DL.
---
Just the first 72?
---
You think its worth opening a ticket and asking? Would they even be able to answer that?
---
At first, I misread it as Livertown.
---
Deadmines was called VC before Dire Maul came out
---
Link for the lazy?
---
Why couldn't he be in charge of Classic? Then it would be Classic and not a modern engine with a Vanilla skin causing nothing but issues. He would also tell you how wrong you were and not be an ignorant pile of shit when saying it. What happened to Blizzard. They still try to tell us what we want but have lost the plot of what actual fun gameplay in an MMO actually is.
---
I've seen messages from GMs stating yes
---
Didn't expect that from blizzard at all. This has definitely become more than a pet project and they really wanting to succeed.
---
No.  They adjusted the curve to allow more people into ranks in 1.12.  They also increased the number of people that could hit ranks 6-14 in 1.8 when they nerfed the shit out of AV, but they didn't make AV specifically give more honor compared to any other BG.
---
No real reason not to open a ticket, good luck finding something out buddy.
---
Same, but for my druid during a nax run. I honestly don't remember too much, I didn't know anyone in the raid and they just needed another healer. Most were over geared, so it was an easy farm run. Ended up getting most of the druid teir set in that single run.
---
Couple weeks later, I transferred servers, since the guild I mained in, needed a healer. (I also managed to score the name 'Resto').
---
I sucked as a healer too, at least at the start lol. Had a guildie, who mained a resto druid since vanilla, help me learn how to properly heal.
---
There was also a third resto druid, and damn it, I'm getting a rush of memories of us three, joking around in our own personal chat room while we kept our guildmates alive.
---
I played that druid all the way to icecrown where we killed Arthas and by then, I became the top healer in our guild. Though, only because the friend who original taught me, wasn't playing any longer, nor her husband. I think there was drama between her husband and the guild master, but I'm not 100% sure on the details. They never left the guild or kicked from it. Just one day, neither of them logged back on.
---
The guild was made assure that they were alright, but decided to quit wow. That was a sad sad day :(
---
Miss ya, Bessiemoo and thank you for all the help, as well as igniting my love for druid healing!
---
I have played since closed beta but on someone else's closed beta account that wasn't being used. But outside of using someone else's closed beta, I have never personally gotten into any of Blizzard's closed beta tests for any of their products or expansions.
---
Just stress test, no real beta for you
---
Same. Got an invite around 22:30 ET.
---
Have you been able to install it? I also got the email but it's not available in my launcher.
---
"Up to level 5"
---
Given that I can only tell by the number that pops up over the character portrait, it isn't possible to discern a critical strike from a crushing blow using my method, they both have the same text
---
Did you make sure to opt into WoW Classic Beta? It's a separate checkbox from regular WoW.
---
Dps warrior tops the god damn meters. They are also the best tanks in the whole god damn game.
---
Account created in 2005, the only WoW beta I ever got in was MoP because of the annual pass.  I did get into the D3 and Hearthstone betas.
---
*stress test.
---
Fury warrior is like the best pve dps in the game from a pure damage standpoint.
---
But if you plan to solo level it is going to be a real pain in the ass, 10x harder than any other class to level to 60.
---
&gt;Discussion  
---
&gt;I was at that Blizzcon, it was nuts, almost lost my voice yelling.
---
Nobody actually says that.
---
Yeah, when the instructions on how to get into WoW Classic Beta was announced, I made sure I updated the profile settings.
---
Didn’t you ask what it would display as? Was simply answering the question, as I got into the stress test and a new ptr showed up in my games list within the account site as “active”
---
Thanks man, I actually might try it.
---
Have you tried downloading it yet?  I got the email about 30/40 min ago but no luck with the launcher.
---
2007 account and I got in... hate to rain on y'all's parade, lol, sorry.
---
Yes, no alliance shamans and no horde paladins.
---
I really want them to buff atleast first raid encounters. We need to consider how better pcs and internet we have now, i dont want to see it being facerolled in first weeks.
---
Right because someone at level doing deadlines or caverns in quest greens then and now and have such wildly different damage values clearly means blizzard has the data. Are you seriously this fucking stupid or do you just spend your days trolling on the net?
---
Also troll priest racial MS
---
Hi, /u/Meat_Gobbler
---
Will they be okay/pull their weight leveling with a group? also are they good in PvP too? thank you for the reply!
---
&gt;does it show up as 
---
Can you show a screen shot?  I got an email but am not seeing the drop down, but not sure where to look.
---
So if you get stress test will you get beta?  No one knows?
---
Open your own my dude
---
Above the "play" button for retail is a drop down menu. Select it and the the beta stress test option. Should be about 3gb
---
What! That may as well be the official wow theme song!!
---
Pretty much anything by slipknot.  
---
I was an angry kid.
---
Yeah easily I believe
---
I just got in today
---
Order of my events today:
---
I was playing the retail game earlier today. I had closed it out to do some stuff. Then I got an email like an hour later stating I was invited to do the beta. 
---
I got excited and opened the [battle.net](https://battle.net) client and right away the option was there under "In Development" and I went ahead and installed it.
---
PS: (I've had this WoW account since vanilla. Also I've been resubbed the past 2 months or so.)
---
Everyone and their dogs got a stress test invite. Of course account age doesn't matter.
---
It's pretty fucking obvious that Blizzard doesn't care how old your account is and these are being picked randomly. No reason for all these "created in 2013 and I'm in!" posts -_-
---
Yeah me too, finally got an invite to play the game for 2 hours, so hype /s  
---
I don't see the client either, neither the beta realm on my account and log in/out twice.  
---
I guess it will eventually show up.
---
Awesome, thank you so much!
---
I'm in! Original account on battlenet is spring 2005 account, no active sub. Different account is BFA expansion with active sub.
---
You do NOT need to restart client I can confirm I did not restart and it was there.
---
Zero salt was produced in this comment 😭
---
Oh my God, I just looked up that site on way back machine. 
---
Crazy lol
---
me too, not showing up in launcher for me either...
---
BM hunter, maybe lock
---
Hey. Thanks for your valuable contribution to /r/classicwow.
---
Super weird that it’s not there but I legit received the email. Maybe it’s too soon. I’ll check again in an hour and then in the morning. Want to make sure it’s ready for the test. It’s got me nervous.
---
I spell it out to avoid confusion.
---
The anger was with god-mode.
---
what made you think they might do that
---
Interesting, ty. I'll just keep restarting.
---
except me and my dog :'(
---
Being a leader in a video game should not be that serious
---
Did you exclusively play rogue?
---
I'm super bummed I don't have the screenshots anymore. It's so long ago, time flies when you "were" having fun ( ._.)
---
I feel like this could be turned into a dungeon crawler type game. I love these!
---
Are you suggesting that the people with an actual reference copy of the game have more accurate numbers than the dozens of private server teams who had to reverse engineer everything? That is blasphemy in this subreddit right now!
---
As was said before, fury warriors are the dps top dogs of raiding with a fun playstyle to boot.
---
Leveling is slow though as you're very gear dependant. Take your time to do the WW axe at 30e.g and you'll see a huge spike in leveling speed
---
They are ongoing you will probably get in. Good luck.
---
I’m likely misremembering what was done exactly but what I do remember is that you could gain honor much faster solo in AV than previously.  I do know that this was pre-1.12, but aside from that couldn’t tell you the specifics.
---

---
my dog did not get an invite please stop spreading hate and mis-information
---
I had a friend in high school that got into the closed beta and didn't play it so I got to bum it off of him. I then shared it with my sister, her fiance, and my best friend. 
---
That friend got into like every Blizzard beta ever because when we were in junior high school he managed to get like a mod position on some warcraft 2 / starcraft fan site where he didn't actually do anything. From that point on he was apart of the Blizz Friends &amp; Family list until around Starcraft 2 came out and they pruned him.
---
You don't and a CM answered that on the forums. 
---
&gt; Sorry if I’m confusing folks but it’s pretty different situation than normal. If you got invited to the stress test you will only be able to play on the stress test.

---
&gt; A shame plate sucks for warriors :(
---
FTFY (it’s mostly true for dps warriors)
---
Frostadamus was complaining about that earlier on stream and made a bug report. CoC definitely seems like it's working differently.
---
Do you have to have an active subscription in order to get in? I don't have the full WoW client installed either and there's no option to change region/account.
---
facebook level post
---
same issue here, i think they'll probably slowly roll out who can install it to minimize stress on their end? idk
---
Unrelated, but I had that exact monitor for some time, the ghosting on it is terrible and very distracting playing WoW in zones like Winterspring, Tanaris, basically anything that's not grass.
---
I was genuinely surprised the first time I saw someone mention VC cause I had no idea what they meant and where it came from. So I was interested in getting to know what the majority of classic enthousiasts call it. The following is my pov rant, be warned.
---
All dungeons get abbreviated in the same way so why would this dungeon be different? Cause of another dungeon that released in a later patch? That makes no sense at all, if anything the earliest dungeon should have the right to get the correct abbreviation.  
---
You could call them both DM since you can always check the players who's asking his lvl, the lvl requirements are so far apart that confusion is hardly possible.
---
Almost noone would refer to Dire Maul as just DM. They'd specify which side they'd want to do cause they're basically separate dungeons.
---
When or thanks to whom did Deadmines lose its title which it had undoubtedly first?
---
weird flex but ok
---
I got the email, but logged on to install the beta&amp;stress test and it's not showing up...?
---
Getting trolled hard by blizzard
---
This one’s JUST. for. you.
---
I had a tauren war alt...but yes, a UD rogue was my main hahaha
---
yeah, 100k was like an absolute baseline LOW number lmao.  I honestly could see 500k+, if it's done well.
---
Breaking gender stereotypes. That's what I like to see.
---
Thank you! is it true that there's no rage generation from auto-attacks?
---
They could remove the invite altogether?
---
just a very lowball, don't know the stats on a regular of both games.. just kinda giving extremely "with a grain of salt" type numbers you dig
---
https://youtu.be/SBQ-vW6rz_Y
---
Terrible suggestion imo. 
---
The time window for this stress test is terrible for eu players because it is in the middle of the night, mid week.
---
Since you've played WoW before you will understand the basics even if they aren't quite the same. I mean compared to someone who has never even touched WoW. 
---
All you'll really need to learn is how to play your chosen class and where things are. Fortunately theres plenty of guides, videos, and database websites like wowhead out there to fill in those gaps.
---
DKP is so fucking stupid, and this highlights part of the reason why. It makes sense if it is currency in an actual market, but when you force someone to pay a fixed price, and even force someone to take something that is technically an upgrade but not worth the DKP, you are basically just in an over-complicated round robin system. 
---
The idea of "saving up" and "buying" stuff is just propaganda to encourage regular attendance. Be honest and just have a loot council, or let people just roll based on actual need and/or their level of commitment to the guild.
---
The faithful attacking the doubters are more outrageous in their accusations. This is madness.
---
Same man..been around for 14 years now and gotta say..I haven't been this excited for any type of video game in a very long time.
---
Hell yeah man, I'm planning on starting one as soon as I get int, 120 level 1s vs 1 Hogger
---
That's literally what people are going to be demanding, so yes.
---
Glad to know I'm not alone, I'd be so annoyed to get an invite but not be able to actually log in
---
Warrior is the top tier hybrid class in Vanilla. Best tank and Best DPS.
---
A lot of people claim he failed with Titan, but perhaps Titan was a bad idea to begin with and fans need to stop falling into trope ideas that a game developer is a failure just because one idea for a game was not released. Maybe they had the forsight to see how much the game was lacking and that is why I am glad we never saw Starcraft: Ghost, because if the gamer friendly Blizzard said it wasn't good, then it wasn't good. Trust in the good devs... 
---
To be fair, that really doesn't describe ActiBlizz anymore, so fuck it. Blame whomever you want for whatever you want. Shit is sinking fast anyway.
---
I am envious of you. You will get to experience this game that I loved for the very first time. I hope the experience is as joyful for you as it was for me. 
---
Don't worry about what other people are doing, or how much more they know about it than you do. That's the fun part. I was a total MMO noob when I started playing the first time. I didn't even know that much about Warcraft and I had played it a few times before. Just leave your expectations at the door. It *is* a 15 year old game, but if you love it like I did, it will be magical, and I hope it is.
---
I don't know the full stats on a regular because I don't play regularly.  Maxed my melee and got 99 mining in 2015/2016 so I haven't played since.  Back then it was 50K players logged in at a time.  Just trying to give people some extremely rough guestimate type numbers.
---
They, uh, don't. The data is the same as it was in 1.12.
---
If there's an issue it will likely be systemic, or tied to a specific ability. And it's very unlikely it'll just be a random one off here and there, since again, it's the same data and formula.
---
Same boat here man.
---
I did too, it's not showing up on my launcher though
---
Have you been able to install it? I also got the email but it's not available in my launcher. I've already restarted a few times.
---
Edit: your reading comprehension is bad and you should stop posting incorrect information.
---
I don't have 23.4 hours to play the 26 hour stress test.
---
Yeah, the official name of the Valor/Devout/etc set is Dungeon Set 1, while the upgraded version (which won’t come out until phase 4? I think?) is Dungeon Set 2. Blizz called it the T0.5 set (the unofficial colloquial name) in their phase list.
---
Are you still salty you’re not getting any of the changes you wanted? :)
---
Much like the saviors of old, he burdens the weight mere mortals cannot.
---
Might as well. Not to sound greedy but sitting in a starting area while lagging on a level 5 for an hour doesn’t seem too fun. I’m also only saying this because other people get indefinite invites? Just odd
---
Cliffs that way, feel free to get a running start.
---
I’ve already installed it.
---
Fucking peggle. I was introduced to that game by someone who got convicted of rape.
---
I guess the issue is that some people got the email invite but don't see it in the launcher yet? It probably couldn't hurt to restart [battle.net](https://battle.net)  or close and open games to see if it pushes the option to the client faster. 
---
But it'll probably just pop up when it's ready like it did for you. 
---
See ya in Azeroth!
---
Same thing happened to me. I logged into the main game, logged out then it appeared.
---
Meh, if ya can’t bother to give me a beta I can’t bother to do your stress testing for you
---
Did you try restarting the launcher?
---
Update: I’m working my 6-3PM shift tomorrow and will be home in time for the release and gameplay. I’m excited to duel all you level 5 maniacs
---
Do you mind showing me where the blue post about getting into stress test not affecting your chance of getting into closed beta is? Been wondering about that all day.
---
Yes, multiple times as well as logging out and back in
---
I actually only played vanilla when it first came out. So I’m actually not familiar with more recent raiding or mechanics. I’m just old and don’t have the time nor patience to deal with guilds, specific raid times, etc. I just want to play solo and small dungeons and raids that can be done with quick pick ups.
---
Ugh. I’m not looking forward to the subreddit tomorrow if it turns out the emails were sent by mistake. Going to be a cesspool of rage.
---
You probably also wore boat shoes and barrowed your dad's Mercedes?
---
Can I just say, a lot of the elite raiders where using nefarian and onyxia buff. I think when those buffs are less available raiding may be harder on classic than private servers.
---
Also I would guess few people experienced vanilla for the first time at 1.12.
---
Haha good luck! I'm lucky my gf plays retail WoW with me already, won't take any convincing to join me in Vanilla.
---
Nope
---
Well shit
---
Its not showing up in my drop down. even though i got the email.
---
Quite the opposite, based on how much damage your AAs deal, you get rage. You get less in berserker stance and almost none in defense stance, where your rage comes from gettin hit.
---
It's why once you're geared, you're swimming in tons of rage.
---
Ah makes me think of the classics like JTI, MTD, AA and ATD. Those were nice dungeons.
---
My dreams are crushed
---
I swear to fucking god Blizzard don't do this to me.
---
Which means that I will skip out on this experience. If I can’t get the best PVP gear without raiding, I am just not interested.
---
Internet is nowhere near what it was 15 years ago. You can't assume you will have the same experience. All you can have is a game that's a close replica, nothing else can be controlled or expected to be the same. I have to add though, that vanilla wasn't some pleasant sunshine and rainbows environment either, do you remember the forums for example? It was just full on aids the whole time, full of hate, complaining, trolls and bs.
---
Oh wow, that sounds really fun! Thanks so much for all of the help and info
---
Same.
---
My buddy got into the Stress Test and he's able to download his.

---
It seems like a tonne of people got the stress teat invite which is cool! Glad to hear you both got in!
---
? I just installed
---
I have this same issue as above. I'll REEEEE but not here. I just want to play it. Get a little taste.
---
Same here, so glad to know it's multiple people having the issue, means it should be okay.
---
they should stick with the true TRUE vanilla, where undead were actually undead and permanently immune to fear, but also pally being their #1 enemy because exorcism would always crit.
---
Now thats the type of balance I wanna play
---
Sure thing!

&gt;Are we still able to be invited into the actual beta if invited into the stress test?  
---
&gt;Getting invited to the stress test will not impact your standing for future closed beta invites.
---
Ehh i mean you are over hyping the pet a little. There's a reason most people go wolf or wind serpent, they're super low micro with good payoff. True, to do it 100% you need to take all their abilities off auto to time your focus dumps correctly, but the DPS increase at late stages is minimal and most raid leaders would prefer more consistent and reliable damage over theoretical maximums. While the theoretical max of Hunter *may* be there highest, there's definitely a fast drop-off in difficulty if you are willing to sacrifice just a couple percent DPS difference; and a huge skill drop off if you are talking about a 5-10% reduction in DPS.
---
Druid, by comparison, requires you to put in tons of work just to be viable, and it's virtually impossible to completely optimize. There's just so much power shifting and resource management that you can't get 100% efficiency no matter how good you are.
---
But it's a pretty moot argument... Either way they are two of the highest skill cap classes by a decent margin. I mean compared to mages, rogues, and DPS warriors in PvE it's no comparison.
---
The beta runs until Thursday night sometime so you might still get the chance! Good luck in your interview tomorrow!
---
Latest meta I have seen is [Improved Regrowth + Nature's Grace](http://classicdb.ch/?talent#0x0xhMxoZZxtcofaV), load up on spell crit, and spam low rank Regrowth. I haven't tried it, so someone can correct me if I'm wrong.
---
The stress test doesn't start to tomorrow, that's why.
---
Yep it’s installed, just can’t log in yet. (No servers available)
---
Got mine 1 hr ago for stress test
---
Howdy! How did we do, sorry I may have had a drink or two :)
---
Max 50. Decay is 5g a month with minimum of 10g
---
It is a “stress” test so I’d imagine they want everyone in the starting areas as much as possible. I worry that the level cap will turn people away who don’t really want to help stress test and are just wanting to play. “Oh it only goes up to level 5? Not worth my time.”
---
Hi, /u/Paralta

Sometimes I like to lean back in my chair and click

i also got in, got all excited then realized its not til tmrw.  Either way, its gonna be good.

Warrior sucks in pvp without a healer. The only reason it gets top damage in meters is because it doesnt have mana. Any class can do the same amount of damage, if not more burst, in the first 10 seconds, then they go oom. But warrior and rogues dont have that problem so they can keep bashing their abilities.
---
I got an email with the stress test but I don't have a drop down menu??
---
They are twitch emotes that only show up if you download BTTV (better twitch tv) on your browser
---
This is a masterpiece
---
"I’m forwarding a report to have the issue looked into and see if the emails were accidentally sent"
---
... They better not... omg
---
Making tons of friends, making my own guild, wind up tanking and become known as one of the dudes who has thunderfury.
---
That's my somewhat silly goal. Remind me later on how that went, heh.
---
its just an emote that people spam in twitch chat anytime something cool happens
---
Lol this’ a big yiiiiiiiiiiiiiikes
---
I'm stuck wondering if there are local Oceanic servers, or if it's back to the days of 400+ms.
---
Just call both dm and everyone can shift click to see level range?
---
No you can’t
---
as of right now he's played for 19h and 22m and is level 16 and just over half, if he really hasn't stopped listening to 'live to win' he has heard it 367 times.
---
As a cloth class do not sleep on any melee class ever.
---
Not the best for people who work or have a longer commute in the US either. Won’t make the full 2 hour window but I’ll be on in time to help a little.
---
Lmao, I guess tanking three same-level elites solo and killing them with two buttons is the "vanilla experience" 🤔
---
Understandable. I would just get annoyed by everyone needing their own personal rage post about it which would 100% happen.
---
Any pics of the undead starting zone?
---
Thank you!
---
I agree that powergaming in an RPG is cringe, but what's with the subliminal pro-changes statement? It's definitely the virgins who wants changes to make things easier for them.
---
This is different from the beta?
---
It is quite fun, especially since you get to stance dance from berserker to battle stance for overpower. It's one of the more involved playstyles really.
---
\#NoChanges
---
I've always known it as VC. Never ever heard anyone call it DM before private servers/Classic WoW.
---
Perfect, thanks dude.
---
I would say go for engineering only if you want to PvP. Otherwise it's not that grate(still fun tho).
---
Yes, its a slightly larger scale stress test capped at level 5.
---
Got the email at 1024 pm. The pop up menu let me download around 8pm and the server was accidentally turned on and i was able to get on for like 5 mins. Hasn't been on since.
---
I received my first ban from WoW from the xp potion exploit that recently happened (2 day ban) and still received and invite. I was worried I was blacklisted but apparently they are really trying to push these servers.
---
This will be such a paradigm shift for many modern players. It will be interesting to see how it pans out.
---
VC, but shouldn't be sent confusion if you see recruiting for the group in West fall. Both will work. However in SW or IF (cause no one goes to Darnassus) DM could cause some confusion.
---
I got an email that I was in at 1915 PDT. Account created in 2005. Currently subbed.
---
I received the e-mail, and my client didn't have it. I waited a while, and it showed up. Just be patient.
---
I got mine. Little victories.
---
We just need to hit it like we mean it.
---
I upvoted
---
I will indeed be choosing horde. Horde is home. Probably going to do a troll. Troll mage my first character. :)
---
Do you need to be subbed to get into the stress test?
---
I was considering this possibility with so many, including myself, in the same spot. 
---
Screw ups happen, I’ll wait it out till tomorrow and it is what it is  :)
---
Plus all of us arnt kids anymore so more of us are inclined to roll horde because of the hardcore pvp tryharding
---
Same, i wanna cry right now lol
---
It'll either be a systemic issue with everything, or an issue tied to an ability.
---
A single enemy having the wrong damage/armour/HP would be ridiculous, like you're pointing out. However their abilities can def be bugged af.
---

Yeah same issue here. I saw a few other folks who have the same problem too.

Wtf?

Wierdly enough I got an invite to the stress test but didn't get an invitation email lol.

I was able to download it tonight. Says "beta and stress test" so not sure what all that is about, but I can only see stress test servers.. Fucking jebaited
---
Kind of the same.   
---
I have 2 EU accounts, one from 2004 and the other one from 2013.   
---
The one from 2013 got access. The one from 2004 didn't.
---
It’s beta, you play something different from what you actually plan on playing on live because this isn’t a test run it’s a chance to discover issues with the game others might run into
---
The thing is naxx won't be out until like 2 years in. So it might be worth doing.
---
I think there are a lot of people who are going to re-learn how squishy clothies are.
---
Hi, /u/KrusherNC
---
stress test is 2 hours technically. it’s just open for a day
---
Even back in 2005 we knew how to use Print Screen.
---
The email usually sends a couple of hours later. I got an invite around 3 pm and didn't get an email until like 6:30
---
I had the opposite, access to stress test &amp; beta a few hours ago but no email. Bizarre.
---
What's the perks of being blacksmith as a tank warrior early on? Is there some decent gear one can make for themselves?
---
Who is claiming that Ion would act any other way, he has never shown any free thinking methodology since being in charge. Just a play the game my way or else one. I think you are lost Ion is a much newer developer lead and was a vile piece of shit as a raider before joining Blizz. To be fair, it reflects his personality as a dev, although toned down greatly because he cannot just tell us to play the damn game and shut up. You can tell he wants to though constantly.

[To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22990080/mark-your-calendars-wow-classic-launch-and-testing-schedule)

Ok just saw the launcher update when I walked past it.    Downloading now
---
[https://www.vanillafriends.com/](https://www.vanillafriends.com/)   
---
Would be your best bet to reconnect.
---
You just ruined this subreddit. Literally hitler.
---
monitored portion yes. Stress test server is open for 26 hours tho.
---
If your name is still only in use on 2 servers it may not get snagged.
---
When your name is in use everywhere that’s when you should worry.
---
this is the funniest trend on this sub gj posters
---
I don't get it, are all these things out of fashion now?
---
Eh, it'll be pretty quick if you don't really have to take encounters slowly and can pull 4+ quest mobs without dying
---
I got an email saying I was in for stress test.  But have nothing in my launcher. :,(
---
I would hate to dedicate two years to this game getting the best PVP gear possible, just to be destroyed in PVP when Naxx gear comes out that I won’t have.
---
Damn. I got so excited and now i have to choose between raid night and this :( qq
---
Others knowing how to rush through it isn’t going to affect you. And there is a ceiling on that knowledge so it isn’t like you can’t catch up in knowledge.
---
pretty sure this guy solo grinded GM https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-gb/character/eu/perenolde/fartzwrgoben/achievements/legacy/player-vs-player
---
he's been famous forever for his obscene honorable kill count (2.3million now) but i remember him originally for being that solo rank grinder, could be mistaken though
---
Same here
---
Yea doesn’t work for me with restarting or logging out and in as well.
---
Booo retail!
---
Yay classic!
---
I was gonna guess UD too, but didn't wanna assume your faction
---
I agree it’s a slippery slope but if you keep the core abilities the same from vanilla and just adjust the stats to compete there’s not really a difference..
---
I mean, I do understand it. If you have a group of, say, 5 people of the same class that have had to compete and out-bid each other for months for gear constantly so they can all gear up. And say they all had to spend, say, 2000 DKP to get where they are. Then a new member of that class gets invited and gets 100% caught up to all of them in one run from pure luck and doesn't have to pay any sort of due and doesn't even have to make up anything close to that 2000 DKP deficit... Meaning they can start outbidding the people that put in the time sooner than later for upgrades that the rest of the players waited a long time for? That can be kind of bullshit.
---
Yes, a perfectly run loot council can fix that, but loot councils can have their own pitfalls, too.
---
There really isn't a perfect loot system that can be hard-coded - which is kind of beautiful in its own way.
---
Lol I've been playing both over the past year, got to a 60 Hunter on PServers and a ~50 priest.
---
Wish I could tell you, they're both insanely fun IMO and I can't pick myself. I was going to decide of who gets to wear cooler looking gear, but they both are tied for best looking pieces (that they actually get to wear as BiS; warlocks lose out because of blood vine and paladins because of dresses). PvP they are two of the most fun classes as well, both are easy levelers (although Hunter 100% pulls ahead), and both have decent gold farming options once DM comes out (again Hunter is better but DME lasher farm with holy nova and thorium jump runs are still perfectly fine). 
---
It comes down to a trade-off between end game group content and end game solo content. Want more gold because you are an altoholic? Want to get into raids and 5-mans easier? Do you find healing fun? How much do you like WPvP? Do you enjoy pet micro?
---
Ultimately I'm leaning towards priest because of how much I enjoy dungeons over solo content. I'll likely have at least a level 35 Hunter as a profession alt that I'll try to get 60 with eventually though.
---
Ok seriously. I'm an idiot. I texted in sick to work tomorrow as soon as I saw this pop up in my client and hit install. 
---
I had nearly this exact reaction when I opened it. Guess I'll magically be feeling better by morning. FML
---
Dude just enjoying the fucking game.
---
Do you guys not work?
---
Didn’t they server transfer around Naxx release?
---
POG/Pog/PogChamp = something good. Kappa/Kapp = sarcasm
---
pog is 'play of the game'
---
If you're my age...
---
POG = :O
---
Kapp / Kappa = :D or perhaps :P depending on the context
---
This might seem random but the stress test isn’t open to everyone right?
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/received-stress-test-email-no-access/179242
---
Looks like a widespread issue that is being looked into.
---
This really didn't happen enough to make this a generalizable claim. It happened, very rarely, yes.
---
oh this wasn't a stream vod; i figured i could just record if i got into the beta or not alongside the stress test before playing FF14 instead. it was just lucky timing in the vid that the server was up for a split second
---
Happened the same to me.  
---
Will we be able to play the actual beta after the stress test?
---
DPS warriors are indeed great, but since you’re a warrior, people are going to try to demand that you tank.
---
It's alright if I tank sometimes, I love tanking too :)
---
Every instance of a player making those specs work was really forced shit like the ret pally chugging 100g worth of consumables in full BIS AQ40 gear and doing 25% more damage than rogues/warriors in budget MC gear and then screaming "SEE? IT'S PERFECTLY VIABLE!". 
---
Just sayin'
---
it’s literally just to test the server capacities man. it’s pretty damn important.
---
Right but what he's saying is that despite eyewitness testimony being so unreliable it is commonly believed to be one of the most reliable types of evidence (at least in the US).
---
No, only people who signed up for the beta on battle.net. Even then it wasn’t everyone who opted in. I just got it today and it’s just for the stress test.
---
more than what I got :/
---
Mine was on a PvE server, now it's a PvP server?
---
Drop devo and armor toughness. Get the shield stuff
---
Thank you! I understand the faces.. the faces we did use in vanilla. :)
---
same but email came at 7:15
---
Why is there no option for "I dont abbreviate Deadmines or Dire Maul"?
---
What if I call Dire Maul its TRUE NAME Eldre'thalas?
---
Yes. There is nothing wrong with LFR as a system, like most systems, the people using them are the problem. When you remove any and all consequences from people's actions, they tend to do whatever benefits them, and ninja looting gear that should go to someone else without any backlash is very benefiting to them.
---
On my server it was VC. I understand if it was different on other servers, but in my unique Vanilla experience it was VC.
---
At that level, most healers have enough mana to cast, maybe half a dozen spells at the most.

Optimum 40 man PvE - [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxMuZx](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgstxMuZx)
---
Optimum PvP as solo paladin - [https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgotVMtMzh](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxurgotVMtMzh)
---
Paladin builds center around what the team needs. There are various niches to fill. None of them will involve reckoning. 5% spell crit is huge for a paladin. 
---
If you take the optimum PvP build the optimum for a second pally would not be the same build. It would compliment it with improved might for example. In PvE there are various niches that need to filled. So it's very possible you can raid in the PvP spec optimally and never have to respec.
---
If you don't wanna be a pure healer I would not recommend paladin. Can you raid like you're suggesting? Yes. Will anyone good let you? No
---
5% spell crit isn't something that's negotiable for a paladin. If you can do that why does anyone have to buff? Whole thing breaks down
---
Literally 2 hours too.
---
IF anything, the devs at Nostalrius are to praise, they obviously went to great lengths after the server was shut down to get this.
---
Besides, not to lick blizzard's ass but i'm pretty sure the reason they've never tried to make classic servers was because they didn't know how to, so telling the player base about looking into classic with no means how will more likely frustrate them.
---
 getting an old game like WoW running on old technology to run on what we have today is not easy.
---
r/wowcirclejerk is leaking
---
"life tap+heals"
---
....all healers will hate you.

It depends on the server. It was definitely called DM on mine, even after DM was released.

7 days /played to 60 seems like more then most can handle imo.
---
Lesson learned my friend

Also got in, oceanic as well for those wondering.

How can we tell if this invite is just for the 2 day stress test or the full beta?

Hold on, did you make an argument yet? cause I haven't seen anything other than ' BRS have good lore' which is honestly doesn't explain why you'd enjoy running over and over, but not any of the modern dungeon who also have great lore.
---
retail suck? still have millions playing my man. MDI and mythic raid races pulling huge numbers on twitch.
---
BoD is one of the best raid ever, and uldir wasn't far behind.
---
let's see how classic does a month or 3 after release, heh?
---
as far as lurking these forum goes... I'm actually in the beta, so it seem appropriate.
---
_surprised pikachu_
---
all of the threads thus far have been using videos from vanilla as evidence, which also actually lead to the fix of at least one bug
---
this us vs them shit is super childish and pathetic
---
This is a must!

Hi, /u/Drummcycle
---
Read the blue posts ffs
---
I did this when i ranked my sham on nost, its hardly noticable as long as you still heal haha
---
&gt;but honestly it worked really well because everyone knew as soon as he started talking about flavors what it was going to be.
---
My tired dumbass that was dragged out of bed like 3 hours earlier than normal had no clue and was just hyped to see someone who also liked Cookies &amp; Cream flavor, because I swear nobody else likes that flavor.
---
tf kinda golf courses you playing on?
---
Jokes on him cuz enhance is literally the worst spec you can play in classic.
---
For me it's more of a fuck you from blizzard than anything, so why would I want to help them test servers the they should already have working from 2005 where millions of people played also
---
On my vanilla server it was most common to hear DM, though I did hear VC too at times.
---
Is world chat on beta a community created channel with 50 cap or auto opt in and no cap??
---
But I have a work thing tomorrow. :(
---
But most BIS paladin OHs are like flowers and shit. Can't block with flowers.
---
Haha ok. I think I'll stick to the faces. :P
---
Mine showed up
---
So I got the email around 10:13pm EDT.. Nothing available in the launcher BUT I can access the beta section of the forums now?  Can't post though... Very weird.
---
Hi, /u/dopherman
---
This. I'd probably go 20/31. Divine favour makes you a little bit better healer but the area you will really need help in is tanking if you want to be viable, you really want holy shield and shield spec. Something like [this](https://classicdb.ch/?talent#sVxdMxZVGpIczxo)
---
Found the mage!
---
I got an invite to stress test as well and my account is an original vanilla account with those characters still on it.  I only resubbed yesterday and haven't had my sub active for about 9 months now. Just FYI for others.
---
Actually I will be playing a warlock ;)
---
Thanks for the heads up.
---
Reckoning?
---
Yeah that won’t work
---
Restart your client maybe. Worked for me at least.
---
They had to basically completely rewrite it on new technology and are no doubt using new servers. To not stress test it would be irresponsible.
---
agreed ill be there for the whole 2 hours getting to level 5 slowly lol
---
Check your launcher tho. Seems a lot of people got this email but not everyone actually had their account flagged.
---
"which server you live in real life" 
---
Thanks for the giggle lol
---
To me, it was always DM.
---
But to be fair, seeing so many supporters for both sides, it's pretty clear that both DM and VC have been used a lot. Depends on the server or depends on the guy who was spading this on general chat in Westfall back when you were levelling there.
---
Cookies &amp; Cream is the best flavor though.
---
I agree they should stress test it, but why wouldn't they give players who helped them out by logging in, access to the beta?
---
I was all about cookies and cream as a kid.  These days my top choice is French Silk, though I honestly eat more vanilla than anything else because Edys isn't on sale nearly as much as everything else.
---
Rough. You do security?
---
thanks :)
---
There is some, but for the good gear you will need rare recipes. If you get them tho you could become a known blacksmith on your server and even make some decent gold.
---
And they weren't. I got in. So emotional right now over a frickin stress test, but its nice to be involved. Just goes to show I need to be more optimistic in the face of disappointment. Thank you for the solace!!!
---
I dunno, Have you played BfA?
---
How did that pally break out of intercept stun? Intercept is supposed to stun for 3 seconds.
---
Everyone can see that forum. You just can't post.
---
Yep. I got the email, account hasnt been flagged yet.
---
I got invited, and now the servers are offline.
---
It'll be significantly quicker than that on Classic since you had people breaking 4 days /played on private servers that we now know have mobs doing 20%+ too much damage, with some over 50%.
---
I think the reason you aren't understanding each other is because he is retail and using his experience in retail as an example of common sense. You are arguing that looking for proper stats is common sense, which is true. His brain has been trained by retail and his "common sense" is being based off retail rather than in general, hence he thinks it's common sense to factor in the armor type too since paladins don't wear cloth in retail. 
---
In a way, it's a fair point. He may not be very smart, but neither are 90% of the players coming to Classic. They will mostly be retail players who barely understand retail, much less more nuanced old school mechanics. They will think the exact same way as him and get mad when they see a paladin rolling on their cloth. It's something that is going to have to be addressed for months in each and every dungeon until these people quit and move back to retail.
---
My two favorite memories from closed beta. First was classes having no talents. Second was the hunter being first introduced.
---
I still love dreadmist even to this day

You if you are running a dps meter add-on it's highly likely to be the cause

"world" chat is a custom channel (player made and moderated) with no cap as far as i know, it resets every server restart and lead it passed on when the leader logs off.
---
LookingForGroup is a blizzard made channel with no one player having control over it, the only gate keeper is blizzard.
---
Or me who got the stress test but has to work lol.
---
I Got my account flagged but no email...
---
Yikes. Wasn't going to even bother with this but you're hilariously out of touch. 
---
&gt; The fact is, they were lazy, and made changes where they could not recreate the original.
---
Do you actually think that a small group of people hosting and trying to get a game as close to the original as possible for thousands of people are "lazy"? And they did this for **FREE**.
---
older millennials who enjoy things that are considered to be out of touch with younger millennials, particularly in regards to video games

---
As a mage in Warsong Gulch, I plan to go a frost spec that uses Imp Blizzard, Permafrost, as well as Frostbite, which normally you should never do. But it's so good at locking down the enemy druid flag carrier, in order to buy my team time to catch him. It's gonna be soooo fun!
---
The won't be using his armor rating much in raids either wearing cloth healer gear, but he's planning to do more than raiding with the spec. The shield talents are incredibly powerful for PvP, fairly important if he wants to tank dungeons, and they also enable him to AoE grind super effectively with Blessing of Salvation (and reckoning is a pretty nuts bonus for that too).
---
Find friends to play with, it will definitely help your experience
---
Alliance scum...
---
THANK THE GODS FOR BESSIE AND HER TITS
---
If only I had access.
---
Yeah, I’m not downloading it just to play for 2 hours.
---
Correct. There are many more invites going out for the stress test, but it still isn't everyone that has opted into the beta.
---
There was a twitch streamer who did this on live who planned on doing it if he got into Beta, glad someone's doing it though.
---
As much as we want it to come out right now. 
---
Seeing the beta it's clear that classic is not ready.
---
Paladin Tank??? 
---
Holy or GTFO
---
This is a very detailed way of saying "We know better than you".
---
You can grind 1-6 basically the same speed you can quest. The bad part is you get less items.
---
I’m right there with ya brother.
---
This looks like Elder Scrolls: Arena, God damn these drawings are good tbh.
---
I've pulled fresh noob friends (like noob noobs who had never played WoW before) into vanilla pservers before. In my experience, all they have to do is make sure to let people know, like TELL people "hey, I'm new, never played this before, I'm open to instructions." 
---
A lot of pserver players automatically assume everyone else is a pserver vet and tend to judge others by a higher standard because they think everyone is experienced - but if newbies just say they're new and show willingness to learn stuff, usually people will be a lot more forgiving.
---
- finally gets BETA access
---
- still finds a reason to complain
---
Yikes.
---
So how old is a boomer? I thought boomers came from post war time area. 40s and 50s babies
---
Like others have said, it's an act. Asmon know's hes a legitimately bad player, but purposefully acts even worse. Then gets overly excited in an exaggerated fake manner. The 8 year olds eat it up.
---
Does anyone have 2 PTR accounts by chance? I'm hoping that's not blocking beta from appearing on my launcher.
---
- still finds a reason to complain 
---
Boomers 🤮
---
I do but that shouldnt affect it.
---
&gt; not showing
---
also have this same problem let me know if it shows up or you find a solution!
---
Had to hook this brother up with some Twitch Prime Sub
---
Two things can be true at once.
---
1. Private servers are not 100% accurate.
---
2. It's okay if sometimes bug reports turn out to be non-bugs.
---
There, can we be done now?
---
and alt+f4 gives you faster running speed. we all know the cheats my man.
---
I fear that it might (back-end system issue)...
---
I feel you. Been playing for 12 years, never got invited to any beta. Feels bad as fuck.
---
Um yeah... like exactly how they said it would work?
---
Same for me, but showed up after about 30 minutes or so.

it’s up for 24

**[A] Kiwi/Aus Semi-casual Raiding Guild (NA | PvE)**
---
In Vanilla WoW, many more people ran dungeons as they levelled. It was common to meet likeminded people and make friends as you journeyed through Azeroth. The world was huge, with lots to experience – and that experience was magnified for people who joined a guild whose members supported and helped each other.
---
This is a guild where you can hang out and chat, join guild-led instance runs, quest together, and give and receive help with classes and game mechanics.
---
**Are you a progression guild?**
---
This is intended to be a guild for people who work full-time and have families but still want to enjoy playing Classic with others. We are going to take our time to level to 60, but there is an expectation to gear up and delve into raiding (and a bit of level 60 PvP).
---
**What are the requirements?**
---
The guild has a few rules:
---
* Be open and willing to accept all different kinds of players, with different levels of experience, a different approach to how they play and different real-life commitments
---
* Have a good attitude to the game in general and towards your guildmates, regardless of how they choose to play; be willing to help others where needed, albeit dungeon runs, supporting alts or helping people with group quests
---
* Be willing, as you approach level 60, to work towards pre-raid gear
---
* Be free for three hours, two nights a week for dedicated raiding progression
---
* Be communicative: let the guild leader or other guild officers know if you need to take a break or can’t attend a raid or event.
---
This is about community and helping each other enjoy the game; but understanding that sometimes life itself prevents you from doing everything you may want to do.
---
**Is this guild only for Kiwis/Aussies?**
---
We will be raiding 9 p.m. to 12 a.m. NZST (New Zealand Standard Time), two nights a week – but anyone is welcome to join.
---
**Do I have to have played vanilla WoW?**
---
This guild is a place of acceptance, where anyone with the right attitude and willingness to learn and improve can find a home. I’m looking for people with dedication, who are willing to level to 60 and enjoy playing with like-minded people as part of a supportive community.
---
**I didn’t see a name. What is the guild called?**
---
We have a few names in mind, which we are discussing on Discord.
---
I am hoping that those who are happy with the choice of name when the time comes will be willing to pitch in and help pay the 10s for the guild charter.
---
**How do I apply?**
---
We have a guild Discord server (https://discord.gg/wc6Eye3) where you can put in an application; or PM me on Discord: Lokhor#2882.
---
Peace.
---
Might as well download it. It's the same client as the beta, so it might save some time later on.
---
I did, nodda. 
---
Logged into my friends account to download the client lol
---
And it only takes 20 hours of farming Gnomer per week!
---
Well to be fair I only got invited for two hours to play and I work during those two hours so...
---
So I did have some addons installed, but even with no addons in the addon folder im getting the problem, is there any cache or something i can clear somewhere?
---
Rookie numbers, etc
---
But that was the whole point in Vanilla, the community feel. If you D’ed over someone multiple times the entire server would hear about it — and not party with you later. 
---
Those of you who have only played LFG won’t get it at first, but will eventually.
---
Thank the retail players for their service though for real. I couldn't imagine the hell it would be to pay to play such a trash abomination of a game willingly.
---
Cable internet baby :3, but no my family wasn't rich XD
---
At least in late, late vanilla very early BC (I started in 2007, BC was out, but this argument was raging on), it was DM in NA too. 
---
Some weirdos called it VC and **demanded** the server change.  They lost that war.
---
It's DM.
---
He's gonna be like Dexter in that episode of Dexter's Lab where he could only say "omelet du fromage" after his French CD started replaying that phrase while he slept. 
---
"Hey man how's it goin"
---
"LIVE TO WIN!"
---
"...uh, alright, you enjoy your week off?"
---
"TIL YA DIE!"
---
i started playing like two days ago and just got it lol
---
Yeah I’m sure there will be many more invites going out in the next few months. Just feels bad going from “holy shit I’m gonna play all night” to “oh...ok...” lol. 
---
Have played since vanilla, never played on a private server since nothing is definitely permanent. Cannot wait for August 27th!
---
You carebear lol.
---
What if someone comes in your farming area of the opposite faction. And they tag your mobs? You fucking kill them on a pvp server.  Cause that's your farming area. ... and if you cant kill them and you keep trying, you just accept it.
---
What do you do on a pve server? /wave
---
Never trust Activision Blizzard
---
Omg really? Like it's exactly what they announced it would be? No way!
---
GET THIS MAN A HOT POCKET.
---
How do you know if you jave beta access? I applied but cant see. 
---
I need an active sub to get an invite or can only play if I have one?
---
What do you think people will call Dire Maul when we all hit 60. Nobody will ever run deadmines when we are gearing up after MC. We'll only focus on running DM.
---
You can have 1000 witnesses it's still shit compared to measurement and data collecting instruments. XD
---
Just look at the Phoenix Lights as an example of that.
---
okay internet wasnt [THIS](https://i.imgur.com/ZyRF3Lz.png) bad in 2004

"Install now and get ready to rush our test realm as soon as it opens at 4:00pm PDT Wednesday, May 22, until 6:00pm PDT . Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019.
---
The World of Warcraft Classic Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test. Once the stress test period is over, you’ll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23."
---
So stress test starts tomorrow and ends the next day?
---
It's up for more than 2 hours. If you had actually read the posts you would know that the initial stress test that they'll be paying attention to is 2 hours, but the server will be up until Thursday.
---
https://gyazo.com/1c0552b6222b8c4fb1adb4a5bc784843
---
That's exactly what he said...
---
Yeah idk why they didn’t make it at least 10. I don’t see many people playing after the first hour.
---
Lol ya no kidding. Most of us are standing out in the rain looking in at the people playing.
---
Didnt know there was a joke to be had?
---
Privat servers are wrong is such a blanket statement.
---
Uhhh...  yeah, you're a little late. They're sold out everywhere
---
[No wonder Thrall found the Tauren and Darkspear so quickly in a place like 1999 Kalimdor.](https://tenor.com/view/small-ken-jeong-community-too-small-to-read-read-gif-5494204)
---
This is really cool! Cant believe I've never seen this before.  Very interesting how the map has changed over time.  Thanks for sharing!
---
I actually envy the fact that you have no idea what you're doing. It sucks that I have my exact leveling route planned out, along with my professions and everything else.
---
It’s open all day. But you can only get to lvl 5 regardless
---
Yeah. I hope it works but if not it’s not the end of the world. Hopefully if it was an accident or screw up they give up beta invites or something.
---
yeah why the hell would i help stress test and help blizz get all the info they need to help make sure launch day goes as smooth as possible?
---
Any old people here?  I had a game in the 90s called [Menzoberranzan](https://www.google.com/search?ei=NsjkXN7eB6yl_QbC-5SQBQ&amp;q=menzoberranzan+game&amp;oq=menzoberranzan+&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.1.3.0i20i263l2j0l8.2590.2590..5074...0.0..0.119.119.0j1......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71.ojigjQjVUVY)... I think your drawing has better graphics than that game did but they look a lot alike.
---
They hated Jesus...
---
Walk Idiot Walk - By the Hives
---
Damn I saw that they released one but didnt know it was for classic wow,  thought it was just for 15 year anniversary
---
I think you’re referring to the 15 year anniversary edition that sold out recently. He is asking about a classic edition.
---
It won't.
---

---
"Dude I have played since Legion" Hahahaha
---
I got mine around the same time. Updated everything and redownloaded battle net and still nothing. Fingers crossed it works out for us.
---
Leveling without the no-life 60 horde gankers. AKA enjoying redridge
---
Threw mine away about three years ago :(
---
I'm not sure about the future, but at the very least for the next two years until all phases are released, we don't have to worry about that.
---
Over the years there were changes that everyone hoped for but brought ruin to the game and then there were changes that nobody wanted and yelled at blizzard for adding them, Blizz still pulled the trigger nonetheless. When you ask when Wow people say it's best it's either Vanilla or TBC... the further you go, the more changes are implemented, the more brilliant ideas of developers or players are put in the game, the worse Wow becomes. 
---
So for any additions or what not. Blizzard, JUST don't. 
---
Make classic servers, and then make TBC and probably stop there. Once TBC runs out from content, it should be at least 4 years from now.
---
And well... 20th anniversary of Wow... hell, it's about time for WoW2.
---
If you're not playing at 6fps you're not playing classic wow.
---
I'm a smaller content creator, but I'll be streaming my experience on Twitch for anyone interested - https://www.twitch.tv/cooleobrad. Good luck on your invites!
---
only tomorrow up to lvl 5 YUCK
---
False. It's a money game. Blizz waited for the best time to get the most money/subs... I mean, I can't really blame them.
---
I got an invite to the stress test. NA Account from early 2005. I wasn't subbed for the last 7 months, but I did resub a couple days ago in hopes of an invite.
---
yeah that's what I'm trying to say.
---
Is it possible their test server is out? I'm not saying it is. I can't even imagine them just switching on the wrong patch but things like that have been know to happen. I'd rate that at a low possibility, but people are acting like that's impossible and whatever information gleaned from that test server is the world of God. 
---
If you're making a list of possibilities at least entertain all possibilities. What I am trying to say is there's a spy in blizzard HQ that is trying to sabotage vanilla by slightly adjusting damage values of NPCs. Or pirates have kidnapped their family members and are demanding they do it themselves!!!!!
---
Ahhhhh it just can't be trueeeee
---
Would you enlighten us on this distilled wisdom exploit?
---
Meh, cookie cutter shit has all been done to death. Might as well do something that requires a bit of a challenge. I doubt there's any lvl 60 5 or 10 man that would be particularly challenging with a pally tank.
---
I love this art style you have
---
Somehow I got a stress test invite, re-subbed 2 days ago.  Made my account in BFA (August 2018).
---
My brothers account, which is un-subbed, but opted-in, was created in TBC (December 2007) did not receive an invite.
---
yea i hope after the stress test they invite some of us to the beta.
---
you may need to restart your launcher.
---
What would you actually be doing with your free time
---
Nothing you do matters fam
---
I'm really enjoying all these wholesome posts lately.
---
If you talking about the click.em.blizzard.com/ those are official links.
---
I played in BL as well. Ropetown and Aenigma were tops. I raided with Turmoil (Horde).
---
This
---
yeah, me aswell, except i got like 5 weeks :3
---
thinking about skinning + herbalism/mining first, then tailor/enchanter after i hit maxlevel. i dont think there is a big gain out of tailoring whilst leveling, but there is an opportunity cost of gold (lost through not picking another gathering skill instead)
---
i had dsl by 2004
---
Why for only 2 hours... that’s so stupid
---
It was probably reported a shit ton as well.
---
Just got it now?
---
Seriously why would you enter a legally binding contract with someone who is going to control your free time to the extent that you cant enjoy your own hobbies.
---
Dont get me wrong im a retard too in many ways but bruhhh lol
---
Same! I got mine 2 hours ago, installing now. Really excited to at least participate a little, and fingers crossed for more.
---
Sucks to suck 🤗
---
That dude has turned into such a cynical douche. Something clearly happened in his life and it's sad af.
---
I really liked his first bunch of videos. The guy clearly knows alot about the game. Especially his vids regarding TBC was good.
---
Hopefully he'll find inner peace somehow.
---
No changes
---
I’m totally with you. Could you link the streamer you watched? I watched a retail player play classic his first time and it was just fascinating as he made fun of the game but ended up having fun with it.
---
As am I, glad to be included in your wholesome definition.
---
yeah, that's what I was planning to do. Just thinking it's going to potentially be an issue when there's that many people trying to grind mobs, though grouping for higher level mobs might be viable
---
I'm in here somewhere! Valmiyr from &lt;Addiction&gt;. I remember this. I see a couple of my guildmates at the top, Nomak and Dorei. 😁
---
Shit looks dope! Fuck retail LG beta classic!
---
The way it’s worded l, you’ll have access to the server for 24 hours.... sadly lvl cap will be 5 ... not much to do tbh after the short stress test windows .
---
Right? 
---
oh my god i just can't! 
---
this!
---
so much this!
---
I got the same email an hour ago and have been refreshing [battle.net](https://battle.net) without seeing anything all day! Keep hope alive people!
---
Didn't have the option to download the stress test client till a few minutes ago and I got the email 2 hours ago so maybe they've fixed it.
---
Yeah, haven't received any official blizzard emails in a while, so I was wary.  Still, never hurts to play it safe.
---
Well, once you leave that 1-6 zone, things really start to spread out. I guess the only thing I'll miss out on if I just grind is cloth (for bandages), because my first weapon upgrade is purchased at the vendor.
---
I got an email invite a little over an hour ago. Still can't DL the beta client though.
---
Yeah i def still plan on working here or there. Hoping to be out of this rat race by 50ish. Then its all day gym wow sleep repeat
---
Stress test is for two hours.  I’m guessing we have to flood the server see if we can overload it in 2 hours.  
---
Lower beyond the pic says I can keep playing for a few more days but it won’t be stress test
---
Kek
---
You said. You specifically said that being able to get correct information from him is your job. It means you are waiting for / needing information from him.
---
Oh okay thats good then. I can play after all lol
---
well thats dumb. REMOVE
---
Yeah mine used to say PvP, now it says PvP as well.
---
weird
---
So #nochanges if you're living in Australia anyway
---
Unless you can gen enough mats to start crafting those juicy bags at 35(probably not realistic but it would still be a lot faster than getting 60 first)
---
Shares DR with charge.
---
There 2 posts about it on hot look for it, one if them have a transcription on it.
---
That's totally not the case. Rogues and warriors top the meters pre-naxx (In Naxx also for horde due to Windfury) because they scale so well with world buffs and consumables.
---
Then they xferred from Executus when the server started dying, right?  I remember those guys.  Them and Eye Candy were the big dogs on the server.
---
People just have to learn to understand that it was harder before because it was the first time and you had no idea what you were doing. There's already more than enough evidence of the damage being the same and all that people have been complaining about since beta started. It's just easier now because of the years that have passed and the amount of time you've all spent in MMORPGs. STAHP IT xD
---
A Warrior with Mana?
---
How long does DR last on stuns?
---
I'm still crying
---
Zug zug
---
Here it is:  [https://imgur.com/a/02ciSpr](https://imgur.com/a/02ciSpr)
---
You don't have to be prot though. Just slap a shield and some tank gear on and you're all good.
---
I think Blizzard did just fine putting it to rest than some random ass video.
---
I just got it too!!!! Is there where I can get hype?!
---
I'm going back in after playing it before. I have every intention of goofing around, fishing, making bags and taking my sweet time to level and have fun. I can promise you that we've all forgotten where things are - you will not be alone in asking questions &lt;3
---
Same here. Email was received about an hour ago, no change in launcher yet.
---
Heck the last year flew right past me and I wasn’t even having fun. Time just flies!
---
It was sent about 2 hours ago
---
MOB damage under  a certain level was massively reduced in a stealth patch in vanilla
---
1.1 mob damage is WAY less than 1.12.1 damage you dumb ape
---
It does help a lot! Thanks a ton for the work
---
Cucked
---
No "my feet hurt" 0/10 
---
;)
---
You don't understand how much lvl 5 duels mean to me ok?
---
I shared my account with a friend back in wrath, got banned, appealed ban, denied..... apparently I was trying to sell my account by doing so.
---
On the other hand I've heard people that have shared with no issue so yeah....
---
Yeah I got in earlier today (only for stress test I guess), for PVP
---
Thanks! That's hilarious!
---
what could be more serious?
---
IM FIRIN MAH LAZAR
---
Diablo 3 on the whole was just one giant troll.
---
thats true, I was even thinking of something like grind to ~4, peace out of starting zone (if tons of people are trying to tag mobs nearby) -&gt; farm level ~5 mobs then head to skill and grind anything necessary to start questing again (assuming it's not insanely overrun again)
---
Okay so I got invited and it gave me instructions on how to download it but that just is not the case. There is nothing new in the drop down menu so just wondering if anyone knows if they're pranking a fair few of us or if you just can't install it ahead of time for the sake of inconvenience?
---
Did they really start the invite with "Sploosh" ... Someone had a good laugh at the Blizzard offices when that went through.
---
Seconded!
---
Haha I keep launching the game hoping to see the beta server listed... I'm gonna need therapy after this.
---
See you all in 2 hours!
---
That's why I said also.
---
Blizzard lies nonstop anyone who's not a retard is pretty cynical at this point.
---
People who are insecure don’t like delving into topics which can affect how others look at you. RP is one of those things. It personally isn’t my jam but it wouldn’t even phase me to go to a LARP event if the situation warranted (like a friend wanting me to go) 
---
The other side is the kind of people who wouldn’t be caught dead in LARP gear, not because they don’t like it but because of what others would think of them.
---
Those people are also insecure.
---
I think so, my understanding is it looks like their full "stress test" is trying to make as much havoc as possible from 4-&gt;6pm, and then after is just normal stuff for it being open til the next day
---
Well, just because you're level 5 doesn't mean you can't do some early quests. There's a quest in Mulgore that gives you  a green 2h maul that's like 8dps and 2 str, I believe minimum level 5. I plan on doing that. I might also do mining/engineering, because why the hell not? But no weapon training, most skills are locked, and most zones are out of the question.
---
Hey thanks for everyone that checked out the stream. I’ll be back tomorrow at 8:00 pm EST to get after it again.
---
Currently level 17 with 20 hours /played.
---
Whatever floats your boat dude.
---
It was announced the same day they announced release for a Classic WoW and it comes with a Ragnoros statue...  1+1.
---
Who knows, my drop down menu first said “wow classic beta” then it pulled a fast one on me and changed to Beta and stress test so...
---
That's my bnet username lol
---
It's the dude's name or tag or whatever
---
Same, seems rather odd.
---
I did that in vanilla.  
---
The extra focus into the totems makes a difference even though the elitists hate it. 
---
The funny thing is the fact they say you'll never be viable,  but you make the strongest classes in the game even better..... so if they can't deal with that, need to find a new guild. 
---
The sad part is most of these people didn't play vanilla.  Only private servers.... where they have created pretty toxic environments.  I just hope people choose to play the game their way,  because even if you aren't the right spec you can do everything almost.
---
I mean it helps..... but if you want to play enhance do it... 
---
I had ok gear.... Earthshaker as my 2h and mostly t1 and t2 shoulders.... I straight up enjoyed pvp and felt very confident against anything really. 
---
Raid wise I did ok.  But Windfury had crazy threat and I'd pull aggro from the tank occasionally and get killed.
---
I had this problem, email from noreply@em.blizzard.com but no drop down option on battle.net
---
Restarting my PC made it show up!
---
They already announced that the name would change to beta and stress test, even for people in the current beta.
---
I literally have not seen this yet.  Ive only seen people being angry at the idea of these arguments, never the actual arguments.
---
Shroud?
---
Stress test access isnt beta access.
---
That is nuts! RIP all priests. Low level spirit gear is mine.
---
I mean, if you live in the US there is very little reason to be gaming if you can’t afford a WoW sub.
---
IIRC, you can account share with a dependent minor (e.g. child), but all other instances are bannable. I haven't played since Cata though, so IDK if it's changed since then.
---
fair point, def have some stuff to fully think through. I think gathering proffs early are going to be a nightmare but we'll see
---
so? i dont care about private servers
---
Do you live in Africa?
---
thats not a classic collector edition you get nothing in the classic game, that's for retail.
---
Same as every other one, 15 seconds.
---
I'm having the same issue.  I sub'd a few days ago helping to get a beta invite.  Hopefully by installing the full game the dropdown for the stress test will show up..
---
Sounds like the guy he’s talking about is Venruki. I think it’s just twitch.tv/venruki or just search if not
---
Hi, /u/Banor_24
---
I am so sad. I have a class at the time of the test and I cant skip it. Heartbreak...
---
Just got mine. HYPE for 1-5 HYPE
---
Pass the link.
---
I love looking at all these old maps of Azeroth and seeing how they eventually got implemented in one way or another in modern WoW. 
---
This map, for instance, has Quel'danas (added in 2007), Northrend/Ulduar (added in 2008), and even Nazjatar (added just recently in 8.2, **twenty years** after the map was painted!)
---
I was excited to get this email too, until I realize that tomorrow blizzard will announce that it was a mistake and I won’t be getting to test it.
---
Ehh ret isn’t that threatening. Sure they can’t be peeled but their burst is predictable and their sustained dps is non existent.
---
Druids tanking? Nice joke :p
---
F
---
Ulduar, just one giant fucking continent lmao.
---
Defcamp is awesome
---
Yeah, that's probably it then. He should have feared between stuns and maybe popped bloodrage during that time.
---
What is "frame" perfect?
---
What does the stress test look like in your blizzard account (web browser)? I have a new PTR BFA one that I haven’t noticed before, but have never really paid attention.
---
I am the rules.
---
So funny to receive this email yesterday and i already completed the game during Weekend. It would be so funny to meet Diablo derploper team.
---
No? All im saying is that we dont know how things will turn out to be, and that its far too early to have any meaningful discussion about it. Its causing a divide which is currently unecessary
---
Why the fuck are tou relentlessly trying to misrepresent me, trying to make what into something i dont? This is the kind of shit im tryi g to avoid; needless antagonization, but you just camt help yourself, can you? Its like you need an enemy
---
Don't you guys feel jabaited... on the battle net tool it says "beta &amp; stress test"
---
That makes a lot more sense =)
---
i got it to but on my dropdown list i have nothing new. anyone know whats up?
---
Well then I'll take three
---
You know there’s two “e”s in *heretic*, right?
---
Defcamp
---
Oh shit, does it show my age when I call people scurbs in Overwatch? 
---
Also, over the last 10 years we transitioned from a wild-west style Xbox live system (think CoD MW2 lobbies with children screeching obscenities over others) to a super harsh auto-ban and punishment system. This has led to a lot of console gamers disconnecting the headsets to avoid being banned for calling shitty players bad.
---
I noticed it did something to the children, they all think they are gods at games when the reality is they are not even average. My friend played a game of CoD on my little brothers xbox and got 43 pages of basic challenges in one game.
---
Kids these days are proper scrubs and they don’t even know it because you cant call them out.
---
as long as its father and son/daughter you can account share in house. you cannot under any circumstance let any one other than you log into your account for any reason.
---
You know 69's a *sex position* right?
---
Truthfully, people just sucked at the game when it first came out; which is expected. But this was in the era of keyboard turning, very few add-ons and dial-up.
---
So, the suckage was turned up to 11.
---
WoW was hard, but that's because we were making it hard for us. Which is the essence of why I love it. So few resources were available on it.
---
&gt; this isn't FFXIV. healers actually have to heal in this game.
---
Lol! Shots fired.
---
I've gotten in on EU. Account made in 2005
---
Most of these have been in the Warcraft Lore prior to WoW though.
---
And yet the database is for 1.12. Funny how that works.
---
&gt; We know rag does way less damage and has way less health in 1.12.1
---
[citation needed]
---
I'll bet you whatever amount of money you're comfortable with that everyone doesnt leave in a few months
---
Account creation day doesn't matter expect for the first wave.
---
where did you get this notification? i didn't get an email or anything but i can select beta &amp; stress test in my bnet client.
---
No perks at all. It's good if you're among the first to get recipes like Lionheart Helm which all Fury Warriors want and are willing to pay high fees for the craft.
---
If you are serious about tanking you need to go Engineering.
---
Dude, I never even maxed a character before Cataclysm. You're SOO lucky to be able to experience this game with the fresh eyes of a nooblet.
---
That's the spirit. Some people are getting salty over getting invited to this because it's not the real beta. This helps ensure the servers run smoothly on launch, if invited do your part!
---
The proof is entering the dungeon, you walk in and it clearly says The Deadmines, it does not say Edwin VanCleef. Played on multiple realms and nobody ever called it VC, In fact the only time it was called VC is when I tried a private server full of people that wished they played classic and wanted to try and create a false memory for others.
---
Right now they don't even know if some of the people who got the email are supposed to be in so you might not be missing on too much.
---
The other thing is that the stress test does not give you a spot on the beta, so unless you are really desperate for playing 2 hours you are not missing much there either.    
---
It might even be that participating to the stress test disqualify you for a regular beta invite.
---
I feel for you... there was a time (recently) where I had 200 kb/s tops and I had that one for over ten years until our town finally got a better connection.

It is very likely that they will simply wait to expand the normal beta until after the first stress test. It doesn't hurt to check every so often but I would assume there aren't going to be any non-stress test specific account flags today.
---
Well what if I log in to my account, and then I get out of my computer chair and let my wife sit down and make a character. Is that bannable account sharing?
---
well that wouldn’t make sense because people with beta access are getting stress test access as well, they wouldn’t take both away at the end of it
---
Why is the right Gryphon on the bar a dick?
---
2005 account, never unsubbed (even got the wolf statue from blizzard) and today got in the stress test. No beta though, so fk me right?
---
Nah
---
confirmed about 2 hours ago but I bet there will be more invites tomorrow.
---
yes, I have it downloaded, when I try to play the only server available is "classic stress test" but of course, its offline.
---
I think it's strictly to test layering functionality under server load.  That's all.  It's a huge technical service that is being introduced and it's gotta work.  They gotta address risk early, that's all.
---
uninstall battle.net launcher and the reinstall, wodked for me anyway
---
Watch people stream the game for 5 days, get offered 2 hours in.
---
I got the email a couple of hours ago and I just now received the option to download it, so yours might still be coming
---
What
---
The best part about being a Druid is being able to heal, but not having to res 40 idiots
---
He didn't really do anything right. No battleshout, pointless disarm. If he stuck and just dps'd then bashed a heal with a 1h/s macro swap he could win. Save intim shout for bop, kite with hamstring for combat drop and re-charge for lots of rage. Intercept is not that useful but if you're going to use it make sure it's not DRed.
---
My friend and I had a rule that your last level (eg 59-60) you had to have the song on repeat for the entire time. He has stopped playing now but I still do it every expansion.
---
Disrespectful
---
BlizzardCS confirmed [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/BlizzardCS/status/1131032609184727041?s=19) that they're investigating this. I'm having the same problem.
---
well, it’s not beta, it’s stress test. not at all the same thing
---
You have to have an active sub to get an invite
---
Big problem is the item level disparity due to having 4 versions of each raid. I remember in MoP where my numbers went up by 3x from when i first entered Siege of Orgrimmar flex mode and when I did some serious HC raiding. Sure I knew the fights better but most of the increase was purely because of the gear.
---
If Classic becomes succesful I hope Blizzard re-evaluate alot of stuff in regards to design philosophies in retail wow. Just having one difficulty of each raid would be a good start.
---
Maybe they will make a complete new beta phase where the people of the first wave are not necessarily in but that is probably not likely.    
---
One thing for sure is that a CM on the forums said the people invited for the stress test are not in for the regular beta.
---
i got the invite but cant install it, blizzard addressed this but i wanna crryyyy ;-;
---
Omg it’s a fucking two hour stress test
---
 I found a video of a paladin 2h tanking an elite in the room after the 1st boss in deadmines
---
https://youtu.be/hdcWmvxGvoY?t=205
---
He is being hit for 20ish per white swing.
---
No one pugged raids in Vanilla. Maybe Onyxia and MC towards the end but even then it was pretty much impossible.
---
Blizz doesn't care anymore all they see is dollar signs, sadly using classic as a cash grab instead of honoring and respecting the people that played during 2004-2006.
---
In my opinion everyone that was in the demo should have been instantly invited to play the beta, they already payed 60 dollars for the invite.
---
Not US, but health can burry anyone!
---
Takes a special kind of person to be effected by down/up votes on reddit. jesus christ, haha.
---
Realm stays up until 6PM PDT the next day, just the "stress test" part is 2 hours.
---
Good bot
---
Legendary catch bro. Hopefully blizzard sees this bug. Post it on the forums too for better visibility!
---
just came from work and opened my email and i got invited btw the email is from 10:20pm Est
---
While you drop combat after Feign Death you can swap used trinkets 
---
Get Engineering (also for more usefull trinkets to swap ... net!! ... dmg reflectors) 
---
Pet is dmg monster while leveling, at lvl 60 it's more for utility 
---
Viper Sting is insanely good ... 
---
At 60 you can use build with less dmg but more utility, Scatter Shot + Intimidation ... it can be good if it suits your play style 
---
Buy and use cheap potions ... they are situational but for pvp they are a must have (there is a video on YouTube about best consumables for pvp in vanilla ... add to it swimming and walking on water potions, than water is your advantage zone)
---
Can't wait for someone to kite stitches to Goldshire.  :D
---
That art is actually pretty good.
---
To bad that im going to be working :(
---
I closed battle.net and waited 5 minutes before opening it. and then it showed up. Thank you.
---
&gt;You said. You specifically said that being able to get correct information from him is your job. It means you are waiting for / needing information from him.
---
I think your view of reading comprehension differs from mine, but this is literally what I wrote...
---
"***my "job" is to be able to get correct information out to the players*** \- not conjecture, not misinformation and not outright lies"
---
Good guilds have reliable and trustworthy people that don't play meme specs.
---
&gt; You can't assume you will have the same experience
---
considering the same close community feeling is there on both the beta and private servers i think you can
---
Correct me if I’m wrong, but they compared Asmongolds received damage, to their own character in similar gear... on the same beta? If the beta damage is low, how does testing it on the beta prove anything?
---
It started as DM, but eventually people started calling it VC and it stuck
---
Yea, there it is. You need correct  information from him.
---
the reports show which talent or items or w.e your reporting on so i doubt they read each one its probably really easy to see things that have a bunch of reports
---
👍
---
Honestly you won’t get banned for account t sharing unless it’s blatantly obvious. Like if it’s day 2 of launch and blizzard see that you’ve been questing for 48hrs straight with no stopping then yeah you might get banned but letting friends play. I highly doubt it.
---
If it’s in your client you got in.
---
Mate it's being compared to old forum posts and videos.
---
What? Something happened or is this an old meme?
---
Lol
---
I've got an active sub, and my account was created December 2004, no invite, just bad luck.
---
Bingo. Everyone freaking the fuck out cause “they had an account since 1865 and didn’t get an invite QQ” to the god damn 2 hour stress test
---
Where is pandaria?
---
Bro where's your bug reporter?
---
I'll reiterate my point that DKP is just an over-complicated way of taking turns gearing up.
---
Even with the new guy who geared up 10 pieces in 2 runs, he knows he is going to get scraps during progression for a while, that he benefited from the "catch up mechanic" that is having some content on farm. 
---
You also need to take into account all the time and effort it takes to keep track of the DKP itself. The cost/benefit analysis leans toward it being more trouble than it's worth, in my mind.
---
starts 4:00 pm PST, then is live for 26 hours!  but only level 5 maximum.
---
The problem isn't reporting values you think are off, but saying the blue poster is wrong when he used the actual 1.12 client for reference and you use your feelings to prove a point. Scroll the thread, people are full tinfoil hat the blues want to ruin our game mode.
---
They won't because next it will be elite mobs, then X boss then X elites, then crocolisks if we play on a full moon on a rogue with a fish equipped and the letters G T or L in their characters name.
---
It will never stop, not until blizzard release the actual database values for classic, and they will never do that because it's a gift to private servers.
---
I've linked several thread makers videos where vanilla characters are recieving the exacts same damage but because the damage doesn't "feel right" then it must be wrong. An actual video of elites in the deadmines being tanked by a 2h paladin isn't enough evidence against their "feelings"
---
It will never stop.
---
Jelly?
---
Just make sure you get to atleast 35 on all of them so you can have an army of alts being able to craft arcanite bars and mooncloth on a daily basis :)
---
&gt; There was a twitch streamer who did this on live who planned on doing it if he got into Beta
---
Unfortunately with level scaling it's not really much of an achievement on live.
---
That Tabula Rasa trailer mid interview. My heart breaks.
---
Wow. First of all, I did not insult you or call you names. There was no call for your overreaction.
---
Second of all, how many vanilla twinks can you dig up at this level slung these encounters?
---
Third, Blizz has already reproduced one encounter reported as "bugged" in the 1.12 reference client. Same class, similar gear, damage was correct.
---
Lastly, I think I have been more  than clear that this still warrants double checking to be sure it's working correctly and to rule out unexpected client bugs. 
---
So again, your hostility is entirely unwarranted. Imagine being so defensive because somebody on the internet doesn't think 240p YouTube videos without full gear sets is automatically comparable to twinked it beta streamers, especially after the reference client has debunked at least one damage bug report.
---
Relax dude. 2005 account here subbed through every expansion and I'm not in it either. 
---
It's a stress test, it's only 5 levels, not the end of the world man.
---
I haven't seen Reddit detective work as good as this since the Biston bomber
---
that keeps getting worse as you get older
---
Negative. 4pm to 6pm PTD may 22nd. 2 hours to get to level 5.
---
I fucking love you and your family.
---
This is the correct answer. The abbreviation meta shifted at some point.
---
Depends on what the expectations are, not to mention the context here, I was mainly responding to this:
---
&gt; Come on guys =( Vanilla was amazing because of the community, don't ruin it by bringing this new age internet meme shit here.
---
That just sounded like the expectations are a little too optimistic and it's healthier to go into classic understanding that the whole spectrum of human behavior will be present, just as it always was.
---
sounds legit
---
Dude its better to have your account flagged but no email, than the large group of people who got the email but no flag. they might not be getting beta, you for sure will be.
---
No it's worse.
---
Why are people so keen to play these meme specs? Is it because they play them in retail and somehow get the notion that the playstyle is similiar? 
---
If that's the case then I got some news for them: They are not the same. Not even close.
---
As a Shadowpriest you got 3 buttons to push. No procs and go OOM before anyone else. Sounds like great fun to me
---
It depends on what live server you were on. Mine called it DM.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a9l2hCoaLII ?
---
Alright reality check here... Warrior dps is good, but creates too much threat. By the time you hold back on dps in order for the tanks to hold aggro, you are doing lower dps than other classes.
---
this from star wars?
---
So if you're in EU, what time does the beta start and close?
---
Like thursday early morning 03.00 h CET opening...?
---
And then closing friday early morning 03.00 CET?
---
All the addons that helped destroy wow and made retail the way it is are already being installed in the beta. There's only so many bosses in Classic and people are actually looking forward to using it. Along with other addons that help you get through the game faster.
---
I'm kinda wondering what the whole point is for releasing a classic game with the very same addons that ruined it all many years ago. I kinda thought we were all gonna let Classic just be the amazing game it was without using addons. What's more ridiculous, is a lot of the veterans are using them.
---
World of Woodcraft
---
1up was so ahead of their time. They had video shows and podcasts way before they were cool.
---
I started a fresh run of the Rexxar campaign in Warcraft 3. It’s basically the prologue to the orc/troll starting zone, and it’s real fun :’)
---
either way it's data being collected.
---
So i’m 23 now and I still feel like a teenager. It snapped recently the other day that hypothetically if I was to get introuble with the law - I would be tried as an adult no doubt.
---
That hit me hard :P not that I commit crimes but still.
---
actually it kinda is as I was the reason why Paladins got fixed on private servers in the first place - well Killerduki and myself - call it pride or what have you but we literally wrote nearly every single bug report from private server to private server cuz no one else was willing or able to do the work not to mention the first Paladin guides for Vanilla
---
Call me crazy but Esfand getting a giant free access megaphone to make money and spew lies/misinformation by Blizzard doesn't make either of them look good. I mean when the Lead Dev of Classic WoW literally PMs him to say, "Dude, STFU you're completely wrong about Seal of Command..." something ain't right no matter how you slice it.
---
Shhh.. we dont talk about that expansion..
---
I've always been an altaholic, from Vanilla onwards - I didn't hit 60 until Burning Crusade despite having played the game from shortly after it launched. 
---
I don't expect that to change at all, and I'm very much looking forward to it.
---
When Final Fantasy 7 came out, there were many, many methods people created that claimed to revive a character killed in storyline.  I mean, there HAD to be a way to bring her back, right?  To troll the fuck out of everyone, there's even a weapon drop for that character only that can only be accessed in an area after she died.
---
Proving/Disproving this sort of thing was near impossible when the internet was in its relative infancy.
---
That feels when I was looking for cash for this... felt more addictive back then compared to this bfa trash.
---
That's a dream comment!
---
me too dude I am also a 2006 account still no beta or stress test invite, honestly frustrating.
---
It's not us vs. them, I'm a pserver player and dev, and pserver values are very often crap, many mechanics don't work 100% blizzlike, many bosses don't work 100% blizzlike, vanilla servers are a **crapload** of guesswork. But esp. many nostbabies think pservers ARE vanilla, and that's just annoying.
---
Video evidence and old sources (like the bestiary from 2008) always point to the dmg being correct on beta from what I could see, the others are basically the OP in various forms or cases of "I feel it's wrong so it's wrong!". There are some rare proper reports like joana with the tiger, but that's it.
---
You are free to voice your concern about it maybe not being right so they can check it, but that's it. If people want to argue then they should bring old proper evidence. But instead the forum is full of posts talking against a fucking blue post showing that dmg is the same as on their 1.12 reference setup and videos from 2006 supporting it.
---
I don't think it's going to completely go away. Take a few days back on Esfand and Asmongolds stream, they hot into Karazhan Crypts. I think all of these are going to take a little more ingenuity to get to than before (a lot more Rocket Boots and slowfall CD's).
---
I woke up for school and checked bnet launcher (it was6:40 in the morning, like 5 minutes ago) and I got the invite for stress test. So when is the test for EU today? Hope not too late.
---
The stress test is probably to check if they can do a few more waves of Classic Beta invites so don’t lose hope everyone!
---
Just realized I'm missing more than I thought. Don't have the Kazzak, Azuregos, C'Thun, Viscidus, Ouro, Gluth, Gothik or Loatheb ones. Darn.
---
Look mom! It’s retarded.
---
it would be be great if we got indication that non-boss elites are also working as expected, both in dungeons and the world
---
hah testicles
---
You down vote me because i'm right, they don't care about you or your 2004 account, Its a fact since they sold out to Activision. When you get over it you will stop crying about not getting into the beta.
---
Exactly. Better go with devilsaur set. I believe even non humans/orcs swap out edgemasters for gloves of annihiliation/Titanic leggings when they are availble.
---
Why is engineering important for a tank?
---
Half Life 3 confirmed
---
Damn... can you do a write up like this for each class? Loved the breakdown to the skill level, was very helpful as I’m trying to figure out what class to play.
---
Australia?
---
You might just get overrun by same level hordies tho
---
"These Undercity hot springs need more water!"
---
By all accounts it appears that Blizzard paused the standard beta invites and started sending stress test invites only for right now. This makes sense, because they're going to be focusing on the stress test and not the regular beta. 
---
Once the stress test ends, they will likely begin new waves of standard beta invites as they expand their focus on the broader beta. But being invited to the stress test does NOT guarantee you a normal beta invite
---
Feels like getting picked last in kickball.
---
They definitely did.  The DM vs VC chat was a common topic.
---
Oh boi here we go again
---
Completly agreed. Its thanks to Pservers that Classic is a reality. 
---
The only way to know the true values is by running the vanilla 1.12 as it was on live, that is client and old server side.
---
Second best source would be old videos showing the damage.
---
Classic damage seems to be off from the videos and from what people remember (people that did not play pservers)
---
Pservers researched this data for years and it seems to be closer to vanilla than the beta is
---
&gt; It's not about the goal
---
I think it very much is. The goal is being set by memories that are a decade and a half old, include various iterations of Classic WoW and / or P-servers that might or might not have been an accurate representation of what Classic was.
---
Taking their legacy data and getting that to run properly is probably the closest we'll get to an *objectively* close reproduction.
---
Y'all dint listen
---
I live in Rural US and get 600KB/s lol
---
Probably not. Download, login and see what servers are presented. If only 1 (and it’s offline right now) then you’ve been invited to the stress test only.
---
doesnt need to be.  hes still annoying and a douche 🤷‍♀️
---
I agree with you that the streamer described is Venruki, and may I further add on to response with a youtube video which shows a 100+ person beta wpvp event in Arathi highlands? \[this awesome video\]([https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV2Qlio5\_uk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yV2Qlio5_uk)) shows the battle between Asmongold a prominent alliance streamer and Venruki the undead mage in the battle for Arathi between a bunch of level 30s or lower!
---
You got a craftable epic shield that is amazing for AoE tanking. Grenades for pulling big packs of mobs. Handy trinkets like the +15 fire res ones that are great for MC early on when you struggle with reaching good amount of it. Same goes for the Evermoon/Gadgetzan teleports.
---
Also says beta/stress test. I just checked this morning I am at work now. Thanks for the anserw.
---
Wow dude that sucks. I hope you'll get some decent internet one day :)
---
Ok.
---
Yes this makes the most sense to me as well thanks for clarifying
---
They will all say that. You can only confirm by reviewing the servers available.
---
&gt; Blizz doesn't care anymore all they see is dollar signs... In my opinion everyone that was in the demo should have been instantly invited to play the beta
---
Uhh, wouldn't that be exactly what you're complaining about? A cash grab for virtual ticket sales by offering beta?
---
&gt; instead of honoring and respecting the people that played during 2004-2006.
---
They're creating classic for free* -- that's plenty of honor and respect for players who played during that time. They could've charged a purchase fee for Classic. They could've required a separate subscription. They could've avoided dumping resources into this low-profit project at all. 
---
They don't owe us Vanilla players anything, certainly not Beta access.
---
I'm just a little pessimistic that it's just for the stress test.
---
.save
---
Here here.
---
Just means having perfect inputs at the perfect time
---
Wanna get really mad? I got in the stress test, but I'll be at work and won't be participating.
---
It litterally is just for the stress test
---
You can see if you are invited to the closed beta or the stress test by checking the realm list
---
  **Patche 1.5**  
---
Dungeon and Raid  
---
\- The eruptions from the lava in Ragnaros's Lair will now always happen while Ragnaros is in combat. **However, these lava eruptions occur less frequently, do less damage, and the damage they inflict is now resistible.** 
---
Wash my fucking car you stupid ape
---
Most likely just the stress test.
---
26 hours. 4pm Wed until 6pm Thursday. The Blizzard monitored testing window is 4pm-6pm Wed.
---
Oh okay. Did get my hopes high.  Will see in a couple of hours. Thanks
---
i just found my email too.
---
Im just annoyed its only for the stress test. At least I can play around with the interface, but I wanted more...
---
It took mine a few hours to show up
---
At least we'll be able to try it out until Thursday
---
If you can only derive joy from novelty, you might be depressed
---
The non private server """"classic fans"""" have a massive inferiority complex, and when they say some stupid wrong shit (often) and get called out for it all they can do is say dumb insults.
---
There's no way blizzard could find out about that, although as far as I'm aware it's still technically bannable but I think you'll be fine unless you message a GM specifically telling him you're doing this, and even then they probably wouldn't give a shit.
---
Now this is shitposting
---
Wait a few more hours you might get in
---
People don't listen to Alex because he spews doomsday scenarios on the daily and once or twice a year he's somewhat correct.
---
Yes, know you mean good. I just stated it is not your job. I don't think there is any contract between you and Blizz that you work for them to make sure people on spread 100% facts of the game.
---
The hype is real! It’ll be fun just playing 1-5. Lots of people wanting in to the stress test don’t even have that, so a privilege to be in the lucky few stress testers :)
---
Somebody just called me stupid for not taking old vanilla vids that don't show a thorough rundown of equipped gear and buffs as irrefutable proof mob damage is borked. Mind you I have been clear that I think all bug reports should be taken seriously because ya never know, and add far add I can tell did nothing to warrant name calling except not completely and blindly agreeing.
---
Have you double checked that your beta preferences are still set correctly? I heard some people saying their preferences changed when they installed the game or something.
---
As a heads up, people only expect the stress test servers to be up for something like 2 days, and they will still likely cap the max level at 5
---
Fun fact, FoH is contemplating forming a guild in classic. However Furor more than likely 99% isn't going to be playing (with us anyways). We're a bunch of casuals now but its vanilla and it isnt difficult lmao. We'll see!
---
You do realize that you have to have a BFA account + a sub to play classic right? That's not free and no I could care less about the beta or getting in. I'm simply stating that anyone who payed to get into the demo should get into the beta automatically. tbh a beta should not be pay to enter at all. So yes they should instantly get access for paying.
---
The stress test period is those 2 hours, but the servers are expected to remain up for 24-48 hours I believe
---
\- UPDATE - so it looks like Esfand or one of his mods deleted this clip in particular...
---
[https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyClearButterDatSheffy](https://clips.twitch.tv/SmoggyClearButterDatSheffy)
---
in which he admitted that the Lead Dev for Classic WoW PMed him to say, "No, you're completely wrong about Seal of Command not having a delay in Vanilla..."
---
which kinda helps prove the entire point of my writing this reddit post in the first place
---
Imo 30 hours a week is enough to experience end game raiding to its fullest. Just find a guild that suits you.
---
Has anybody else NOT got an email at all, but still have the Beta &amp; Stress test option? Seem's strange that I have not got an email but have been able to download the installation for about 6 hours now.
---
You're being ridiculous. /u/turdas is right, Blizzard is not going to compare each and every mob. If several mobs are working fine with imported damage values from the 1.12 database, the formulas are correct (unless they have crazy curves that need to be tested seperatedly). They're note going to test all the thousand different mobs hand by hand.
---
By now I'm 100% sure that people don't want to "test" the beta to 100% because it's a beta. They want to do it because they're disappointed. They see the classic beta being too easy but they want the game to be the hardcore difficult thing they "remember" from 15 years ago, so they hope and search for the bug that causes this game to be way easier than they remember. Otherwise their dreams are shattered.
---
Since I've already played this version of WoW my goal is to actually help build a great community and help the those who are playing for the first time enjoy it just as much as I did 14-15 years ago. Plus, I'm actually spending more time watching people play classic than I am playing the live version if that says anything.
---
Okay but the meme clearly states private servers
---
probably everything in the game lol. obviously that was a bit of sarcasm, but you’re 10 hours short of playing full time. if you’re good at the game that amount of time used efficiently is more than enough.
---
Feasible sure, but it will take years and a consistent guild.
---
Yeah ! Thanks for keeping it positiv. Fingers crossed !
---
Why does it matter what other people think? If their opinion bothers ylu just then just don't pay attention to it. Just like you would IRL to stuff you don't agree with.
---
I don't see the problem.
---
Open the game and look.
---
Limited item vendors. There is one im really hoping people have no idea about. One of the rarest items in game actually :p
---
Man I play the original age of wonders every 5-10 years and for some reason it's still fun. I do the same with an old game called faxanadu. Shit gets old... Till it gets so old it's fresh again. Probably helps I'm an idiot.
---
top of the top guilds can clear BWL in 30 min so theres that
---
Why are you here then?
---
Asmongold reacts videos are literally E V E R Y W H E R E, LOL
---
I've always been curious, is the whirlwind axe still better than the whirlwind mace if you're human with the +5 to Mace skill bonus? That's like 2% hit chance being traded for the axe's slower attack speed.
---
30 hours a week? Yeah you could do all that with that kind of investment. It isn't so much about how much total time you can put in as long as you can put in time during your guild's raid time. Find a guild that works with your schedule, bring consumables, and play to the top of your class and make an argument that you deserve a shit at Atiesh and I don't see a reason why you couldn't
---
Tunatornado
---
&gt; I just want dungeons to be challenging
---
I do too. The worst case scenario right now is that Blizzard's data is correct, and the dungeons really are as stupid-easy as they currently are in the beta.
---
You can give 10-15 to me.
---
&gt; You do realize that you have to have a BFA account + a sub to play classic right? That's not free 
---
That's why I said free* with an asterisk. If you're a current WoW player, or even a recent WoW player, then you likely already own BfA and have a subscription. It costs nothing *extra* to play Classic. They could easily have required you to own everything *and* pay $19.99 to download Classic *and* pay for an *extra* $4.99 monthly subscription or something. 
---
&gt; I'm simply stating that anyone who payed to get into the demo should get into the beta automatically. tbh a beta should not be pay to enter at all. So yes they should instantly get access for paying.

You're contradicting yourself? Beta shouldn't be pay-to-enter, and the people who paid should be allowed to enter? By not doing this, Blizzard is giving you what you want - a beta that is not pay-to-enter. You do have to have an active account, but it doesn't guarantee an invite at all so it shouldn't be considered pay to enter anyways

Seems everyone got a fucking stress test except me.
---
Could you beat tipsout in a duel though?
---
[Here you go.](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qkfexjgWuZhNko5Ht94Qxxni2r1OIhFFBIWDxbhC5Wg/mobilepresent?slide=id.g456bc58517_2_318) The whole presentation is great
---
On every major pserver in the last five years or so it's been about 45% horde 55% alliance.  I assume we will see similar numbers
---
Just saw it, and had to go to work. I made the post on my phone
---
[This is all I can think about](https://youtu.be/8oWAb5NVALw)
---
That's what i'm hoping at least. It does says "beta and stress test" so one could get the implication that you'd be able to join the beta. But i don't actually know and i'll cry when i wont be able to join the beta.
---
My dude being new just means you get that experience we won't get back. It won't ruin it, it'll make it better.
---
I had broadband by 2004, it was overkill for WoW at the time.
---
Hell yeah Bootyjiggle
---
Check GameStop's website. I snagged one a few days ago for $60 pre-order.
---
You're on a sub full of private server players...
---
I've done STV with 12k people on the same server. 
---
People who have done that are grizzled war veterans next to scrubs like you, hah
---
You think you do, but you don't. He was right about a lot of you
---
Best comment here. Wish I had him to give
---
However, the elites on the beta are even easier than on private servers (at least, those based on the Nostalrius core). So if you found it easier on private servers than you remember, get ready for it to be faceroll easy instead.
---
Can confirm mjp20 is correct, 2 hours is advertised as the primary stress test window. But I imagine the extended duration of this test is to see how the servers hold up to consistent high populations across the few areas level 5's can access.
---
I got something new in my launcher that says "Event: World of Warcraft" that loads up the bfa client and has a few of incompatible servers. Did you happen to get that? Maybe they gave us access to the wrong thing somehow?
---
Fairly sure they are very interested in how the starting zones react to launch day population stress and thier new layering system, and so capped levels accordingly maximize the number of players in layered zones.
---
"During the Summit that happened last week, Blizzard revealed more details about how they plan on reacting to the large influx of players during WoW Classic launch. Their plan consists of a new technology developed exclusively for Classic: Layering."

---
I think I do, and I do.
---
LET ME INNNNN
---
Good, I welcome same level world pvp!
---
This was my experience. I didn't heal in vanilla and took poorly to downranking on a pserver. Add long as I said I was new to vanilla healing people were super patient and helpful.
---
&gt; Mate it's being compared to old forum posts and videos.
---
Link 'em then that proves it wrong with *empirical* evidence that it's off, "mate".
---
Upvoted because you can’t tell me what to do OP
---
Grenades, Sappers, Trinkets like frost/shadow reflect.
---
You don't need mining. I'd say go herbalism/skinning while leveling. Drop skinning at 60 and pick up engineering.
---
Herb is the best money maker of the gathering professions at 60. By far.
---
Tailoring is viable if you are going for the Truefaith Vestments which is Bis healing chest pre T2.
---
Dkp is a proven system to use in raiding until you get to BWL or AQ to see ho deserves what . That’s what our pserver guild did. You have to motivate people to show up and dkp works to get ppl invested when they go to MC with a fair shot as long as they contribute . Allowing people to earn dkp for farming materials for the raid is as good as loot council for Mc to bwl but obviously you should loot council legendary mats but dkp imo keeps 40 ppl all invested with a fair system and we will see it a lot in classic . Guilds who do loot council are either bleeding edge hardcore or going to fall apart . No in between. There’s a reason Loot council became widely accepted when we went down to 25 mans , less drama .
---
But who do you guys hunk might have the upper hand win rate % wise ?
---
Now that horde is not “mature players only “ not alliance filled with 12 y olds
---
Bring back the screen shots forums.
---
Ya warrior is ridiculously good in vanilla. Arms is also one of the premier PvP premade specs. 
---
Three specs that are considered the best at what they do. One of them is so good it makes other tanking classes look unviable. Not be sure they can't do it, just because they look terrible by comparison.
---
Doesn't mean it isn't a good idea to keep testing.
---
how exactly will lowbies get through STV?
---
This is kinda silly. Just let more people into the actual beta. What are they afraid of? I've already got the client downloaded at this point. Just let me in. Please.
---
Please?
---
level 5 here i come baby!
---
Will do!
---
They're Twitch terms only used by people who weren't born yet when WoW launched.
---
You still have a 26 hour period in which to participate, I too am not able to join during the main period, but once I get off of work I can make a character to mess around with the other level 5 experts. :D
---
I saw this morning that I could play stress test.  About 2 hours after I received a blizzard email confirming the same.   Have not tried to look at beta though
---
Funny, I never got an e-mail. Just went to play retail (been playing alts since I resubbed for a chance at the beta) and there was the damn thing. Almost popped an aneurysm and all for a Goddamn offline stress test server. Sigh.
---
I loved treating heroics like a raid. When BC came out and we unlocked the heroic hellfire, we got our asses handed to us. I was shocked at it being an actual challenge. Personally, I loved it. The only thing I had close to that was Wildstar attunement runs. Shit was ridiculously hard but when you get that kill, it was as satisfying as a raid. And then their are raids. I definitely would like a similar experience without the mythic plus grind over n over.
---
I would agree that they are a hybrid. At least two rolls and both amazing. The dev team didn't considered them a hybrid for some reason so they paid no tax.
---
same happend to me. i got my invite 10pm eastern. still haven't gotten the option to download.
---
Can you share your secrets? :P
---
Or maybe just a pm. There is no chance we are on the same server anyway ;)
---
You can start in Northshire Abbey at level 1.
---
I adore both of your comments!
---
That's more than enough to fully enjoy the game my man.
---
You can travel there at level 1 and quest. You'll have access to mwge trainers so I don't see it being any kind of issue
---
They exist still. But iirc you have to sign up to the site first now.
---
You're always giving up on 5% crit by picking anything but the axe
---
Jesus imagine getting community managers back for the real experience. What is Tseric up to nowadays?
---
There aren't that many tanking spots in raids. You will more than likely be dpsing most of the time unless you go out of your way to tank. 
---
Being able to tank just makes getting groups easier in dungeons.
---
yep, against the rules to be a mom and share accounts with son/daughter.
---
Well you could do a bachelor's degree. In game you could easily clear every raid playing 15 hours a week.
---
https://youtu.be/Ipa3NyL4t_E
---
Made it not to long ago check it out !
---
It was always DM on my server, unless someone left and they specifically wanted a replacement for just VC.
---
Why do you want to sresstest so much? Do you have aburning passion to contribute to blizzards test of the server? Or do you just want to play, even if its a character that gets deleted after a while?
---
Thank you! Made the choice of going gnome that much easier for me!
---
Ikr I paid for a subscription specifically to have a chance for this beta and they are fucking me it seems literally everybody but me is getting in
---
You do realize that they're probably hundreds of thousand of people registered for beta, but even the stress test is not requiring even close to that number, right? People feel entitled for the beta because they subbed so long, or because they want the game more than others. But in fact, it's a beta, to test the game, and there're only limited slots available for a good reason. Blizzard doesn't need more testers, and after a certain amount, duplicate bug reports would probably do more harm than inviting more people.
---
Relax. I really want to get in too, but in the end we'll all join it in 3 months.

I'm 34 and still spend my of my free time playing video games and other dumb stuff. I don't feel all that different from when I was in my early 20's but at my part time job I'm the ancient relic who's been working the same job for 15 years.   
---
it was pretty weird for me to see old friends from high school all having kids and I still can't picture myself having any. 
---
time will just fly past you if you don't plan out your life early.
---
Unless im misunderstanding, u/stardestroyer277 is saying back in Vanilla, guilds might bring a few dead specs, and get away with it because it was easier. But IDK.
---
And while the Dwarfs and Gnomes are doing that, the Human bros can raid Hogger.
---
Ironically, I find that those who try to appear mature by judging others based on something as silly as the slang they use to look far more immature than the one using said slang.

Bm hunter. Can’t fail leveling,  good in PvP without skill

Thanks for the reply! Gunna hobble my ass right on over then the moment I load in!

Yeah cuz then that two years of fun would just be wasted right? Lol

Just got an email not long ago but it showed up in my launcher hours ago

You don't need a bfa account, you literally just need a subscription

He is a fallen paladin
---
I'm just saying the people who are actually mad that somebody doesn't think a video lacking important information is still gospel are definitely out there and they aren't just mad about this meme, they're the reason it exists lol
---
I have neither -__-
---
I wonder how much a jump in subscriptions they've had since announcing Classic.
---
Alliance is objectively the superior faction in most scenarios
---
AB horde has advantage that's about it
---
It will probably start off Horde until people realize Alliance is vastly better and just basic prep you can roll horde in zerg pvp assuming anywhere equal comps.
---
Paladins bopping mages and light of elune. Very disheartening to just get smoked all the time whenever you're in a large group hahaha. A bunch of mages running into you with blessing of protection up is very difficult to stop before they wipe most of ur raid
---
Certainly the PvP scene will be dominated by alliance when BG's are released and in Black Rock Mountain unless no one on the alliance knows what they're doing relative to you. Or is unwilling to prep/consume
---
SALT
---
Showed up in my launcher in the last 60 minutes I think. (From EU)
---
Have a reply!
---
Sounds fun
---
Lol....get your private server nonsense out of here
---
Literally seen him get dumpstered repeatedly lol the guy has zero iq
---
Except for that one time it doesn't work for 4 consecutive stuns and you start to lose faith in your green self.
---
He could've been bigger than SS, Tips, and Esfand no doubt but he chose another path. Seems like he's doing better in life now though so good for him
---
I think it would be a blast, I mean of we can't get past level 5 anyway... Why not do something unusual
---
It would be pretty illegitimate to change values based on skill and lag. Now if they upped MC by a little, and BWL by even less, to account for 1.12 changes, then that would be more legitimate and called for. I'd actually be happy if they did, but that doesn't seem like their current philosophy, which I get.
---
&gt; Guilds who do loot council are either bleeding edge hardcore or going to fall apart . No in between. There’s a reason Loot council became widely accepted when we went down to 25 mans , less drama . 
---
No in between? Lol. I've never joined a guild using Dkp and every loot council worked out (not on pservers, but until master loot was removed on retail). There's no drama, because there's a simple rule: behave or begone! Attendance was noted each raid in spreadsheet and kinda influenced the council decisions because these people also advanced the raid the most. It worked just fine.
---
no women on the internet
---
trying to get a good name for once lol
---
Just woke up to this.   
---
Account since 2010.   
---
Havent been subd for a year, untill classic date was announced.   
---
So i think its just random ppl getting the invites.

The same vocal minority that made Classic WoW seem like a good idea to Blizzard?
---
But, but they totally had plans to introduce Pandaria, since WoWs inception! It's not just an easter egg.
---
Search your email for Warcraft I got one a few hours ago (us). The beta stress realm will be open but the level cap is 5
---
Got it, US launcher
---
Is any rogue *not* a butthole?
---
Some men just want to watch the world burn.
---
And before he worked at right he was lead class balance design for World of Warcraft.
---
Australian here is download speeds of 700kbs and uploads of 0.54kbs
---
If its just PvE leveling a bit and no end game, I'd say it would be one of the easier ones to level. Druid would also be a good choice since it's just attacking in cat and shifting to heal. 
---
We're not taking away from the skill needed to play either of those classes in PvP later on tho.
---
AMEN BROTHER
---
Snipping Tool my man
---
I got the invite as well. Got excited to start beta, but realized quick that the servers were down because I was only invited to the stress test from 4-6
---
I  was part of this.
---
Outside of rank 14 you could do everything tbh.
---
restart your launcher then check
---
If Jeff wanted to be in charge of Classic, he would've been. He's made Blizz billions with Overwatch and before that was insanely successful with WoW. Not to mention Blizz employees were friends with him through Everquest before he even joined the company. 
---
&gt; Then it would be Classic and not a modern engine with a Vanilla skin causing nothing but issues.
---
Says who? And what issues are you even talking about? Not a single person at Blizzard would be okay with using the 1.12 client considering the exploits, bugs, and extreme inefficiencies that are bound to exist in the back-end of code that old.
---
Praise GabeN
---
Yes it is. You access the beta.
---
Imagine trying to get online on August 27 and the servers are shitting themselves. This is to pinpoint and eliminate those issues.
---
I think you will agree that's more important than any other possible bug or you just wanting to run around Barrens *right now.*
---
yes it is. will it happen? no.

Don't forget about the tram and to get the IF/SW flight points :)

Well deserved :)

The class knowledge shows who has pvp'd the most, the mechanic knowledge difference is such a massive swing in sodas favour.
---
dude there are instant 60 private servers
---
if you're convinced you love the game, you know what to do 
---
It's not level to 5 so they can layer the servers
---
Looks like I was definitley left out. Have fun man.
---
No dice, thanks anyway though, and have fun!
---
Exact same time I got my email. My launcher let me download already.
---
Yeah and it's capped at level 5. Wtf are you gonna do at level 5?
---
In that case, wouldn't it make more sense that you could play the beta as we speak, since the stress test has not started yet?

---
full disclosure here as there's a history between esfand and myself going back quite some time as i used to be one of his biggest supporters and boosters - I was active in his discord and did my best to promote him whenever I could
---
but shortly after he got banned from streaming, his attitude changed quite dramatically and he basically started shitting on anything to do with private servers, even though private servers were quite literally the only reason he had a following in the first place.
---
and as time went on, his attitude to anything other than AP SOC RET was considered anathema to him - for example whenever I brought up in his theory crafting discord channel either Nightfall Ret or Spell Dmg Ret (this is now referred to as Spelladin), he would quite literally shit all over it
---
it got to the point that I literally said, "OK I'm out guys, I'm done here but if you want to come and join a real theory crafting channel, come to Taladril's 'Classic Theorycrafting' discord"
---
Ironically enough guess who ended up coming over...but do you think he added anything to the discussion there?
---
I'll end the suspense, the answer is a big fat nope lol.
---
Anywho, more time went on and he ended up writing a bug report that I noticed and looked into further - TLDR - he wrote that the PvP Berzerker buff should not be removed when a Paladin casts Divine Shield.
---
I was intrigued enough to investigate it further to see if maybe there was merit to it. Unfortunately, my research showed that the mechanics he was saying were Blizzlike only came into effect once the TBC pre patch launched.
---
ie: throughout Vanilla it was Blizzlike that Zerker buff gets removed when a Paladin casts Bubble and I even showed him multiple clips of video evidence including a TBC pre patch video which shows that it only remained from then forward.
---
I asked him to close down the bug report as it was a false report. He ended up doing the exact opposite and rather than close down the report, he kept pestering the devs to push through the false bug fix - even going so far as to use the video that I sent him from TBC pre patch as part of his evidence and claiming that it proved Zerker remained with Bubble up.
---
To my dismay, the devs ended up approving his bug report and pushed through this "fix" to the live server sometime later. Once I saw the patch notes for that week and the "fix" had gone live, I was quite disgusted because I saw that instead of closing the report he kept pushing it forward with the devs being none the wiser. So I went public on the LH forums and said that the bug report was garbage and that it should be reverted ASAP.
---
It's here for all to see - TLDR I used to respect the guy but he's nothing but a snake.

I don’t think the time you’ve been playing wow matters. I played for the first time with the launch of BFA and quit after a month and I got an invite.

You just clearly aren’t in a relationship/ live with your SO. It just doesn’t work like that my dude.
---
challenge accepted
---
It's on.
---
Got access to beta, no email just showed up In the launcher (pre-stress test). No friend or family, not an influencer. I stopped playing late wrath until BfA prepatch.
---
Wow, were 5% closer to release, than when it was 100 days away. 
---
Kill me, please.
---
Someone who's actually beta testing
---
Loot council is great.
---
I just don't think it's great for motivating 40 individuals at progressing together .
---
Obviously main tank will get the best tank pieces but dkp in my experience allowed for the guy who WANTED to be the main tank -- to have the most points to grab what he wanted. Same for healers. DKP is a good metric for vailla because of the amount of prep.
---
loot council works much better in later iterations of WoW because of the lesser ephasis on guild planning overall.
---
Negative. They want everyone to log in in those two hours for the real stress test but the stress test server will be open for like 2 days.
---
It's Okay OP. I got an invite, but I don't get off work until 5 PST and have an hour commute. If Blizz wants as many people to join as possible, they sure did pick a crappy time for us west coast people.
---
Pandaren were in the Warcraft series you bot
---
nope. the download you get isn't even the full client.
---
I have a fiance my dude. Yeah sometimes i have to give and take of course. Have a step son as well. But most times i have 2-4 hours of free time at night and we both do whatever we both want. Once again within reason. Obvious exceptions and there is a give and take to make shure both of us stay happy.
---
I got excited too when I saw it in my launcher. then I saw the time and only two hour window...Which is around the time I get off work. LAME. Blizz why couldn't you do it around 6pm in the evening?!
---
They scheduled 3 stress tests I think. So always a chance to get in next time. They'll probably add more people to it each time to further stress test I'd assume.
---
Lame. Its better than nothing. Im not trying to burn myself out but i would like to get one of each class to 15/20 so i can solidify what i want to play lol.
---
Just got mine 15 minutes ago (oce) so could be region based?
---
No youre just an idiot
---
Well it was the sixties...it's possible a man slipped in. There would be no way of knowing.
---
&gt; 1 nerf to 1 mechanic in 1.5 = "way less damage and way less health in 1.12"
---
assuming people actually get to level in the stress test.
---
They're not gonna purposely slow everything down just to make it similar to Vanilla. This kind of dumb "NoChAnGe" attitude is what I think will kill Classic honestly. Some changes are acceptable and required. Deal with it and stop whining. I can't deal with people like thi/s.
---
Back then half the raid consisted of braindead window lickers with 10-15 decent people carrying them.
---
The only difficulty is having 40 people consistently showing up for raid with the minimal amount of consumables (resistance pots) and you'll eventually clear all content.
---
Sorry mate, but it really is not that bad. There will be plenty of streams, content.
---
Within a 2 hour window? I'm not sure you'd be able to do it on the first stress test. Maybe if the stress test realm characters carry over to the second stress test time.
---

This has been discussed to death already, Private Servers had damage too high. The damage on the beta matches their in house 1.12.1 client.
---
Don’t think this is very true, but you got the basic idea.
---
Pog is just PogChamp shortened into a (separate) BTTV emote. Represents a feeling of excitement or hype. Got your first epic? Pog !
---
Kapp (Kappa) is used in a sarcastic context or as a non-believing expression when someone is lying. “I was rank 14 once.” “Sure Kapp” or “Yeah, we totally want to watch you spam battlegrounds for 3 months Kapp”
---
Seriously doubt it.
---
People will just coordinate the quest turn ins.
---
Dope!
---
Possibly, I'll keep checking and report back if anything changes.
---
Thanks yall.
---
Why did he get banned for streaming? It sounds like the reason for ban affected a lot of his mentality if after that all went to hell.
---
I can actually feel your excitement xD
---
Here we go again..
---
The email was VERY delayed for me. I had the option to download and install the stress test for a few hours before I even got the email.
---
https://i.imgur.com/zkqB4pg.gif
---
The mob is grey :|
---
the stress test window is 2 hours, but the servers will be online for another day.
---
Not interested in an instant lvl 60 server I want to level up on the official server.
---
It's always been DM on EU English realms, I think the first time I ever saw it called VC was when cross region play came in an it was someone from a German server. 
---
VC is the more common abbreviation on the pservers I've played though.
---
We are already playing in my head!
---
the email is super delayed, i just got my email whilst ive had the beta &amp; stress test option for hours.
---
Thats not entirely true. While they are not really viable doesnt mean they did not exist nor that they will not exist
---
Besides, they will still role on that for PvP
---
I’m from Australia and I’m the same only got my email 1/2 hr ago but had it in my launcher hrs ago
---
Turtles in WoW absolutely makes sense, a tiger with armor though not so much.
---
Same:(
---
Have a great day!
---
Checked few hours ago and I had it. EU, acc created in 2016 and subbed for total of few months.
---
The email is just very delayed
---
Healing without Holy Power in PvE is...a very bad choice. That talent is too good to pass up. Speccing into Imp BoW without Benediction is pretty anti-synergistic. What exactly are you going to use triple Imp HoJ for? Not having BoK as the BoSanc pally in your guild forces someone else to spec into Prot far enough to get it. Your weird obsession with Reckoning is holding back a lot here, and it seems like you're asking to go OOM while doing a subpar job tanking 5 mans or healing raids. My recommendation to you would be to try to find a guild who wants you as the BoSanc paladin. Raid in the 30/21/0 BoSanc spec while in progression, but ask ahead of time if once you have content on farm, they would be willing to let you raid in a Holy/Reckoning spec and check out the guides to the 25/26/0 Holy/Reckoning build. That one has some of the same problems as your build, but it's more consistent overall.
---
idk but I cringe at this post.
---
just got my invitation about 3 hours ago according to the email! here’s to hoping you get in aswell, friend :)
---
So true and so brutal!
---
Considering this Gnome is level 39, shouldn't we expect him to take significantly less damage than Asmon? He also has pretty good gear for his level.
---
I highly doubt beta waves go out on Wednesday, at earliest Thursday. We can only hope that stress test invited players have a higher priority on the next waves. IF there even are any waves to come.
---
And that's why you join a guild without rolls.
---
Have a current account from 2005 and an active sub. No invite for the stress test or beta.
---
I never said anything about normal mobs, of course those are expected to be wrong.
---
Stress test but it’s better than nothing enjoy
---
That will not change anything
---
And me
---
Oh I am HERE for this!!
---
Should just do it at lvl 1, since lvl 5 is pretty purposeless.
---
I wish they were doing beta keys instead. I got stress test access and have to work tomorrow during the test. I would love to give the chance to someone who can actually help out.
---
That's a pretty bad comparison.
---
Available in my launcher now, but no email...yet. \[EU\]
---
Remember folks, the point of this is to see if what they habe taped together can handle all the people who are so desperate to get in. It wouldn't suprise me if beta invites for much more came a few days after the stress test once they've analysed the data.
---
Except it does...
---
Guild doesn't allow Enhancement Shamans in raid.
---
Guild doesn't allow Resto Shamans to roll on Enhancement gear "for PVP".
---
= Shaman doesn't get raid gear for his PVP Enhancement conquests.
---
I'm planning on NA PvP and don't like loot councils, and at this point I'm starting to consider starting a guild myself if I can find enough people who fit my schedule. Every guild seems to plan on Tuesday-Thursday raid nights for some reason, and my work only leaves me free Friday-Sunday evenings. 
---
Even if you're lucky enough for *nobody* to be corrupt enough to abuse it, loot council seems like it would cause a ton of drama most of the time. I'd probably prefer a zero-sum DKP system, with a weekly decay rate to encourage people to not ignore potential upgrades to hoard points for something big. Plus, I'm not all that interested in getting server-first anything, I just want to get some people together to collect raid epics.
---
Goin down the only road I’ve ever knowwnnnn
---
Finally someone using actual math and factoring in some of the variables instead of "that number is bigger than this number".
---
Good work.
---
Why would a Worgen/goblin be a vet? they only played since 2010!
---
I got a stress test invite. It's better than nothing, I just hope it doesn't make me ineligible to get a real beta invite in the future.
---
This is me right now.
---
There’s always next summer lol
---
No way!
---
/r/mapwithoutnz
---
I hope it actually gets used for LFG in vanilla. Using trade chat for everything is just bad.
---
If I opened a convo like that and proceeded to spout some shit about WoW I'd be concerned for my safety too.
---
My account is from '08, and I got an invite to the stress test. Stress testers only get to play for a day to level 5, though. If you don't get this, maybe it's just waiting to give you the good actual beta invite ;). Good luck friend, can't wait to see you in Azeroth! May the winds be at your back.
---
I think people are a little too hard on leveling warrior, it's not that bad, you just pull carefully and pop die by the sword (I think it's called?) if you screw up.
---
Don't screw up more than once every 30 minutes. But seriously, it's not really hard, it's just kinda boring, you mostly auto...
---
They want people in that 2 hour window for stress testing, but the realm will remain open for 22 hours after that.
---
/r/MapsWithoutNZ/
---
Hope there's at least on streamer free PvP server
---
Well to be fair you could do that yourself in the client
---
Blasted lands in Northerend! :o
---
Just because there are no roles does not mean they wont allow not going for pvp gear.
---
I was on the best guilds of my server, and I always used my DKP for PvP gear. And noone bat an eye (not a single guild did and I did tht until end of MoP).
---
Also your first point has nothing to do with "there not being rolls"
---
Not always. Project Ascension has there own launcher so you wouldn’t know which one it’s off of.
---
Congrats to the kid!
---
I'm guessing there's probably an automatic system that flags accounts with major changes such as an IP's attached ISP and geolocation data (especially in succession where it couldn't be explained by say, a vacation) that are then looked through manually, either as routine, or when the account is otherwise brought to attention, with the data being logged to be looked at retroactively if needed. Probably there's lots of other information recorded such as changes in MAC address to build metadata, and if your account was being investigated, they would probably look at less useful information like chat logs too (does whoever logged in *act* like someone else?).
---
So to OP, assuming you're not telling everyone about account sharing and getting reported, the risk would probably be in whether you set off any of Blizzard's systems or not and if your login behaviour would look suspicious. Seeing what your friend's class plays like for a half hour isn't really what account sharing rules were meant to stop, and may be cool, but is still technically against the rules. Contrast the reward (which is not that high) with the risk of losing your account and ask yourself if it's worth it. I wouldn't do it unless your friend is your roommate.
---
I also want to know, just got the stress test invite
---
The night king at it again
---
Who said anything about DKP?
---
[Loot lists for the win](http://onslaught-wow.com/about/).
---
Rogue asking why he would use vanish to break roots...getting chain rooted and nuked to death.  Honestly surprised first match was as close as it was.
---
&gt; do you see the point now? some specs are good in raids and shit at other things.
---
No, thats the whole thing we are arguing about. I'm saying there isn't really anything that several of the specs do well and you're equating that to asking for all specs to be equally good at everything.
---
Who said anything about Loot lists? DKP for the win.
---
These were all in the game before BC release: Feast of Winter Veil, Noblegarden, Children's Week, Darkmoon Faire, Harvest Festival, Hallow's End, Lunar Festival, Love is in the Air, Midsummer Fire Festival, Peon Day, New Year.	
---
It's going to be so fun experiencing these in Classic again!
---
The server is open for 24 hours, they just want people in that 2 hour window for stress testing.
---
From the Arms tree? I was planning to go Fury in the long run, I hadn't thought about whether Arms would be better early on before respeccing later.
---
It is an invite to only the stress test. Hopefully it will translate to a beta invite soon.
---
You will only have access to the stress test, for the 24 hour period.
---
No full beta access.
---
It is, without any doubt, solely an invitation to the 26 hour duration of stress test. The maximum level is 5. If you want a breadcrumb of hope, I imagine those invited to the stress test could \*possibly\* have a higher prioritization than others to get into the max level 30 beta. :) keep positive.
---
Not every Single guild. And i wouldnt call it meme.
---
I’m the min maxer type that likes to be the best I can be. Knowing an uneven playing field lies ahead of me is enough to ruin my enjoyment from the get go.
---
Wait, what?
---
600p! Yarr we never used to refer to resolutions like that, not classic like at all! 800x600 baby!
---
Separate (unfortunately).
---
feeldbadman
---
You're an angel, thank you so much for the solid answer :) I'm just hyped for the chance to play, even if it's only for a short time and for such a small level bracket!
---
It still saves a ton of cloth farming time.
---
Deadlines has never been particularly hard.
---
Private servers are way harder as said by Staysafe and Monkeynews themselves, so you are right. The Classic is the easy mode version.
---
I understand you want to think private server people had it easier, because you dont want to feel you have a disadvantage, but unfortunately they didnt :/
---
How will we now if we've gotten the Beta after the stress test? The most solid way to find out was to look for the beta in the launcher. Since it is already there now, will we need to open the game and look at the server list?
---
Makes sense. They really need it to succeed w/ their other games struggling badly
---
Must... resist... correcting... the... troll... :)
---
Everyone in Onslaught has one goal: maximum individual performance to have the fastest possible raid clears. Their tank isn't even prot specced for the extra damage and threat. Anyone that thinks an item should go to a shaman for PVP before going to any other class for PVE, doesn't belong in Onslaught. They already have 100+ members committed to getting a week one Rag kill.
---
They’re monitoring the servers closely for 2 hours, but leaving the stress test server up for a full day.
---
The stress test starts on 23.5. 1AM CEST, and ends at 3AM, however they said they will keep the realm up for about 24h so we can play around for a bit.
---
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
---
Upvoted, because you think you do but you don't
---
Posted by /u/nvmvoidrays
---
&gt;no, the damage is accurate.  
---
&gt;[https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw?t=224](https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw?t=224)  
---
&gt;this is Asmongold's video of the elites hitting him for about 30 damage per swing. that doesn't mean much, until we get to a real video.  
---
&gt;[https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=75](https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=75)  
---
&gt;this is a random Warrior in SFK. he's getting hit for less then Asmongold is due to Stoneskin Totem, which, reduces damage taken by 11 according to the classic database, which would account for the difference in damage as well as Mark of the Wild.  
---
&gt;[https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw?t=1960](https://youtu.be/rQI3mMqUgGw?t=1960)  
---
&gt;this is Asmongold's video for Fenrus. he's getting hit from anywhere between 60-80 which seems about right.  
---
&gt;[https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=205](https://youtu.be/W1FuMa3OyiM?t=205)  
---
&gt;here's the same Warrior getting hit for about 60 damage, again, with MoTW/Stoneskin.  
---
&gt;there'a also footage for everything to compare, but the second boss and the ghost mini-boss. i'm just too lazy to compare every inch of footage. Wolf Master Nandos was hitting Asmongold for an average of 70-80 and critting for almost 200; dogs were smacking him for 25-30. there's brief footage of the other Warrior getting hit for around high-60s and again, accounting for Stoneskin/MoTW, the damage seems accurate.  
---
&gt;so, it seems like the damage is pretty much correct. let's face it: the dungeons weren't that hard. we were just fucking terrible.
---
googled
---
talk about selfish bunch of kents
---
It's still the best water in the game. If it's a friend/guildie, I'd do it for free. For random people, I'll personally ask for 1g for 80 level 55 water (cheaper and better than the same amount of level 45 water). 
---
Sure, it disappears on logout, but if they'll be on for several hours, it's worth the investment and 1 gold won't be breaking any banks. 
---
If they find it unreasonable, they're free to find a different mage.
---
you don't understand the purpose of beta so you should probably shut up :)
---
Rip, thank you for the source :)
---
You laugh, but their MC clears take 17.5 minutes and they were the first guild to ever kill Vael in under 45 seconds (now getting it down to 16 seconds).
---
They were doing the same in Bfa beta.
---
Both are probably workable options but I assume we'll get an email too
---
Not saying it's ideal
---
But you'll learn a lot more about the game there than you will in the beta
---
HAHAHAHAHA
---
Vanilla is going to be the end of retail....
---
That looks fucking epic.
---
I tanked Scholo regularly on my rogue.
---
NOCHANGES
---
The artstyle is on point
---
I would think the requirements are pretty far above actual vanilla, since the client is a fork of 7.3.5. probably not very demanding in the grand scheme of things (all the effects of legion are gone, etc), but it's probably going to run like crap on a potato.
---
Gz dude. Trying to get my girlfriend who I recently moved in together with to start playing as well. She never really played games before. Wish me luck!
---
DM. Shift-click the guys name like you literally always do when looking for potential groups, and their lvl makes it obvious whether theyre talking Deadmines or Dire Maul. Duh.
---
As others said, basically everything. The only people spending more time than that are likely guild masters/officers, people playing alts, or farming to make more gold than they actually need.
---
The one caution I'd say is Atiesh. Wanted by many, takes a long time to farm enough shards for one. If your RL or officers can legit use it, likely one of them will get it for the effort they put into the guild. At 30 hrs a week, that isn't likely to be you. But each guild is unique.
---
My guild never went into Naxx and I didn't pserver raid, so I don't have firsthand exp. Just saying I'd be cautious about that expectation. I'm rolling priest, and not going to count on that opportunity. If you want the closest thing to a guarantee, run your own guild or be second in command to a GL who is playing a class that cannot use it. Oh, and then be a good enough guild to put Naxx on farm. Easier said then done.
---
haha that's funny i actually consider bonescythe to be the nicest looking armor in the game

---
What dude? 30 hours per week is a huge time investment, I imagine all except the higher ends of pvp ranks will be available to a 30 hour week player :O
---
Most of the times they are artificially overtuned on purpose otherwise it would be a steamroll...
---
Lvl cap is 5...
---
Can only level to 5
---
You can’t tell me what to do, Upvoted
---
Lvl 5 cap on stress test servers so...
---
the stress test is for only 2 Hours. 
---
unfortunately for me here in NZ it's between 11am-1pm and some of us have jobs :(
---
It looks like a Llama xD
---
Im still just hoping we see something about combat text
---
yeah i thought the same
---
That *is* a strawman: there is no video evidence of normal mobs or elites nobody gives a shit about. Still, if you care, those values can be reasonable accurate, like 30% difference, not 5x or something like that.
---
But those are really irrelevant. Only raid bosses matter and the evidence is for raid bosses.
---
As a vanilla player I started on one of these servers a week ago and it is fucking great

# "I was WRONG about CLASSIC! Here's Why"
---
If blizz jebaits us I'm going to be mildly annoyed then move on with my life
---
Probably because you keep changing your argument slightly with every response. If we aren't allowed to talk about a future roadmap to adding content now, when are we? When the numbers tank? When people get bored? When blizz considers shutting down servers?
---
There is literally zero harm in discussing potential courses of action blizzard could take. In fact I'd argue that by not saying anything, by just sitting quietly like you want, we risk something that hurts the game. 
---
TL;DR: Don't shoot people down because the simple idea of Blizzard doing something to classic pisses you off.
---
&gt;  That’s still a world away from deliberately changing end game spec balance though
---
So some changes are okay, but not anything in regards to balance?
---
Balance changed multiple times during Vanilla as well. I'd argue that for classic to be a true vanilla experience (like most people on this subreddit seems to argue), balance should change at some point as well.
---
Do enjoy peoples use of the word 'fact' these days.
---
That would be my reaction though. Idk how to screen capture. I don't have any of that fancy software because I'm not a streamer. Either way, this is more reliable because this way I KNOW it worked. I know in some games you can screen capture using the Windows 10 Xbox whatever thing but I wouldn't have risked it.
---
The same way. It’s a completely different client or whatever if you read it all lol
---
They are doing a great job on the beta. They get a lot of hype pump from the streamers and the real beta testers snipe stuff from the stream to report bugs. The point of the stress test is to see how many players can they put into a zone before it starts fucking up. They don’t care that half the people thought that a STRESS TEST was going to be an opportunity to level up. I recommend to pick up some other game or something to tide you over for the next few months.
---
&gt;	due to how complicated modern wow has gotten over the years, the average player is much, much more skilled than in the past.
---
Can we dispel this once and for all? Most players now are garbage and the only reason they don’t die is because it’s easily to passively sustain through standing in the fire in LFG. Most people aren’t doing mythic +9000 and regular difficulties are way more forgiving than anything in vanilla
---
stress test lasts 2 hrs but the servers are remaining up for a day
---
Disgusting
---
What about strat orbs runs with your main?
---
No idea how good it is for gold, tho, but as i see a lot of these runs in world chat...
---
Oh, thats a bug on blizzard side then if it suggest you would have beta.
---
Just got mine an hour ago. It was in the promotions part of my gmail.
---
They wont. Doing those kind of interactions is not considered proper for a live product. OP actually left off the 3rd message sent by the GM  where they mention that it Never gets old to say that.
---
Beta gives you WAYY more leeway to have that fun. I hope enough of you get in as the end of the beta is going to quite a party.
---
I have 3 planned out as well. 2 classes I've never played. Shaman alch/herb, warlock tailor/skin, druid ench/leather. I don't plan on raiding. I'm excited for class quests.
---
That's honestly what I miss most about classic. The pure DPS classes were strait glass cannons for the most part. You had to avoid damage and try to out play people.
---
This made me laugh. Sounds silly and fun!!
---
I didn't get invited :)
---
Lets say you are a warrior and want that 2-h axe from herod. So going with your suggetion, no hunters, no other warriors, no shamans/paladin. If you want a resser, you need exactly a priest.
---
Being picky usually means much longer time to gather a group. If you ever get it going.
---
Gyazo... what year is this?
---
Welcome to the stress test!
---
No, it was part of their example of things people thought was a bug, but was just how it was in vanilla. I vividly remember that being a thing, and was a little surprised people thought it was a bug. That’s why I’m saying private servers adds to the confusion, as people that play on them say it’s unofficial vanilla when it’s really not, just vanilla like
---
Now that's the spirit we're longing for.
---
The wording was weird on the email but it appears you're correct.
---
Were you still subbed when you received the invite?
---
Yea, I would assume so as well. However, I have not gotten an email regarding my stress test invite which I have had for a couple of hours in my launcher now. So I do hope that I am not "opted-out" for Blizz mail. :-)
---
Both are area based auras giving stats. One around paladin, other around the totem. So its going to be closer than gold veins and goldthorns... unless the bug between those is based because both are gather profession items. Not because they have same name.
---
Nah man you get 24 hours it's just the actual stress test portion they are monitoring is a 2-hour period.
---
I really don't want to wait until November 11th to play.
---
Nay, we tried that already.
---
Cross-faction collusion (communication outside the game) is a ToS violation
---
Basically it was an error and you either might get access tomorrow or they might have to apologize for the accidental invites. They made a post about it, will have to wait and see.
---
no, he was saying the exact opposite. pservers were more difficult than he remembered it to be.
---
Explain to me why it's a joke.
---
Exactly, the title of this post is so blatantly creating a straw man. Don’t know why so many people here have to have such an “us vs. them” mentality with private server players. Just annoying.
---
see you tomorrow in the mosh pit
---
Are you sure? I read that they changed the name in the launcher from "Beta" to "Beta &amp; Stress" for everyone that had already recieved a beta invite, and that the only real difference was that beta servers would not show up in the realm list for the people that had only gotten a stress test invite.
---
ahh damn was really hoping to play, thanks for the response!
---
They saw blurry CCTV footage of the eye witness and now know exactly what he saw back then.
---
In a nutshell yes. But, I feel like pally and shaman are decent tanks as well and if you build and gear a druid properly it probably wont be too bad if you sit in bear form either. It really depends how "hardcore" you want to get with the min/maxing. Anything can work as long as you find a group that's willing to work with you in their raid and what not.
---
All in all, really the best advice I can give is play what you want and you'll clear the content sooner or later. Just depends how quick you want to go through it is all. The "meta" classes will make it a lot easier to get into groups and raids, but all content can be cleared with any classes.
---
I think there's no BL in AV.
---
??? Who doesn't play a game because of something like this? Also if he is a troll NOTHING will hide the hunchbacked figure.
---
I dont see what the point of getting excited over the stress test is anyway, you can only level up to 5.
---
My email took quite a few hours to reach my inbox, seems like a lot of people here are having the same issue haha
---
I am so hyped for the stress test “minmax” antics and world lv 5 pvp!
---
It's almost as if I put the ":p" on the end for a reason right?
---
According to you, one could hold the same perception about sports since its just games, but people Kill for that shit
---
Bad part about being notified about it through e-mail now is that in most cases it was like a week late after they got granted access. Unless they fix the time gap between being flagged for access and sending out the e-mail to notify you, it's going to end up being a shit storm lol.
---
Yup. And I will hatefully love doing it.
---
It doesn't quite mean what this guy thinks.
---
If you watch speedrunning and such, there may be a skip, a shortcut, or just something very hard to pull off. "Frame perfect" means you have a window of a single frame (fps frame) to pull it off.
---
Nobody could play anything "frame perfect" in wow because... it makes no sense. Even if we ignore everything else, the inherent latency of an online game makes it moot...
---
Yeah I really hope that this invite e-mails weren't an accident, but in all honesty, it's starting to look like it in my case at least. Got the e-mail about 4 hours ago so hope is dwindling lol.
---
My private server closes end of july so no keeping it either (i think)
---
It's only going to last 2 hours no? With the amount of people packed in the starting zones I doubt we even make it to 5.
---
This doesn't really mean that all elite mobs damage values are correct though, dunno why Blizzard is making that argument with only one specific elite mob as evidence.
---
Could be a certain type of elite mobs is bugged but not others, you know? They should do more testing just in case.
---
They deserve to not be trusted.
---
RIP quick mafs
---
As far as I'm aware, druids can't use items or consumables while shapeshifted.
---
TBC and Wrath changed values too. It's just not possible to remember if something was in 1.12 exactly.
---
I mean no Ill will to developers and I commend them for getting vanilla servers to the point they’re at now but I’ve been in the scene for 8ish years and people are still arguing about the same shit they always have. 
---
The devs can only gain so much insight from watching videos and looking at old discussions, to say anything else is untrue. They cannot ever be sure they have it right until classic is released and they have actual data to compare it to, otherwise they’re shooting in the dark with a match for light. 
---
Stock mangos is a buggy mess since no one wants to commit their core and help the community. It’s very easy to tell a stock core from one actually developed. 
---
As I stated above the nosty core was running tbc quest values well after they shut down and every server has different tuning for dungeons and raids with nobody being able to actually agree and prove what’s right. 
---
They simply do not know how close they are because it was impossible to prove, everything was based off little info until now.
---
I say they ship us free cakes. Sounds like a dope free DLC to add on after naxx
---
After all this time, with nearly everyone advocating for nochanges, you think it'd be a good idea to vaguely rebalance the entire raid experience based on unclear factors?
---
Those are bugs in beta, not a compilation of things private servers have gotten right.

But do you remember if it was 1.4, 1.9, 1.12, TBC, or Wrath?
---
implying I reach naxx lmao
---
Savory Deviate Delight (pirate, ninja) does not work in feral forms. Noggenfogger Elixir small/skeleton forms do per 1.12 patch
---
I got the email aswell i was hell excited then noticed its during my work hours feelsbadman but its good to see they are doing proper stress testing i hope they get alot out of it so on launch we all have a smooth entry thats well oiled
---
Perhaps they can see who actually went on the stress test server and will give those accounts prioritized access.
---
Have fun NA, im 99% sure EU wont Get invites
---
Didnt the bluepost say 4-6pdt, that should be like 22.00 GMT, or 21-22 cet. Dont take my hunch for good will tho.
---
I tested and played many mmos. None of which are comparable to wow. I disliked retail in recent years and stopped playing mmorpgs all together. Now im pretty hyped but skeptical.
---
oh yeah that's definitely true but I am not in a rush to learn the game I'll just slowly learn as I explore and level up when the time comes
---
oh ok so i guess we will have to wait to see if noggen works. hopefully as im going druid this time around
---
well it's against the Digital Millennium Copyright Act to stream private vanilla servers on Twitch or YouTube and since they are both based in the US, they would be subject to penalties themselves under the DMCA - so long story short he got a strike against his accounts for streaming pirated software servers.
---
If you get 3 strikes on YouTube, they perma ban you and the only way to remove said strikes from your account is to not stream anymore pirated software games for a period of time before YT removes the strikes.
---
TLDR - he had to play nice with YouTube and Twitch, promise not to stream private servers anymore and then basically went full rtard and started shitting on private servers as his new Standard Operating Procedure from that point forward as he, TipsOut and Staysafe started ClassicCast.
---
i closd client for 5 mins and it came up, after about 3 hours after inv, i dont have full game instal
---
Unless you're into BDSM or just enjoy seeing the word "miss" on your screen, you should be leveling as arms.
---
this is pretty well drawn tbh
---
My brain goes AFK fairly  often, I will use such addons, for my own good.
---
I don't have the option to install either.
---
Did you happen to have a new thing show up that says "Event: World of Warcraft"? I thought it might be the stress test but it loads of the bfa client and shows 5 incompatible servers.
---
Wtf is that thing closest to screen, is that the new tauren models?
---
Me tooooo. I was so hyped when I noticed it on battle.net I didn’t check my email until I had already installed. I start work at the same time stress test starts too, to add salt to the wound.
---
There was low chance to get RNG which wouldn't spawn a bugged tentacle. If you got bugged tentacle then you need to wipe and try again. So you wouldn't faceroll it unless you got lucky.
---
I mean, I'm not disagreeing with the generla sentiment of the population right now, but things like the stoneclaw totem bug would not have been found without people cross referencing stuff and attempting to fact-check. All I care about is authenticity, difficulty means nothing in the face of having fun. That said, stuff like permanent invisible totem buffs reducing damage isn't fun, and the idea that other things like this might be present is worth investigating. It is worth Blizzard's time, because again, that is the point of a beta.
---
I'm top dog
---
cringe
---
I created a second account and upvoted
---
Highmountain Tauren lol
---
It seems that they're prioritizing older accounts but you still need a healthy mix of both.
---
Are you ignoring every other patch?
---
16 debuffs as oppossed to 8 is a monumental nerf to health retard
---
I think you'll have an absolute blast, as will I! Imagine the shenanigranny that will occur in goldshire hehe. I intend on rolling horde in classic but holy crap the goldshire appeal of the 50+ people that will be there will be hilarious. The horde equivalent is brill but who wants to go there? Teheeee :)
---
Almost as if the Warcraft universe has been around longer than WoW.
---
Could always just gear out with melee weapons irl and go to blizzard hq. Beta the shit outa whoever thought late August was a good idea.
---
I believe it's the only landmass that makes sense not to have on maps. It's supposed to be shrouded in mist.
---
Would have been late vanilla, a lot of my friends joined either during AQ gate or slightly after and we had a twinking phase to get them hyped for 60 pvp.
---
So 1.9 give or take a patch all the way to 1.12 and you're talking 3/4 people on vent using BoE blues at 17-19 vs you + 4 randoms.
---
Was Azeroth a continent?
---
I appreciate the effort put into your post, but I vaguely remember the mana efficiency rankings as: pala &gt; priest &gt; druid &gt; shaman.
---
It wouldn't really make sense to innervate priests over themselves if the mana was less useful on them - or am I missing something?
---
But there is content comming after Naxx update that will raise the level cap
---
&gt; Rhak'zor from DM

&gt;DM
---
You mean VC, right? ;)
---
Me too, I hate people telling me what to do
---
The guildmaster of my raiding guild was a game master.  I used to have a few suspicions and this one time I was joking around in guildchat about how she might be a gamemaster and she suddenly got very hostile on whispers and threathened to kick me and stuff. Apparently it's not okay to share this news.
---
I guess the cat was out of the bag for me at that point though. She was very nice though and helped me get some gametime when I was a poor teenager and actually got me beta access to WOTLK aswell.
---
It was really fun back then.
---
Thank you.
---
Would love to do in 4k but the background pictures I used are only 2400x900. It will look streched and beacuse of the resolution on the framed pictures which were 1280x960 it would look blurry, maybe when blizzard release some higher resolution backgrounds sry.
---
Do you have any reasoning?
---
End game you probably need 30 hours a week just for farming consumables.
---
Since a minority, including me, got a email but no actual invite, it would restore my faith in blizzard if they gave us the full beta access instead
---
Same here =(
---
That is brilliant and incredibly useful I really dig it!
---
Well yeah vanilla was 2 years of changes. Classic is meant to bring back what vanilla was like, and the obvious time to pick is to make classes like they were after all the talent revamps were done and all the silliest things from a rushed launch were fixed. Then you gate progression similar to how it was released in vanilla and voila - you have essentially Classic.  
---
The thing is people don't want to play iVanilla 2.0 where it's just a 2019 designed game but with vanilla models. And that's what spec changes are advocating. Because once you start mucking with spec balance you have to completely redo pvp, and levelling, and 5mans and raids. It's all completely different to what vanilla was like, even if it does have the same models. That's not want people want. People want vanilla wow gameplay. Yes that means hunters suck in naxx, and mages have a one button rotation and shamans have to heal in raids. And that's ok.
---
The dungeon sets are actually really bad for warlocks and mages. If you are trying to get the best gear available you wont be using either. Warlocks specifically use greens for a lot fo their gear until they get to BWL
---
Druid bear is arguably best tank for all pre raid dungeons. Their dps and utility is nuts. Warriors are de facto the best tanks in raids. Prot paladin is good in pre raid dungeons. Bear druid has a place as a raid tank in certain instances but will struggle arguing that cause 
---
Warlock starts picking up in dps when they start getting aq40 gear.
---
Mage and warrior reign supreme in dps, with rogues being like a warrior that has less survivability.
---
Ret paladins, enhancement shaman, balance/moonkin druid will always be "meme" specs that don't bring anything to the table that another class/spec couldn't do better.
---
Please correct me if I'm wrong as I haven't raided since vanilla and going off info that I've gleaned from current pserver meta.
---
People only put "don't upvoted" in the title to get people to give them upvotes.
---
Philippines. 100-300 KB/s
---
Rural Germany, apparently our politicians don't think that we need a fast connection or at least they don't really seem to do much about it but making empty promises about "Faster internet"
---
Thanks for the actual helpful response. I agree, it seems like it isn’t worth it.
---
Well to be more specific, he's perfectly fine with playing on the Alliance side since they don't have the same look. I'd just like for him to be on Horde so he can play with my Tauren Shaman although I don't really have a preference.
---
Yeah, it's a bit silly.
---
They're a corporation.
---
 [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-OKRzZDGhA](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-OKRzZDGhA)
---
same :(
---
Well Blizzard felt it was still worthwhile to have people submit it, so you don't really have a leg to stand on here.  Muted.
---
reckoning bomb wont work, reckoning will.
---
fancy software streamers have? They use a FREE software called obs.
---
Hey, thank you for your input!
---
Im not really hardcore player, so its better for me to go for meta, I guess :D
---
lol gl with that. Try to get them to throw in a foot massage as well.
---
It's looking amazing! lol
---
If they're going with a true recreation the ol 'fogger will most definitely work in classic.
---
I'm curious to know what else will as well
---
I've just got my 2 PTR accounts and my 2 regular WoW accounts, nothing new.
---
Regardless, I don't encumber my computer with every free program just in case I come across an opportunity to use it in a time sensitive situation.
---
I think the issue there is that they must do some kind of mass email sendout and things just get clogged/lagged and therefore people are getting emails way too late. Seems like something they really need to work on, but in any case what person who is desperate to play classic *isn't* checking their client every day? ;)
---
NoChanges.
---
Does it go up in increments of 5g or 10g?
---
Almost got me
---
\^ this
---
I'm definitely rolling horde in classic, gonna be playing with my brother and we've already decided our class/race and we're both so hyped haha. But for beta and stress testing it's definitely gonna be human, seems to be a bit easier to congregate as alliance
---
I got the e-mail awhile ago, and immediately checked my Battle.net Launcher - no section above the 'Play' button for selecting the Stress Test Beta!
---
I checked again a couple of hours later, and it was there. So, there's definitely a delay between the email and the ability to install the Beta. Check again before 4 PM PDT tomorrow.
---
&gt;  fairly distribute loot
---
Loot council should not be used to fairly distribute loot. Anyone who uses LC for that goal is completely misunderstanding what LC is for. LC is only to maximize progression and raid performance which by definition means unfair loot distribution.
---
Can just run them at a lower level, most streamers were at around the safe level doing dungeons ex. Asmongold running deadmines at lv 20. And they had some higher levels in the group as well. If they all were around 17 it would have been a whole different kind of run.
---
Pandas were originally a joke character drawn up by samwise and placed into warcraft 3 The Frozen Throne in the horde campaign.
---
People are going to be so much better informed through sheer experience and tge amount of information that will be easily accessible by youtube.
---
From RFC to level 40 I face tanked just about every dungeon I ran as a mage because warriors were just that terrible, and I was able to successfully complete almost every instance I ran. It's going to be a joke in classic, especially when you have at least 2 people who even have a clue
---
Huh? OK. Last year I could download part one for free. Maybe they changed it.
---
If I was against the hunter? No fun at all.
---
If I was the hunter? "I am an unstoppable God."
---
I read up on the guild info on your website and have applied.
---
Tbf. Everything is hunter gear.
---
Not at all, they have only improved it. Gearscore was dumb, but I don't think the ilvl average of retail is all that bad for what kind of game it is (most classes have secondaries performing pretty close, in general ilvl&gt;all so why not use it as a prominent metric).
---
Other than that, who cares. Can't think of many add-ons that detract from the game.
---
I also think removing addon support would just make people use hacky add-ons (like parsers for ff14, that are not allowed but goes without punishment). It's just not fun when something as simple as a DPS meter becomes a grey area...
---
lol so why not then?
---
*"MOM, bafroom...BAFROOM!"*
---
Others in this same topic disagree. But it's just a minor thing. My main point is the first sentence. :)
---
How can he do this? It’s not like retail where mob level scales is it?
---
This just shows what blizzard does if theres reasonable proof that something might be off. They can recreate it exactly on their own 1.12 100% perfect code. And see for themselves if its correct. Since mob attack values are transfered, unless theres some mixup on the database transfers, those should be ok (and this would be obvious). Then they need to check all possible migitations happening AFTER the original mob damage.
---
Dude I've been refreshing my client all night since I got my e-mail for the stress test. Still not in the client...If I got jebaited by Blizzard bro......ahhhhh HALP
---
People will stop bringing healers because it seems like they are not needed.
---
As far as early game community goes I do believe alliance has the advantage since goldshire is so universally known as "whatever" central. I might message you before classic releases to affirm your server choice since I have a bunch of friends going for a pvp horde server :) you're welcome to join!
---
Amazing work, please please don’t stop
---
There also aren't any NPCs for a wide swath over there.
---
Roll something else then.
---
It's this guy :O  [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN5KUCMa8uo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN5KUCMa8uo)
---
I think 5 but it's been a while, but it also depends on which respec number it is
---
Seeing that picture gave me goosebumps because right now (with classic) is the first time I've felt like Blizzard cares about us like they used to. Its like comparing going to a wal-mart, to a "ma &amp; pop shop".
---
I remember paying 260 and 220 DKP for Nemesis Pants and Nemesis Skullcap respectively. However, I never got the robes or the shoulder. We had like 6-7 locks and I lost the bids, and we rarely got Nemesis stuff from Nef and Chrom. A while after, I took a break.
---
Important thing to note is that you have to learn all your skill again, that drives up the cost by a lot.
---
I got excited, until I saw that's 1 AM to 3 AM where I'm from :(
---
And you're resorting to literally no argument, that makes you the loser, sir. Good day.
---
Oh OK thanks.
---
I rolled a Paladin Healer back in 2004. Was great, but to be honest I was fast at Twinks and yeah Paladin is nice for Raids but boring for the rest. I mean you can do great Duo PVP as a healer as well.
---
Paladin is not bad, BUT I choose this time a Priest.
---
If I like healing and find some cool dudes to play duo pvp I stay as a healer for PVE and PVP.
---
Otherwise I maybe just have some fun as Shadow in PVP, which is not that bad.
---
Sploosh
---
I remember in Vanilla raiding MC as a paladin. "Hey I'm gonna walk to the store and get some beer, be back in 20 minutes." Also always volunteering for OOC rezzer.
---
That scene where Sam brings the book to Tyrion, I already knew exactly what was gonna happen. Even knowing, it still didnt prevent me from vomiting in my mouth a little.
---
I’ll be playing so casually, I doubt I’ll be capped by phase 2 so it’s all good! :D
---
I've never installed a screencap software or even use the built-in Windows snipping tool. I just hit print screen and then paste the image into an empty paint file.
---
Just wanna swoop in here an wish you good luck mate! Make sure you get that job
---
From what I remember they weren't bad, but I wouldn't call them OP. As a mage I had a pretty easy time abusing their dead zone and reseting the fights if they got the drop on me. Don't really remember how it was like fighting them on my other lvl 60 classes.
---
There are three things i always hated about pets  in Classic
---
\- Leveling up a low level pet (NOT FUN or fast)
---
\- Pet happiness.
---
\- Pet  loyalty
---
\- only 3 pets. but for me  it's simple Rak'Shiri, White Lion, Black Lion.
---
It’s alright you get the 60% speed mount for free.
---
yeah, looks really good buddy :D
---
It’s true I’m being greedy, but I feel a little cheated that I have to buy regular epic mount, then once it releases I have to spend another 1K just to get the best looking ground mount in the game XD
---
Looks like a fucking dog.
---
Its said in the OP post, hes not killing the SAME boars, hes moving from zone to zone for higher level boars. But just exclusively killing boars all the same.
---
Hi, /u/Jin_Kireiame
---
I played on private servers and these things happen without abnoxious streamers. We had guilds killing city leaders so people couldnt turn in onyxia head or other important quests. We had big raid battles in BRM where massive raid groups would try wiping other guilds world buffs.
---
A dirty warlock
---
I KNEW IT! THIS IS **FAKE!**
---
You have experienced WoW players with good gear and talking over discord doing lowbie dungeons, they are gonna look easy.  
---
When the game releases you are gonna have things like hunters with their pets taunting and aggroing everything, healers wearing agi gear and using rank 1 heal at lvl 37 because they're too poor to buy skills, and rogues that think stealth means they are invisible to mobs so they get too close and aggro random trash.
---
The question is not if you can carry the baggage associated with your spec, it's whether or not you can get lucky and have people carry your useless spec...
---
It's a multiplayer game. No, not everyone can, wants to, or should roll the same class. But it's not everyone else's fault when you don't get invited, after you've been presented with every option and choose to play a crap spec.
---
In retail this argument works because most specs are relatively close, in vanilla the difference is large...
---
But yes, by all means, follow your dreams. But as said I think you have nobody to blame but yourself when you bring nothing to the table and people don't want to play with you.
---
"I was going to break up with my partner in June, but she already dumped me for refreshing r/classicwow during lovemaking!"
---
Me and two others from the same guild got an invite for it during the night. EU
---
&gt; Because once you start mucking with spec balance you have to completely redo pvp, and levelling, and 5mans and raids
---
I don't think this is true. Sure if you overtune something. But small talent changes and/or buffs to 2-3 class doesn't necessarily mean all the content has to be changed. Did blizzard revamp everything when a class was changed in Vanilla?
---
You are comparing and going right to the extremes. Why can't there be anything in between? A few minor changes to hybrid specs for example will not turn Classic into retail like many people here seems to believe.
---
&gt;  People want vanilla wow gameplay. Yes that means hunters suck in naxx, and mages have a one button rotation and shamans have to heal in raids.
---
You believe Classic will be ruined if hunters did a little more dps late game? Or if there is one enhancement shaman in your AQ raid?
---
And my previous point still stands. Vanilla saw drastic changes. There isn't  ONE true version of Vanilla. Sure I'm against any major changes, but small changes would improve the game and make its lifespan longer I believe.
---
If you like outdated info it's going to be great
---
Woof
---
Did you check out wow twitch yet? Huge nostalgia boner
---
If you’ve got into the stress test and want to know if you get into the beta, you can launch the beta client and see what servers show up in your secret list. If you see the beta servers then you have beta access. If you see nothing or “stress test server” then you do t have beta access.
---
I'm super happy for you three. Can feel your excitement through the text! Hope you guys have an amazing time! Would love to see that three person setup :)
---
Nice! My hope is regained :)
---
&gt; It only makes sense that the content was far easier if they could afford bringing useless classes.
---
They paid for it by using 10x-100x more time to get content done compared to now. If you raided 2 times a week 3 hours a time like people do now with those inefficiencies you would still be in MC when naxx came out lol.
---
You mean like every other Paladin and Warlock who played from launch in vanilla?
---
i read alot of comments saying: "yeah but blizzard has the reference client so we have to trust them with that".
---
that was never argued. anywhere. ever. nobody is saying that the blizzard reference client is wrong. what people ARE saying is that some things feel off about the beta.
---
whether or not its because of wrong privateserver values or hazy memory doesnt matter.
---
just report anything that you think is wrong. THATS WHAT THE REFERENCE CLIENT IS FOR
---
Weird and gross question
---
I was surprised that IF you install the Classic to its own separate folder its 9GB, but if you install it under your normal wow client, its \~5GB. Didnt expect it to share that much of data, guessing its music, videos and partially the base client combined...
---
But yeah, the download was so fast it totally maxed out my 100M line, couldnt even watch twitch while doing that.
---
Isnt he in full twink gear?
---
Yeah it started as a joke "30 year old boomer".
---
If I sub today, what is the chance I get a key? 2005 account.
---
Do you understand that classicdb uses data from mangos pserver core and not vanilla?
---
fucking pserver players again trying to compare pserver data to beta... sad
---
How does this honor Memorial Day?
---
But, I do agree with the idea. For every 10 vanilla players, invite an expansion player.
---
I figured. But it seems quite tedious compared to just checking the launcher. :-) Well well...
---
I wish I had kept mine!
---
I had the Vanilla, TBC, and WotLK books. Threw them out mid way through cata because I thought “oh well this is all just outdated info and it’s easier to find on the internet anyway”
---
I would of loved to flick through these again while playing classic.
---
Im pretty sure that's what Old School Runescape did. Now it's more popular than the current game
---
Come to me I will cleanse you
---
You can press windows + print screen at any time. It will create a screenshot folder in your pictures folder. No install or software required, its an operating system feature.
---
My mom got me one of those 14-day trail cards. I had been watching my friend and his cousin play for weeks and now I could finally play myself. As soon as the 14 days ran out, I (or my mom, can't recall) bought the game and I instantly got 30 more days of playtime. It was glorious.
---
How about orc female? They are the most human-like of all horde. Except skin color, of course.
---
I wonder how made it makes you that I have both vanilla CE and mini tyrael, things your private server will never give you. :)
---
 You're going to find out you can't get enrage from /sit and can't get world buffs to carry you through mc and cry all the way back to whatever pserver you've only ever played wow on.
---
Cringe
---
&gt; Average age of vanilla players was 28.
---
The average age of the participants in the sub is **not** 42. There is clearly a selection bias going on where mostly people who were young during Vanilla participate here.
---
But hey ... don't let me disturbe your crude rationalization.
---
Can some pro PVPer point out mistakes? :)
---
Kinda as a joke tho
---
RIP EU
---
You could just ride your 60% until the quest is completeable
---
Buhahahhahha, in 2004/05 here in Italy in  300/500kbs was a dream, I had 100 kbs when lucky
---
Might be outdated and there is wowhead nowadays, doesn’t change the nostalgic feeling
---
got the stress test, late 2013 account lol.
---
&gt; ~~Bored~~ Boared of the same old thing watching your usual streamers?
---
Ftfy :)
---
It really depends on the phase release dates. DM came out 4 months after launch. So if phase 2 takes longer than 5-6 months to release it’s a far cry from authentic
---
i know this is a joke but can we please not bash the people who are trying to report bugs?
---
thats what the reference client is for.
---
we bugreport what we THINK are bugs. blizzard checks if its true or not.
---
&gt; My understanding from reading posts here, was the bosses were fine, but it was the other elites within the dungeon which were off?
---
Nope. No one was saying this at **ALL** until Blizzard answered with this data. Initially people were talking all about the bosses. Claiming that Rogues soloing Vicious Fallout was broken, when that was Legit done by lebel 29 rogues in retail all the time for the dagger. Its in the 16 year old comments on classic.wowhead.
---
As soon as Blizzard proved the boss was right, it pivoted to "but the trash though".  This is going to be a long ass beta.
---
That is complete nonsense. The Deadmines does not transform to VC just naturally.
---
Yikes. They are all things pservers have gotten right. You cannot fear 2 mobs in pservers. Resurrection doesn't ress with full health on pservers. Totem effects don't stay indefinitely on you on pservers. Spell crit damage is 150% on pservers. Getting stamina boost doesn't heal you on pservers.
---
Hell yes I'm down!!
---
This is the difference between authenticity and accuracy. Many people on this sub seem to use the terms interchangeably. Often when there is a disagreement between #nochanges people, this seems to be what causes it. One person wants an accurate experience, one where the mechanics and data are as close as possible to what they were in Vanilla regardless of how much it seems to deviate from their memory. The other wants an authentic experience, one that replicates as closely as possible what they remember Vanilla being like, and are willing to sacrifice a little bit of accuracy to get that.
---
Both are impossible goals, but one can at least approach accuracy in the limit. Different people have different experiences of what Vanilla was like, and Blizzard cannot replicate all of them. What Blizzard can do is try and make Classic match Vanilla, and then let players decide what they make of it.
---
What's are your thoughts on the blizzcon fiasco?
---
I remember reading through that thing in 10th grade English class with a dear friend of mine. We were supposed to be reading The Scarlet Letter. He played an undead rogue, I was a troll mage. A great memory of mine, but even back then that thing was outdated just about the moment it released
---
Meh too much sensibility imo.
---
Those people were fucking the game and will continue to fuck the game because idiots have pity of them.
---
You need to diversify yo' bonds, *****
---
I didn't receive an email but I have "beta &amp; stress test" in the blizzard launcher and downloading it atm. 
---
And I'm EU
---
It isn't the beta, he will be able to play for 26 hours with a max level of 30. The regular beta is 30+ and has a completely different server selection
---
Good choice.  Don't embrace that stupid shit.  Anyone can tell what a face is, twitch emotes constantly change in popularity. Unless you want to permanently lower your IQ, I would stay away from twitch chat.
---
You didn't read the post and comments, you condescending ass. I know that. Go troll elsewhere.
---
&gt;	You're on a sub full of private server players...
---
​
---
I've done STV with 12k people on the same server at the same time
---
People who have done that are grizzled war veterans next to scrubs like you, hah. What are you smoking? Give me some
---
You think you do, but you don't. He was right about a lot of you. Why would you assume that in this sub of all places. No where are you gonna find more people who are intimately aware of how to level in vanilla.
---
Insanity of retail plebs who couldn't figure out how to log onto private servers is galling
---
&gt;To quoute WC3 DRAW STEEL KNAVE!!!
---
This thread is the only place that quote appears in.
---
The term Azeroth has had a few different meanings. Originally it was the name of the nation of which Stormwind is the capital. Then, it was repurposed as the name of the southern part of the Eastern Kingdoms continent. Then the whole continent. Then the world. Then the Titan inside the world.
---
Also if you're in westfall general chat its pretty obvious.
---
Then you don't vote?
---
As a mage I hated their 1.0 attack speed cats but if I got the drop there was a good chance I was winning, while of they got the drop I had to really play for the win
---
&gt; You wouldn't have classic WoW without them
---
Actually we wouldn't have Classic WoW without Blizzard and their failed expansions. 
---
Pirate servers operated since 2006 or so with mediocre population. In fact few hundred peaks were considered very good. One notable exception was the server which operated during TBC which was shot down and the owner sued for millions.
---
So why sudden success of Nostarlius? The answer is *Warlords of Draenor*. The most failed expansion ever which caused subs to nosedive and players to look for fun elsewhere.
---
You may rest assured that if not falling subscriptions Blizzard wouldn't give a shit about Classic.
---
You don't have to venture to another zone to up fishing. You can reach 300 in Stormwind canal if you want.

I'd try classic first since that's cheaper than buying BFA. Personally I like classic more than BFA. But BFA is ok too (please don't kill me for saying that). They are two very different games now. I will most likely spend most of my time on classic, probably 90%. But I'll still log onto BFA and do some dailies, check out new content, farm mounts etc.
---
Search function folks!
---
ps, higher difficulty, use less people.
---
You do not need changes to achive more difficulty. Just setup your group/raid differently. As an example 40 Druid molten core.
---
VC
---
It would e nice if Blizz would make a change to Classic to include a monument for TB in it :)
---
This would be proper and nobody would complain such a change.
---
You just keep sucklin' the teet of your corporate overlords then, buddy.
---
Even worse when doing RFK/RFD, ally still spawn at Ratchet!
---
It’s the female Tauren remodel. With high mountain antlers.
---
We died after cata
---
This is why we called it VC. Then there is no confusion.
---
Ikr dude I've played on private server launches with like 15 or 20k players and it took like atleast a hour and a half to get to level 5
---
I'm not going to say the "People know better now than back then" argument. But there are a lot of factors as to why a dungeon is hard or easy.
---
If you go in DM with level 15 people who don't have a clue as to how to play their class (I know it's just level 15 but still) or even have atleast 1 green or blue item to help them and on top of that the mechanics of the dungeon, it will be hard even for a low level dungeon.
---
If you go in with level 20 characters who know what they're doing and have some greens or blues on them, the success chance is way higher both in terms of damage received and knowledge on how not to mess it up.
---
Mother of pearl!
---
Since there arent any unarmored mounts, i would just save up the gold and get the charger later on.
---
Kalimdor gained some.
---
That's actually bad. Vanilla private servers werent even that hard and if they had 2 times the dmg of mobs...
---
Nelf Priest.
---
&gt; The moment you start thinking of a corporate entity as your friend
---
I appreciate the capital scepticism from my fellow socialist. But I do have to point out that there are problems with the sentence and how it frames the previous comment. For reference, here the previous comment:
---
&gt; Blizzard has my full faith at this point. They are doing everything they can to ensure things are accurate, stable, and good for this game and community. 10/10 would subscribe again
---
The comment does not describe friendship. Even though faith is a vital part of friendship, you can't deduce friendship by the presence of faith. Religious faith in god does not make god your friend. Economical faith into fiat money does not make money or the central bank your friend.
---
The comment makes a clear remark on the transparency exhibited by the classic devs. This level of transparency in this industry is **extremely** rare. On the scale of WoW:Classic I only know of one other example (where this other example is basically mandated by the people funding the project).
---
Lastly, the comment can be interpreted in a way that the OP has faith in the communication displayed by Blizzard over this project. This is actually a reasonable assumption. Not only is the communication so far very concise, it also was timely and accurate to the points raised in the community and this subreddit. The latest post gives transparency over their internal methods of testing claims of inaccuracies. The "faith" is not so much in not fucking us over. It's in the communication coming out of the team is accurate and to the point without needing concrete proof for every point raised.
---
Though the last paragraph is more interpretation as strict reading. Keep in mind that the previous 2 paragraphs are not.
---
Same guy that died 54 times 1-30, most of it to mobs.
---
&gt; until they dont belong to Activision
---
This is meaningless as long as Blizzard is a publically traded company and has to answer to people investing the money outlinde by the rules of the US government.
---
My Hope just got destroyed today. That they convert Stress-Test to Real Beta.   
---
I got picked with 7 out of my 13 Accounts so, I am 100% sure they don't invite any of us to the Real Beta after Stress Test =/
---
Yup, had EU stress test invite when I woke up as well. No e-mail, though. Check the client.
---
Only correct answer
---
It's unironically one of the actual good expansions in the series. Some of the best raids inn the game, amazing zones, great dubgeons with the introduction og CM, loads of content, except ofcourse maybe the drought near the end.
---
It annoys me when people ignorantly throws it aside just because "pandas lmao", because its dishonest
---
Because trolls love to troll.
---
Lame that Verdan wasn't there for them to try again.
---
I would think so too, my GF has an OG account from vanilla with lots of cool stuff from back then and she got invited at the same time as me... and I have an active 6-years old account + one banned account from 2010 and 2 misc alt accounts in my launcher.
---
Well, you could... like PLAY on the beta if you gotten the beta access, right now. And not just look at the server lists. Beta servers are going down before the stresstest starts.
---
Running of the Gnomes!    
---
Thousands of pink haired lvl1 gnomes (although no longer lvl1 by the time they arrived due to discovery exp) running across the continent.
---
Ok...
---
I absolutely love that campaign... It is like a mini Diablo/hack and slash RPG campaign, and it is really awesome!
---
I guess from the Alliance point of view, they would consider Azeroth the land they live on since they knew nothing of Kalimdor or other continents.
---
Nobody is actually confused. People just like to feel superior to others and cause trouble.
---
It might be that they are doing it off of time spent subbed rather than from the date that you originally subbed. Not sure on that, it's a thought though.
---
If you're interested then here's a link to a video where someone goes over the details regarding zones and xp per kill etc.
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh6iBkfvkY0
---
I only ever saw that on EU beta server happen. And even then only close to the end of the beta where there was an big event like this anyway.
---
Chuck Norris beat Super Mario bros. running in the left direction.
---
God, we are all old in this thread ...
---
That versions on the Japanese servers
---
I'm sure they're not going to fix that. I'm sure they plan to leave lag issues around forever.
---
Huntard is one of the most boring classes in classic, probably right after ret pally.
---
Holy crap it really sounds like Ion has done something truely horrible to you. What did he do, kill your parents? Or even worse, did he kick you from his guild?
---
What I am going to be doing is seeing if I can use xpadder or WoWmapper to play with a controller so I can casually level without hurting my wrists.
---
Honestly hoping whoever makes that consoleport addon for retail can make a version for classic cause that has been an amazing addition to the game that makes me wonder why blizzard didn't just make playing a official controller scheme as an option when they cut down on the amount of skills we had so hard during legion/BFA
---
your experience was not the norm for everybody in 2005. I started early 2005 (Europe launch was a few months behind US)  and we always had capable warriors during leveling.  Of course there were many very bad ones too, but I think the more seasoned gamers quickly found each other and formed networks / guilds / friends lists.  That is the whole idea behind vanilla wow, community building .  People often dislike grouping with randoms, for the reasons you gave and others, but they would form teams that regularly work together.
---
Does anyone actually just run the entirety of dire maul, though? And in that case, wouldn't you have to specify full run anyway which would give it away as no one does partial runs of deadmines?
---
Sorry, I'm in the same boat... if you got invited today you are most likely only invited to the stress test.
---
It will be active for 22 (or 24) hours after the test is done and you can try it out during that time and there is a level cap of 5.
---
Who gave you the right to just walk in here and burst everyone's bubble?
---
My email came like 3 hours after I noticed the option to install from my launcher
---
Might not be right away but we can hope that at some point we'll get it right :)
---
These are bugs in Classic, yes, and will be fixed. Not proof that private servers "got it right". Other than really crude, basic things such as chat working as intended, everything is down to pure guesswork and nothing can be used as a method of comparison. Everything is estimated. A LOT of things are wrong in private servers. Even things that seem to be working okay are most likely working as intended by random chance, not due to the server developers actually getting it right.  
---
The point being, we should absolutely overlook EVERYTHING they've "gotten right", because that list is so much shorter than the one of the things they've gotten wrong that there is no point in wondering if the 20% of things that are "correct" are actually correct and not just "close enough". ESPECIALLY when Blizzard have an actual 1.12 client running and can double check everything to confirm. There is absolutely 0 need of even considering if something is working correctly in a private server because all it does is trying to emulate as best as it can the game that Blizzard have got running with 100% authenticity themselves.
---
Hey Man. Holy reckoning is a thing. 
---
Even without the /sit macro you can pump out tons of heals and are going to be targeted no matter what. Sword and board (healing weapons) till 4 stack reckoning, pop judgement of crusader and then seal of righteous and pop on a slow 2H and fuck someone’s day up, then rinse and repeat.
---
Go for pure spell power gear. I’d also move points into improved seal of righteous in holy, as well as considering divine strength for 10% strength.
---
Again, the /sit macro isn’t a game changer. The amount of healing efficiency you lose is more than made up for by being a true hybrid beast on the battlefield.
---
https://youtu.be/7-aCwJeuQ4I
---
I got 7 xD but yeah, bascially everyone got invited. 7 out of my 13 got invited. So not a special thing.
---
haha, nice one.
---
Not sure what you mean, but Ion is the current Game Director for WoW. He got the position during the development of Legion and has had it since then.
---
A lot of people like to blame him for how poorly BfA turned out but i still like to think that he had grand ideas that were marginalized by share holder promises and release schedules.
---
Esfand was talking about planning wpvp event with Asmon on stream
---
nope, the damage numbers have been compared to real vanilla footage and do line up correctly, even dungeon elites. Now, dungeon elites may hit harder on private servers as opposed to world mobs which hit lower, but that doesn't mean beta is wrong.
---
Oh no, you're sick all of a sudden. How unfortunate.
---
Looks like you'll have no choice but to stay home and play the stress test
---
Since its 15 year old game, this stuff wont happen often
---
I shit on hunters as a Warrior. I would straight up hunt them in BG’s.
---
Why is everyone getting invited but I ain't get nuffin xc
---
Lembas bread bro
---
Yup, I think this is probably the case as well. It's easier to work out where problems are if you test little by little. Starting off with the smaller group of players to eke out bugs was a good start, the stress tests will give them the opportunity to see how the server handles the load. 
---
I reckon there will be a level update in the next couple of weeks, some more people will be added to the levelling beta and then, of course, the other stress tests.
---
You are speaking 100% out of my heart.
---
Played private servers a lot, first max main healer was a priest. After that a druid.
---
I inform myself about playstyle, progression and everything through podcast and stuff for my top 3 classes. (which are lock, pala or priest btw) 
---
2 Weeks before the classic release you are able to reserve 3 chars on a server for names. I force myself to just doing 2 and on classic release I play the one who "feels right" may sound stupid, but this is how I will choose it.
---
My advice would be don't play priest, you have great memories don't crush them with new ones. Try out Pala and Shaman and see what you like more! One of my best friends plays vanilla p servers a lot and really didn't like druids for healing so be carefull with them.
---
I've just had "World of warcraft: Legion (WoW 5) PTR" come up on mine, not had chance to check my pc yet but can only assume that would indeed be it. We'll see later when I get back on.
---
Priest is really good, but expect to compete with a lot of other Priests for loot. Also the other healing classes rolling need on your cloth healing gear in pre-raid dungeons. 
---
When I used to raid we only had one Druid in our raid, and that guy was the first to get fully kitted in tier gear, so I expect that any of the non-Priest healers will have a much easier time getting epic gear if that's something you care about.
---
Hi, /u/PlayerSalt
---
My brother is in Minneapolis and we’re both in the beta, so there’s one.
---
I am sure you can crush this Idea, got invited with 7 out of 13 accounts, so litterarely everyone got invited xD
---
Shaman or priest, imo. Sure paladins are good alliance healers, but what a brain dead boring class.
---
Druids are good too, but druids are one of those classes where people who are going to play a Druid—play a Druid—no one who has to be told to play Druid enjoys it.
---
It will still be up for 24ish hours
---
Damn, I was thinking of putting points into MM for Aimed Shot then filling in BM. Or is BM that good early level?
---
Wonderful!
---
Hunters in vanilla can played but anyone somewhat well, they have high skill cap but low skill entry if that makes sense. There is a clear difference between a great hunter and a bad hunter. But again a bad hunter can do stuff.
---
Just noticed that i DID get a email from blizzard of my beta access. It was just filtered to gmails "offers" or whatever thats called in english (when you have your main box, social meadia and offers).
---
It came a day after i noticed it myself in the launcher.
---
You're correct. But my argument does not change, that weapon is the one reason people give for enha shamans being "progression raid viable" but all the testing we did in team plague simply said that equipping every off-tank with it so that they could use it during boss fights where they dont have to tank gave the same result and gave us another slot for other dps. Which made the decision to roll alliance much easier.
---
I'm talking specifically about the dev team, not the entire corporation.
---
no, you are in denial, post proof
---
Do you know what times and is US and EU test servers separated or the same?
---
Heavily considering it. The more I think about it, the more I like the idea of a male nelf priest. The druids and priests if Elune are predominantly male and female, but exceptions have been allowed for the past years lore wise. It'd be rare ingame, and rare lore wise. The casting animations kind of suck, sadly. The light blue hair would look so good with one of the tier sets, forgot the name... The blue one. Also night elves get that Elune themed priest ability, I think a channel dot? Not very useful for endgame at all, but probably gon a be fun flavor while playing.
---
Classic will put a serious strain on all my relationships but azeroth needs me
---
Dump her i will be your gf i know whats its like to put a 40 man together
---
Any other music choice? Yes how about the masterful in game music? Why would you deny yourself the amazing soundtracks of Warcraft to listen to that trash?
---
Well, pretty sure, this is just a normal invite then xD sadly, no bigger chances, they also said that in a Bluepost (not sure if they lie tho, to not piss pepl.)
---
Sorry but please don’t misinform someone who asked for best pve classes. Pala and shaman tank aren’t. The question wasn’t what is possible if you and all others around you want to make it work. 
---
@OP your summary is on point.
---
Back in Vanilla it was said they were asking for a refund on their credit card and there was nothing Blizzard could do.
---
So they basically had an endless source of one month free time.
---
Vanilla was created and released in 2004, not Classic.
---
well, presumably overtuned. We don't know yet though, because we don't know the real vanilla raid values yet. Besides, all the top private server streamers that are on the beta like monkeynews was complaining his whole first 1-2 streams that normal mobs was dealing "way lower damage" than on private servers, then it turns out the complete opposite is true.
---
As someone who played WoW with his family as a kid and has tons of memories from it, I can say that 10 years down the road your kid is gonna look back at these memories and be happy he was able to share the experience with you all as a family.
---
Thanks for being good parents and getting your kid involved. Hope you all have a wonderful time!
---
Yeah this looks like the kind of map that early seafaring explorers would make, with proportions and geolocations off. I doubt Metzen had this in mind but the resemblance is there.  
---
I mean compare it to map of Earth from published in 1564! And there are certainly "worse" ones from pre-Columbus era etc.

Just pop out a couple more little dps babies and you'll have a sick 5 man squad! I'm only 23 but I'm extremely envious of having a family that would play video games with me, let alone World of Warcraft. Sounds like you'll have an amazing time! :)
---
I'm an adult and I actually have come to like the Alliance better. I see the horde as a bunch of angsty teenagers that just wanna look "cool"
---
Also, Alliance has Paladins, so we have the best two pvp racials which are
---
1. We get to play alongside Paladins.
---
2. We don't have to play against Paladins.
---
Upvoted for ......................

Thanks for understanding

Ah yes, the hash tags that must apply to every single person who happens to dissent from the cultish like belief that everything must stay the exact same way as it was in 2004-2006. Fuck off with that hash tag shit, doesn't apply to me, doesn't apply to every single person that disagrees with you. 
---
How about *you* accept the idea that maybe some small increased difficulty (after all, we're just talking about raising the damage of some elites in dunfeons, which are supposed to be hard!) that those changes would be good for the game?
---
Now please try and respond without using memes.
---
Retail version. No castsequence or script macros. [Source](https://youtu.be/hhKkP8LryYM?t=2505)
---
There is only one stress test server. It's US based. 
---
They started planning it about 3 hours ago so there aren't many details for the public.
---
Only talent skills mind you.  But still expensive when you’re a paladin who mains holy for raids and plays ret in pvp lol.  I was never a rich man in vanilla.
---
there are screams of it being too easy, or rather not as hard as they remember.
---
A large part of that is the players running the dungeons who seem to be fairly competent BUT there are still people who wipe LFR because the can't grasp basic shit like not standing in fire, once the game is open to the public you'll see things get harder.
---
Another warrior is probably the worst class to level with a warrior. All green drops need to be shared, both equally as weak against clustered mobs and lots of caster/ranged mobs.
---
If you want it to be more difficult that's easily achievable. Do the dungeon at a lower than intended level, do it with fewer people, take off some of your gear, try to do it using only abilities from one spec, do it with a hunter pet as the tank. Get creative and you'll find the difficulty.
---
please don't scare people away by spreading nonsense...
---
It's not that difficult. Most of the tools are built to be basically out-of-the-box ready to go. I use Streamlabs OBS right now and I was up and running within an hour. It only really gets complicated if you want to create custom graphics and aren't already familiar with that stuff (thankfully I am, so eventually I'll be adding custom graphics to my stream).
---
I'm EU, and I got the stress test too. Probably won't be playing though. My boyfriend told me, that if I got a beta invite, it was to be handed in to him ASAP :p
---
Twinks get corpse camped for eternity. Along with multi boxers.
---
I thought Shadowcraft and Nightslayer looked very good as well.
---
I don't know man. I think pserver players will only make up a fraction of total people that will be playing.
---
except the only evidence we have so far shows classic beta is tuned harder than private servers. 
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M
---
world mobs are hitting harder on average, have better AI/scripting so using more abilities and using them smarter, and some dungeon bosses are way tougher because of this, like verdan is hitting for 3x more than he does on private servers. And the speed lvling streamers in general are reporting slower lvling times than on private servers. Of course, endgame is another story and we'll have to see if private servers are overtuned there, but from what we've seen so far 1-30, classic beta is harder than private servers.
---
You don’t need a tank at lower levels, amy melee will do. 
---
A healer let’s you go faster, chain pull and all that.
---
Did you participate in the 10 year anniversary? I have never wiped as much as I did with a pug on that dumbed down version of mc

Blink can be used to remove stuns. If he didn’t use it to close distance, he could have blinked out of the stun and lived
---
You realize they had teamspeak and ventrilo right? So that example is kind of dumb. And yes it was widely loved in wrath because people didn't think about the repercussions, didn't think about how it would help destroy the social aspect of the game.
---
why do you think people want classic? You don't even know.
---
Does it look like I care?
---
That's pretty smart dude! Every flight path you have to do burpees until landed! You'll be BUFF

“Play up to level 5.“
---
Find a lower level alliance person and just drop earthbind totems so they walk extremely slow for hours
---
Ah I see, well thanks! I almost cried when I saw the drop down on Bnet but almost cried again when I realised its just for tonights stress test. :(
---
Corpsemaker is so sick at that level
---
Is there a way to see when my account was created? I checked the Transaction History on my account setting but the first payment on there is in 2008 for an authenticator. The thing is I know it's the account I played a lot of classic in because I have two characters with the old PVP ranks and I specifically remember playing one of those in ZG trying to get a son of hakar pet before TBC came out.
---
Beta admins &gt; live admins
---
What are EU time for stress test?
---
Another paladin will have to be specced kings anyways, he can’t put both kings and sanctuary on the tanks as one paladin. Totally agree with you that he should be going 25/26/0, but none the less the other paladins in the raid will fill the gaps in this spec.
---
Ultimately he’s sacrificing 5% crit to be able to crazy burst in bgs while still having effective healing
---
With 30 hours a week you can do anything you want, except extreme cases like reaching the highest PVP ranks. 
---
You can raid all content, you can make multiple alts, you can do PVP.
---
I have been playing both as a hardcore and as a casual raider. In my hardcore period I still played not more than 25-30 hours a day.  (3 nights of raiding x 4 a 5 hours + 10 -15 hours of doing other stuff including  gathering raid consumables)
---
In my more casual periods did dropped down to less than 20 hours a week. 
---
I am not saying that other people weren't playing more hours, I am sure some played 60 hours a week, but my 30 were enough to get accepted as core raider in a hardcore guild that competed for all the server firsts.
---
That's not how it works at all. The client contains a lot of information of the game in the dbc files. Formulas and logic are not that deep and were figured out and documented back in the day and can be found from addons (e.g. threat meters back in the day would have been useless without knowing how threat worked) and archived websites. Monster values are documented in bestiary (which uses TBC values, which were not exactly same but close enough not to be called guessing at all). Videos and strategy guides help to get boss scripting right.
---
Never played wow before, subbed a week ago got in the stress we lit
---
Reckoning stacks disappear on weapon swap.
---
This is why we don't take advice from private server players.
---
Yeah I ran deadlines with a group of 16s and 17s on private servers, it’s hard but doable. I think this is a better idea than one less dps.
---
#BOW, YE SHITS!
---
Apprently it last an entire day though
---
The stress test time is equivalent to 1-3am window where I live, I didn't have an invite straight after the raid last night! Excited to get it this morning only to find out the realm is offline :x
---
&gt;This subreddit has spent the past months doing nothing than shitting all over private server players by claiming Vanilla was much harder than these server. Now that the complete opposite seem to be the case
---
&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtR0fT3Hz3M
---
so far all the evidence we have shows classic beta being tougher than private servers actually. Mobs are hitting harder, have better AI/scripting so they use abilities more/smarter, elites are harder to solo because they have higher movespeed, dungeon bosses like Verdan are hitting 3x more than private servers,etc. Just wanted to point that out, as a hardcore private server player of the last 3-4 years myself, private servers are even more faceroll than classic, at least in the 1-30 content. Endgame is another thing and we'll have to wait and see if private servers were overtuned there.
---
I had the same thing with hearing VC for the first time on a private server. It would be completely normal to have heard DM though since that's how someone not familiar with the dungeon would even call it.
---
Oh duh, you're right. I was thinking Kings was an Aura despite having "Blessing" literally in the name.
---
I started playing wow in legion and subbed like a week ago and got in today for beta. Every morning i was checking if i got in and always got disappointed but today when i checked and saw the Beta. I was so happy that i can finally try to vanilla wow that everyone speaks and loves.
---
Arcanite reaper too?!
---
I hope you're lying lol otherwise I'm super disappointed.
---
Well not me on 2 accounts
---
Dungeon bosses are just regular elites though?
---
Yeah that's what I am saying, like what is the dude's point. Who gives a shit.
---
nah i dont have that but there have been people saying the option is there hours after the email so I will have to wait and see
---
Thank you. People forget it's a beta and things that are being reported are exactly what a beta test are for. It seems like people believe it's an early access and everything is complete.
---
I don't have beta access, but I just got stress test download (no e-mail). My account is fairly new - created in 2012 for Diablo, first WoW related purchase is from Nov 2017. I have an active subscription (resubbed in the hope of getting into beta).
---
I kinda lost interested somewhere around the third admin. rererererolled?
---
omg I'm so done now. I got hyped up big time and...cmon &gt;.&lt;
---
I did make comment about this to peeps I know but at the end of the day - lets be honest your gonna need a good while to save that gold.
---
Make use of the time initially to get yourself ready for the questline.
---
The idea is that you trust people you GOT to KNOW  during playing.   
---
In my experience the system is great and I was skeptical at first too, but if the leaders are corrupt the guild collapses quickly, so only decent LC guilds survive.
---
My wife and I both got invited (EU). Just done downloading the client.
---
It’s all about that bass.

---
So I basically had two different experiences in WoW vanilla, I didn't start playing until about 6-7 months before Burning Crusade came out. The first time leveling a warrior it was probably similar to the way it was with most other people. I had no clue what I was doing, I wasn't even familiar with the whole trinity system (healer, dps, tank) until I was close to level 60. WoW was one of the first RPGs I ever played too so a lot of things were very new to me. 
---
Then about 1 month before TBC came out, myself and several others from my current guild decided to go to a brand new server that was just released for TBC to start a guild and prepare for TBC. That was one of my favorite WoW experiences of all and that's as someone who's done a lot of different things in this game. We all had a lot more knowledge on what we were doing. We'd all level in groups, we'd only do dungeons within our guild and it was brilliant because people understood their roles. 
---
I think this will be a similar experience even to a greater degree with a lot of people coming into playing Classic, knowledge is power and it makes a huge difference.
---
I think it will weed out very quickly. Being reliable, forgiving and humble will make you progress so much smoother in Classic, while being the opposite actively hinders you. People that cant help themselves but be assholes all the time wont enjoy Classic for long. I estimate most realms will have a decent community at worst in the long run.
---
Why would you even want TF as a hunter ? It's a shit hunter weapon and I'm saying that as someone that is considering rolling a hunter in classic.
---
Yeah some people just got in without an email maybe doing mass invites are just lagging them abit lol
---
It also makes me a bit sad. Sploosh would have been amazing as the beta invite sound. :(
---
Vanilla account, no stress test/ beta for me. I played 5 years of vanilla Pservers. I have no desire to play the beta. Or vanilla before official launch.
---
That is only for the most hardcore type of guilds, that really want to progress as fast as possible.
---
LC can also be used by a more casual guild, that just wants to distribute loot that way, even if their way of distributing means it's not ideal for the fastest progress.
---
These type of guilds kill  an end boss 2 months after the first guild.  They really don;t care if their Nef kill is 8, 10 or 12 weeks behind the server first, as long as they make steady progress at their own speed
---
Things that are in the client are things that Blizzard got right and pservers use as-is. You can't really credit the private servers for "getting it right" when they're using Blizzards client that contains the information and the programming.
---
Also videos "helped" to get boss encounters right. Which, as you know yourself, means that if they happen to be 100% authentic it's down to pure guesswork. Just like I said.
---
same, fuck it going in wth no sleep.
---
Yup
---
kinda hoping they will but they definitely wont do that haha
---
It's their job to test it, we can throw as many questions at them as we feel like. Stop feeling sorry for a company.
---
Ultimately your right. Early epic mounts will see a huge advantage in world pvp but seeing as how DM will come with the rankings I can wait till then
---
That is fucking disgusting
---
All of them or only the one coming from talents?
---
Mount collecting and transmog turn your character into a silly fashion statement rather than somebody interacting with a real, living world. It is indeed like sharding and LFR in that they both take away from the grand feeling of being in a vast world. It's not supposed to be online cosplay. It's an RPG. The goal of the game is not just to play dress up with your character. Things are supposed to feel real.
---
In classic, the mount is an expensive but immensely useful tool. It's an ordinary animal like a horse or a wolf because that makes sense within the world. Your character is just another adventurer, not the demigod savior of the world. Every player riding an enormous, laser equipped, armored super dragon like in retail (and then having literally hundreds of equally over-the-top mounts like a fucking flying pirate boat to switch around with) is ridiculous and immersion breaking. That guy riding that expensive horse earned it. It's his trusty steed. It doesn't make sense for a character to have 500 mounts.
---
Likewise, in classic, gear is a part of the game world. It's not just a "dummy object" that holds stats so you can collect stuff to transmog with. Gear is a physical object in the game world same as a tree or a mob. Not only that, but what other people wear also tells you a lot about their characters, as it should of course. As a probably quite absurd comparison, imagine watching a big fight scene in a fantasy movie where swords and armor are transmogged into t-shirts and jeans and horses become bicycles. Sure, the numerical "gameplay" experience is unchanged since the modern, transmogged clothes have the same stats as armor, but its extremely immersion breaking and ridiculous.
---
So yes, transmog and silly mounts absolutely affect both the social experience and the gameplay experience. It breaks the immersion of the game completely and trivializes proper in-game goals. Your character looking badass and awe-inspiring should be a direct reflection of your accomplishments (and really be a secondary reward in itself), not come from online cosplay.
---
Same as NA
---
This video portrays alexensual as being a smart one. Cant take it seriously, sorry.
---
So, grey mobs don't do reduced damage they just have more of a chance to miss and no crushing blows (150% damage) 
---
Why do people think that damage is multiplied/reduced because of your player level? Where does this come from?
---
This is a video of a lvl 48 soloing the 1st boss being hit for exactly the same damage as a lvl 20 tank

Yep i am from EU and got invite too :)
---
Awesome hopefully they give you full beta, they probably have a bit of lag with all the emails they have to send out and stuff I will just wait a few hours and check :)
---
excellent passive aggressive. you fit in well here
---
Call it four times the damage, then. That's still very much tankable.
---
zomg
---
Sounds like retail
---
It’s the vanilla experience.
---
You’re paying for 13 accounts?
---
To be clear, the focused monitoring time for the stress test is the 2 hour window. The server for the stress test is supposed to be online for people to mess around on until Thursday the 23rd, according to the invite email.
---
If that happened for real, it would be the best troll in history
---
I remember running it in its entirety on Thrall, especially since I wasnt in a super raid guild and we just got BWL on a regular schedule shortly before BC. Dire Maul and other 55+ content was mostly my PVE end game. ( I still remember the Westfall trade chat using VC. I think this was very specific, with original vanilla servers using DM.
---
Also I remember having a good amount of abilities in pandaria. Every time xpack after was just prune brothers.
---
Yeah who knows but im going to play the whole 2 hours and report all bugs I see so they know ill be serious in a beta i guess :/ if i get in anyway
---
 Kinda tough when we sit by the BG queue forever :/
---
Give me free karma for continuing the positivity train!
---
I mean, yay!
---
Joana has proof that mobs in classic beta does far less damage than what the exact same mob did in his 1-60 world record video. But since he didn’t do the run in patch 1.12 (no one really leveled in patch 1.12), the classic beta might still be correct. If that is the case, Blizzard should consider tuning the mobs damage to how it was prior to patch 1.12 as they promised us the classic experience.
---
&gt; Things that are in the client are things that Blizzard got right and pservers use as-is. You can't really credit the private servers for "getting it right" when they're using Blizzards client that contains the information and the programming.
---
That's not the point. The point was is that it already gives a starting point where you are mostly filling in blanks rather than starting with absolutely nothing. Verifying that the blanks are filled close enough within the already known correct framework is much easier than creating your framework from nothing.
---
That sounds healthy.
---
How difficult is it to understand that a warrior with leather pieces and no shield takes more damage than a shit geared tank *with* a shield? He has some more stamina, that's about it.
---
Elites scratch him from 45-55 damage, at level 30. It's so easy I need to reconsider if I can call it gaming.
---
Broken tooth won’t be op in classic. 1.12 pets are all normalized.
---
Account from 2013, fresh subbed, legion, EU.
---
Where do you get these values from? Classic winds video shows that in general damage values are very similar and higher on beta if anything. Not even talking about better AI in beta.
---
Retail, lol. Who plays that? It's sad that you can't google when you don't know what something is though.
---
Thing is, I want to join the fun in beta, but I also want to play Classic for the first time on a real character
---
Check out holy reckoning. It’s a viable burst spec in pvp that’s focused around healing and support with the ability to gib pesky rogues/warriors or use their burst against their casters.
---
Your average progression guild will be willing to overlook the 5% crit to get one of their paladins to fill the blessing of sanctuary slot, seeing as it’s not a spec most paladins want to fill anyways
---
Got the stress test option this morning. My account was made in tbc, but dropped of retail because of the sub until cata. have a few days left of active gametime on retail right now.
---
They’ve already said having  the stress test does not mean you’ve got Beta access :(
---
Is it up now? @work
---
Encumber??? Do you even know how computers work bro...
---
Its finally here!!
---
What I find interesting now is will all the "No changes" crowd suddenly change into "Mimic Pservers" - Essentially asking for change in values because they don't in fact want "No Changes" but instead to replicate the experience they have been used to for X years
---
I would be streaming a lot more if I had more than 2 viewers:P even though I stream everyday almost
---
I've got in the stresstest as well.  
---
Few notes,   
---
blue confirmed it's a limited access for the stresstest only, which will last for a day,  
---
it does not increase our chance for a full beta invite,  
---
you can only see the stresstest realm - which is offline atm,
---
I've started in TBC, so no vanilla only invites - I was subbed tho',
---
EU account
---
You are underestimating how bad the average retail wow player is it a wow bet who hasn’t played in 10-12 years
---
He's been playing since vanilla, and I only started at the end of Draenor. I don't have a real interest in the game ATM, and he is really excited for classic. So I think it's fair enough, that he will be the one to play it :)
---
good luck getting to level 5 in 2 hours and having time for anything else my dude
---
Why would you think it would be any different on live?
---
If anything, live is proving to be easier. Some bosses have ~1k more armor on pservers than classic.
---
Nothing wrong with that, it's how it actually was. But it isnt going to be harder.
---
I just got in myself. It shows when you go to the actual games tab on the left (mobile), for me it's "World of Warcraft: Legion (WoW 5) PTR".
---
world mobs damage/hp are higher on average on classic than private servers. Dungeon bosses are also hitting up to 3x harder (Verdan in WC) than private servers. Endgame might be overtuned on private servers though as far as damage/armor/hp etc goes, but it's also undertuned regarding resistance values (private servers have used a standard +15 on all bosses, while staysafe in the irvine interview was told in vanilla they had up to 200 in some cases). But the big thing is that scripting/AI will be much better on classic, which can actually increase difficulty too, like ranged mobs are actually kiting backwards to shoot you, then kiting more etc. Mobs are using more spells and using the smarter than private servers. This could mean that some raid bosses turn out to be harder on classic too, but we'll have to see.
---
That wasnt the only issue that matter. The biggest issue is, and has always been economic viability. Before Nostalrius, Blizzard simply didnt believe classic servers would be a economically feasable thing to do. Nostalrius showed them otherwise, that there is infact a huge demand for it.
---
Kiljaedens Cunning made warlock pvp so much fun! Too op unfortunately..
---
Way to bind cannibalize but not wotf
---
You are mistaken yet again. Blizz compared a single boss, not any of the trash mobs. Did you even look at the example provided?
---
Sounds good. Thank you for the info!
---
Wtf folder save all settings and add-ons settings. Wdb folder it's server cache files you can try delete the wdb files to recicle bin.
---
Well you’ll start at north shire at level 2 just due to exploration xp
---
Your math is obviously off.

---
Rogues got a complete revamp in 1.12. It was so big that they refunded every Rogue’s talent points. 
---
1.12 lasted only 3 months before 2.0.
---
So should they revert Rogues back to pre-1.12 state because they promised Rogues the true Classic experience.
---
I love how Ulduar is bigger than Northrend, it's like a Texas meme.
---
This joke is either too deep or stupid.
---
Again, you twist it to the *literal* opposite. Read the ending of your comment, and read my original post. And when did i say that it wasnt allowed? You keep arguing a damn strawman
---
As for "when" *i personally* would like the actual changes discussion to happen.. 4 weeks after the first guild has beat naxx maybe? I can be swayed in either direction? Id preferably not have the discussion *BEFORE* the damn game is out though
---
Played shaman in vanilla/tbc and all my totems were stomped 24/7. Now I'll be playing alliance lock and facing these annoying, never ending spawning tremor totems:(
---
Oh well, my fault for going against the wind..
---
Fucking Payo
---
check that thread, another guy compared to trash mobs damage in deadmines on beta to a video from original vanilla. It lined up perfectly. Keep being in denial.
---
Search vanilla flavours on YouTube funny and a good presentation of each class
---
I'm not sure what people expected, they're low level dungeons that are meant to be extremely easy.
---
If I recall correctly, DP works like SWP when it comes to Blackout. They can only proc once when casted and not on every single tick.
---
Fuck man... Everytime i hear about him i get all teary eyed... I couldn't wait getting home from school to watch his content. It makes me happy tho that people are still talking about him.   
---
I assume chinese gold sellers would like to give blizz a lot of kisses for bringing classic...it will make them rich as fuck :D
---
True , they have been super helpfull every time id had an issue . Did have one wierd encounter with a CS that was either drunk or high , was hilarious still managed to fix my issue.
---
Take 'em away toys
---
&gt; These type of guilds kill an end boss 2 months after the first guild. They really don;t care if their Nef kill is 8, 10 or 12 weeks behind the server first, as long as they make steady progress at their own speed
---
Well, there are dozens of guilds that have farmed nef 8 10 or 12 weeks at that point. The guild will not retain players long enough to do that now.
---
Oh boy... the conversation i had with my father to give me his key lasted over 2 days!!!!  
---
Fortunately i did not miss much because people did not know shit! :D. In my first session i saw a lvl24 shaman sitting in OG and i thought to myself.. holy fuck this monster is 24!!!
---
Got stress test invite, I don't really care about it as it's so limited compared to closed beta.  
---
I'm not sure about exact account make date but I did finish leveling to 60 mid-late vanilla, yet my account history shows earliest action from 2007 which is odd.
---
I've only ever enjoyed twinking BGs at 19. Probably because it was such an hilarious faceroll and nobody could do anything unless they were another twink.
---
What time will the stress test be for Europe? more specific (Sweden).
---
Man I don't have the link at work. I Googled it and was led to the EU battle.net account history and it worked with my US account.
---
No man, your post is 100% spot on. 👌🏻
---
Yes but wouldnt you specify "full clear" though? Which would give it away that its dire maul
---
Hes gonna be so sick of that song by level 30
---
it is more then 2 hours, it is 24 Hours :P
---
Not saying it to be negative but this is what we get with a 1.12 client and 1.12 itemization. 1.12 AV and fast dungeons. I still wish they'd gone with more progressive content but oh well.
---
Probably with gold.
---
Tokens :)
---
Should have sheep the lock and kill the pet.
---
You can see he's to used to retail, he uses his ice block at the last moment which is not as effective in classic, he'd better use it when the lock just put all his dot on him.
---
No bandage? No evocation? No grenade?
---
Thank you so much! Literal saint.
---
Female troll will
---
No. It's still good to bring up issues and have them double-checked.
---
&gt; Keep being in denial.
---
What does that make you, the apologist? 
---
Since I've asked twice and you haven't responded to it we'll just assume you are incapable at viewing the example provided. No, it was no possible tank RFK in that way. Which would be obvious to you if you A. watched the linked video and B. played it during vanilla. 
---
What's the goal here, you've ruined retail, now you want to make sure classic is protected from criticism? Why?
---
Did you not follow blizz for the past couple years? Look at what they did to BFA. I was expecting wow tokens and all kinds of shit. Luckily, they proved me wrong but I had very little hope.
---
Nah none at all. He’s going to need to play a female character to not be a hunchback.
---
I doubt I'll have even close to the amount of gold required until after it releases anyways. I've always been terrible at making gold. I played WoW since launch and I didnt get my epic mount until Burning Crusade
---
I think most people wish that Classic WoW is harder that it is in reality, and cling on to the idea that damage values are incorrect.
---
I personally wish that the damage is higher, but vanilla is vanilla.
---
I can see that happening. The difference is at that point Blizz can always blacklist that payment type (CC#), so the farmers have to have endless Credit Cards. 
---
They couldn't buy game time cards from a 3rd party (like Gamestop) like to get around this, either. Because at that point the card is expended then the time/account is voided by Blizz. They're only recourse would be to chargeback/refund the retailer that sold the card, and that'd never work. CC companies have a big no-no policy to refunding purchases of gift cards, etc.
---
Basically they'd need an endless supply of CC#'s, which isn't that hard I guess, but it sure is one hell of a hassle.
---
No changes was mostly to encourage blizzard to not totally fuck it up, and that seems to have worked. I'll be disappointed if  classic dungeons are easy though, I can't deny that. Should they make them harder? I don't know. Personally, I would absolutely support it, but I highly doubt they are going to do it.
---
They can Keep their fucking stress test.
---
They should ask their beloved streamers and youtubers to stress test for them.
---
Wait, doesn't that mean it'll be only up for 1 day? (24 hours)
---
Hey why don't we make a 10 minute video about respec cost decay?
---
IIRC it was common to have most players 17-19 and often nobody level 20. Sometimes you would have a 16 healer, but I think a 16 could accidently pull mobs from the walkway above on the dreadnought.
---
Yup. Finishing the starting zone with that many people is going require multiple logins throughout the week.
---
Try making him play female UD warrior. The animations are pretty over the top. He might like it. Dual wield looks good on her as well.
---
Yeah that's why I never fucked with 19.
---
Man, I'm gonna run a holy paladin (alongside a friend who's going warrior) and I WILL be rolling on the healer gear. Even if it's cloth.
---
No one knows how long phase 1 will last. May only be for nolifers to get world firsts. The logic would be, if you're a casual, DM frankly won't hurt you.
---
Since no BGs will be open, I'd save those 1k if I were you.
---
You expect alarmists to actually read the email?
---
A streamer got two-shotted by him and reported it as a bug.
---
Not really. Everyone is on the same exact path for a while if you go Orc/Troll. It doesn't really start to spread out until you hit the barrens quests.
---
I've posted evidence that classic beta damage values are currently identical to what they were in vanilla. If you wanna keep denying hard evidence that is up to you.
---
Professions my man, even lazy professions like enchanting and skinning will you net you some solid gold output and you can passively level them as you farm exp
---
Gather enough rare recipes as an enchanter and you can charge up to 50g (more realistically 5-25g) tips
---
Different Dev team. If you only follow wow, sure.  But Hearthstone and Overwatch are completely different stories with Jeff Kaplan and Ben Brode. People overreact because Blizzard has like 1 really bad dev team.
---
You dont even need it to do more tps than warrior.
---
The best would be if big streamers would come to agreement where to play on the same server on opposite sides so this would balance the fractions. The rest is just normal PvP - you gank, you get ganked. It is classic.
---
Like the last youtube battle between Asm and the other youtuber.
---
You are not supposed to, however this is indeed the case in classic.
---
You think you do but you don't
---
Soda would destroy him in BFA as well..
---
Bullshit idea.
---
Your example you have edited in was for SFK not deadmines as you originally claimed. Similarly it is not the example of RFK I provided which you **still** apparently haven't watched.
---

Here, now stop being a fucking wankstain.
---
Stop crying.
---
Will anybody please bring me up to speed? Wow classic will launch somewhere in August, right? There is currently a Vanilla Beta you it's invitation only. Will there be an open beta and if so, when?
---
I accidentally bought a sub when beta got announced on the wrong account that was created this year, has the base game &amp; no expansions, got the stress set invite email 3 hours ago
---
TIL there are masochistic gamers.
---
I'm embarassed to say but during Vanilla I was 13 so at level 60 my professions were at like.. 30. So hopefully this time I won't be so bad.
---
Congrats bro!
---
Stresstest and beta is only for those who live in the US right?
---
Tnx
---
👌🏻
---
i've watched that, wtf is that supposed to show me rofl? do you actually have downs?
---
https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427272471?t=1h27m
---
Hey, if you want to keep dodging evidence to the contrary that's on you.
---
What time did the email come in? You're na? Grats
---
Pretty sure absolute maximum mitigation through armor was 70%
---
Not playing classic beta but I am pretty sure people already know how to do proper shit by now, even in privates WC and DM runs go very smoothly as opposed in early days where a three or four wipes were the norm
---
Yet flying mounts were not a good addition to the game and even Blizzard has recognized this. Hell, LFD didn't seem so bad at the time because you just wanted to get in and do a dungeon real quick not bother with scrounging around for people to run it with but there are always consequences with any change you make. I agree, in the moment flying mounts felt great but obviously the addition of them had negative consequences.
---
Brah all PvE is easy in every tab targeting MMO
---
It's all about the PvP
---
If you like PvE you're not gonna like classic. It's about 15 years behind raid design as you'd expect.
---
0/10
---
Classic Winds is doing the boars-only all the way to 60. But probably not with the song.
---
Hey i just got in too ! Are you sure ils only for thé stress test period ?
---
Nice. Lol I can't find any of my vanilla videos on YouTube anymore.
---
A seperate server my dude.. not asking for them to change the regular classic servers.
---
Okay, so either you have no idea what is taking place in that video, you haven't watched it, or you never did RFK during vanilla.
---
I have been wasting my time speaking with someone completely ignorant or incompetent.
---
For the alliance!
---
I'm jelly I want to play so bad :(
---
marginally harder, not 10x harder
---
Yeah, the difference in difficulty seems to be caused more by better AI and mob abilities than raw stats.
---
Wait why is the worgen with the horde races
---
I would upvote but we don't yet know the bosses armor/resistances in Classic for sure.
---
Same, although i am going to try and get the complete set, i fear that MC will simply be on farm so fast that it wont be worth getting the set stats wise.
---
It's like the polar opposite of retail. Instead of casualising the game you make it super duper hardcore.
---
how is 1s23c gonna buy me a goddamn pool m8
---
Grats, Did you have classic installed already?
---
&gt; remembering how awesome it was to truly progress towards even the simplest goal.
---
This is my main draw.    
---
Every item FEELS like an upgrade and not just a bigger number. You notice the spike in DPS or the jump in survivability.    
---
Some mobs hit like trucks even when they are lower level than you so everything is dangerous.     
---
Even if it's mostly "kill x" or "gather y" quests some are hard enough to feel like real proper challenges.    
---
      
---
And you're never truly the one big damn hero in the story.
---
Well you and like the five others who would like this can just delete your gear when you die in pvp, or just delete your character. Problem solved and no need to waste development resources catering to the handful of people who like to punch themselves in the balls for fun.
---
You get a email and will be above the PTR WoW
---
please explain it to me what is happening in that video? it looks like a group killing some elites in RFK
---
And who is tanking, Timmy?
---
PWNED
---
WTF ist this ? this is not a Keyboard, its a freaking Monster out of Wailing Cavberns
---
I'm still using the same Youtube account and don't have many videos on it. I didn't make many, since as you can tell I never really got good at it. It still makes me chuckle and takes me back though, so I thought I'd share.
---
WORLD FIRST WOW CLASSIC BETA STRESS TEST FISHING MASTER
---
*facepalm*
---
Its an entire day my dude not two hours.
---
monkeynews is! a warrior :)
---
Just came here to say ‘leedle’ to you.
---
That's true. I do think it is a safe bet that bosses wont be significantly harder.
---
And it's also a safe bet that bosses are FAR easier than current mythic raiding. So to expect anything other than extremely fast clear of the raids as they come out is a little naive imo.
---
As a proud member of the alliance I can’t wait to once again get one shot by a flag carrying enhancement shaman wielding the unstoppable force.
---
Iirc the boats are under that zone to the west of the barrens, stone claw? Stone talon?
---
The biggest barrier to big pulls, and the reason we relied so heavily on CC, back in vanilla wasn't incoming damage and tank survivability. It was threat and aggro. When I think back to vanilla wipes I remember adds and non-CC'd mobs swarming the healers and DPS, and the tank always died last.
---
The big difference now is that multi-mob tanking is a much more well-understood skill with tab-sundering, threat meter add-ons are prevalent, and DPS and healers know much better how not to pull aggro off tanks.

Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23

Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20  
---
Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18– Fri July 19
---
Good so far! 
---
And what stance are they in? Do they have a shield out? And lastly, most importantly, was it possible to tank RFK in this way during vanilla?
---
Got in! Sadly the times the game is playable won't fit my schedule.
---
Fingers crossed after the stresstest there will be a huge beta invite wave!
---
Hi, /u/nidyy
---
Have a nice week!
---
Love seeing this thread being posted 5x hour. Op are you an idiot?
---
Idk if i even want to play the stress test to be honest. level 5 really....
---
Oddly Enough I never received an email, yet I'm able to download the client. I just happened to check my launcher for the hundredth time today.
---
Yeah. Lol I made a undead Korn coming undone video and a video soloing feel reaver by kiting. This was in bc but no luck finding them
---
Vanilla wow never had a stress test
---
/#nochanges
---
They will be actively monitoring / paying attention to the stress test in the first 2 hours (4-6 PST I believe ? ), but you can continue to play afterwards
---
nope, all good for me
---
I really hope for at least one RP-PvP server in each region
---
Stopped reading at the "shadow priests are bottom of the barrel, no decent premade would even consider you", obvious trolling:(
---
No there isnt. There has been chat that the devs are "open to suggestion" on releasing new content. But this doesnt mean raising the level cap.
---
Yeah you probably should tbh.
---
Nope, attack speed is not normalized.
---
No, that I’m not what I suggested. I suggested only to tune the damage of mobs so that we can get the classic experience they promised.
---
Polar opposite while introducing what retail is, affixes
---
yucky.
---
Craft a wand and dominate those filthy defias.
---
Kill hogger!
---
I think it had way more to do with people being very very bad at the game in the early patches, everyone was noobs and didn't even understand the concept of an mmo, except a small minority coming over from games like everquest. The patches from 1.1 &gt; 1.12 also didn't really nerf low lvl dungeons much, the upgraded gear from later patches only mattered at endgame, and the new talent trees were hardly a big boost at lvl ~20 when people only have 10 points.
---
Are these (or their upgraded counterparts) the "Best in slot" option for people who are never going to bother raiding?
---
i miss TB so much ...but old gamers getting old anyway ! 
---
RIP OG TB &lt;3 :\_(
---
Awesome! Thanks for taking the time to write this!
---
He should find some new mobs to compare as those duskwood worgens are fucking insane.
---
Pulling more than one without CC was certain death.
---
So its  a bug?
---
What development resources? From retail?
---
Also, it's not the same if it's just me following the ruleset. That's like saying they should just add a dungeon finder and if you don't like it dont use it.

---
I don't think this will be "good" for wow, but take my upvote for the effort
---
I think there was an eye patch from UBRS(?) that was great for warriors, and the eye patch was not plate.. that was for sure.
---
It's a joke, dude.
---
Why not?
---
No ones going to artificially handicap themselves
---
Guys, I forget: did these come out with the original release or did they come along in post-release patches?
---
Haha, I knew you was going there. Do you know that on the private servers which are supposedly tuned harder than classic, the warriors are tanking raids while dual wielding, in fury spec? They are tanking naxx like that. Without a shield. Yes my dude, tanking RFK like this was possible in vanilla hahahahahah. I remember 3 manning ramtusk in RFK without a proper tank for the corpsemaker haha.
---
Nah verdan is doing about the same damage on private server, and all the dungeon trash are hitting for twice as much on pservers
---
Launch date is August 26, 6 PM Eastern for the US.  About half of the world is ahead of the US in time, so it's August 27 for them. https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/template_resource/PYV9W9Y8ZDNR1557767427825.jpg
---
Current Beta is Closed, yes.  I don't think you receive an email if you're invited, but I'm not sure.  It'll show up as an option in the Region/Account menu in the Battle.net launcher for WoW.
---
Today (Wednesday) there will be a Stress Test at 7-9 PM Eastern, and the realm will remain open until Thursday around 9 PM Eastern. https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t//178282/1
---
Many people are being invited for this because, well, that's what a stress test is.  This is *separate* from the Closed Beta.  https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t//178282/342
---
There has been no info or hints of any kind about an open beta.  I personally doubt there'll be one, or if there is one, I'm guessing it would happen with the end of July, but that is only my personal opinion not based off anything Blizzard has said.
---
no, we need a new thread every single time. Just like we need a new thread every single time a twitch streamer breathes on camera
---
Who is claiming that private servers are 100% more accurate?
---
The point is that they have reverse-engineered the game based on the best data available, and not just pulled everything out of their ass.
---
And this video clearly shows that their version has been pretty dam close, being off with one damage.
---
I agree, but I'm quite sure in Europe we had a somewhat higher average download speed at the time. I know I had 2Mbit since 2000 (well I trialled 2Mbit ADSL in 1999, but general release was 2000).
---
So, for the Europe region at least the download should be a bit faster.
---
We dont use pm or am
---
They might've hotfixed verdans damage the last days on private servers, but before beta he was hitting for 50-100 damage. About 3x less than on beta. Last boss in RFK is also tougher on classic beta than private servers. The dungeon elites may hit harder on private servers, but i've seen zero proof of that so far, and there is hard evidence that world mobs at least are tougher on classic beta than private servers.
---
you called me a carebear, it's like 2005 all over again. /golfclap
---
I played Wow from day 1, i had max level toons on pve and pvp servers. PVP, 99% of the time, was a rogue backstabbing you when you were on a minion and on low health OR it was just a big group 5 manning you. Good fights were very few and far between. 
---
I'm just letting people know how it is.
---
When i say badly balanced, that's not up for dispute. Some classes were incredible (see warriors). That isnt a bad thing as each class felt unique, but balanced it was not.
---
I got into the stress test and am from the EU - as the test is middle of the night for us i was going to skip it. However, do you think skipping it will reduce the chance of a beta invite? If it will increase my chances to stay up all night i will!
---
Better yet, just glue one hand to your forehead. Difficulty increased!
---
I usualy mess up timezone conversions, but if I got it right its 22:00 CEST
---
Sounds like fun, if they made 1 server I wouldn't touch it without a dedicated 5 man at least to start out with. 1000 gold to secure an item would be far too much for a server like that because there wouldn't be nearly enough normies producing gold.
---
Not sure if it is legit here, google "project ascension".
---
I am using the stresstest to set up my interface settings and chat and unitframes layout so come launch I can use these settings on my characters!
---
That's hilarious, what a guy.
---
You can learn all apprentice trade skills at level 5. The first wand crafted by enchanting also has a minimum requirement of level 5.
---
Coincidence? **I THINK NOT!**
---
I remember having a conversation like this except I was the girl on the left and my ex-girlfriend was the guy on the right ... and it was about PvPing in BGs. I will never ever go into a BG without a pre-made carry or a Shaman party member.
---
&gt; XP loss on death 
---
I played a few MMO's with this mechanic, it ends up being even slower than normal leveling. You end up even more unlikely to group up or do dungeons because a dungeon wipe is depending on other people, not just ur own skill
---
&gt; Gear loss on death 
---
Imagine being a sudle little shadow priest in STV and out of nowhere comes a rogue, 2 shoots you because he is 5 level higher and takes all you stuff, the griefing would be awful
---
&gt; Raid bosses and trash will have extra mechanics and affixes along with possibly boosted health, armor, and/or resistances. 
---
Sounds like mythic + which would be cool IMO but we got retail for that 
---
Something taking longer is not the same as making in harder
---
An across-the-board damage nerf to all mobs would have been in patch notes or on forums. Seems nobody ever mentioned this.
---
So it's doubtful it happened at all, but even if it did, I'll quote from the devs:
---
&gt; After careful consideration, we decided on Patch 1.12: Drums of War as our foundation, because **it represents the most complete version of the classic experience.**
---
works fine for me
---
Got a invite as well, am from EU, no mail but checked the client.
---
Also running Linux so nice to be able to test how that performs!
---
Are you guys with optus?
---
One shot? The other player is about 60% health when he "one shots" him.
---
Still cool though and I'm standing between playing shaman or rogue.
---
&gt;Haha, I knew you was going there.
---
I've been saying the same thing since the very first comment, if you're just now getting here you've just outed yourself as being super retard baby slow.
---
&gt;They are tanking naxx like that.
---
Okay, that's a positive assertion and I'll give you a shot here. Go ahead a post a video of someone tanking Naxx while dual wielding. 
---
&gt;I remember 3 manning ramtusk in RFK without a proper tank
---
If you did this at all, one of you most certainly was much higher level. The clips provided were at level and I worry about your capacity for understanding at this point.
---
I am now reasonably certain you never played during vanilla, much less tanked anything ever. Too slow to be depended upon holding aggro.
---
I am suprised that noone startet a rant about why they changed the Log text from "Rhahk'Zor hits you for xx." to "Rhahk'Zor melee hit You xx physical." Because its not the authentic vanilla feeling we get WHEN WE CHANGE THIS TEXT !
---
If the stress test server can’t handle lag, no way the actual beta server can’t. They have to test it some way. Maybe they’ll let those who get into stress test later play beta.
---
And heroic strike.
---
You shouldn't regret  that decision  it was for the 39 other people as well. For the first time kill but you can bring that person  back for everything  else and since you got the kill without him you can bring him back the next week so he can try again.
---
for the good of the raid.
---
I did but it's scheduled for 1 hour after I start work. Grrrrrrrrrr
---
Unless you have a 24+ hr shift, you’ll have plenty of time to play since the stress test is Wednesday but the servers will remain up until thursday
---
Was your in-game ignore list full? :O
---
Cuz every weapon is a hunter's weapon? I've also seen buffcapped video where TF melee hunter pulled 1k DPS :D Personal private server ofc.
---
What are you on about lmfao? Of course you could play without the expansions.
---
lol. I am imagining a hunter with a tiny orc warrior as a pet.
---
Thing is high level char likely have more armor than the lvl 20 tank.
---
Having played FFXIV with a controller since day 1 thinking it would be a joke and now still playing with a controller and realizing I play much BETTER with one, I would be very interested in this.
---
The problem is that everything in FFXIV is designed for a controller, but that's not the case in WoW.  The biggest issue with making WoW controller-friendly is clickable objects, and this is a huge issue because of how much of WoW involves this.  Because you can't target them (which is how FFXIV does it) and can only click on them, I really don't understand how that addon makes it work, or does it at all?
---
I would say that AoE targeting is also a big issue, but I saw they added @target (and @cursor, but that's mostly irrelevant to controller) in macros for those spells in 7.1, which is awesome and only about 10 years overdue. :P
---
1AM Thursday to 3AM Friday is how long the servers will be up
---
[Insert Franchinse] MMObile.
---
I have one better, got the invite but for some reason my ISP is having issues connecting to battle net Haha
---
Quick tip: Use ~ ~ to strikethrough text when confronted with evidence of the contrary
---
2h fury warrs are very stronk in vanilla. 
---
Fury + BRE = great times.
---
I hope he feels better soon
---
Yeah, pretty sure the emails are fake, it just shows up in the launcher if you get in.
---

there you go, now please do yourself a favor, don't emberass yourself anymore.
---
Made my account in early Legion, I've primarily kept my sub, but let it drop for a few weeks here, and there. Haven't gotten a beta invite, but I am able to download the stress test client. So I guess I'm in? Was playing StarCraft II on my other account a few hours ago when I swapped accounts, and noticed I could download the client.
---
&gt;XP loss on death
---
&gt;Gear loss on death
---
&gt;Raid bosses and trash will have extra mechanics and affixes along with possibly boosted health, armor, and/or resistances.
---
Sounds like mythic + which would be cool IMO but we got retail for that
---
&gt; Possibly less xp gain for a longer grind. 
---
&gt; No DHKs 
---
It's one of the mechanics which needs the most re-thinking. But just removal won't fix the issue. I got no better idea btw.
---
PS: I totally see the appeal of all these mechanics! But classic was not about difficulty it was about the journey and the meta game around it, like keeping 40 people happy to log in every week for a raid night. If you have a different opinion, feel free to tell me!
---
Going to a different zone doesn't increase the rate at which you accumulate fishing skill. Every body of water yields the same chance to skill up.
---
at what point does this happen to you? i find by the time i hit 40+ the idea of rerolling is long gone
---
My theory is that I have never been and never will be invited to a beta because my account has been flagged because I have been suspended for 24hours in the past in WoW.
---
Ok so here is the deal you only need 20 points holy to heal raids. Sure the 5% critt is nice but it really isn't the end of the world. After mana refund on crits that is the only good talent in the holy tree. You can easily raid as 20/31/0 this will give you all the needed talents to try tanking in 5 man. There is never any reason to spec into holy shock. And only one pala in raid need improved wisdom longer lasting judgements of light is totally unnecessary and the 100%crit next heal is not worth it
---
Actually the point of classic is to restore **AUTHENTIC VALUES**. Difficulty be damned. We asked for Vanilla as it was, not some modified version to make it hard. If the **AUTHENTIC VALUES** are easy by 2019 standards, then so be it. I want the real deal, "warts and all."
---
Hi, /u/El_Dief
---
I'm not saying you won't have a chance at getting it. It'll just go to other classes first. The +86 AP is actually really solid for hunters.
---
I got it but it's scheduled for 1 hour after I start work.
---
 Weekends. Need to schedule stuff on weekends Bliz
---
I got in aswell https://i.imgur.com/GkVrZuN.jpg, but i didnt get an email.
---
The option was just available when i checked my launcher.
---
Back during classic i was still in school! Now i have to work 8 hours a day! Please fix!
---
I didn't  :(
---
Yup got mine here in the EU.  Will need a nap in the afternoon as it's a midnight startup lol
---
and nobody cried
---
Stress test doesn't start till  Midnight for me but I'm gonna stay up and do it anyway, should be fun seeing that many people crammed into Elwynn Forest or Durotar lol
---
Ill put my friends email in :3
---
So Europe (GMT+2)  will be able to play from Thursday at 01:00?
---
Can someone confirm if I am right or wrong. 4 pm PDT is 1 am CEST?
---
Thats me! 3 mins ago!
---
I have 2 laptops from around 2006-2008 that could try it with if I had beta access. I used one of those laptops to play on a private server for about a year back in 2013ish.
---
I got into the stress test and my first WoW was BFA, but even I know that vanilla was the best so I'm looking forward to it :)
---
What development resources? You mean the ones needed to develop the mechanics to allow you to flagellate yourselves like this?
---
Haha, a classic
---
It is close to impossible to win mage vs warlock if both players don't make mistakes.
---
Technically all hunters are utility specs. Literally invited just for kiting, Tranq, and True Shot Aura. ;)
---
Same here, but just for the Stress test :(
---
Two-shot, really, but still amazing.
---
Hey !
---
Theres an addon called DialogKey which allows you to bind things like Accepting Quests and NPC Conversations  to keys, it works in the beta.
---
With that you can do almost everything with just the keyboard, i dont know how you map camera movements to the analog stick tho.
---
Okay I'll give you that one. I wasn't familar with it, which is why I asked for proof.
---
Now outside of an incredibly niche example of needing more aggro gen than tankiness in a raid setting with extremely geared characters and especially healers, your argument falls appart.
---
Now, find me a video of someone in classic tanking RFK at level like this and you'll have a point.
---
It's bad for me aswell. I'm with AussieBroadband. Blizzard website and launcher information fails to load,  but ping in game is unaffected. Must be some routing issue
---
"good" ? It's severely gimped compared to a pvp fury spec or a run of the mill arms spec. It can work for casual pvp, you're missing rage retention, crit dmg, open wounds, the extremely important imp overpower.
---
With Enchanting + Tailoring you can craft a Lesser Magic Wand using \~50 Linen Cloth
---
We had an open beta though.
---
U can check out markymark on YT..he has nice guides for every class
---
Topic was the best class for the worst players. This alone should tell you that this person will not be in a competent guild. Suggesting that he should play priest in such a setting over paladin is just wrong. Paladin is so easy to play that in any setting you could basically watch porn at the same time as playing and no one would notice the difference.
---
Only thing to add are Hunters. They are good for the typical solo content and got good dps in early progression but fall off later. They don't scale with gear that much. Am I right?
---
Thank you! I will check him out
---
I have a feeling Asmongold will cave and go PvE. If you watched that stream, he got extremely fucking pissed while everyone else was having fun. He’s pretty garbage at PvP and he only enjoys it if he wins.
---
so you think it's possible to tank naxx without a shield, but RFK is just too darn difficult? bro i'm sorry, i'm done arguing with you, you have all the evidence you need to see that classic beta has the correct damage values
---
Nobody in this thread seems to care that you think 1 day is 30 hours.
---
I don't know if you can't read or what
---
But they're all that easy
---
The stress test if 2 hours but you are allowed to play the game for 22 hours after that
---
Disgusting indeed...yikes..
---
I guess these popular streamers play games from their homes (ergo never leaving home...) 12h+ per day, they become less and less compatible with wider social norms. Just my little stupid hypothesis lol
---
It's funny because full beta accounts atm now are going for 400-1000 lol
---
&gt;The World of Warcraft Classic Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test. Once the stress test period is over, you’ll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Friday, 24 May.
---
That's from the email they sent me. I don't have other beta access, only the stress test invite. Hopefully you will find some time to get on by Friday :)
---
I'm in love with your drawings. Please, never stop.

here you go!
---
Dont log out of battle net you wont be able to log back in
---
awful, either go all in with your role or don't bother
---
Created my account feb 2005 and nothing so dno about people saying that old accounts are likely to be flagged
---
This is high quality content! That's why I am subbed here
---
That was not the question.
---
That would be 0,0 in Kalimdor. Alterac/Hillbrad would be 0,0 in EK.
---
It's actually *less* demanding than the original Vanilla 1.12 client. It runs on the modern WoW graphics engine (with all it's improvements) with the same art assets (models, textures, etc.) which are very light weight by today's standards.
---
The caveat is that it runs better only if your computer actually runs it. :) Extremely old hardware might not work.
---
See also: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CGQ8w46JOL4
---
I agree with your point, but I think these people are talking a bit more than 4 hours a day.
---
Ahh yes, I too have *decided* to be single.
---
&gt; Honestly though, there’s a reason why MMOs that had mechanics like this weren’t very successful.
---
It may not be your cup of tea and they may not have been as big as WoW at its peak, but most MMOs used to be like this.
---
For example, Ultima Online was the first big MMO and was huge for its time, and had full player looting in PvP. Someone who spent hours farming could get killed and lose not only all that work, but everything else they had on them. Even later games like Lineage II that were more casual than a game like UO were much more hardcore in many ways than Everquest and WoW.
---
There's still a sizeable niche that's into MMOs of that style, but they have even less options than those of us looking forward to Classic WoW.
---
Why? There is no extra damage resistance bonus vs low level mobs. The only difference is critical chance and crushing blows.
---
This is such a strawman. Because private server popularity made Classic WoW happen, suddenly these servers are unquestionable 100% accurate recreations of the game? Nobody is dismissing people just for having played private servers, they're dismissing them for thinking that Nostalrius devs can more reliably make World of Warcraft than Blizzard can. Because people are claiming that "Because X was like this on Nostalrius, Classic must be wrong" without ever questioning that maybe Nostalrius was wrong.
---
Regardless of how you feel about private server accuracy, your whole post is pointless and irrelevant.
---
of course they will.   they fish in a different pool of players, the casuals.  You seem to deny that real casual raiding guilds will exist.
---
Project ascension is free for all and it's skill system is completely different. I did try it but it doesn't really hit all the nails on the head.
---
Thanks for the suggestion, though.
---
Me too!!! Just now!!!
---
That keyboard is the Classic experience my friend. This game sucked most people in for 12+ hours a day, without streams!
---
The dungeons in Mop were the worst ones in the game imo. Raids were decent tho.
---
It's meant to be a huge barrier. There shouldn't be s bunch of people running around with unlootable gear. Just the special pieces like a legendary or something.
---
Found the guy without a phone. :-)
---
Actually working to upgrade your gear through an epic quest chain is going to be fun. FFXIV's relic weapons were definitely fun to make imo, at least the first 2 expansions, not so much this latest one.
---
If you don't think Blizzard with a reference client can do it accurately, then how on earth would some random dudes making a private server get it anywhere close?
---
Yeah but where would I be pulling those resources from?
---
nice try, but I live in the netherlands, my university had a 10mbit network back in 1997....
---
Erm, there are a number of differences in those situations, namely the amount of geared healers and the boss fight in question. 
---
If you had actually played or tanked RFK during vanilla you would know the clip above is hardly reflective of vanilla's values.
---
I get it, I do, it must apparently be very rewarding to suck blizzard off to such an extent, but everyone who's seen that clip that played during vanilla has said the same thing, "it seems off," the streamer included. Why make a hobby of white knighting for blizzard? You have been bending over backwards to say "nope nothing could possibly be wrong." Why?
---
Of course not everyone with an old account is getting in. You just got unlucky.
---
I got my vanilla account back a few months ago. I emailed them my name my Id and info about my account. Took a few hours and they added into mine lol
---
Also, not to forget Asmongold was in Defensive stance, vs Berskers stance here.
---
I am 100% basing my opinions of evidence, not feelings or memories.
---
Have to bloody work tho 😀, might pull an all nighter, even though it's only till level 5
---
\#NOCHANGES!!!
---
There are trinkets and consumes +gear to get any upper hand. When you say unbalanced, i feel like you are just not trying. Carry some potions for whatever is ganking you. Now you have balanced. Free action potion. Living action potion, limited invulnerability pots, greater prot pots, get engineering and put some effort into what you carry.
---
Sounds like you were just a rogue that opens with backstab on low levels, choose fights in your favour. Saying that's how it is. Pretty sad cause it's just simply way more to it and way more fun in world pvp.
---
Ahh cool, i don't have an email, but my client lists the stresstest, so i didn't know that.
---
Will definitely try i then :)
---
That's my plan as Paladin. Tank 5mans and maybe raid trash, but put on my devout shoulders for raid bosses.
---
Halfway through MoP I was maining three different 90 rogues and playing monk/druid/warrior lvl90 alts. Yes, altaholism is a concern for me.
---
What a stupid name for a baby.. summer..
---
Okay I'm unaware of the evidence for this, but you've again made a positive assertion, please link the video of someone tanking RFK in vanilla at level in this way that you are basing your opinion on.
---
Hwo do you tell id you did ore not?
---
No EU as well.
---
IMO quite decent. As long as you keep in mind that fury (and this under-fury especially) isn't that good for PvP and have some tank gear to make up for the missing mitigation talents.
---
got invited for the stress test and never got the download :/
---
I have Beta access since yesterday. Did start in 2005 and played into BC and stopped after that. Resubscribed last week and subbed for beta access on the same day. Playing on a 2013 MBP on EU. Have not upgraded to BfA.
---
4PM PDT happens when this comment is 14 hours and 29 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/yzM1vAO1b
---
No i am EU
---
You still need sub for it right?
---
I still have my original Bradygames guide with the Horde cover. It was obsolete the week after I bought it. They redid paladin judgement system.
---
Woke up to find it on my drop down menu as "Beta and Stress Test: WoW Classic".  Downloaded and installed and it has single PvP server for the test
---
No wonder eastern kingdoms is the creme de la creme and kalimdor aint.
---
Worst part of playing Classic 15 years later: There's no way in hell I can stay up til midnight++ on a weekday and not feel hungover the next day
---
Or any time someone in this sub complains about streamers
---
My same thought. We are no longer the teenagers as we all have full time jobs and families so paying for gold will be massive this time around I think
---
I'm getting a laptop and want to play WoW Classic on the go. Any recommendations?
---
&gt; bro i'm sorry, i'm done arguing with you, you have all the evidence you need to see that classic beta has the correct damage values
---
It's lightweight and has a gif functionality and saves all of my shit on their servers. Pretty nifty
---
It sucks for EU players that the stress test is so late.
---
I saw a similar post on the Beta forum with a Blue response.

Never experienced classic, even more reason to play it!
---
also only level 30
---
level 60
---
also engineering you can use a shadow  reflect trinket, stun granade them, and potions  to burst and control a lock. if the warlock gets any momentum you are screwed.  I might  be incorrect on this, just what I remember.
---
Live to win brother!
---
Does anyone know if those players being given beta access for the stress test have  had their launcher updated/been informed?
---
We got it mate
---
Can you point to a single successful example from a modern pserver then?
---
I've only ever twinked at 19 which was a lot of fun. What makes the 39 bracket different?
---
You're wrong and now you're mad
---
Mines updated yeah
---
&gt; it doesn't look easier than private servers most of the time.
---
I have tested level 1-13 UD WL on a prominent private server 6 times over the past few weeks. I know Tirisfal pretty well by now.
---
Got my beta invite 2 days ago. Classic mobs hit harder and are more durable. It took me about 15% longer in classic to get to level 11 and I actually died once (died 0 times the last 3 private server runs).
---
I'd say classic is harder than the private server I tested on.
---
Well. We could always recreate Tseric here in reddit. Any volunteers?
---
Just woke up to see my Launcher display the Stresstest.
---
EU player, so it's going to be a nightshift to get my fix :D
---
Account Creation is Oct. 2005 btw

In some of his interviews about Overwatch, he's yalked about how much he loved 90s pc shooters. He was big on quake, the original team fortress, and counter strike. One of the first characters he made was pharah, because he badly wanted rocket jumping in the game.
---
What I'm saying here is that he isn't explicitly an MMO guy, he just loves gaming.
---
&gt;When I used to raid we only had one Druid in our raid, and that guy was the first to get fully kitted in tier gear
---
Lets not forget what comes with that too. You are buffing a 40 man raid solo with motw, tanks with thorns... When anyone dies, its up to you to buff them. Not as bad as buffing as a priest (almost 1/3 of mana cost), but still...
---
Aside from armour and avoidance, level would make no difference. He takes the same kind of damage - he just has more HP, so it will kill him slower
---
I wasnt aware tracking herbs showed in your buffs, has it always been that way?
---
Right, so there is no video, you are basing your opinion not on any evidence out there, but rather on the feeling that you don't want blizzard to be wrong. Noted.
---
I am however going to base what I think on evidence, and I'm more than happy to admit I was wrong and eat all the crow that comes with it... all you have to do is link a video of someone tanking RFK at level in the same way as the clip above.
---
Yes, invites have been going out. I was given access last night. My launcher updated with dropdown and on login I can see [https://imgur.com/Xoa8rZx](https://imgur.com/Xoa8rZx) so I'm not a beta player but a stress tester.
---
who is this little fapgoblin
---
I've done it 3 times in BFA so far. Started with a priest, then a DK, a hunter and currently I'm playing a Druid. All of them are at 120 and the only one I've managed to reach any real endgame with is my current Druid. I have a bunch of 100s and 110s that got left behind as well. I'm really hoping with classic being a lot longer of a process to level I can keep to one character and enjoy it enough to not even want to swap.
---
Priceless, award this person Beta access ;)
---
&gt;isclassicoutyet
---
do you prefer this site?
---
Ah shit. I’m on a real bad luck train with classic lol - launch date is a day after my 3 week PTO ends and I’ve still not got an beta invite despite having an active sub since 2005 - it wouldn’t be as much of a kick in the balls if I hadn’t been so hyped since the announcement
---
One thing that is very important to know is not to use taunt right away. The mechanic of it will put you at the top of the threat list for that mob. It can also be resisted.
---
Usually I will not use it till a mob targets another player, and try to keep threat with agro producing abilities.
---
A simple example would be a mage shoots a pyro at a mob, or a hunter aimshot for a bunch of dmg. Once you taunt that you gain all that threat+ you have can start using high agro abilities to put you even further up on threat.
---
Also some mobs and bosses are immune to taunt. Typically at higher level
---
unless the email i got is lying to me, the stress test is 4-6pm pdt
---
In fact they have just responded directly to a video by asmongold regarding the supposedly low damage numbers.
---
Gives me lots of hope
---
Dirty elf!
---
6pm PDT happens when this comment is 16 hours and 19 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/hFcoGyimm
---
Awesome, my daughter is only 1,5 so no wow yet for her, might get my girlfriend into it, let's hope hahaha, but dude enjoy your wow family time, sounds wicked.
---
This is a good point. It counts down to 00:00 on the 27th August for the users viewing the page - which may actually be after or before the game is out for people. I will double check this and push a fix if this is the case :). Thanks.
---
OH FUCK... Its the very hungry caterpillar. We're DOOMED!
---
Coo good feedback :)
---
I never got a email but i can get into the test
---
I'm on the same boat.
---
YOU'RE NOT PREPARED
---
....Does it seem to you like I don't know what he's saying? 
---
It's a TERRIBLE SPEC
---
And no you only need to drop holy shock for sanctuary, and reckoning isn't a talent ur gonna be able to hide from a guild for long. Some one is gonna notice that real quick.
---
Anything is "viable"
---
No where near optimal or rational. Get way more use out of holy shock. . . 
---
Source: I actually have pvp'd on this patch
---
But all the other people won't throttle their speed and that isn't the way classic is meant to be played and they take away my **FUN** and **IMMERSION** and will quit after 1 day anyways so theres that
---
I loved it when H was added. It was a more fun raid than R.
---
Awesome 😀
---
EU.
---
I went to sleep 7 hours before this comment (roughly 3:30am GMT+1) with NO stress test invite. This was hours after the first waves.
---
Woke up today at 10am and had it on my launcher 😇😇😇 I really thought I was going to get passed over
---
2007 account fwiw
---
Vanilla has multiple axis of allegiance.
---
Alliance vs Horde
---
DM vs VC
---
I see that /s in the end, very sneaky
---
Yes it is... between 1am and 3am, very bad for a stress test if you ask me !
---
Funny I never died to a warrior, easiest class to kill as a hunter
---
Das macht absolut keinen Sinn.
---
Not bad just the hardest class to play.
---
Fasting is faster !
---
On a RP server :D
---
Uh, make the game a little more difficult? Like private servers did. Seemed to work out well.
---
Too bad a bunch of retards that only know the words ‘no’ and ‘changes’ will prevent that from ever happening.
---
Don’t go to work, play Classic beta.
---
We absolutely must get a few 40-60 people groups to raid Orgrimmar.  
---
Requirements:  
---
5 lvl, all white equipment.  
---
Consumables (Bread, water for mages).  
---
Questions:  
---
How to get to orgrimmar on level 5 in vanilla?  
---
What's the best level 5 gear for a warrior?  
---
We'll have 26 hours to do this, boys.
---
Nah fam you could go boomkin
---
It's just [https://www.firesofheaven.org/](https://www.firesofheaven.org/) again, it's being ran slightly better for the 99th time around. But I agree moving forums every 3 years is silly as shit
---
I found an addon to remove that shit back in the days if I recall. Shit sucked ass
---
Its ok for me to play at the morning.
---
I didn’t have access when I went to sleep last night (~6-7hrs ago) but it was right there on my launcher when I woke. No email.
---
Yes...that's exactly what a stress test is. What's the problem?
---
The character in question is 4 levels higher and doesnt have a shield equipped, he will have the same, if not less than a level 18 warrior with a shield and defensive stance.
---
Even back on nost he was hitting as much as on classic
---
do what you love.  I personally never saw the appeal to stunt a character's growth like that, but I understand.
---
Try IPv6
---
Actually, the manual of health has a panda head on it, and Illidan also has panda heads on his glaives. This was before the expansion so it has been a running joke even before Chen.
---
Tnx :)
---
Was on Burning Legion - EU.
---
And to add, they may have played in Classic, but after that playing on private servers. Memories can merge very easily, especially old ones. You may have been trucked by some mob in a Private server 8 years ago on your warrior, then misremembered that as your warrior you had in classic being trucked by that mob.
---
Hell, for a while I thought I had a level 35 hunter and that's about how far I got in classic. Turns out that was wrong, that was a Blood Elf, the only character I got leveled decently in classic through all the deletions cause I just didn't like them was a Warrior who made it to RFD and got Corpsemaker (and started my obsession with that ax). And no, I don't remember Hilin the Tauren's level, just that he had the ax, nor why I named him that.
---
nah, on ely/LB/Ndale he is hitting like a wet noodle. There is a reason tips and his whole group was sure he was bugged
---
Graphics are usually the bottleneck and you can play with the original graphics. So in theory the same system requirements would apply.
---
However, the Classic client is probably optimised for a newer OS, which could bump the requirements a little.
---
Ah, gotcha!
---
Sick mana bar on that warrior
---
You're going to have to play harder and better than other classes to perform well. If you don't want to heal in end game pve you might be SOL unless you get lucky. If you want to pvp you aren't going to be doing the big damage, it'll mostly be out lasting your opponent.
---
They're an incredible class with a ridiculous amount of utility, but if all you want to do is raid you're probably better of with another class. If you want to pvp however, especially world pvp, and are looking to perform at the top of your ability then druid is insane.
---
26 hours.
---
Omg I just gave mine a dusting the weekend just gone!
---
In terms of PvE, druid players will absolutely enjoy leveling. You will have the tools to do almost anything you need done 1-60. Increased run speed, healing/dps/tank for dungeons, stealthing when there's pvp shit going down at quest hubs, etc.
---
Once you hit lv60 though:
---
PvE: (Assuming you want to get into raiding) you'll almost exclusively be a healer unless if your guild/raid team has a niche spot (not uncommon, 40 people turning up is the main thing) for you as a crit-buffer (cat for melee or moonkin for casters). Innervate and remove curse is useful, but don't expect to be the star of the raid like everyone has a chance of being in BFA.
---
PvP: Healing and flag running. 
---
One other option is if you're lucky or your guild has endgame content on farm, you might be able to land some decent Spellpower cloth pieces so you can play as a suicide moonkin (Basically hope for a starfire + moonfire crit on someone before you get killed). Similarly, moonfire spam if you're caught out and about to die.
---
I don't have much experience with feral druid pvp in vanilla. I felt they were quite strong in BC but that's all I know about that.
---
Hi, I actually played a fury dps/tank role hybrid and that’s not far off the specc I used. Taking points out of prot for the sake of getting 2 or more in tactical mastery is something you should really consider. You could DPS or tank with this in PvE and perform at 90% for either role NP.
---
However, do not leave yourself under any illusion that this spec will work for pvp. It won’t. It’s dogshit for pvp.
---
I'm fucking crying right now. Got the stress test but even that's not open. So i'm just staring at the login screen. So close... yet so far 😭😭😭LET ME IN i just want to go home! This is torture.
---
8 fps, check
---
Yeah :) 
---
Know what you mean, but that ''Old WoW Stuff'' folder was like on 3 backups :))) 
---
Have a couple of more, will post again maybe...
---
Do you think that wow token in Classic would make sense?
---
Glad you noticed that I was agreeing with him.
---
Hi, /u/Captainmervil
---
Agreed I will be there Hogger raid ftw
---
Tseric did nothing wrong.
---
And should have stayed that way. It’s legitimately the reason I stopped playing WoW and even though I’ve returned on occasions to keep my main max level, I’ve only been to Pandaria once.
---
Upvoted you both! Suffer now!
---
I received stress invite in the hours since you wrote this comment. 2007acc.
---
Not to get your hopes up but check again?
---
Can't you get the first crafted wand on lvl 5? Priest PvP is gonna be OP.
---
I am sure there will be another stress test for. It felt like EU went down a lot more tgan NA during vanilla so i assume we will get more tests.
---
Yup. I didn't get invited to the official beta, but I am selected for the stress test.
---
Druids are fun. One of my favorite memories from vanilla is low level pvp as a druid in Ashenvale. The class has so many tools to survive ganks and 2v1s.
---
Mid 2007, just got one
---
um das gehts ja :)
---
So much time wasted running right and left instead of casting...
---
not gonna lie mines the same way
---
nah about a day, ends thrusday. blizzard will be actively monitoring for two hours
---
All good on telstra
---
I got invited to stress test. My first wow account thats linked to my bnet was created in dec 2015. Been subbing on and off troughout the years. Been there for most first and last raid tiers. Approx 2yr /played. Currently got 2 active wow subs
---
What Remmiz said basicly.
---
There was no way for me (or i think any player that played back then) to see Molten Core or BWL or even Ony if you werent a part of a guild that was devoted enough to go to the endgame. And prepare for it, of course... 
---
I was lucky to get that chance (tnx Mati for that invite ;))
---
Probably won't be long until phase 2 is out. Just use your 60% mount in the meantime and buy whatever BoE's you might need for any gold exceeding the required amount.
---
There are atleast 2 BoE craftable epics you want as a pally.

Got invite. Live in oceanic region. Account created in late 2005 and was subbed through until mid Cata. Currently subbed now incase of beta invite.
---
For EU - for sure. But for NA, well I'm not really sure. I assume that at 4 pm a lot of people may still be in work. However consideirng that it is the 1st stress, maybe they don't want to push it so hard.
---
Well,  the past year  I only played on the server whose name looks a bit like Cosmos.  These servers are relatively old,  so the guild building dynamics of a new server were a thing of the past, the first wave of raiding guilds had moved on and all the guilds remaining were  way behind by default.  But in my experience there was always room for a few guilds that  went really casual. (I know this because I liked to join those with an alt, to keep open more connections with other people outside my 'main' guild) 
---
I do recognize your point about more ambitious guilds recruiting the 'better' players from casual guilds, but I don't think that automatically killed the casual guilds, they had enough new casual blood and often had a few leaders that wanted this casual guild , that's the whole idea after all, somebody is founding such a guild, and those leaders kept it together.   Up to BWL this was successful, in AQ40 they usually have to step it up or go down.
---
Can confirm. Europeans go down a lot more than Americans.
---
ATLEAST YOU GOT IT 😭😭
---
I do, but only after at least a year of classic being out.
---
https://wow.gamepedia.com/Pandaren_relaxation_area It was an easter egg in reign of chaos
---
I've gotten in but have no idea what time the EU one starts im assuming the same time which is 11pm UK time which seems pretty late for a stress test on a work night.
---
Just ask em if you can use their account while they’re offline!
---
Which is why I actually think my character was named before the author used the name in lore.
---
11pm UK happens when this comment is 13 hours and 2 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/FfL2D11i_
---
Yes there is.
---
Yea sure i'll have a twink
---
It'll be a 60 paladin
---
Feral isn't bad at all, it's just not as efficient to manage.   
---
With that said, you will have put in 150% where other melee DPS put in just 100% to do the same amount of DPS. 
---
It's more time consuming to Raid Prep for DPS due to the amount of consumables needed (MCP and Breath Chili for once)  and it's a Guild Effort if they have you Tank as your healers will have to get use to healing you.   
---
They're a blast to play in PVP, as you have to engage in Range, Melee and Heal while managing your Shifts and CD's.
---
I don't have any preference, just meant to say they exist.
---
you'd be surprised how much dps a feral cat can do with equal consumes to a warrior or rogue in Phase 1. They are quite viable with wolfshead helm &amp; mcp and can most likely top on single target fights in phase 1
---
Wouldn't wanna run DM without all the quests though :&gt;
---
I'm not sure if I would say Paladins and Shamans are "way below Priests." Paladins are the most efficient single target healers, and Shamans are the best raid healers. Priests just have a lot more versatility. Paladins and Shamans also come with some of the best buffs in the game.
---
yup, it has been hit or miss for me since legion. But in vanilla tbc wotlk and cata where i played more than the 3-4 months of mop and wod, cs was impeccable.
---
Good move. We have to weed out the weak
---
HOW CAN YOU STRESS TEST WITHOUT EXPERIENCING STRESS!
---
KEEP GOING!  PUSH HARDER!
---
I learned  from that graph that my connection was 16 years ahead of the curve :D
---
Genius
---
Hey guys, thank you everyone for input, I appreciate it very much &lt;3
---
Gotta play holy priest, I guess :D
---
Yes, because you are a 2.Class Beta Tester. Only for the stress sessions.
---
forsenE
---
Video evidence is proof of it being real though, even if it is in patch notes or not. We do not know what they meant by that statement, but most likely they are referring to talent system, itemization, quests. If they dumbed down leveling as a catch up mechanism somewhere in late vanilla, it does not really give the classic experience they are promising as most players leveled before that change.
---
No you need to be streamer to get full access :D
---
This stress test is better than BFA in terms of content
---
I'll focus on my PVE experience with feral. I can tell you that being "Dat Feral Boi" for your guild is EXTREMELY rewarding. I got to be the designated feral for my BWL guild on nostalrius and I had a fantastic time. I felt impactful every raid because I was tanking in most fights, and even when I was just doing my mediocre feral dps I was still the guy that the melee WANTED to be in a group with, even if just for my buff.
---
If you are bothered by not being able to top any meters, you will not like druid, but if you don't get hung up on that and just enjoy being a useful member of the raid, feral can be great. You still need to get lucky enough to be Dat Feral Boi for a guild tho if you want to raid as feral, otherwise just have a resto set ready.
---
I might honestly do that for Classic, sounds like a great way to make it more memorable (and even more rewarding to finally ding after 10+ hours of the same song).
---
In case of the old 40 man raids, it’s not that Important. But for some guilds with ambitions..
---
What are you talking about. Prior to AQ40 you raid once a week clearing BWL/MC/Onyxia. 
---
If this guy is there from the start he won't have any issues at all.
---
&gt;Just having one difficulty of each raid would be a good start.
---
So much this. I always hated the HC system, and I would rather have progressively more difficult content which is the case in vanilla and TBC.
---
On retail when they launch new expansions I play for the first few weeks, clear the raid on release day... in a pug,and then I am not really that motivated to farm the same raid for 3 months, just with a few more mechanics added, and then just to have all of that gear made obsolete in the next tier progression anyways.
---
But the good thing I guess is that the world-first race is super exciting
---
You guys are still young..lol. 45 here, daughter is almost 23. Glad I have a bunch of free time again to game. Especially with classic being re released. I’ll be on my deathbed and people will be wondering when I’m going to grow up. Responsibility is overrated.
---
Naah, played in the beta 2 evenings now. Never streamed a second in my life.
---
how do u get the scythe?
---
I'll tank. Human (or dworf) warrior here.
---
We gotta do this. Or otherwise the stress-test won't be complete.
---
&gt; let's face it: the dungeons weren't that hard. we were just fucking terrible.
---
Well said. I've said this since Classic was announced and people crawled out of the woodwork with their insane hyperbolic "memories" of vanilla. Up until AQ most bosses had maybe 2-3 mechanics, all of which amount to dispelling someone, mitigating a big hit or dealing with adds. There are quest mobs in retail that have more mechanics than some raid bosses in Classic.
---
There is going to be months, if not years, of nostalgia blinded people whining and crying on every forum, discord, etc about how Blizzard totally screwed up Classic and made it super easy as some sort of hidden agenda. They won't cope with the fact that they just fucking sucked at video games when they were 12 years old, and that a lot of raid bosses do in fact die pretty quick when half your DPS isn't just spamming 1 attack over and over.
---
pve is an absolute cakewalk and people will clear mc with half the raid not being level 60, let alone all being pre raid bis
---
Feral with MCP will be able to Top DPS meters in Phase One.   
---
They'll be able to be on par with Rogues/Warriors in Phase Two. 
---
It's only in Phase 3 where their DPS starts falling behind slightly.   
---
With that said, you will have to put in 150% where others put in 90-100%
---
Awesome! I’ve heard the story of the map on the wall, but never seen it.
---
As it was. So it shall be. 
---
Original launch date: November 23rd, 2004
---
Dire Maul release date: March 7th, 2005
---
The good news is that you still buy a regular mount while you’re waiting.
---
Ok, thanks for the reply
---
Most of this sub was so convinced their precious ‘no changes’ code was the peak of difficulty. Two days after beta comes out they’re literally calling the code they asked for bugged because its too easy. LOL.
---
A few people have been saying it awhile now; emulating the experience is they way to go. The game needs to be more difficult to account for leaps in player ability or it just wont *feel* the same.
---
Can also get the offtank spot.
---
Yes but did those guilds last long? On third iteration I of course see people trying to make those guilds all the time, just none of them last. Of course there is AQ out now so I don't know if it was like this without AQ.
---
&gt; Pandas (Chen Stormstout) ~~were originally a joke character~~ are joke characters
---
FTFY
---
Under the Region/Account you should have a dropdown menu with the "Beta &amp; Stress test: WOW classic" option. If you don't, then you're not.
---
Tell that to Wildstar.
---
Came out with heroics that were bloody hard, bosses that forced you to constantly move, hold aggro, more complicated mechanics in most instance boss fights than you see in most other MMO raids, 40 man super hard raiding and it failed on its ass because everyone cried it was too hard.
---
I didn’t get an email, but the region box above play on my wow retail now has the option to install the classic beta. 
---
Anyone else have this??
---
Nah, going to be much worse this time, the knowledge has only solidified the top 4 classes (Warrior, Mage, Rogue, Priest) and on top of that its worthwhile for Warriors to grab some of that gear as well, especially combat swords further cementing itself as the meta.
---
Just ditch the playlist and listen to Disturbed. It is all you need to play classic (successfully)
---
It mostly shows your level of committment to the guild. Why take you over some guy who hauled ass and got his pre raid BIS?
---
It shows that you're serious about your spot in the guild. 
---
I'm sure you'd be able to find other casual guilds who will take people in whatever gear, but I can also guarentee you that you will have a harder time clearing raids with that guild.
---
that's 10% difference which at higher level content is a lot.
---
FERAL DPS: There are videos out there proving you can be among the top dps. It's not that it's hard to play feral, the hardest part is going to be utilizing the most out of consumables to be competitive with the top dogs. Very possible, if you show effort, no raid leader should deny you the opportunity if they are right in their mind. Huge plus is the next paragraph though.
---
FERAL TANK: Very yes. They get shit on by noobs but they can main tank 90% of the bosses just fine and are best off-tanks out there. Fury tanks have worse survivability and comparable dps, prot paladins are just tank bots. As druid, the benefit of one talent tree for both roles means you will not loose almost any performance when switching between dps/tank at demand because, let's not forget, that demand can shift violently between each boss and being able to shift in an INSTANT is super valuable.
---
RESTO: Probably worst of the healer bunch but they will carry their weight just fine. They are actually pretty mana efficient even when using innervate on others.
---
BALANCE: Are you prepared to suffer? If not, don't go there. It's workable if nobody is going to shit on you for being at the lower half of the dps meter.
---
Anything goes in PvP really. That crazy mobility is going to be saving grace of any spec, even balance.
---
Sub all day
---
https://youtu.be/5vd57mgQSFY
---
first clip is private server. sec clip is joanas speedrun in actual vanilla. not only does the mob melee for 1 more dmg but also the fireball does nearly 9 times as much dmgas it did in actual vanilla aka beeing rank 2 instead of rank 1. this can be seen for most of the leveling content on private servers. maybie inform yourself b4 you make bullshit posts on reddit
---
That’s awesome guys, some good feedback, I’d like too raid but I think majority of my time will be spent collecting the Blue PVP rank, since Rank 14 will just be unobtainable. I’ll definitely be on a PVP server, so knowing what I know now about then having such utility I’ll be playing Druid, do you know if you have to spec into flag carrying or is it just generally deep feral is viable for DPS and flag carrying?
---
I'd go for cooking
---
So it says BETA and stress test but really its only for the stress test? okay thanks saved me a download
---
It's a bit wrong here and there, but fury tanks will be the better tanks later on in vanilla. More threat  = more raid dps
---
I've got a stress test invite and I'm from EU. Nothing in the mail, just checked the launcher and it is there.
---
It's not worst just least popular by numbers. But just comparing bug trackers you can see they take authenticity far more seriously than anything else.
---
Wouldn't the world first race be as exciting even if it's one mode? For example Sunwell was a great raid. Bosses were tough as fuck and most guilds weren't able to kill even one. But nobody complained about not being able to go there.
---
The hardest part of vanilla raiding was getting 40 people to work together. One way guild leaders can judge who will be a good team mate is putting those kinds of restrictions in place. It shows right off the bat that you 1) listened to them 2) did what they asked and 3) are motivated to be a part of the team.  Getting a raid full of people like that is almost all you need to be successful.
---
like wheels on a car, you can manage it but not so good ;)
---
How many of those have sizable populations today?
---
this is such a stupid argument cause there was no confusion to begin with. if you’re looking for a group to dire maul you always specify which wing. on top of that if a 20 warlock is spamming lfg with ”LFM DM” you dont assume someone of that level would be looking for a group to dire maul, and vice versa.
---
bonus point, dire maul was added to the game after deadmines had been called DM for ages
---
I just checked and got in. So hyped. Unfortunately have to work till the afternoon, but after that... Oh boy, already so hyped
---
They are real, usually get sent few hours later tho
---
AB ALL DAY , some gear past level 30 has great stats like the green tower shield you can get at 36.
---
Honestly just more gear options
---
I am not saying any of them are hard. About reading comprehension: did you read the OP? Where does he ask about what is most easy to play in raids? He is asking about the class that you basically can’t do mistakes with. 
---
Paladin in general is the easiest class to learn and easiest class to play in almost all settings in the game. Very few possibilities to cause wipes (priest has fear which is one of the best abilities in the game to cause a wipe if used incorrectly). It is almost impossible to suck as a paladin because it is so easy in all settings.
---
If you could take your level of skill and WoW experience back in time to vanilla's release, you might not think it was very challenging. I've watched Asmon in dungeons as well, and his group is a cut above the average player group. They are also voice coordinated, something rather lacking in vanilla. It's just an unavoidable thing, we've been practicing this game in various stages for a decade.
---
Also does anyone know of any feral Druid classic beta streamers - excluding soda (can’t stand his stream)
---
5g
---
I know people who deliberately took a year longer studying than necessary in those years , because graduating meant they had to go off campus , back to abysmal  slow common people internet.....

Unlike the comment under me, embrace it. I did it and I love it. Twitch chat and emotes are wholesome widepeepoHappy
---
&gt;Loot council should not be used to fairly distribute loot.
---
I think you are mixing evenly with fairly. You can have FAIR loot council, based on activity, performance etc. People who deserve loot will get it. 
---
Pushing gear towards limited number of people is idiotic in "maximizing performance" point of view too, since every stat has diminishing returns. You want to have your stable 40 man roster ALL geared somewhat evenly. Sometimes rushing a certain ppl with tier items to get certain bonuses that are OP. Like rushing 3p bonus to all priests, one at the time. And then trying to get 8/8 on few ppl. It doesnt mean the other priests will NOT get loot, they will focus more on the BIS non-tier items.
---
Wow that looks amazing!
---
Mid 2007 account, EU
---
logged out / asleep when I got invite
---
yes but this is absolutely not the right build to be fury tanking, trust me
---
I've "not interested" so many fucking channels on YouTube now.
---
I've literally watched one after a link was posted now I have like 40 different recommendations
---
Dude I was rank 12 in pvp in vanilla, i levelled every class to 60 on a pvp server. I'm just being honest about what world pvp was/is.
---
World PVP really want a thing, just unfair fights and ganking. Sometimes you got a good fair fight and it was amazing, but it was rare.
---
I also forgot to say that over 50% of all my pvp experiences while levelling were against an opponent who massively out levelled me and I stood no chance. It's just how it was. If that's your thing go for it. I'm just letting people know that you can go PVE if you don't like the sound of it.
---
Hmm. It sounds very fun to me, cause most of the players will get to level 5 in a few hours. That basically means, that 90% of the players will have cap lvl and PVP's will be extremely balanced. Not to mention some 10-11 lvl elite mob raids, after which people will make a bonfire (I think cooking is from lvl5, right?) and just chit-chat untill the next respawn.  
---
It's like a smaller version of the classic WoW which you can completely finish off in a day. Doesn't that sound fun?
---
If you use pet attack/pet follow macros and the like, they become a lot more manageable.
---
&gt;Wouldn't the world first race be as exciting even if it's one mode? For example Sunwell was a great raid.
---
In the later tier, yes. But I don't think it would be that exciting at the release, as the release raids for all expansions are "introduction raids", which would be cleared pretty fast.
---
But having "impossible" raids like Sunwell and Nax is definitely a great carrot on a stick for casual players to always have some new content to strive for.
---
So the only thing I like about the 4 or 5 difficulties or how many there are is just to be able to watch the method streams during their progression for every raid.
---
But as a non-hardcore raider the olders system is infinitely more satisfying and appealing.
---
I am pretty sure that caster mobs always had a bigger range than players.
---
I’m concerned because she isn’t playing a healer. Are girlfriends allowed to play something other than a healer in WoW? I feel like a whenever someone is  referred to as, “so and so’s girlfriend” she is ALWAYS a healer.
---
maybe i was a dumb teenager but I don't think I ever even heard the phrase "pre raid bis" until pservers got huge
---
As others said, I think it’s 5g, but only after you have already hit 5 or 10 gold. The first one was only 1g, and incrementing by 1g for the first few, I am fairly sure.
---
Tanked parts of SM armory/cathedral with a 2hander because sweeping strikes/WW sped the runs up so much.  Not sure if I did it in later dungeons as well or not.
---
Well stress test is from 1am till 3am that is why I posted this meme, so no rush.
---
Yup, in their original post about stress-test, I believe they mention that it's the same client (hence the same name), but stress-test players won't have access to the beta servers.
---
I just got into stress test only too, the feels :(
---
Nelf teams would be the absolute strongest world pvp and wreck your gear over night. It's an entertaining idea but I think the ingenuity of people would ruin it as you frame it.
---
I will be playing when I get home from work tomorrow. It's too late to stay up to play for an hour sadly. 1 am, play for an hour, 2 am to go to bed, get up at 7 am. No not worth it for a level 5 stress test :) Luckily the servers stay open for 24 hours so I can check out some things and maybe encounter a bug or two.
---
&gt; Because private server popularity made Classic WoW happen, suddenly these servers are unquestionable 100% accurate recreations of the game?
---
this is indeed a strawman argument, as he never claimed that .
---
All he says is that the serious private servers spend years researching vanilla sources to make their code as good as possible. did they succeed in making it 100% blizzlike?  of course they did NOT.  But that is not the claim, he just says they tried the best they could. And that their results were not totally useless.
---
Right, for a veeerry brief period. It was such a small side-reference that Blizzard made an april fool's joke, announcing pandaren as a playable race. Then like 3-4 years later, they actually did it.
---
I don't think it's a problem btw, it was an area that Blizzard could chunk into the map for another expac. But I don't think 2004 Blizz devs foresaw pandaren being in the game.
---
Yes man, they're going full scale at trying to make Wow classic what it was. Of course, they're humans, they can still be off. But they're not sabotaging your experience. No doubt people at blizzard want to have an official vanilla wow, even just for themselves. They're doing it with passion. If you feel something is wrong with vanilla and classic, try to present evidence and make a great post. Sure that Blizzard will take a look, even if they don't respond, they'll obviously test it if they have clear scenario like this example. They want it perfect. Believe in them. As for ourselves, players, we'll have to enjoy it as the game goes live. It's the rebirth of Wow, the same baby, 15 years later. I'll be there this time (I was too young back then)
---
Retaliation?
---
Yeah; it’s good, but you can’t rely on 30min CDs. Rogue’s panic button is evasion, with a CD of only 5 minutes
---
I don't recall this being true. At the very least I know that fishing in higher level zones and in pools of fish increases the likelihood of skilling up.  One of my fondest vanilla memories was when I got my friend to play with me and we leveled fishing together, traveling from zone to zone on new characters and avoiding the mobs that quickly out-leveled us.
---
That's not the classic beta.
---
As Priest when Auto-Shooting with wand and trying to spam Power Word: Shield I can see the cast animation of the spell and a gcd is taken, but the shield isnt applied on me. After this fake cast &amp; gcd the shield is then applied correctly on the 2nd "try".

---
Lol enjoy being banned.
---
Checked client, not invite for me. (EU)
---
This is why people actually pick the axe
---
Stress test has a level cap of 5. Not much stuff you can do as a lvl 5.
---
You miss less if you start fishing in the starting zones. Capital cities are advanced, yo.
---
*GUID (global unique identifier) is what you probably mean. GUI is graphical user interface.   
---
I am not sure why a skeleton would need a GUID and whow that GUID would impact server performance in a meaningful way. I have no idea about how WoW is coded though. But from a database developer pov, it sounds odd.
---
That's what I'm doing, why wait and quest when you can smash boars and then duel people for 22h straight ?
---
26 hours\*  
---
It's not compulsory. If you don't want to participate, you can just skip it.\*  
---
Beta tests (and stress tests) aren't for players. Players just get a little treat (like early access to the game) in exchange for actively testing the game in search for bugs.\*
---
Was so excited to play when i saw it :/
---
Screw him, that's your beta.
---
I was scared of PvP servers before I tried them. I was secretly relieved I didn’t have to deal with that barbarism.
---
They’re really, really fun though. Makes the world feel more alive and consequential.
---
It is. Beta wasn't there last night on the launcher nor was the second PTR account on my games list on the site.
---
&gt;I think this is not the case for private servers.
---
please people stop using this as a frame of reference!
---
You do have the core raiders geared somewhat evenly, yes (in practice for most guilds that's never all 40 people). Doesn't mean it's fair. Fair is subjective and everyone experiences it differently.
---
You don't rely on it, that's the point. If you're asspulling too many mobs while leveling that much, just be more careful. I seldom had to use it at all.
---
*upvotes rebelliously*
---
Well the challenge is still to be among the first to complete the raid. 
---
People are saying that there will be no world first kills this time around because all bosses have been killed already. Bullshit if you ask me. It's gonna be amazing to see the top guilds and their strategies to get 60 asap and how soon they can clear MC. Even if the raid itself is easy as fuck and can be done by 25 people that's not retarded. 
---
Also I wouldn't say that catering to the likes of Method is a sustainable way to balance the game. I'd say TBC was excellent overall in that regard. You had Karazhan/Gruul for the newbies. SSC/TK for the more casual guilds (and later on MH/BT when attunements were removed) and Sunwell for the hardcores.
---
The whole badge system was great also. Even the more experienced players had a reason to run Karazhan/ZA for badges (and SSC/TK for certain powerful items + attuning new raiders). While making it a adequate catch up mechanic for new players joining in or the casual players to gain an edge and being able to progress.
---
What is peggle?
---
I love the fact that Valor is spelled the British way "Valour" in the picture.
---
This is just out of my perspective and Blizzard has the actual numbers but: 
---
Please no. The WoW token legalized buying gold. It definitely decreased the amount of work Blizz had to do to stop gold selling but I would bet my ass that nowadays more people buy gold than before, just because it is legal. Not many would even be brave enough to buy gold on an account with a character they leveled to 60. 
---
Introduce the WoW token in Classic and the economy will be dead, just like it is on retail...
---
Don’t use your numbers on the top past 5 or 6
---
Use the unbound buttons on your keyboard, and things like shift-1 - shift 5. ctrl-1 - ctrl 5
---
Totally. I understand that people are excited to play the beta but for me I haven't logged into the beta as I want my first revisit to be when the game is actually released.
---
Definitely going to get hate that I'm not using my beta invite and I would gift it if i could but I'm going to hold off until release date to revisit vanilla
---
This is more important than raiding to me. I have fond memories of trying to farm them for my druid and another druid in my guild back in late bc/wrath. Can't wait to do it properly.
---
Chaotic good
---
It's actually pretty decent for early tanking. It has a nice mix of defensive and offensive stats, despite the lack of actual defense (which is over-rated really).
---
Whats undermine? The zone we got during cata?
---
Same, I could have done with that lift after work! Ah well, life goes on, back to levelling slowly on retail and pretending it's classic
---
Same for me midnight on a work night &gt;&lt;. Will someone not think of the adults!
---
This reminds me of doing Rhok'delar and Benediction quests.  Heard they were hard and people in the guild were failing sometimes multiple times and even needed other people to get on their accounts to do it ... I get nervous, get my consumables needed go in and .... that's it?  Didn't even come close to failing and thought there had to be more to it ... nope people just couldnt do basic stuff.  A lot of people are going to be disappointed with those quests when they find out how easy they are now due to just having basic awareness/skills.  The only challenge with vanilla will start with aq40/naxx and the fact you need 40 geared people to do it.
---
Account-sharing is prohibited :P
---
That's a shame, because Mists is probably the best expansions since Wrath.
---
Hunters have probably the most complex dps rotation, not that that's saying much. It's just that we were bad in Vanilla, so ended up with a 90% auto-shot "rotation".
---
It's not needed. I'm in a progress guild now that clearly said we want to chill during the level phase and MC, just because leveling is a special time, where nobody should feel pressured and Mc is free loot. We rather spend our time building a good community, because that is a big factor going all the way to naxx. 
---
I fully expect to raid in greens in Mc.
---
Progress starts with Bwl.
---
If things can be wrong in beta they can be wrong in release. In fact there can be things wrong indefinitely. It's not an approach that will result in 100% authentic game. The only way to do that is to host the actual game instead of creating emulation in the modern engine.
---
well i mean for europe the stress test happens in the middle of the night so yeah xD but we can still play because the server will be open for 1 day or something!
---
Good post.
---
It's the most immersion-breaking bs imagineable. 
---
I don't mind engineering mounts, they were few and far between and you knew peopld had worked hard for them back then, but dozens of characters on motorcycles driving anound those supposedly tranquil starting areas is heart breaking.
---
Whelp, now I have to scour eBay for hours trying to find one...
---
Yeah I’m with Optus and it kept disconnecting for me - I couldn’t log in to any of the blizzard games
---
Same here just checked when I woke up. EU :)
---
It appears to be listing sets
---
Dungeons were hard runs when you got to the last boss and its red to most/all of your group.  You could still do it though.
---
Again they're all easy
---
Paladin in pvp on alliance is easily the hardest. Shaman beyond the retarded mechanic of totems is very easy
---
I've played this game a lot. Priest has nothing on deciding what blessing to use when. Blessing of sacrifice alone is more complex than anything a priest does in PvP
---
Whatever helps you sleep at night tough guy :)
---
Make your alt, run him into an inn. Use up the double xp every time it fills up.
---
Hey guys, its Tip!
---
The Darkspear weren't on Kalimdor. They were on a group of Islands close to the Mael Strom.
---
I got in as well but don't know if it's beta too or only stress test. Downloading now.
---
For the record I made my account in 2018 and only have active game time on (not a sub) and I am in EU.
---
Working now?
---
These are amazing
---
Bfa swapping is nothing, you can get a max toon in like 3 days of playing
---
what does this even mean? you can do this in any version of wow... killing exclusively boars to level really doesn't have anything to do with vanilla aside from being in the legendary South Park episode
---
Made an account just to upvote this!!!1
---
Excuse you. Defias leather.
---
&gt; total of 34:03:28, and to non military time that is One day Four hours Three minutes and twenty-eight seconds!
---
That are some strange 30 hour days you have there
---
But dungeon elites are significantly weaker?  This seems backwards as fuck
---
Upvote upvote upvote... i remember first playing and seeing tons of them around in the cross roads... Little did i know there was a battle being held close by. Its one of the most satisfying things to see in game.
---
Are you sure you really got in? I am in the same case: 
---
- I did not receive any email. 
---
- I see the "Beta &amp; Stress Test: Wow Classic", I am able to download the client. 
---
But I am pretty sure we won't be able to log-in once the server is up.
---
And monks was/is a really cool class. Was super fun to play in MoP especially.
---
Pls enable VODs!!! Wanted to see so bad
---
&gt; I'd say TBC was excellent overall in that regard. You had Karazhan/Gruul for the newbies. SSC/TK for the more casual guilds (and later on MH/BT when attunements were removed) and Sunwell for the hardcores.
---
Which is the best system, but for Vanilla its old content, and people have had it on farm on private servers for like at least 3 years now on high quality servers.
---
Its a way more fun and rewarding system as a player, but for the world first (as its not new content) its not as exciting imo.
---
&gt;The whole badge system was great also. Even the more experienced players had a reason to run Karazhan/ZA for badges (and SSC/TK for certain powerful items + attuning new raiders). While making it a adequate catch up mechanic for new players joining in or the casual players to gain an edge and being able to progress.
---
I don't like badges, guaranteed "epics" should be very rare and far between, vanilla had a better system imo. You got a few epics from reputations (like Cenarion circle exalted, the AQ opening event and AV exalted etc),and then you had comeback raids like ZG where you could farm the comeback gear as oppose to guarantee getting it from badges.
---
And MC was on farm from the beginning to the end of vanilla due to some great items (spell blade, and thunderfury in perticular), Onyxia you always wanted the head and everyone wants the bag. ZG had all those enchants which are always good, AQ 20 you had the scarabs and the quest that gave a lot of rep etc.
---
Yeah badges are good to make sure you are always progressing, but again its suppose to be an RPG so you should actually go out there and obtain the gear yourself.
---
ANd it really went out of control when they started giving out full tier sets from badges in wrath.
---
Hi, /u/Drakkenstein
---
Aussie PVP  
---
 Hey everyone, we’re looking for more members for Classic, we’re going to go Alliance on a PvP server, obviously Oceanic servers if we get them. The ultimate goal is 40 man raids and PvP so class balance matters but we are not going to tell anyone what they have to play.  With our raiding we’re not going to be some hardcore guild aiming for server firsts or raiding every night, probably 2-3 nights a week and these nights and times will be decided upon what is best for the majority. People have jobs, families, social lives etc so we aren’t about to crack it if someone cant make every raid. Raid loot will probably end up DKP, it seems to be the fairest option. Other options can of course be looked at.  PvP is also something that a fair few of us enjoy and have had some success at in Vanilla and various expansions. So we will be looking at doing regular premade groups.  Regarding Officer/ Recruitment positions etc within the guild these are all up for grabs.  As for the Guild name this will be voted on in the coming weeks.  Come check us out on discord if you’re keen or add me on battlenet eds#1563  [https://discord.gg/uEMtvEt](https://discord.gg/uEMtvEt)
---
Bump
---
this is beautiful haha, loving these lo-fi renditions of WoW
---
shame about the mana bar ;)
---
I miss language as a point tbh. I know that's less of an issue in NA but a really big one in EU. Still not clear if we get dedicated servers for German or French?
---
Aaaaahhahaha. The peggle part got me. When that hit.  So many people played it while waiting for resets and pulls.  I forgot about alt tabbing out and getting a fix.
---
More like content for non-raiders. The quests are a waste of time if you're raiding.
---
Druid is really fun, but my suggestion is not to be too rigidly attached to one spec. 
---
Feral is good for dungeons, and is ok for pvp and marginally ok for raiding. 
---
There are other cool specs to try though, and they by no means neglect shapeshifting. Of course there is various resto healing specs, but there’s also a ton of really fun pvp specs. 
---
There are BG specs which are resto/feral mixtures, and there is the infamous balance pvp spec which is one of the most complex play styles in the whole game. Coming from retail you might think balance = moonkin turret spellcaster, but no, you use all your forms and you go zooming around
---
Short answer: it's Kezan now.
---
How long will they be inviting players?
---
EU here, my friend and I also got an invite.
---
It helps but they're being excessive by wanting all bis
---
I got the B&amp;S server showing up over 9 hours ago, still no email.
---
We will still be able to play for the next 24 hours after it starts, right?
---
those hunters suck ass
---
t. never played hunter in vanilla
---
it has probably one of the most involved rotations and a very high skill cap. Low skill floor, high skill ceiling defines the class, really.
---
That's honestly not bad. Crendor is at 21 after 24 hours (although he has been messing around a lot).
---
I've only played WoW since BC but I am excited to try out the challenge of classic wow. Kind of nervous since I've mained hunter for most of my time in WoW since BC. Am I just not viable to level a hunter in classic?
---
Nah blizz can just sell tokens and sell gold like they already do in modern wow
---
I took mine out of the box a couple nights ago and was also curious if they are still about and they got for like £180 in good condition on amazon but id imagine you could get them wayy cheaper on ebay.
---
Absolutely, but "close enough" is not "100% correct" and therefore you can't measure anything against it with if what you're aiming for is 100% correct. It's like building a house and using "probably a yard lol" to measure everything.
---
That would be nice because I could risk staying up until 3-4 AM but then I would only get 3 hours of sleep and then it's work.....
---
If we could play for the next 24 hours I could play in the afternoon when I get home which would be better xD.
---
More XP too
---
same bug with power word: pain and renew
---
If we have the stress test and beta does that mean from midnight tonight (UK) I can play the beta? The hype is real I hope it isn’t just the 2 hour stress test I can play!!!
---
1AM -&gt; 3AM here I come!
---
Paid 15$ so I might get to play beta... doesn't get invite... stress test comes out and also doesn't get a invite.. blizzard shall die a horrible fiery death from a naked homeless man holding a poop covered lighter and a container of stolen fuel
---
Then they'll extend the invites to more people.
---
The stress test starts at 1 am CEST
---
Highlands too
---
Max level is 5 even after the two hours.
---
I got an email
---
what is the best class to win at everything, i have only 5 minutes of playtime every week i need to level at 1 level a minute at least, plz
---
If you got an invite and your Realm List looks like this:  [https://imgur.com/Xoa8rZx](https://imgur.com/Xoa8rZx)  you're a stress tester. At 00:00 GMT you can play for 24 hours on the stress test but after that you don't get beta.
---
A troll you keep playing because you like it is far more valuable than an orc you don't play because you don't enjoy it.
---
OMG I got into the stress test. Im currently downloading, why is everyone saying its not up???
---
Everyone playing classic is a adult haha... besides what adult goes to bed at midnight?
---
&gt; Fair is subjective and everyone experiences it differently.
---
If the core sees the LC as NOT FAIR, you wont have that core for long. Luckily vanilla/classic is a marathon, not a sprint. If the guild you are in is rotten, then theres always spots open in other guilds.
---
And people do speak.. if multiple ppl say your guilds LC is fucked up, who will want to join after that ?
---
Competent\*
---
Most MMO players are incompetent...
---
In any other genre no one would suggest doing some stupid hybrid spec that doesn't fit into the meta. Something about the MMO that just draws people to play video games for hours they have no desire to understand. 
---
Yea hybrid specs are great dude? You are clearly not all that competent. Blows my mind how common this is relative to other genres. I just don't understand.
---
EU 2006 account, got in stress test no Beta.
---
My understanding is that the server will be available for 24 hours, and those 2 hours will be where they're actually trying to max out the server and properly stress test it, I could be wrong though.
---
except for stressing out the server in the starting zone at 1am
---
There is no need to aim for 100% correct if you want the same overall meta, raid bosses being steamrolled 2 hours after the raid opens etc.
---
Warrior
---
I didn't know about Hayven while he was making videos, but only found his channel afterwards.  His commentary was stupendous, and all the work he put into the videos really show.  
---
100% he and TB are the giants of who's shoulders we currently stand upon.
---
Can do a few different things. With daggers you can take imp Sprint and also get prep. Lots of mobility with that. With swords I like cold blood/hemo/prep at lower gear levels and once you're in like AQ gear you can do premed
---
Ahhh damnit!! Oh well, looks like I’m staying up until midnight to hit it hard!! Thanks :(
---
no blue posts on that one I'm afraid.
---
I bet they will increase very soon.. in my country they're already 30+ euros, was able to snag one at Amazon in Germany just now for 7 total!
---
Higher level zones have one consequence in terms of fishing: it requires higher skill to fish there.
---
Skilling up is solely determined by number of successful casts and current skill level. That combined probability goes down with every skill point you gain.
---
Mage
---
... did the barrens have grass? I always played it on the lowest settings?
---
Just yell in /4 LFGUILD. *sidenote: can be another channel*
---
Hadn't gotten an invite at 2AM (EU time), but I had received one around 9AM this morning (EU time) when I woke up.
---
Was pretty epic. McConnell, Sodapoppin and Preach were all there as well.
---
I haven't logged in since the first month or two of legion and I got in, so if it does affect chances there's gotta be a lot more to it.
---
i'm envious that you have so many irl friends interested
---
Seeing this live was so hype!!!
---
No idea, haven’t tried - this was ~2 hours ago
---
It's called PokéMortalKombat 11
---
You'll want deep feral for Heart of the Wild. The 1 extra point for the extra crit % is a bonus. The rest depends on your playstyle/gear 
---
The blue set will also do decently for tanking 5 mans. However, you'll need a proper set for dpsing. 
---
If you go WSG, you will be flag carry, unless there is a better druid in the group. (unlikely for premades)
---
I have bought game time on my BFA account just for a chance at beta and have not installed Retail or logged in since December last year. Got the stress test today.
---
"Played" wow since F&amp;F alpha, and then more seriously from closed beta.
---
Never had a beta invitation
---
Literally me man.
---
Most hyped I've been in a long time
---
Now we are just repeating the previous point. LC for performance and progression is not fair, it's for performance and progression not fairness. It's a semantic argument where you think fair is not same as even except many people do.
---
Link doesn't work?sad face
---
What video evidence are you referring to?
---
The option wasn't there until I exited and reopened  the app and it was there. No e-mail either. Try it
---
do you do this with your mouse? and is it done with paint?
---
I plan on just playing the game without any plans pre-launch. Meet the people I meet, form friendships, fill up my friendlist and take it from there. 
---
I'm going to play casual though. If you're hardcore you may want to visit some Discords and join a guild pre-launch.
---
Oh, yes I reported it on the megathread after making this comment.
---
That's amazing.
---
GM's have been playing Warframe. Those guys love goofing in server messages, its great, adds character and is a nice reminder there is a person at the other end.
---
Blizz could probably benefit a lot just from having a server admin trolling the players every now and then, PR wise.
---
"We've noticed you guys are making far to many humans, so we've buffed Hogger 500% and given all his camp Thunderfurys. For the board!"
---
I probably know the answer already, but maybe someone has a great idea. My playstyle is going into melee range, being able to receive some hits and disrupts the enemies. I don’t care about killing blows etc. just to help my team win the battle by controlling the battlefield from melee range. Ofcourse this if for PvP and I don’t care with this build for PvE. I might make an alt for PvE or respec for it depending on my gold situation.
---
1v1 PvP is not my thing, so this is for BG PvP or World PvP. So if your answer is Warrior, yes, that’s what I think as well. I’m looking for semi viable idea’s here 😊
---
"sorry boss, my toilet exploded and shit is overflowing, need to wait for the plumber" 100% works
---
Yes but people would do stuff like this more frequently in Vanilla
---
It should in theory be "slightly" better on classic beta, because from what I could see with the streamers in the human start zone, they have the same pooled dynamic spawning as current retail has.
---
It ensures that (for quest mobs at least) there's always a minimum number of creatures spawned at any time.
---
I've never seen a p-server do anything more than "accelerated respawns".. Which isn't quite the same.
---
I also think this stress test is also to test their layering solution.. In which case, we'll be able to see the max number of players before they split, in action this time.
---
Oh it'll still be hard and slow.. But, somewhat less so than these huge launches.
---
The fuck did he do to his keyboard? Can’t he clean it once in a while?
---
Looking forward to playing mage!
---
What play-style do y’all recommend for classic, and how should I change it up once my guild and I get raid ready?
---
TBH fishing peaked in wotlk with Dark Herring tho
---
Yeah, but I wonder what the point will be for 1-5.. I intend to go on for the 2 hours, to help them gather their data. But beyond that.. Not sure, maybe I'll log back on the next day.. But, not convinced there's much in it, to make it worthwhile.
---
Yes. One of the worse ones.
---
I’ve got the battle.net to install on Ubuntu but can’t run wow when prompted it says can’t run 3D acceleration. Tell me if you have a fix.
---
Never gets old, or does it?
---
We’ve had this EXACT thread over 1000 times, I wish I was joking
---
I love it. Missed old Blizzard GMs! I hope we see them in-game too and hopefully they spawn random bosses again to scare us for fun.
---
hell ya
---
Always play what you want. It's a game, not a job.
---
Not sure if I should try to play a paladin for the first time in my life, and the first time to ever play alliance.
---
Or just default to warlock which has been the case for the last 15 years.
---
If they decide to go TBC I would have to pay for a faction change tho, or level a new character
---
as important as mana
---
Cultivated mass.
---
Look at all the grass, thats not the barrens i know and love.
---
I'm pretty sure everyone got into the stress test. I got in on 2 accounts.
---
Amazing to see this live! Great work by Staysafe. So cool that they called each other on Discord to set this up :)
---
These things aren't related. You can be wrong about how something was, by comparing it to a private server; and that would have absolutely nothing to do with what helped bring this project to life. I don't see the connection here.
---
Lol roasted
---
Server not open until Weds :) (or Thursday 9am AEST if you're in Australia like me)
---
I was there. 
---

---
Thank you, kind stranger!
---
Mists of Pandaria was legitimately the best expansion the game had. Shit loads of content, good raids, lots of things to do, great story, a Legendary quest line that was very good, and class balance was fantastic. The only bad thing about it is that it will probably never get its own classic Realm, since it follows it after and before two of the worst expansions.
---
Did you restart your launcher? :( someone further down mentioned they didn't get a download button either.
---
got in for the stress test, no email though, just appeared on the launcher
---
The differences are too big. Almost none of the information will carry over, except maybe the name of a healing spell or something. The class and game mechanics have just changed too much. Just watch streams.
---
If you try this you’ll see what we mean. Retail isn’t evil or anything - there’s fun to be had. J think the game philosophy is compromised and lost its way buts it’s still a fun, polished game.
---
You don't *need* it but when you're limited to 40 people it's a way to filter who's serious about raiding from people who will have to sit out.
---
Eh, personal preference really. Thought they were otherwise decent. One of the best things about MoP was that it didn't really funnel you into dungeons outside of the initial stretch.
---
It took me 3 days to download Wotlk , can't remember if it was the full thing or just some patch honestly. Ah Irish internet in the middle of the country side, I don't fucking miss you
---
100% agree.
---
I remember doing the attunement quest lines and the mobs use to 360 cleave, clothies getting one shot etc was so hard.
---
Shattered Halls, Shadow Labs (?!!!) and Alcatraz was no joke in heroic. 
---
Not sure how they would fair up today and tbh i've not played the last 2 expansions but i always remember how hard i use to think they were.
---
Couldn't hurt to file the report.
---
Blizzard will check it against their reference client and find the truth.
---
As I said, if you want to have a 100% genuine experience you can't compare it to something that's been guesstimated. Therefore all comparisons to private servers are moot. Especially seeing how many things they DO get wrong. That even more diminishes the few things that "might" be 100% correct. I'm not going to argue this any more though. Thanks for the discussion and have a pleasant day!
---
No. You need the arms talent to keep your rage when you change stances. Without it your warrior will be a potato. 
---
Fury/arms is fine for tanking, and there are some very modest tweaks you can make to a cookie cutter spec to be a better tank. 
---
Also fury is ok for pvp, but it is best to use a 2handed weapon. And wayyyyyy better still to be arms.
---
What does it say at the bottom? "You'll be able to continue playing.." and then it cuts off.
---
I don't think we can extrapolate that information from what we have so far.
---
Zug zug!
---
Your friend was right all along. For the Horde!
---
I don't think it was an easter egg or a joke at all. It wasn't like it was a non-canon story arc, or he was a person you could randomly miss. He was a traveler from a far off land who helped you out. Kinda tells me that they had some idea of wanting to make that a thing somewhere down the line.
---
Ebn and Stormx are great!
---
So I started playing the game late vanilla and therefore only got to lvl 40~ with my warrior before TBC released so I never experienced max lvl.
---
What's in your opinion the best class for being able to heal and also able to solo quest/farm at 60? (going to play alliance so shaman excluded).
---
Someone send him a real (and clean) keyboard!
---
On a PvE server, it will be ok. On a PvP server, LOL good luck getting your leather drops and swords with every other rogue and warrior rollingon them
---
If you just wanted the axe, then you would be able to bring a hunter along, they will be more after the raging berserker helm or shoulder piece.
---
Finding a priest healer whilst leveling is usually pretty quick &amp; arguably stronger for the group - majority of people will level in shadow / ret / enhance, and shadow spec priest will automatically have a set of caster gear, whereas the shammy/paladin may not have many healing spec items.
---
It may take slightly longer to form the group yes, but if you can get what you need from fewer runs, it is a massive time save.
---
Femdorf priest. Not choosing it for dwarf racials. Choosing it for twirly helicopter hair casting animation.
---
Im pretty sure a person who plays WoW from the beginning until retail has learned how to keep pet under control
---
This right here 100% i played warlock myself and while they are not weak they are pretty below mage in terms of dps until AQ
---
Yup, as above.  I got in with no email-able to download, get to loading screen etc without issue-have fun!
---
enjoy getting to level 5 and playing for a day weeeee cant wait..
---
Why are you guys so hyped to do 5 levels?
---
He definitely would have played it. Genna said he even played some of Legion.
---
Launch it and see what servers show up, you might have gotten into the actual beta
---
You there! Just wait!
---
thats a true
---
Pandaria had a beautiful world, with a good story. If the main reason you disliked it was Panda people, how were you okay with Cow people?
---
get lv5 ench wand as a priest, level engineering get bombs and kill some alliance
---
quality shitpost, upvoted
---
You goof you ;)
---
Level 5 is better than no levels! LET ME INNNN.JPG
---
And that's why we have 3 difficulties bois
---
I thought I didn't get the email but my gmail just put it under promotions tab and didnt get phone notification. I now fixed that so I get buzzed if beta access or whatever blizzard is promoting. Also I've heard of many others getting the install and no email so maybe you really just didn't get an email
---
Also a lot more abilities.
---
I got to download the beta on my launcher but never got an email from blizzard
---
This is the best I’ve seen:
---

What the fuck. Having free time and time for hobbies is crucial in a relationship. I'd be unhappy if I were in a relationship where I wouldn't be able to play, or just simply have time to spend on my hobbies and me-time. Same goes for her, if she wanted to go on a trip with her friends or such, that'd be completely fine. It's the exact same thing.
---
Stop gatekeeping marriage behind some made up miserable situation where your SO controls you. That is not the norm.
---
With that said, being in a relationship is a compromise, and you can't just straight up neglect your SO. I've taken time off from work for several game launches and said "I'm going to be grinding this game for a couple of days", and that's completely fine. She's well aware of how much that means to me.
---
They are busy having fun in beta, doing dungeons, pvp, training professions, gaining lvl 30 bis gear, etc... =(
---
..
---
ummm probably druid? depends what you mean by farm. if you mean gold, priests can holy nova farm lashers in dm east, palis can do some aoe farming on undeads.
---
but if i was playing heals i'd make money with professions like herbing/alching.
---
Like someone else said, Female troll has the most straight-up/normal posture. They make great tanks and good dps with their bloodlust racial. Theyre pretty good mages too.
---
I like the female troll-model, doesnt seem very popular though.
---
Depends what you think is fun. I guess you can look at it two ways:
---
1) Druid has the most diverse playstyle thanks to shapeshifting forms
---
2) All the druid forms are extremely primitive compared to other classes
---
I lean toward #2. While the class has a broad scope of playstyles, none of them really feel fulfilling. Bear form is a pale imitation of a prot warrior, cat form is pathetic compared to rogue, balance doesn't hold a candle to mage and resto is basically the worst healer in vanilla. It's not so bad that it's unplayable, but unless you value being able to do many things over being good at them, it's not very satisfying. Each form has so few abilities that you can barely fill a hotbar. Playing a level 60 feral druid kinda just feels like playing a level 20 warrior or rogue.
---
I want that as an expansion for classic ... or atleast expand on the area south of tanaris and fit in some 5man dungeons in there
---
You too dude
---
You're still a priest, yeah fear ward is good but you're still more than valuable if you're a good healer. 
---
I just got lucky that my favourite priest race got fear ward. Helicopter hair healing \o/
---
Am i required to buy the newest expansion to play classic?
---
Can you read? I literally said I understand they need to test the beta, but thousands of players were waiting for beta access, they tease them with this, then they take it away after they’ve used the players for their own test.
---
I'll tell you straight up that feral is only good until level 40 then once you hit 60, you'll get dunked on by every other class in pvp. Mainly because your attack damage DOES NOT SCALE with weapons like a rogue or a warrior would. 
---
Just dont, unless you want a 20 minute long 1v1 of you fighting a warrior
---
Nice blog post, so relatable, upvoted.
---
I'm gonna puke if i hear "world first" used in the context of classic even once more. Ironic or not.
---
The live economy wasn't ruined from WoW tokens in my opinion, Blizzard fucked it up over the last two expansions with the Garrison and Legion mission tables. You could just absolutely pump gold out of those with very little effort. 
---
The token initially was fine when it couldn't be redeemed for Bnet balance, only for game time. I don't personally believe legalising gold selling is the issue, it's just how Blizz goes about it.
---
It was said somewhere that you might not see it til a few hours before it's open. I know sounds odd for all the people who share there stress test invites but it'll come around. They want as many people as they can to make the stress test the best
---
mace spec
---
It's incredible they even responded to this witch hunt. I'm very happy with the outcome of this.
---
Too*
---
Fuck me is it too much for streamers to clean their things once every ten years?
---
This is the real meta
---
It was like 80 vs 80 at some point. Can you imagine how poorly retail WoW would have handled this due to the game trying to shard people? I've seen Asmon try to raid Org and the whole ordeal just ends up fizzling out in an hour due to server lag and sharding. Meanwhile this battle between Staysafe and Soda lasted between 2 to 4 hours and it seems like people with halfway decent machines weren't experiencing much server latency. 
---
If Blizzard isn't learning anything from this Classic Beta in terms of improving Retail than they never will. Long live Classic.

Hi, /u/synetic707
---
Holy mother of boomers
---
Warrior With Mana op
---
Hah! No way!
---
Corporations in general aren't something that should just be blindly trusted, and Blizzard has done quite a bit of things that have been in bad faith over the last year. On top of a shitty Blizzcon, a rushed and buggy BFA, dismissal of feedback on BFA, lack of transparency on Classic until VERY recently, the level of greed their ingame shop has gotten to, as well as their layoffs and change of leadership, yeah. I can see not wanting to have the faith in them I had during, hell, the days of Legion.
---
Personally, I'll be shocked if Blizzard doesn't put experience potions, WoW tokens, TCG items, or character boosts into Classic. They'll probably wait till phase 3 or 4 to do it, but I have no doubt in my mind its coming. It's free money, they'll take the PR hit after they hooked a core audience in. They completely did a 180 with WoD (cutting most of it, adding flying, etc), and things like the "exclusive" boat mount. No doubt in my mind the folks working on this WANT to keep the game authentic and please the fans. But it's not going to stay that way.
---
No I believe it was ruined by people not wanting to interact with the rest of the community they got exposed to by LFG and cross-realm.
---
You can't fully blame tools for the result, if you don't use them properly you end up with a shit job but the tool did exactly what you used improperly for. The community is the main factor that changed over time I believe.
---
I'll just say this. If a warrior or hunter or paladin roll on Cruel Barb when a rogue is there, theyre assholes.
---
Why so, you earned it, it's your right to do whatever you want with it. See you at the release :)
---
printing one at the work right now :D
---
Sign me the heck up. Molten core all day. Might actually be able to raid on the front with multiple characters.
---
!RemindMe 105 days
---
I does not matter, it needs to be harder. Actual progression and difficulty is what makes vanilla good. I cleared every raid on Pservers and it was a total breeze even with my semi casual guild. "Hardcore" guilds where speedrunning stuff in 30 to 60min full clear. Elites need to destroy you solo, red mobs need to scare you, raids need to kick your ass.
---
This way you are pushed to play better and work together with your guild to overcome harder content. If we get the same nerfed easy values I think alot of the people will be disappointed in the difficulty.
---
Are they streaming beta?
---

---
The infamous Paladin "cheat" which only last 6s, with a 5 min cooldown and push longanimity, which prevent any possibility of casting other "cheated bubble" or holy hands for 1mn.
---
Yeah Paladins are known to suck at almost everything in Classic but I love their lore, and I still enjoy it.
---
And I can legitimately yell at warlocks and warries when they won't let me 10s to up my threat on a pack (hello crusader strike) so that's fine.
---
But the best part is to put blessing of salvation instead of power or kings ^_^.
---
"For all of what is sacred, I'm nerfing you !!!"
---
okay so i got in as well and it says "beta &amp; stress test" which implies we have access to the beta AND the stress test. so a bit confused i am praying that after the stress test we can be beta testers also
---
Started forming a guild myself pre launch that I plan to keep building on
---
I actually took random timestamp in the video saw consecration hit 13 different targets and instantly closed the video and concluded that you're a moron.
---
Joana’s guide then.
---
But yeah, everyone’s right, you don’t get down to 5 days without having specifically practiced vanilla speedrunning. 9-10 days /played is downright efficient.
---
That map isn’t bad aside from Australia being part of Antarctica.
---
You wanna know the real downer here?
---
I have 33 hours left on my subscription.
---
stress test is the non-streamer test.
---
as in, streamers will be in it too, but as you aren't a streamer, you aren't worthy enough to be in the regular beta.
---

People dont realize that viper sting is one of the most broken spells in pvp. Just keep rotating between people in group pvp and spamming it until they all run out of mana. 
---
You'll not deal lots of damage, you're mostly there to slow, knockback, and drain the enemy and preventing the rogues from stealthing
---
It's human nature to bitch, it require discipline and a strong mind to not bitch. But most people lack both and therefore bitch. Be poor; bitch. Be rich; bitch. Struggling with bills; bitch. Afraid to lose money; bitch. Men bitch, whine, complain and take every opportunity to tell everyone how superior they are by saying that they started playing earlier than other players. The bitching knows no bounds.

Wow will be perfect for when your kid wakes you up at 4am and you have time to kill

If you install the battlenet client you can stream Retail WoW to your laptop and create lvl1 characters - I used this to test whether my old laptop could handle WoW.
---
From the Battlenet client you can stream Retail WoW to your laptops without a subscription and test how they handle it. If they can handle Retail they can handle Classic.
---
lol damn I had 100/100 fiber metro connection by then. I had 0.5 Mbit ADSL by end of 1998

I got stress test rdy, but havent recieved any email lol

Yep, same.
---
Why are we worried about name change before any of us got our names? If you’re worried about not liking it, just put work into finding options you like

If you want name change so you can ninja and get away with it, that’s another matter
---
Hi, /u/Gennaken
---
Just because you can't be an undead shaman on fucking PRIVATE SERVERS doesn't mean you couldn't in vanilla, okay? Jesus.
---
will blizzard go the way like Jagex went with Oldschool Runescape?
---
They confirmed they won’t do it though.
---
As a Warlock they were the bane of my existence while leveling after lvl 40. Fuck Bestial Wrath.
---
Actually laughed out loud, hahahha
---
The whole point of a stress test is to have a lot of people online, more people than there are streamers. 
---
Don't be so salty at Blizz giving access to streamers and youtubers. Of course they want those people to have access so that they can stream the content for tens of thousands of people to see. It builds hype for the game to have those people streaming classic. Would you honestly prefer it if streamers didn't get invites and those ~50 beta invites went to normal people and no one got to watch classic content?
---
Wow what a legend, thank you so much.
---
You're welcome! Hope you enjoy it :)
---
Woow
---
Someone posted on this subreddit Joana killing the same mob showing classic beta and his level 1-60 retail vanilla side by side. Showing that the retail vanilla mob did far more damage.
---
Are you talking about the Stoneskin totem bug?
---
you never been purged, bursted, or one shotted by a shaman I suppose
---
Blizzard has stated that there is an issue with intermittent "phasing". It should be fixed by the end of beta.
---
They literally made an aprils fool joke about making pandaren playable races.
---
They're open to the idea of the community wants it.
---
That's the real fear here, dungeons in wow are a huge mess (by that I mean not a corridor like modern mmo) with unclear packs of mobs. This a content people know since long, and some will literally discover it (like myself). As a random, I feel obligated to play dps/heal so that I don't lead the team in the dungeons. I hope douchebag will calm down and realize it is, indeed a new start, and some player will literally start wow with that.
---
Going onto retail is not a solution. The story is a mess there, the leveling is outpaced, you can't enjoy the content of everything before MOP
---
No. This has been explained by blue posts
---
No, because the Beta servers are being taken down during the stress test but its running the same client.
---
Why is this not pinned?
---
Fantastic work, thank you for putting the time and effort into this.
---
Or it could just be a 1-2 damage difference at high level content too and be only a 1ish% difference?
---
AB without mounts is horrible though.
---
Fiber in my city arrived 3 yeard ago..
---
Just here to say I can't stand that guy.... That is all.
---
Right, I get it.  Not sure why an ambiguous phase was used however.
---
Got my first final exam tomorrow. Nice timing😂
---
Speak for yourself ! Should of added IMO , but ab without mounts is awesome still in itself
---
You give them summons, soulstone and healthstone, they give you heals in return. It's like symbiotic parasites.
---
Racial segregation, huh.
---
If you read the email you’ll see that you can continue to play after the stress test up to level 5 until May 23. It’s kinda Beta if your an optimist. Which means you get one lick..one lick only!
---
I don't think so.
---
well do you wanna heal? if so go pally. new and new faction could be a great experience.
---
im sure they will go to tbc and warlocks are the gods of tbc, so maybe level a horde warlock alt later down the line so its 60 ready for tbc launch.
---
It happens on private servers as well - with talents in shadow reach I can match the range of ranged/caster mobs but it's outside of my wand range.
---
Accept mass-invites while leveling, if the Guild is toxic and edgy enough to be entertaining stay until lvl 55-60, then start looking for a raiding guild which needs my class. As a healer that won’t be too hard I assume, last time I played on a pserver I got a raiding spot as a lvl 57 Shaman with pretty much no serious raid experience by the merit of being able to write a proper application and willing to heal.
---
^
---
I really hope they do. I would love to replay tbc but we're basically going to end back up to Bfa eventually if they go that route. I'd love something fresh like expanding on classic
---
&gt;defect (Synonym: bug) -  An imperfection or deficiency in a work product where **it does not meet its requirements or specifications**. (ISTQB Glossary )
---
We can't see wow documantaion and developers wanna to make "original" game, so at this point we can use original 1.12 game's mechanics as "requirements or specifications".
---
In original 1.12 you " **Can't** shift + right click compare stats on items ". In today beta you can.
---
So this function doesn't meet its "specification". So we must report it as a bug, so developers will have a look at it.
---
Correct me if i am wrong.
---
P.S. Of course only Blizzard can make their final decision what is bug and what is not. But at 1st time when players (or QA) discover something and open ticket, it receives status "Open". So everything what has differences between 1.12 and beta must be reported as "bug".
---
I started playing during mid high school at the end of tbc which kinda screwed up my grades. Now I have to turn in my college thesis 4 days after release
---
Level cap is 30 on beta and it's opening up a lot of new opportunities. Tethis (level 43 elite raptor) is the objective of the final Raptor Mastery quest in STV to get a pretty great chest piece for rogues and hunters so I worked together with a friend to take him down.
---
Tired of you retail beta babies coming in and trying to ruin everything that made the original Friends &amp; Family alpha so good.
---
Fact. Keybinds are faster than clicking. So you can be a very good clicker, but not a very good player...
---

---
God I can't wait for all the shitty guilds with. Ames that reference their tiny private server, hell even one that got 240k people to sign some shit is nothing in wow terms.
---
The ass kissing and elitist view of private servers being the reason for classic will be so fucking annoying.
---
It's a couple of hours on midnight, not too bad.. ?
---
To add to this fear ward makes onyxia and nefarion much much easier! I remember we had nef on farm and one week our dwarf priest didnt show up and we wiped like 4 times on him because we were so used to having fear ward xD
---
u mean talent? frost is your raid, pvp and leveling spec for the entirity of the game until you get geared from AQ then fire is good.
---
What absolute maniac has their own nameplate turned on? Do you forget you’re own characters name or something.
---
It was initally just "beta server" but due to them just added a server called stress test they just tacked that on.
---
She will never know cos she’s at work when I play!
---
15 damage is stupidly low though. The turtles on the beach in hinterlands hit for similar amounts as normal mobs; it was never a massive difference. Same for the ones in the oasis in The Barrens. For 15 damage to be okay with the turtles, it would mean that they're hitting for close to 60% less damage. Plus, crabs are known to be a defensive pet too, yet they still hit pretty hard.
---
If you dont mind could you PM me me what items u make in tail and de in enchant to be able to do it.

can you write what happen, I will not give him a click\^\^
---
That’s what I’m hoping, is that if the servers hold up okay they’ll open the gates a bit more to the beta.
---
I levelled as fire on private servers, I wouldn't call it a mistake, but it certainly did not make things easy, unless in the sense of PvP, then yeah, you're fucking terrifying once you get into stranglethorn.
---
kalimdor is oddly small

Most of us just want to be sure that Classic WoW is as accurate and authentic as possible. I'm much happier that the community raised this concern and Blizzard tested it, than if everyone just ignored it in the first place.
---
Asmongold on the other hands only cares about being right and shitting on people.
---
World of Warcraft Classic
---
can you expound on what they did for people not in the know
---
Is your experience with hunters from 2004? I've played on a vanilla server for the past year and I've met some terrible, terrible hunters. Just awful players. But none of them expected to get Thunderfury, most didn't forget to dismiss their pets when doing the mc skip, if they did then it happened once and never again, and they don't need on downgrades unless it's their first raid and they don't understand how important weapon speed is for example and think Striker's Mark would be an upgrade from their blue bow.
---
He looks like he just got a BJ, when he hears his youtube clip was mentioned in a blue post
---
How is this insult if it's just a simple proof that the fanboys were wrong? Does this mean Blizzard is insulting them too when using Asmongold's material as proof?
---
Is it a shit post tho
---
Not DM, that’s for sure. Nobody ever says “LFG DM”. Nobody ever does all of Dire Maul at once.
---
VC is mostly a private server thing.
---
Yeah next tick would break stealth.  
---
 Some rouge vanish between ticks, and then it wont matter if dot broke him out of stealth, they would been aware and got what they needed from the vanish anyway.
---
Because tauren are cool and pandas are quite goofy. honestly I bet the reception to pandaren would have been so much smoother if they had a more serious looking design, something closer to a furbolg.
---
for pvp i suggest orc or gnome depending on faction. orc is great for stun res and gnome helps alot with arcane resist + escape artist.
---
Literally said "Lets stfu about it until it actually becomes stale"
---
 How does theory crafting  what Blizzard might do cause any harm? It's fun and fills the time between now and August.
---
Ho boy he's going to be ripped when AQ comes out and he needs to do Orgri - Silithus everyday
---
theres been an argument if the classic elite damage numbers are correct and a blue post confirms that they are so asmongold insults everyone who thought otherwise
---
don't be a loser for once in your life
---
Please delete your WTF folder. BY THE LIGHT OF THE MOON! \\\*POOF\\\*
---
I like the video were he slams his head on the table. Lol
---
its not even his main youtube channel, don't "worry" lol
---
Hes a real piece of shit.
---
Getting off work 1 hour before the test, then I got six hours until my next work session. Sleep? nah I need some stressss
---
I did everything as Hpriest back in Vanilla. Once you have good enough 5-man stuff at 60, you'll farm decent with no need to respec.
---
But there's no magic option, every healer will farm slower than dps, but you'll still outfarm prot. Just be ready to run a lot in pvp since Disc is a shit spec at vanilla. SP is very good at it but not wanted in 5 and very restricted in 40.
---
If you want to have a guaranteed raid spot, go Alliance and roll Dwarf. For the Horde Resto Shaman is more sought after than Priest.
---
That's actually unbelievably pathetic lmao.
---
Vanilla was so long ago pretty much anything anyone remembers from level 1-59 from memory is minimal 
---
its right for us to bring these things up because it catches stuff like the totem bug they are going to fix. 
---
I think its expected that pserver players use those servers to some extent as a reference , we have no access to the source material classic is based on so memory is just not enough to pick up every bug
---
You’re doing it right!
---
Whichever guild tabard matches my armor obviously
---
His community is pure toxic, they all act like little kids.
---
 Ye, they actually do something while at paid developer work, such devotion, appreciation thread shall be made!
---
No. I had no WoW installed, and there was the Beta &amp; Stresstest tab. It's like 9 GB to download.
---
There were more pandaren content than gnome content in wc3. Literally you could replace gnome with pandaren in vanilla and the world would be more coherent.
---
Its usually a couple of hours late but it really doesnt matter if you get the mail or not. Blizzard mail is usually slower than their other services - I get mails for their other games like a day later after the said game had something newsworthly.
---
Yeah, sure I want to try healing, and I guess pala is the most chill for that with their crits giving return mana.
---
But its mostly just for the AFK leveling experience, warlock is already pretty afk with dots + wand while the void is tanking.While on a pala you just auto-attack 90% of the time.
---
All of a sudden these two scrubs are the faces of wow classic? Why? :(
---
Sweet that’s what I’ve been seeing. Thanks for the reply! Hope it’s not a dumb question, but do you have any recommendations on builds? I’ve been seeing some that are almost all frost, and others that are more heavy in arcane/frost.
---
If I had a camera on me 40 hours a week I would probebly say way worce things sometimes. 
---
Watch him if you like him, don't watch him if you don't.
---
sorry for being that guy but it is called sharding/layering not phasing :D
---
Peggle came out Feb 2007, so defo TBC, give your memory more credit :D
---
It looks like we're in just for the stress test. Here's to hoping though! Glad to have the opportunity to even do this :)
---
Yep, im horde for life, but if i ever just wanna chill and watch a series, i will probably level a paladin alt, just for the different scenery and easy mode leveling. Slow but steady.
---
It's not the elite boss damage that needs testing it's the Non boss elite damage, why arent they getting this?
---
why would you lie about this? Blizzard stated that you need an active sub
---
What do you mean by heal?
---
Warlocks can self heal with drain life, Hunters can heal their pets. These are probably the two strongest solo PvE classes.
---
If you mean healing like dungeons and raids, the answer is there isn't one. You can't viably farm in a healing spec for any of the healers. You'd be better off making two characters, one to farm with and one to heal with.
---
How do you make these?
---
Yeah especially mid-week :(
---
I'd love it if they could do a stress test on a weekend, it wouldn't be a problem to not sleep for it.
---
Nice stupid clickbait post
---
there is the neutral panda monk in retail though ...
---
Neat, did they migrate everything? So my account should still be around with all my GoT shitposts?!?
---
Man, ppl did 4 man Ony back in the day, what are you talking about? Anything prior to AQ40 is a joke
---
Can't wait to wake up here once again, always and forevermore!
---
Yea so? That doesn’t mean people didn’t do more stuff like this in Vanilla at all.
---
Might have been totem bug. Don’t know. The video that was posted was probably posted before that was a known issue.
---
I mean, hes right, even if hes being condescending about it.
---
Because that would turn the next 3 months into a permanant stress test wouldnt it?
---
The World of Warcraft Classic Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test. Once the stress test period is over, you’ll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.
---
You're welcome to publicly share your experiences and adventures in the beta, so feel free to stream, record video, and post screenshots. Remember, your feedback will directly impact the quality of the final game—our developers are standing by!
---
 People are mainly talking about elite mob damage, not one particular boss. But this 15min test from Blizz somehow convinced half of this sub that they already tested everything lol and they are busy jizzing their pants at how awesome Blizz is.
---
If you happen to have your old wow game boxes and the original activation codes that came with them. Blizzard should be able to restore the account for you.
---
Sooo I'm playing from overseas (so I will have to deal with 200-400ms) and kind of wondering what the best class is to deal with that. I'm looking to mostly be leveling with a priest/solo. 
---
I was originally thinking warrior but trying to get a main/off tanking spot with high-ping seems to be a no-go. I'm thinking of either Hunter or a restro druid. 
---
I'm looking to get into a guild that sees most of the raiding content but I'm not terribly concerned with topping meters, (which again is unlikely do to the ping) and would prefer a class where I a little of big of lag on my end doesn't ruin the fun for the other 39 people and at the same time being able to be a valuable member of the raid (and actually get a raid spot with 300 ping lol)
---
Is the beta client up for download yet if we got in the stress test?
---
Nobbel!
---
So, am I the only one who doesn't have a region selection drop down menu? I just have the play button with nothing above it.
---
That would be the perfect time to set up the UI and not at the actual launch, indeed.
---
I guess after playing the game for 15 years and having a massive brain is the "vanilla experience". I mean like 99% of Vanilla players were clickers.
---
Disagree. Legalizing gold selling is a problem because it redistributes wealth from the top. A lot of people don't think about this, but consider:  
---
A player who is a huge AH Baron and has 1 million gold is unlikely to ever spend even a fraction of it. They're amassing wealth for the sake of it; the number itself is their game, and they're playing to make it as big as possible. They have no intention to spend that gold, which effectively makes them a gold sink. Their gold is out of the economy forever.  
---
With WoW tokens, they will start buying them up and redistributing their gold. This turns them into a new faucet for gold into the economy.   
---
The overall effect is massive inflation.  
---
So as a result: WoW tokens do more than just legalize buying gold. They also provide a path to *sell* gold to people who would otherwise be effectively "deleting" the gold from the system.  
---
In addition, more people buy gold once it's legal to do so. This means poor people spend more than they otherwise would have. This drives up all prices. The AH baron who was buying up all the &lt;whatever&gt; to craft the &lt;whatever else&gt; that they used to make their profits doesn't care. They'll just pay more for the &lt;whatever&gt; and up the price of the &lt;whatever else&gt; to compensate. This just leads to overall rampant inflation for everyone except the legitimate players.  
---
Gold selling/buying is actually not terrible for an economy if done in a small amount. If done by a greater percentage of the population, however, there's a positive feedback loop.
---

Nobble87 on YouTube has lore videos for just about everything in WoW. His channel has this [playlist](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GGChOIUC3JI&amp;list=PLV3Yvqnl3FYdyi9i55IOCb2oJYUkiNFNw) that might be of interest to you.
---
Or lag/delay?
---
In second 1 of the video you can see the characters behind the textbox
---
We might have the beta server unlock afterwards but I doubt it considering the classic beta folder is only 164MB, unless I'm missing something painfully obvious.
---
I’m trying to decide if to go prot warrior ( played prot in BC/TLK) or try out healing for a change, thinking paladin.
---
My biggest worry is that getting a tank spot in raids will be a pain and I’d rather not be one of the many dps warriors. 
---
But by going healer raid spots should be easier to come  by (right?) but five mans may be a pain. 
---
Am I just over thinking this ? I just don’t want to respec a hole bunch or spend too my time waiting for groups (limited play time)
---
Here comes the flood of "game DOA" because something happened once in a beta
---
While druids are one of the most fun classes, there burst damage sucks so pvp can be a drag and requires alot of patience. There also the worst healers.
---
Personally with no WSG until BWL and also AV coming out at the same time effectively making WSG dead, i wont be touching druid, maybe an alt twink or something for low level world pvp.
---
Searches the LFG monday tread untill I found a guild that got what I'm searching for.
---
- SemiHC/HC raiding
---
- True vanilla raiding history
---
- Officer team that seems invested into the guild
---
- not PC, save space for all kinds of humor and discussion
---
- Room for a mage
---
I hope someone can answer me my question:
---
When navigating to https://account.blizzard.com/games, does the classic Beta / stress test show up as Legion PTR Account?
---
I am at work and I am unable to check my launcher and the account hasn't been there before.
---
Dishonorable horde scum...
---
well if you do you also have time to write down Dire Maul I guess
---
The "secret cave" in STV video that supposedly had an NPC selling the Bengal Tiger mount in it always stuck with me through life. Was two gnomes wall jumping there with Mindless Self Indulgence in the background.
---
Yeah what a terrible idea, testing the limits of your very large game over the course of 3 months rather than 2 hours
---
&gt;I am sure there will be another stress test for.
---
Well, if you checked the classic release date announcement page, it clearly stated 3 different stress test dates.
---
* Stress Test 1: Wed May 22–Thurs May 23
---
* Stress Test 2: Wed Jun 19– Thurs Jun 20
---
* Stress Test 3: Thurs Jul 18– Fri July 19
---
\*Dates of each stress test are subject to change.
---
Couldn't give a better response than this
---
Aw, that sucks. I think the servers are up for at least 24hr so you can level up a toon to level 5 as a reward for an exam done! :D (Unless you have more :S )
---
I’m worried there will be too many horde players.
---
For many EU countries it's 2am to 4am since we have daylight saving right now and that's GMT+2.
---
Definitely remember getting stuck in the mines and eventually getting rezzed by the healer. Fun times.
---
Yeah I have a second wow legion PTR (WoW 1) and (WoW 4) on my launcher.. looks like you got in buddy, enjoy
---
Devour magic from the fel hunter maybe? We have little information to work with here :P
---
16:50 this part had me in tears, holy fuck 😂
---
Frost Mage is probably the easiest class to play and arguably the strongest class to play. It's the perfect choice for anyone with any sort of lag issues.
---
Honestly, you've just described a druid. If you play feral you can really disrupt the enemy team and carry your team. You are very much a hybrid, being able to do damage in cat, take damage in bear and then heal. You're survivability is insane.
---
Check out EBN for some good guides etc.
---
Good for farming as well if that helps.
---
Lol meanwhile I am ditching my husband for Classic 🤣
---
We know a lot of people will pick Warrior. 
---
Do you guys think there'll be *too* many Warriors? To a point where it impacts individual players?
---
Same question for Mages.

The stress test is only two hours. Roughly the time that you need to hit the cap of level 5. Just set your settings and addons in order so you are ready for launch without needing to fiddle with stuff!
---
Hi, /u/Rhederred
---
Any magic dispel or damage taken will break it.  
---
Warlocks can have their felhunter dispel it.  
---
There's also heartbeat resistances that can make it end early.

I'm dueling on a Vanilla server, I think he had a Voidwalker but I'm not sure

---
Yeah it’s nice to set graphics settings and key binds. Hopefully I won’t have to set them again at launch
---
If you can only buy game time it keeps the token price low. WoW tokens only sold for around 20k before you could redeem them for Bnet balance. 
---
The advantage is a safe way for players to buy gold. Many of those players are going to buy gold anyway, the token provides a safe way to do so without risk to account security. The easiest way to tackle gold sellers is to just regulate the practice.
---
It will be interesting to see if they add a token though. I'm not actually convinced they'll do it anyway
---
I wouldn’t say the meme specs don’t bring anything. They have their niches like totems, paladin blessings and balance having that 3% Crit buff
---
world first puke for over using world first in classic
---
So Viper Sting breaks it too?
---
Asmongold is not renowned for his subtly of speech.
---
Thats just the client having info such realms can exists. They will choose if they want to actually add one or not
---
Haha fuck me.
---
quality shitpost
---
Would be confusing for people to have that information if no realm exist, they could just easily add it when they release them in that case.
---
🤢Oh god oh fuck here we go 🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮🤮
---
Sellout
---
Will level a troll hunter on my own pace, raids are atrocious and boring in vanilla anyway and I have no intent on doing end game.
---
I mean it's a single day, a personal day here and there is pretty nice and if it's for something you're excited for it can't do much harm. Depends what you're missing at work I suppose
---
Blasted lands in Northrend:O
---
Healer will always be the go to for anyone looking to do dungeon and raid content. You're right in that if you play a tank, you're gonna have a hard time finding a raid slot and if you play DPS, you'll have a hard time finding a group slot.
---
yes as long as you use the right gear
---
Thank you for your suggestion. I will have to try a druid in Beta once I get invited for it to see if I like it or not.
---
I think he means vanilla.
---
Authentic
---
Its hard to remember all original game stats, everything was new and many players was playing first mmorpg game. Its not possible to get same experience because so many players know all the bosses now. Maybe some new players can feel the difficulty and should make guilds without veterans. If you are playing the game first time, don't do any speed leveling or any full leveling guide. Of course you can search quests online if get stuck and check some class talents stuff, because that was available in vanilla.
---
Oooor just stay at work 1 hour longer for a week and buy gold from overtime money.
---
And you need to realize just because something is good mechanically does not mean someone will like it thematically. 
---
Warcraft has always had some comedic parts but was by a lot of people considered dark and brutal. Then when you turn around and make an entire expansion around the theme of something that was largely considered a joke from wc3 and it has this more cartoony asthetic with the fat yet agile bouncy bears, it ruins this idea of what the world is for people. 
---
I was the same way, and did not play until a friend had a spare account he wanted me to tank for his raid on. Mechanically the game was super fun, but I still disliked the stupid pandas and the asthetic they brought to the world.
---
&gt; why wouldn't they give players who helped them out by logging in, access to the beta?  
---
Because they don't need those players. Your participation in beta is a gift to them of your time to dedicate to helping them identify bugs. It isn't a reward or a treat for you. If they don't need you, they won't use you.  
---
&gt; away after they’ve used the players for their own test.
---
Which is literally the definition of a beta, you entitled baby. Beta testers are testers. They are to be used and discarded as needed. If you don't like it, don't beta test. It's that simple.  
---
And to address your other dumbassery:  
---
&gt; Yeah what a terrible idea, testing the limits of your very large game over the course of 3 months rather than 2 hours  
---
Who cares how large the game is? They don't need to test their scaling design for more than a day or two to be sure it works. Once they know it works, make some adjustments, try again in the next stress test, etc. After the test, they want to go back to beta testing the actual content and not testing the underlying architecture until they're ready for the next stress test, so no reason to leave so many people in.    
---
Also, you have a totally shitty entitled personality. I'd hate to be your family/friends/girlfriend because you are intolerable. I can only hope you grow out of it by the time your balls drop, you garden variety lamer.
---
Oh what it must have been like back in EQ. I still regret not begging my parents to pay the sub when it came out.
---
shame no bgs for atleast 6-8 months :(
---
Haven't thought about youtube.. Thank you!
---
Got the email but no option to download hope it's there before it starts :(
---
**Alliance Priest**
---
Doubting what race to play:
---
NE is out of the question, because NE.
---
Female Human is out of the question because they have only one casting animation (which is kinda boring) and I don't like how their posture/gear looks.
---
I think the only think holding me back from going full on Male Dwarf is the fact that this time around there might just be so many Dwarf Priests (kind of like Undead Rogue in Vanilla, they made up like 75%+ of all Horde Rogues despite three race choises) and people might think I'm a min/maxer (which I am not). I will be having a (Male) Dwarf Rogue as alt.
---
Talk me into a decision!
---
* Male Human
---
   * \+ Nice casting animations
---
   * \+ Gear looks good
---
   * \+ Spirit racial
---
   * \- Lacking in the fantasy department
---
   * \- Will be casual player: Might miss out on raids due to non-Dwarf
---
* Male Dwarf
---
   * \+ Nice heal animation
---
   * \+ Stoneskin, + Fear Ward
---
   * \+ Coolest Alliance race fantasy wise
---
   * \- Stupid shadow casting animation
---
   * \- Afraid there will be an abundance of Dwarf Priests
---
* Female Dwarf
---
   * \+ Doubt there will be a lot of female Dwarfs
---
   * \- Gear doesn't look to good on em
---
   * \- Don't know if I will enjoy looking at the character 1-60 and beyond
---
Just install BFA trial and try it yourself?..
---
Dont get me wrong i would love a beta invite (EU here so chances are pretty slim). All we can hope for is a large batch of invites roll out after the stress test at least.
---
Got the invite but no option on the launcher :(
---
I like the optimism peeps. 👍. I will be gone with RL stuff but I hope all goes well for you guys. Enjoy!
---
As some have already mentioned, I didn't get an e-mail but I noticed that I had gained access about 7 hours ago, curious to whether it's delayed or just not sent out to those that install the client or alike before the scheduled send-out?
---
They do.
---
- clear all raids
---
- pvp rank 11isch
---
- full t3 depents on how long naxx is open
---
-
---
I mean he's right and most of the private server community and others that think they're experts of the game for ages have been doing worse and are finally being called out on their bullshit and suddenly it's not okay to shit on people ? 
---
You guys shit on retail players everyday but when you get shit on for justified reasons you whine.
---
People mentioning about the client and no mail being sent out  being at work curious af if I got in or not...
---
Private server retards downvoting you 😂
---
All 3 volumes of the wow chronicle will catch you up nicely.
---
I suppose that in a stress test blizzard employees are on deck, and so working hours are probably best for them.
---
Also my favourite so far.
---
God are you a dumb fuck
---
Thanks! That looks really promising!
---
Horde scum I will see you on the battle field and take great pleasure in bringing down a great and holy judgment upon thee.
---
Speak for urself
---
Depends. There will never be enough warriors with regard to tanking normal dungeons but if you want a good raid spot (especially as a tank) you propably need to stand out a bit and bring some skill and knowledge. As a mage you shouldnt have a problem finding groups or joining raids.
---
I played retail vanilla, so shut your worthless mouth
---
If you can get 75 fishing in 2 hours you're a champ.
---
Sylvanas did literally nothing wrong.
---
Aahh, that's why I fished mostly driftwoods and junk in TB.
---
Not the place to be advertising when people are asking genuine questions...
---
The game was originally released as RuneScape 2 was, back in 2007, but rather than follow the timeline of RuneScape 3 they instead created new original content to add to the game. The community would vote on the content if they wanted it in the game or not requiring a majority of 75% to pass.
---
For example with classic WoW, after Naxx they would not progress to TBC, but instead release more content for classic and keep the game level 60. Maybe a level 60 Karazahn raid or release Hyjal as a level 60 zone/raid, the idea for new original content seems much more exciting in my opinion. The could add features from TBC even such as arena.
---
I was subbed from february 2006 to mid 2008 on EU more than 100 days played. I resubbed on my EU account on the 16th of May for a shot at the beta (foolish move but I sort of want to play). I checked the beta box on beta preference webpage one day before the beta start.       
---
I got an email last night around 10pm EST but my launcher did not have an option until 12pm+ and I also did not see anything on my account details page, now I see    
---
 World of Warcraft®: Legion (WoW2)
---
Public Test Realm    
---
The regular PTR test server has the same name but is WoW1.     
---
I have sent a few tickets to support in the last days to clarify some aspects of my account, it felt as if the database was not updating instantly once I reactivated my account and asking if I was eligible for beta. They don't have power to put you in but I wonder if it had any effect.       
---
I also made a lvl11 gnome on the american servers this last weekend in order to posts on their forums.   
---
It is impossible to know if my account was selected for my NA or EU account but the later seems more probable. the email just has my battlenet name on it.
---
None of the books are required to understand what's up in the game per se. Honestly, just play Warcraft III + Frozen Throne, it's the direct prequel to WoW Vanilla, The Bruning Crusade and Wrath of the Lich King as well.
---

 The Last Guardian,  Day of the Dragon, The War of the Ancients (trilogy) are my personal favourites.
---
And the private server community isn't toxic?
---
You may only share your account with your kids. But if you swap houses aswell no one will find out.
---
But I would not risk it.
---
The issue is not that they can't release RPPvP realms, they're still having an internal debate whether or not they *want* to.
---
Dwarf is a nobrainer alliance side.
---
I played Human at the time, and was in raids just cause I was good enough. Heard a lot about Fear Ward, enough to not make another human. Believe me, It's a dealbreaker.
---
you also might be thinking about when swiftly had everyone login as gnomes and dwarves crashing the server as they ran to ironforge.
---
Sounds great! The path not trodden...
---
So.. i guess OP is a pserver APE that's mad, gotcha.
---
Youre overthinking it. Finding groups (either raid or dungeon) as a healer will be easy.
---
Got my invite but no option to download it lol
---
I created a google docs for our IRL group to show class distribution and what faction everyone wants to play (the faction with most "votes" will be the one everyone plays), we used to all play wow from vanilla to around wotlk, then eventually people went to other genres; mobas, fps, br, tcgs, irl (terrible genre imo), this will be the one game where we all get united again. As of right now we have around 20 people, 0 warriors though... no one wants to endure that leveling process... But we are all super excited!
---
Goes without saying

Thanks for clearing that up.

Then , when the time has come for me to raid (a bit behind the first wave, as I am not the fastest leveler) I look for a guild that has raid times that suit me. This is the most important factor for me as these days I can't just game whatever night, I have to carefully plan it for an extended period of time.   If a suitable guild is available I go through the motions, apply, tell something about myself and my history in the game, make sure I am prepared, have the required gear etc  (I don't go all out collecting every last piece of prebis gear, but I make sure I am capable of the job that will be required from me as junior raider)

The elements will destroy you!
---
31/5/15 was one of the most common warrior builds in vanilla
---
Deep wounds is super low priority as a debuff, so it’s the first one to get pushed off by any other debuff when debuff limit is reached. No one should be able to get pissed off about it.
---
Dude, I've been with my gf for 5 years and I dread the arguments because I want to play classic.
---
There will probably be too many DPS warriors, you'll have to be really good.
---
There's never enough tanks on this version though, so if you want to prot just go ahead.

Why’s he wearing a hat indoors ?

yet you had a 12 y.o. daughter at my age... I'd probably have to look for full time employment just to support her.

The general consensus is til around BRD.

Depending on when the change at implemented there may still be an invulnerability period after using vanish.

That's some good foresight.

Jagex released Runescape Oldschool as the 2007 game it used to be, then introduced voting polls that let people vote for *new* content made in the mindset and graphicwise of 2007.
---
It has worked great so far imo
---
i would jizz so fucking hard if we get classic hyjal, kara, ulduar, etc....
---
Vanilla druid is a true hybrid, and is vastly different from the retail specs. You can do pretty much everything, at the cost of not doing each thing as good as the specialized classes. 
---
On my server there was pretty much just one druid tank in the raiding scene and he had to go way out of his way to gather gear for tanking, and he still wasn't ever as good as a warrior. But his guild loved him so they let him. Feral in general doesn't offer that much if you go heavy into it. Treat the class as the hybrid it is and squeeze as much utility you can out of it and you'll have a good time.
---
Geez - yeah. This video inspired me to go roll a lock:
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giqsMdKt5s4
---
If this had been a new client (and/or tooltip) I would've said yes, but this confirms nothing other than this kind of realm exists on retail.
---
It depends what you want to do.
---
There has always been a shortage of tanks for dungeons and an overabundance of tanks for raids. This has been a problem throughout all of WoW's history and will probably never change.
---
If you want to raid tank, you're going to have a hard time finding a slot regardless of what class you pick. It's the dynamics of only needing 2 tanks out of 40 raid slots. If you want to dungeon tank, war/dru/pal are all viable and you should find groups instantly because there's going to be a million DPS.
---
Mage has the opposite problem. There's always a raid slot for a mage given mechanics always favor ranged DPS over melee and you bring arguably the best strongest kit to a raid. Mages will have a harder time finding groups though given the plethora of available DPS. I will say though that polymorph is insanely powerful in classic and mages are usually given top priority for DPS slots in groups as well.
---
I’d have to mute this guy.

Brewmaster monk was so fun, up until the end of mists, Shamans too (when they did reasonable heals)
---
Beta Invite: Day 1  US CE edition invite on Friday last week, was added to the launcher. Account bnet  country is set to South Africa,  so neither US or EU but the wow acc is on US.
---
Stress Test Invite: Was fooling around with multiboxing mid legion expac, for some reason  I created a separate battle.net for it. re subbed on the beta news it was invited when I work up this morning.
---
This is a very unfair system that excludes so many people. I would have expected seeing how much we all pay blizzard to come up with a more creative solution that does not purposefully exclude members of the  classic community.
---
Old school Game price sticker 👌
---
Combat Rogue
---
This is hard to say, since what you’ll play the first week and month may be very different to what you’ll play in 6 months time. I imagine a lot of people will get their highest numbers in the first stretch of free time they have after launch.
---
sorry for being that guy but sharding/layering uses phasing technology.

Did you see the title on the video?

96 days, fok

It's only today from 4-6pm PST like the email, website and official forum posts say it is.
---
Same shit i got yesterday ... Just wanted taht closed full beta not that lvl 5 shit
---
&gt;Correct me if i am wrong.
---
Sure
---
&gt;We can't see wow's documentation, and developers wanna to make "original" game, so at this point we can use original 1.12 game's mechanics as "requirements or specifications".
---
&gt;
---
No, you can't. That's not their objective and therefore your logic fails.
---
Example of a bug :
---
"when I run this program it should output the number 10. Oops, it returned 9 instead. Seems like a bug"
---
Not a bug :
---
"this program should output a 10. It does.
---
You: but I want it to output 8 instead. It's a bug"
---
If something is working like intended, it's not a bug. Asking for things to changed that are working as intended is a feature request. At the moment the combat text is from BfA. This is working as intended. If the developers had tried to change it back to vanilla, but it still was BFA it would be a bug.

Where do you get a wand at 5 on a stress test? You can’t buy one from a vendor until like lvl 15 right?
---
Not really an insult as its more him saying he was right.
---
The only thing disturbing is seing him almost ejaculate when he finds out they used his video for reference.
---
And the pserver community isn't toxic? Go sit in Barrens on the popular pserver for less then a minute. I'd be surprised if someone wasn't spamming the N word. It goes both ways. We finally have Classic, and the values are correct. People need to stop bickering
---
Got no mail but got the drop down option and installed. Waiting for stress realm now.
---
Optus are having issues connecting to international sites
---
The stress test server hasn't been online yet. It starts in 13 hours.
---
Do you already have addons? Or you just keep the free space needed in mind?
---
Bruh you don't go hotw without FFF, it's amazing for both PvP and PvE. You're basically skipping one of the main abilities the spec has. And the crit talent for catform is not good for hotw since your crit is so low without LotP, and also you're not going to be staying inside catform for long.

I got my Beta/stress test invite on my fairly new account. Created at launch of Overwatch.
---
https://i.imgur.com/q6fxCUv.jpg
---
So I have two accesses to beta?
---
Imagine being so sure of yourself, even when wrong, that you personally attack another user.  Knob.
---
It was.
---
When you're waiting since more than 10 years to play the game you loved and played on P, you have lots of things to try 1-5. I plan on leveling everything to 5 and duel people while trying to find some quest bugs.
---
Will keep me busy for the 24h.
---
Been ages since I played vanilla but, is this working as intended?
---
That said, pretty cool to look that far!
---
My guess is paladin and warlock are pretty good. Druid, mage, priest, shaman all fine. 
---
I would guess warrior, rogue, hunter are pretty trash
---
How can they ban for that lol
---
I keep shifting between Rogue or Priest. I have experience on both in vanilla, but mainly during TBC doing progression PvE on Priest and downtime PvP on Rogue as an alt.
---
I love the idea of Rogue and I want to main one this time around, I'm just not convinced it's actually the class for me.. the whole PP to make gold thing definitely isn't and the rotations in PvE hardly seem inspiring, I'm not bothered about topping meters rather than actually having an interactive play style. Thoughts?
---
You shouldn't find any issues while levelling however, dungeons will be painful
---
I would be so on board with this! Hopefully they add attunments for all the new stuff. Id hate seeing a newly dinged get boosted through the latest dungeon/raid and outgear the older contentent straight of the bat.
---
Things id love to see is something like darkmoon faire, completely pointless but fun nontheless.
---
Dungeons like mgt or forge of souls etc i rather avoid though. Id prefer that dungeons remain a thing you do before raids and not as a catch up. 
---
But maybe im just gatekeeping.
---
Gatekeeping vanilla wow.
---
I havent even been invited to the stress test. I guess blizz extrapolated the amount of stress I put on the launcher and decided its too much
---
Doing 1-75 fishing in tirisfal glades takes 23 minutes. Skills at level 4 cost 1 silver each.  
---
OP's joke is just lame. This would not be hard to do. It'd take more time to reach level 4 than it'd take to reach lv75 fishing.
---
Depends on group comp and gear
---
A good group that CCs properly and targets correctly can probably get away with a non-meta healer in just about every dungeon, you may struggle on certain bosses but that could be mitigated with good gear.
---
It really comes down to how well the group performs, most bosses can be kited if you run low on mana or the burst is too high.
---
Classic Winds, that you?
---
Don't realy care about that guy. On the other hand I feel some malicious joy whenever the private server community is proved wrong. Don't get me wrong. Beside all the drama and corruption around private servers, I think they did a great job to be as close as possible to classic. But the community of this servers is huge pile of ... (insert any insult here). There is no way to argue with them. Even now they will claim, that Blizz is faking the numbers and they were right. I can't stand them.
---
Probably disabled because the entire video would have been copyright claimed because of the music
---
I did not know the undead starting area had a garage door
---
Wait any DOT pre cast would break it?

You know what dude. Sure why not. I'll do this.
---
Streamers and 2004 accounts.
---
This is such a hard Choice.  
---
I really love Paladin's and Hunters it would be great for me with Class Identification.
---
I am a casual player and won't achieve the best gear. I want to level up, do some WPVP, and maybe slay ragnaros later.  
---
But I'm not sure if I will have fun with pallys in PvP and if im good enough for Hunters.   
---
And... what about Priests?
---
Not a big deal.
---
I have two wow accounts on my [battle.net](https://battle.net) account and regardless of how far fetched it might be, I subbed in hope of getting a beta invite. I didn't think any of it at first, but I subbed on the newest account, not the one from 2005. Anyone in a similar situation able to shed some light on this?
---
Only Druid heals? Doable but frustrating. The Druid will need to be “on” all the time to prevent deaths. 
---
Will be a tale to tell your kids though.
---
Can confirm that this works
---
You're overthinking it. Play what you want, the racial bonuses aren't that big of a deal.
---
why would blizz not release rp servers? what's the catch here ? separate customer support team or ? I mean, what the issue that may influence their decision ?   
---
Do RP servers not act and behave like other types of servers ? besides the obvious roleplay part, but software/hardware wise it's the same  
---
They worry about player division or something ?
---
I'm sure other people who frequent other gaming subs can identify that this sub is above average levels of toxic and argumentative
---
It has a 30 minutes cooldown right? That will be so annoying.
---
iirc pandarens were first announced as one of the races for original warcraft 3 as an april fools joke

---
The bluepost says that the accounts invited for stress test are flagged to receive beta access, but just not yet given it. Meaning that they most likely will get it very soon. :)
---
Unless things have changed, hasn't Blizzard's plan always been to have one RP-PVP server per region and increase that number if there's demand?
---
Am I the crazy one? I feel like I've seen so many posts lately saying that RP-PVP isn't happening, but I've never heard that from any actual source.
---
Im using the test to test my own stress about stressing out its still a long time till august.

Well not down the drain.. surely you've enjoyed wow this whole time?

:(((
---
No reason you can't play both for a bit and decide later when you have clearly idea what the play style is like.
---
damn really? could you give me the link to it?
---
Ok, thought it happened last night
---
Wildstar had many issues, and it is not at all clear that the mechanical difficulty of the content was the main reason it died. For example, the questing and leveling was pretty boring and inferior to most other current MMOs, it was a new IP, there were major performance issues that persisted long after launch despite the low fidelity graphics, the attunements were very time intensive (also compared to vanilla wow) and segmented the playerbase, and most of all, the company itself had massive internal issues with poor leadership and infighting.
---
Why? Leveling is not hard, and by no means requires a healer at any point.
---
chris probably was running out of paint
---
No lock in your group either?

what is it called in the [battle.net](https://battle.net) account ? I just saw today that I got a new wow4 shown on it with public test realm and legion ? I'm wondering if that is the stress test
---
I will play Final Fantasy 14 with her and she will play WoW with me. Problem solved. Feels good to have a gamer girlfriend.
---
&gt;But hey ... don't let me disturbe your crude rationalization.
---
His rationalization isn't crude, although I'm sure you felt really smart for typing that. Regardless of whether he's right or not, the fact that the average vanilla player was 28 is relevant. Averages don't matter here, because the average person doublechecking exact combat numbers is almost assuredly older than the average user of this sub.
---
At least Asmongold dunno how URL work on the WoW forum lol !
---
It really is. These shit-tier memes are typically here to get a rise out of people and shit on someone for playing how they want.
---
Being offended in 2019... Oh boy
---
&gt;Why do people think that damage is multiplied/reduced because of your player level? Where does this come from?
---
I would assume since this was a mechanic prior to mob scaling. I'm guessing WoD-era was when this situation was true.
---
Thanks for your answers, I'm leaning towards priest or paladin atm. Good thing there's still some time left to decide :D
---
The stress test is only for 2 hours, but the server will be open for a about a day more.
---
[From a blue post](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291829/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-22nd) 
---
"The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT)."
---
Hunters seem to fit the bill for wpvp. They are hands down the best class in pvp while leveling, your pet hits like a truck. They are a little more technical later on though but if you enjoy the class do it up.
---
I’ve already tested it. You can reach 75 in both Fishing and Cooking in less than an hour and have a full stack of Longjaw Mud Snapper for your efforts. I recommend getting Skinning and Herbalism beforehand to help scrape together the funds to purchase those skills and recipes. Check out the Level 5 section of my quest completionist guide for more information:
---
https://shadowpanther.net/questing.htm
---
Hunter is legitimately hard to play. Not only do you have to manage your own skill set but also your pets. You also have to carry ammo and food for your pets. I would not recommend playing one if you can't invest the time to learn it.
---
Pally healers are the best for PvP and Priest healers are the best for PvE. They're both fairly unique and easy to grasp classes, both good choices and highly needed.
---
Not sure you understand what a 1 shot is
---
I was thinking more about the random ninja pull or threat steal into a death and then having to walk for 10 minutes since bres is on cd.

dont listen to this guy, druid is just very very weak in bgs (except as a fc). wpvp is a different story but i would advise you to play warrior, druid is a joke in classic
---
Git gud and it won't be an issue
---
Ohh!! What was the response :P
---
I don't just mean log out inside an inn everytime you get off... Its called alt cycling. You make all your alts, put them in inns and cycle between them on who has double xp.

Aesthetics &gt; all

Unless you’re a min maker in a hardcore guild

Actually is able to play Classic and complains that it feels wrong? ITS THE BETA ATLEAST YOU ARE ABLE TO PLAY :((((((
---
Good thing cap is 60 so you'll never be able to do that :D
---
You’re right I’ll spend the other 22 hours getting BiS gear for a level 5. I’m sure the pvp content will be amazing at that level.
---
Deaths will be more punishing, as you already know. Other than that, druids are a fantastic class. It's not going to be any harder to level.
---
Well that's his thread. Should just have put it in OP in a more subtle way.

Didn't they take out the T0 dungeon sets in retail? I always wondered why, the quests to get all the pieces were just amaaaazing!

No, they are secret magical beings or mathematical savants or one fire away from becoming a monster that terrifies children in their sleep.

Original post said:  We’ll also be adding a significant number of players to the stress test from the pool of people who have already opted in for the beta but have not yet been selected.   
---
(At the end now) Ps:  Getting invited to the stress test will not impact your standing for future closed beta invites.   
---
 Sorry if I’m confusing folks but it’s pretty different situation than normal. If you got invited to the stress test you will only be able to play on the stress test.

I don't think you quite got the point: I don't care about the racials that much. The only thing about the racials is that having no FW might keep me out of PUGs.

My main concern is that I slightly prefer Dwarf but that I'm afraid 7 out of 10 Alliance Priests will be Dwarves.
---
Hi, /u/ludok07
---
by lvl 5 you can visit any area of the world ... all you need to do is die ... over and over ... and over ... and over ... and over again
---
Vanilla rotations are much slower though. More time to think about what to do next.
---
Fair points, the cd on brez will be situational and could potentially be frustrating for gy runs. Druid heals are capable of dungeon runs as you say. I’m priest biased though 😎
---
Holy shit. I played a hunter way back when and had no idea at all that eagle eye could chain. My mind is absolutely blown.
---
&gt; The only report I know that is a bit odd is the Joana tiger clip but as far as I know it was also confirmed that the average damage is still the same, the tiger in the Joana clip simply attacked quicker with less damage but the overall DPS was the same.
---
It was confirmed to have been a bug in stoneclaw totem.
---
It went up briefly, but it wasn't supposed to be officially on until today.
---
either go through my retail friends and what they are doing for guild server etc, or trying to find a guild with dedicated  players with experience  that want to clear content, where there is some sort of structure.
---
you will inevitably see in Trade and General chat people looking  for players.
---
I'm aware, I'm not new to being an altoholic lol
---
If you found a class and lvl bracket you found appealing you'd enjoy it. It takes alot of time and effort tho to make a perfect twink
---
Hit print screen and it’ll save to your WoW folder like has since ever
---
In order to maximise your DPS as a hunter you need good ping, because your main rotation relies on squeezing in 3 second aimed shot casts between roughly 3 second auto-shot “swings”. Even though you’re primarily brought for utility (in ways such as Tranquilizing shot, kiting mobs, Nature resist aura to name a few) you still need to pull your weight in DPS to see Naxx and AQ content. If you think ping will be an issue I would advise a class with a more forgiving rotation.
---
My 70 year old dad sure hasn’t.
---
The one that find the most bugs during the stress test get a permanent beta slot...        ^probably.
---
I was more thinking about how much my poor machine would have been lagging in 2005, trying to render this many players on the screen at once.
---
1.12 has this exploit already fixed. Not happening.
---
Yeah, I used to do this in TBC.
---
29 hunter was one of my favorite twinks in Bc, if you haven't done that. for sure should give it a go
---
mage
---
You know, this is actually the other way around. Back in vanilla, noone could really 'play' 40v40 battles, I mean everyone was playing at a framerate between 1 and 5 fps. For 80+ ppl on the screen situations, you'd only see a slideshow. What we see now during Classic beta is actually doable due to the modern wow engine (they're using the BfA 8.1 engine).
---
Why there aren't big fps drops is because they're using the original, low resolution assets - the amount of graphics on the screen is so low vs BfA is unreal - the amount of polygons to be displayed for 10 player characters with classic assets is actualy significantly less than it takes for **just one** modern BfA equipped character. On live if they'd allow this many people on the screen without sharding (I have no clue what's the treshold they've set for people in the same tight spot before sharding), then people would most likely play at 5 fps, due to how many polygons (orders of magnitude more) the modern characters have and the particle effects, shadows etc.
---
So yes, because they use the modern engine (with DX12 rendering mode, multi-threading support, 64bit client etc) together with the old, very low fidelity assets (low polygons, low resolution textures, low or non-existant particle generators on gear), players are able to get the likes of 200 fps in a capital city - a thing that is obviously not doable in BfA with the significantly higher fidelity assets/textures.
---
not really :D
---
It's not that bad, just run back
---
Guess there’s no way to change a local file to give the beta realmlist (instead of just stresstest)?
---
I was losing my shit waiting in line at Panera while reading this. Have a silver, its all I got. Thanks for brightening my morning

Send the mail after a random delay, so when they receive it, they don't know if it's the fake mail or the actual one.
---
alright maybe ill even get to 75...
---
You're reading way too much into this dude. It's a test! Now this has been tested and everyone has accepted it. On to the next testsubject!  
---
This whole situation is very unique and there are bugs aplenty... This whole thing already led to the finding of the shaman Stoneskin bug, so there is obviously a possibility for other bugs to be present.
---
You should stop thinking of this whole thing as an "us vs. them" thing and start helping the testers test instead.
---
I'm not sure how bounds affects it.. they even said that layers are just different versions of the entire world, not specific zones/boundries
---
DIE TO BOARS!
---
Hardcore raid guilds will most likely use some variation of DKP.
---
Casual ones wont.
---
TBF the other thread in this subreddit that was documenting the evidence was showing that the issue seems random in nature. Sometimes minions are hitting properly, other times they are all hitting like they are disarmed.
---
Yes. That's why you'd either not cast Serpent Sting at all, or replace it with Scorpid Sting when you want to CC.
---
What is best/fun between rogue and shaman. 
---
Ive played shaman my whole life and still enjoy the class but I’ve always said to myself I’d play rogue if I have to do it all again. 
---
And now the time has come to do so but I can’t decide what to play. I will mostly focus on pvp and dungeons ( no time for raids ). It feels like rogue is better to play in pvp overall, but I can’t say shaman looks boring with their one-shot highlights. 
---
So I’m looking for help on what is better but still fun at 60 pvp. 
---
Anything is helpful!
---
I like your approach, I think I’ll do similar
---
Spoiler alert - it wasn't appreciated.
---
It is from "[The World of Warcraft Diary by John Staats](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/whenitsready/the-world-of-warcraft-diary-0?lang=fr)", I highly recommand you to read it if you are interested in early wow dev (from \~2002 to Vanilla release).
---
People want clicks on their shitty videos, this is the best way to get it.
---
Yea this is true. Thing is I played Priest for so long I know I'll enjoy it and I'm good at it, but I always get the nagging voice in my head telling me to try something different :D
---
You think asmongold uploads these?

I made two posts on the forum about this, [this one](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/pros-and-cons-of-all-the-classes-in-classic/50984/2) and [this one](https://eu.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/which-classes-will-have-the-hardest-time-finding-groups/51198/11) but I'll put a 'quick summary' here.
---
I've been trying to figure out what class to play for more than a month. I know you should play what's fun but since I started in TBC (and haven't played properly in a VERY long time) I don't know what will be fun.
---
For now my top choices are warrior, paladin, priest and warlock (in that order), but all classes have something that makes them seem fun to me.
---
Warrior is what I mained but I'm not sure if I'll enjoy the 'feel' of the combat of the class. Tanking seems like fun and I don't really mind slow leveling, but how the class feels to play is very important to me.
---
Paladin seems fun because I like the idea of being a support class and being able to heal and DPS, though I'm a bit worried about being able to find raid groups and actually doing good damage (as ret) since I'm probably going to be playing pretty casually. Having to manage a crap ton of buffs in raids also seems tedious, though I guess addons can help with that at least a little bit. Weirdly enough the auto attack focussed combat seems kind of fun to me as well. Being able to selfheal is great and being good at 1v1s is nice as well since I'd like to mess around with world pvp every so often too.
---
Priest seems fun for pretty much the same reason as paladin. Finding a group as a priest should be really easy and you won't need to be super amazing to find a group since priests are so good at healing. Though like the paladin finding a group as a DPS is going to be very difficult, and with the priest DPS doesn't seem as fun as it does with the other classes.
---
Warlock seems fun because of a couple of reasons. They have cool utility like summoning portals and healthstones. Farming soul shards I won't mind too much, but their overall gameplay doesn't seem too fun to me. Though it's a bit hard to tell since I never really played warlock in the early days. Them being amazing at leveling is also a plus.
---
As for the other classes: Shaman seems fun all around but unless you go healer you probably won't be able to find any raid groups. Rogue has stealth which is just great and enjoyable utility, pickpocketing to make gold seems fun too, but their reputation in combination with them being sort of a 'self-centered' (not having any useful utility aside from sap and lockpicking) class makes them less appealing to me, and they're overplayed as hell of course. Mage has cool utility but them having to drink a ton and their rotation being pretty much just frostbolt makes them seem a bit boring. Though their high damage seems like fun. Druid seems like a class that'll only be sort of good if you put in a ton of effort, so that won't really work with me. Hunter only really seems fun because of the whole pet system, but aside from that I don't really like the playstyle at all. Their utility is pretty cool though.
---
I hope I'll be able to play the stress test since that should at least help a little bit in figuring out the feel of the class. Level 5 might not be much, but it's much better than nothing.
---
Any help or tips would be greatly appreciated!
---
Thx
---
The point he's trying to make is you wouldn't be able to get into those raids without progressing through the tiers. You won't get to Kara etc... Until you have Naxx level gear.
---
&gt;and things like the "exclusive" boat mount.
---
Are you being for serious? That mount was never "exclusive", the fucking initial advertisement *told you* it was coming to the store. Buying the 6 months sub was only giving you early access to it, and for free no less.

I wouldn’t say I decided to be single but I definitely decided to stop pursuing any sort of relationship for at least the rest of 2019.

Titties are temporary. Atiesh is forever.

I was thinking of making a post like this. Not getting beta is a blessing in disguise for some people, ideally they can be productive for the next 3 months and have their life organised, their body prepared, and their mind happy going into launch.
---
And for minmaxers or speed levellers - OP is absolutely right that working on cardio and fitness will basically give you a resource you can burn for advantages in WoW. A healthier body can take more of the punishment of the nolife sedentary lifestyle before it falls apart. Getting proper exercise and nutrition will feed your brain what it needs to be sharp when the time comes.

Second this question, I've heard going 30 ele 21 resto was a good pvp spec, how viable was that as a 5 man healer/dps? 
---
I'm torn between that and warlock, the main argument for shaman being the ability to heal, do you really have to respec deep resto for lighter content like ubrs and the 20 man raids or can I enjoy the the 30/0/21 and still do lots of content?
---
Same here lol.
---
No ones forcing you to make gold a certain way, if you want u can make gold from professions alone. Also in terms of rotation I’d say rogues are up there in terms of interactivity along with hunter and warrior. Every other class has 1 button rotations. That is unless you play heals and downrank

Druids are very fun for lvling, however if you want end game content you'll struggle finding groups, as the DPS part of the druid isn't very good, the tank part is OK for some fights but useless on others compared to the warrior tank most groups tend to go for warriors. So grab a resto set if you wanna go raiding hardcore. PVP is quite fun while lvling and while 60 you'll make a

I'm not communicating this point well apparently.
---
I'm not disagreeing with the goal of reproducing vanilla. What I am saying is that in my experience game code is a tangled mess of spaghetti and side effects, as evidenced by the recent Stoneskin bug. At some point of complexity, even when you have the source code, the damn thing is still a black box. It would be easier to define the vanilla end-state, then tweak database values to the point where that black box outputs vanilla than to try and wade through every combat interaction in their modified BfA client to make the fixed database output a decent version of vanilla.
---
Take off some gear if you'd like the dungeons to be harder

It depends on the content? Only like 1/4 of bosses have fear, and for every fight that doesn’t include fear human is min max

Yes it is.

Most of the time, it's the gold sellers that get the ban but buyers definitely get hit too.

Been reading the wow diary lately.  There’s an even older one pictured in there.  Pretty great read.
---
I agree. I noticed on private servers that dungeons were a lot less fun when I out-leveled the mobs, and my most challenging (read: fun) runs were when some people in the group had slightly lower levels.
---
Of course it was private servers, my leveling in vanilla is way too far for accurate memories.
---
I recommend following this list, it is about 90% right and has served me well so far! I never paid attention to lore before, but this time I'm reading and watching everything.
---
Note that a number of the books stretch over long periods of time, so in some cases they are chronologically correct when taken from a certain point. Don't worry though, all the gaps get filled the more you read, and if you are curious about an event/character you can read the wiki for some spoilers!

---
After seeing some videos from Ebbnflow, I decided on Druid. Was my main for original classic years ago, also my main for retail for the last 5-6 years. I guess its just destiny.
---
Anyway, I'm really not sure on Night Elf or Tauren. My original was Tauren. My retail was night elf so I have an appreciation for both. Im not even hung up on racials and faction bonuses, just aesthetics, lore etc. I like both too much. 
---
Also not sure on Alchemy vs LW as my profession. I was a LW for the longest time in classic and retail but it has never made me money while alchemy suits druid and makes money too so not sure...
---
iirc Blizzard is using an actual 1.12.1 client so I don't see how their values could be wrong?
---
Impossible to say since Noone but Blizzard know (and probably not them either, hence the tests) how many people they'll have per server (layer). I can almost guarantee you that they are putting in WAY more people now than they intend to. It's a stress test. They want to know at what point the server will literally break.
---
I did this on the old wow client in private servers just fine with good fps too. Also dx12 actually butchers my fps. Its mainly the fact everyones computers are much much better.

I don’t think the amount of Reddit subscribers is a very accurate tell of how many will be actually playing. Wow at like 14mil player subs  at one point and their reddit only has 1mil.

Its mostly used to see who will put the effort towards raiding when you dont know the player from example private servers, its really not needed, but used as a filter to avoid plebs.

This stress test is pointless for EU its about as useful as a cock flavoured lollipop. Three months to go... Come onnnnnn August 27th!

---
I'm just thinking it's possible the reference client isn't 100% accurate because (anecdotally) even with version control at my job, I can barely find code and documentation for anything more than 6 or 7 years old.
---
If they've held onto all of their data and lost nothing over the years, then that's fantastic. However, people running private servers may be in a similar situation where their client wasn't 100% perfect and they went back to check details from memory, old videos, and so on. Many of them ideally wanted to make the game as accurate as possible. They might not be spot-on, but at least they still tried and the people making bug reports based on those private servers are still well-intentioned. If they're reporting non-bugs then Blizzard will just continue to clarify that.
---
Wont downvote you cause you're right in a perfect world.

But in the real world, you'll lose your best players and your guild (also all the hard work) will be buried some weeks/months after if you keep players that make 39 other players lose their time.

Guild leading is about hard decisions. I once had the choice between kicking an irl friend or keeping my guild alive. I kept the friend. Guild died cause it was also about power and leading, politics, resulting in a very bad server ratio since we had the best ally guild. I moved to Horde to stay competitive and been followed by like 20 players.
---
And now this friend became an asshole. So much regret cause now my ex guild mates are more my friends than this guy.
---
I want to play shadow priest as i enjoy the warlock-ish playstyle minus the pet, and they seem to be on top of most tier lists when it comes to dps, yet, i wonder if i will be able to raid as shadow or if ppl will make me go heal.
---
From what I can see from those pictures; Rhahk'Zor didn't do any critical hit in the "classic beta" while he did in the  reference environment. Now I don't know his crit chance but it could make a big difference in how the numbers show.

Makes sense too, actually I have always been fascinated with enchanting so I will do that alongside herb / skinning. Cheers.

It's called Stress Test because it stresses people out.

Why not? This way you're bound to get in a BG even if you're playing ona low population server.

They’ve said they will have atleast one RP server but are still debating wether they will have an RP-PvP server at launch or not.

FWIW my Thinkpad x220 i5 8gb ram runs retail playably, but just barely at lowest settings.  Probably wouldn't do dungeons/raiding on it.  I also have an HP prodesk 600 g1 business destop.  I3-4130 16gb ram, runs retail fine at lowest settings, and playably at medium settings.
---
ShadowLabs was hard too but more manageable. Shattered Halls and Arcatraz were hell though. 
---
I never really worried about not finishing a Stratholme run or some such. Now, the timed run could be decently difficult for a PuG, but finishing? Never a problem. 
---
ShadowLabs pugs would fail all the time, and I never even tried Arcatraz or Shattered Halls PuGs. Everyone would farm Mechanar since that was the easiest one. Others like Mana Tombs or Slave Pens weren't so bad either, but there was some wild swings in difficulty between the TBC Heroics.

Wildheart is just so cool!

Not for another 11 hours i think so you got plenty of time to fix, probably just restart your launcher.

yeah I tried that. i installed the launcher on my laptop too and it's not showing up. blizzard said the invites may have been sent out in error, there may be a delay in the flag, or there's some other internal issue. most likely i think the emails were sent out in error tbh
---
Ion said that they would not have an RP-PvP server at launch. In a recent interview the devs said they’re considering it though. So hopefully.
---
I got an email a couple hours after it appeared on mine.
---
 - The current state of WoW is a skinner box designed to try and keep as many people on the treadmill as possible
---
 - Diablo fiasco shows they are more interested in the money to be made in the Asian market rather than making the game their core fan base wants. 
---
 - Activision time and time again seems to be more involved in influencing Blizzards decision making.
---
 - David Brevik, the mastermind of Diablo 2, has expressed his negative sentiments in the way things are currently being handled at Blizzard

 -  Key top personnel involved in making many of the 'good' content that people loved in the past have abandoned ship. Mike Morhaime may be the biggest example, it's all but confirmed he left because of scummy things was being pulled with employee pay.

I could keep going but I think you get the point.
---
That's my fear with Hunters.   
---
I like the ability of Paladins to heal. My inner feelings tell me to choose Paladin... thank you for your thoughts.
---
So there are two types? Stress test and beta&amp;stress test? Or I am missing something?
---
11-12 Hours from now.
---
Right now I'm stuck between Mage, Warlock, Hunter or Rogue.
---
I plan to raid, plan to WPvP, do some BGs, do dungeons, world grinding, rep grind etc, ability to get into raids. Leveling doesn't bother me.
---
One thing I've become accustomed to is the fact that rotations aren't difficult. Even Hunters complex "rotation" is still no where near as complex as I'm used to. So I've stopped worrying about how difficult somethings rotation is. This has opened up Mage and Warlock for me.
---
* **Mage:** 
---
* Pros: High overall DPS, utility is awesome, POM Pyros just was super fun. Insane for open world PvP in groups. Chance for Atiesh! 
---
* Cons: are less gold farming methods than Lock and Hunter, and easier to gank in solo open world.
---
* **Warlock:** 
---
* Pros: Great DPS, great solo farming. Tanky AF, good farming methods. Less played than Mages? Easier raid slots?
---
* Cons: Probably less useful in some areas of PvP? And they start off really low when it comes to PvE dm,g but ramp up well into late game.
---
* **Hunter:**
---
* Pros: Good open world PvP, great grinding and gold farming methods, good 1v1 pvp capability. The most "complex" rotation. Feels good to beat the shitters in dps who only need to spam 1 button. But then again, there won't be that many shitters in a proper raiding guild.
---
* Cons: Need only a tiny few amount for your raid. They don't scale into higher end PvE.
---
* **Rogue:**
---
* Pros: Amazing open world solo PvP, good dps, decent dungeon utility, good solo farming, scales really well in pvp when it comes to gear. So much fun with stealth and being able to fuck with people.
---
* Cons: There is going to be thousands of them. Do not do as well in open world group PvP (really large groups that is), farming capabilities are a lot lower than other choices.
---
The choices are hard. I feel as if out of all of these, the Rogue and Mage are my two top choices. Warlock and Hunter are GREAT for solo, but doing less dmg because I just have worse scaling would annoy me and the fact that I wouldn't be able to use my classes full capabilities due to debuff slots *may* annoy me too.
---
So, I want to do a lot of open world pvp too, small, large and solo. The main question is, out of Mage and Rogue, who is better for that, and which class just does better in farming gold and gear?
---
Must be a really good friend then.
---
The only reason to get those mounts is 1 less inventory space and the unique look of the mounts. Otherwise doing the quest chain cost nearly as much gold as buying epic training etc, and the quest chain itself on both sides is a pain in the ass.
---
It literally would change nothing but everyone is low level so talents aren't even a thing yet? It would matter more for endish game like level 30-40. Which I don't think anyone got to yet.
---
There were cross realm BGs in Vanilla towards the end. It aims to reduce queue times mainly.
---
I really love WPVP but how about the late game? I allways heard that Hunters are hard to master.
---
Why you gotta flex on us 'stress testers' with that Beta :(

---
It's not VC. Even though this question is asked constantly I never see VC getting much representation.
---
I never liked the blind hate for private servers really. Some people like me just wanted to play an old version of the game that was no longer playable, until now at least.
---
Exactly dude. Loved tbc and wrath both, but it is not the way to go. We are not gonna get a second go at classic, lets please stick to our guns.
---
I like it, but not exactly because itll kill world pvp for sure
---
ok, what about an enhancement shaman? How annoying would they be in BG PvP/World PvP?
---
The dungeons are stupid easy because people know how to play the goddamn game properly. 15 years ago, the majority of players had no idea how to spec, what spells to use, what gear to wear. 
---
You are now watching people on twitch stream Classic, people who played WoW for 10+ years - they're not braindead. People have some weird memories here about Classic. Not everything was stupid-hard back then due to the game itself being hard.
---
I miss the age when using Eagle Eye didn't automatically trigger a loading screen
---
&gt; Personally, I'll be shocked if Blizzard doesn't put experience potions, WoW tokens, TCG items, or character boosts into Classic. 
---
As much as the want to make money, they know this would be the death of the game. It's not going to happen.
---
you can just turn the settings down
---
earned? so you CAN suck blizzard's dick for access?
---
OMG i got invited!!!!
---
My understanding is that they complained about the boss damage, and blizz proved them wrong. So they said no wait, i meant the nonboss damage, which blizz also tested and is fine.
---
There are a lot of chips on shoulders, and I've veen saying since classic was announced that we're going to have to wait and see what's what in the live servers because a lot of things in private servers are... wrong.
---
I like to compare pservers to Jurassic Park. Ingen couldn't make perfect dinosaurs, because the dna wasn't complete. So they added whatever they wanted to fill the holes. Problem is, now you have tourists who are seeing creatures much closer to real dinosaurs for the first time, and only have ingen's psuedo-clones to base their opinions on. They see things aren't the same as what they're used to, but what they're used to has been wrong the whole time.
---
Eh, grab streamlabs obs, toss a theme on, customize it a bit (stream name, remove unused theme elements). Honestly, the difference between a "low budget" stream and big budget isn't that much. Most of it comes from the streamer.
---
unfortunately many of the game designers/devs/test team are actually really bad at the game ... or at least thats what it was like for wildstar
---
So any info if the "having a sub is required" thing is really true ? Wont buy one anyways though.
---
Yep, I think people are way more methodical (for lack of a better word) nowadays than in 2000-2006 when it comes to gaming.
---
We have access to so many databases with all the stats, guides, calculators that do the work for you, etc. We know what to do in a game before we install it if we want to.
---
And leveling in wow even though it's boring, to say the least, now. People have leveled to death in these past 15 years, they know exactly what talents, what gear, what spec, what everything to do and where to go to get results not fails.
---
Whereas in Vanilla times we just played for fun, there was no methodical approach unless you were a hardcore raider or played the AH or any other such activity. Everyone played, died and failed because it was fun and part of the experience.
---
I didn't give a shit at level 15 that DM was better done at 20. I didn't care that I didn't have single green item on me, I wanted to do this mysterious place where all the bandits in the area come from. Storm their mines and put an end to their threat in the region. If that meant that I was under leveled and under geared, so be it, I go there and fail until I see the bastard that orchestrated everything dead and maybe a piece of loot.
---
And I leveled several characters to level 60 or stopped at certain levels. I still didn't care about the "right" approach to leveling, sure I applied what I've learned from past mistakes to each new character but I still did it my way, not the correct mathematical way for maximum success because the success in game was to have fun, not numbers back then.
---
Today we are going to look at respec decay. For those who don't know what respec is, check out my other video. But first I want to thank Audible for sponsoring this video.....
---
Vent and Discord are not the same thing at all. Discord will have server-wide LFG chat channels, trade channels, etc. The “social aspect” of Classic is going to be very different from Vanilla.
---
Not everyone that’s looking forward to Classic wants to live in 2004/07. Some of us want a 2029 version of our favorite game.
---
I know this isn't the same, but this reminds me of the hunter specific quests in Molten Front for the different tamable spiders.
---
Can't wait to get experiences like that again.
---
&gt;rried about not finishing a Stratholme run or some such. Now, the timed run could be decently difficult for a PuG, but finishing? Never a problem.
---
Was Shattered Halls timed IIRC? I remember thinking the pre-nerf Kara was easier than the 5man heroics, even with Prince raining infernals every second.
---
This is about me, right? You made it about me :'(.
---
How about the fact that the only guilds who have ever completed BWL in 30 mins are completely decked out, and in full world buffs and flasks.
---
1. You can’t get the world buffs in classic like you can in private servers because they are all on cooldown timers.
---
2. No guild aside from the hardcore (which OP said he probably won’t be a part of) will be completely flasked and buffed to the max for BWL.
---
3. If he isn’t in a hardcore guild they won’t be fully decked in tier 3 gear to speed through BWL in 30 mins.
---
4. Blizzard has already stated on record that private server bosses in raids had all the armour values and resistance values off, also how spells interact with bosses. That means the whole meta will change and you can’t just cram 30 fury warriors and rogues now for speed because of new armour values.
---
But yea keep dreaming of 30 min BWL runs every week in a casual-semi serious guild.
---
Hey appreciate you either way. Keep grinding until you get 10 viewers and then 20 :)
---
There will be max one raid spot for spriests in most cases and you will need to use lots of consumables to be competitive.
---
I wish I knew!
---
Because the classic team is making good decisions for the health of the game
---
That is fine. But don’t be the guy that mindlessly needs on everything in some pre-bis list, like Hand of Justice is on many hunter pre-bis lists because of +20 attack power...
---
i feel sorry for trevor .... poor trevor
---
Maybe they can still make more than one tank  class viable
---
Because 1.12.1 had Cross Realm BGs? NO CHANGES remember?
---
Who fucking cares, the result is the same - people ghosting out of existence. Fucking sucks.
---
Someone forward me an actual beta email, so I can see what the actual one looks like :p
---
And then there was stuff like the green ring from nagrand being hard bis for physical dps.  Warmaul ogre band?  Tbc itemization was all over the place on what was good and what was shit.
---
Hahaha get triggered nerd
---
Sorry man, but #nochanges. Everything is a hunter item!

What has a bad Dota clone got to do with World of Warcraft?

GIVE THIS MAN A BETA ACCESS !
---
Can't be to many warriors, tanks are important
---
Do you think a fan didn't upload it?
---
Break yourself, break yourself , break yourself upon my body!  Feel my body!
---
Exactly mate!  
---
Bad decisions I want to avoid this time:  
---
1. Selected priest based on the fact that my mate got a dps class first. We did not even level together that much and ended up with a fantastic class (love shadow lore), but would rather dps than heal.  
---
2. Did not use any single spell until level 3! What a noob I know. Of course that meant that i even died at lvl 1.
---
3. Since I played priest I decided to level as Holy all the way. What a BIG mistake that was...  
---
4. Had no desire to properly pvp back then, but I ended up playing on a pvp server. As a result I was destroyed by competent and not pvpers especially as holy trying to farm herbs.  
---
Some good decisions:  
---
1. Always join a guild - even at lvl 1. 
---
2. Don’t be afraid to ask for help and also help others even when you do not need sth like loot etc. 
---
3. Buff strangers, heal guys in trouble and all that good stuff.  
---
Good luck!
---
Yeah, this confused me too. I didn't receive any emails, but when I checked my BNet app at around 7.30am GMT it showed the option for Beta and Stress Test. Sadly I'll have to assume this is Stress Test access only.
---
Loot Council will probably be used by hardcore guilds. The rest will probably use some derivative of DKP if they want to distribute loot fairly.
---
Got one too. I hope it comes with guaranteed invites to all betas to follow.
---
Haha I just watched this aunty Donna skit. People act fast
---
You have beta? ;-;
---
If you so wish to endeavor in a different spec of your liking, or perhaps make minute changes to an existing specialization, there were cost systems in place in order to limit the frequency of said re-specializations. Blizzard has ... blablabla *puke*
---
Rank 14
---
I thought you had to be subscribed to participate in any sort of testing of Classic. I got the stress test and I am not subscribed (no email either yet)
---
No it won’t. It certainly didn’t in vanilla.
---
And your point that private server data is wrong is inconsequential - because everyone already knew that. Few/no players on here are arguing that private server data is right and the reference client is wrong - that is a  fallacy invented by people who for various reasons hate private servers and the people who play on them. 
---
I watched the stream where this controversy got started - from the very beginning there were questions about whether elites and/or bosses in instances were doing correct damage. If Blizzard tests and posts “yes, all bosses and elites in dungeons are working as intended” it will be the end of the conversation, but so far only part of that question has been answered so we will continue to bring it up until it is.
---
On the other hand people are 100% sure that the private server elite mob dmg is 100% correct because it is supposedly expertly curated by the community. When pressed for source videos they are unable to provide them. 
---
In fact, I have seen more 2005 grainy video supporting the current beta elite dmg values than I have seen evidence to the contrary
---
Yes I would haha
---
So much this.

I thought about this and a cool way to open up the earlier expansions. Keep the classic server, open a TBC server with the option to "move your character on". Of course you'd never be able to bring that character back, but there'd still be a classic server there which you could create a new character on and start the journey again. You could do the same with Wrath, you character would get the "option" to move on but never back.
---
...About that Bass.
---
Some guilds need a lot of lovin' and some guilds don't.
---
I’ve missed work for less honestly
---
I just got it as well, glad blizzard is keeping us in mind ❤️
---
Reckoning bombs were patched out fairly early.
---
Yes, yes, and he brought them with him to the place he dubbed Durotar after saving them from a Naga witch, and they decided to settle down on the Echo Isles after their arrival.
---
I was just making a joke! Kalimdor was also much larger in WC3, so I know Blizz didn't actually view the continent as so tiny.
---
Sadly there is no way to get tbc without flying. I wouldnt even mind the gearing and character changes but staying on the main world without flying mounts.
---
no but  [karmond](https://www.twitch.tv/karmond) does. I've clipped a lot of hunter stuff from him
---
I agree but that balance is about the same as retail wow in vanilla too
---
i laugh at the people who resubbed just to play the beta.
---
Where did all the stories of “needing CC” in vanilla come from? At this rate protection spec will be flat out useless.
---
The stress test starts later until then its offline see link below.
---
[TIME CONVERTER](https://www.worldtimebuddy.com/pdt-to-gmt-converter) &lt;-- see link for what time it is where you live.
---
Well, WoW, specially vanila, isn't, say, a fighting game.
---
The player skill is in the small things. The positioning, the way you use your cooldowns etc...
---
For instance, compare Venruki to the crappy mage that dueled Asmongold in some of his latest videos. A mage that even after rooting a warrior, walks towards the warrior to get hit 1 time and then cast blink (instead of waiting for the interept to use it).
---
Again: Venruki was a multi-glad/rank1 guy back in TBC. Yes, TBC isn't Vanilla, but I think we can aggree that, out of the expansions, it's the next closest thing. He has a good knowledge of the game, he won't be using his CDs on the wrong time and won't position himself in a bad way. Yes, maybe he still doesn't know about specific trinkets and etc but you bet he's gonna be one of the best PvPrs of this game.
---
Why did they say they consider things like how long theyve been playing?
---
You had an event to save some prisoners at the end of the dungeon which was timed, that was pretty hard, not much room for mistakes. But I can't remember if it was for an attunement or something else.
---
OCE and got an invite :D keen to see my disgusting ping
---
With the growing interest I find it to be increasingly weird they won't be specific about this and other servers.
---
It's way past the point they should've released launch server lists.  
---
They should deffo add RP-PVP at least one pr gateway. It would be horrid to have played on a new main and then have RP-PVP release later. For good reason transfer TO RP-PVP is limited.
---
No one I know ever got banned for buying gold in Vanilla, you just trade a small item for the in game gold and whispers confirm the trade is gold for an item.
---
Not a meme, upvoted.
---
I got the email yesterday, but didn't have the option in the launcher until this morning. Try restarting your launcher. If you have BFA installed, the download is really small and fast.
---
How much of a pain in the ass is it going to be for a ~~group of 5~~ solo player to level from 1 to 60 with ~~only druid's battle res~~ no rez? 
---
You're 5, you shouldn't die except in dungeon and even there if you play with discord and are somewhat skilled you won't have any issue.
---
&gt;We tested this issue in our reference environment today.  
---
&gt;First, we looked at a video from the WoW Classic Beta, where the player was tanking Rhahk’zor in Deadmines at level 20:  
---
   
---
&gt;[Asmongold's CRAZY Deadmines Clear In Classic WoW Beta](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zPSDVj0mNcY)   
---
&gt;If you look at his portrait while he’s getting hit, you can see him  receiving 65-83 damage from Rhahk’zor. The average hit is \~75.  
---
&gt;We then recreated it in the WoW Classic Beta-- a level 20 human  warrior with similar gear, with Defensive Stance, and with Mark of the  Wild. Here’s what that looked like:  
---
&gt;📷[ J62P4NV0PXHT1558473362677.png1279×777 ](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/J62P4NV0PXHT1558473362677.png)  
---
&gt;We then did the same thing in our 1.12 reference environment. There, the test looked like this:  
---
&gt;📷[ WRMLQ1YPJZYJ1558473362591.png1264×720 ](https://bnetcmsus-a.akamaihd.net/cms/gallery/WRMLQ1YPJZYJ1558473362591.png)  
---
&gt;Conclusion: the average damage taken is identical.
---
Not entirely correct. Some of them are saying they are open to that idea, but others like Ion have said that it's out of the question.
---
problem is you split the playerbase so much if you do this . I guess they might have the numbers to do it though
---
I used to be one of those AH barons. It started because crafting, buying and selling on the AH was more efficent than farming. Once the snowball started rolling I made a lot more gold than I needed. The goldmaking was fun to me, so I kept going for the sake of it. In Wrath I reach the old gold cap of 2^31 copper, and in Cata I became a millionaire. I thought when I qut WoW I might consider selling it, but actually doing that was a whole lot more hassle than I thought, so when I quit the game in Cata I permanently removed that gold from the economy. If WoW tokens existed back then I would've bought some for myself, and probably for some of my friends too.
---
That's not an entitlement, they have the right to find/form the guild whatever they want.
---
that is going to be expensive.
---
Because, it's not working properly.  The issue is known to most, but clearly not all and it should be fixed by the end of Beta.
---
It kinda did.
---
Forced immersion is the best immersion.
---
Im OCE and i got in so im guessing anywhere?
---
Same - mine was available more than 4 hours after (slept it off after 4 hours of waiting).
---
Other than some class trinket, heartbeat and maybe your pet if you didn't put him on passive or smthg
---
Does anyone know if it'll be battlegroup based like back in the day? It's not as great as single realm, but at least it's not "everyone".
---
Id be totally fine with world buffs not working at all in 40 man raid content.
---
This was a comment about sharding causing shit.
---
I recall it being true. Who is right?
---
Dwarf is a no-brainer for an alliance priest, they are fantastic. Whether you want to make it a M or F is your own personal preference. I don't think either look great personally. I don't really like any of the alliance races for priests from a cosmetic standpoint. As for your worry about there being too many dwarfs. I've been running census scans on ND for a while now. Dwarfs make up just over 50% of the priest population @ 60. Understandable considering just how good dwarf priests are. You can be sure though, your average retail player will min/max less than an average private server player. So expect dwarf priests to be popular on retail, but maybe not as popular as on the PS scene.
---
^^ false. As a vanilla player, I’ve 1 shotted many horde players, here’s how it works.
---
If you get crit by an attack, your next auto attack hits a second time. This can stack up to 5 times (if you don’t auto attack).
---
So if you are in a bg and a rogue jumps you, you let him crit away while you heal yourself or just bide your time, once he has crit you 5 times you can pop bubble and smack him for 6 hits at once + hopefully a seal of command hit. If you use seal of righteousness iirc it goes off each hit but seal of command can only prod off the main swing (not too sure I forget).
---
The fix the above poster was talking about, there used to be no limit on the stacks...so some guy dueled a rogue for hours and built up 1000’s of stacks, then 1 shot lord kazzaks (world boss) so they capped it at 5 stacks.
---
You also can’t just type /sit like on private servers and force a crit. You will still take the crit damage if you do that, but it won’t build a stack.
---
That's a lot of stuff in 24 hours, this meme fits you perfectly
---
Better at night than at work...
---
Sorry to hear you're not feeling well /u/timb6000
---
Nice try, blizzard.
---
They should make a Megadungeon for classic...
---
Move along, nothing to see here
---
You mean its not working the way blizz described it to be working. Its most likely automated so this could be the intended way and it could be phasing him because the layer he was on and another layer merged due to the two layers having very few ppl on it.
---
blizzard has posted about this, they said that either:
---
1) the email might have been sent out in error
---
2) there's a delay with the flagging system
---
3) there's a back end problem with people not getting flagged after receiving the email
---
since it happened after hours, they weren't able to confirm with the dev team about this issue. we'll find out today though
---
No guild worth joining will be.
---
BiS weapon for stress test.
---
What am I missing?

That's really not true at all... 1-5 fps? I had a piece of shit pre built all in one system and I don't think I ever ever dropped below 10 at the worst times and AV was more than playable.

I don’t have any information I can share but I’m forwarding a report to let our teams know that some people are receiving invites without actually being flagged to participate in the Stress Test tomorrow"
---
Got email from blizz was just stress test invite downloaded game closed launcher now just waiting on a real invite.
---
Are you from the future?
---
What if it was a ‘copy and paste situation’? Keep your character in classic and copy it over to the bc servers. Allowing you to continue to play both servers without any sacrifice.
---
Military days have 30 hours so they have time to sleep.
---
DKP is a bad system. The best guilds will use a loot council
---
Well said. With the amount of negativity around here lately I'm surprised this got upvoted this much. Maybe there's hope.
---
YES
---
How about.....no.
---
What part of *accurate* vanilla experience do people not seem to understand?
---
Blizzard says the numbers are fine, the numbers are fine.
---
Honestly, if people don’t like it, they can go back to the private servers with the tweaked numbers.
---
It was a combination of things - not just items.
---
- You could skill up a profession that play session and get 8-slot bags/a new potion/copper runed breastplate.
---
- One or two talent points can make a total difference in how things play for your class.
---
- Warlocks get to have a new pet every ~10 levels, requiring a pretty lengthy and interesting quest and getting even more tools in case you get jumped in PvP, etc.
---
- Druid form quests (again every 10 or so levels) were also enjoyable, took you to distant lands, and gave you a new tool or fun thing.
---
- Every play session you'd end up meeting new people. Some became good friends after playing together for an hour. Others you already knew, and you like them even more after playing another session with them. That warrior you gave bandages and spare potions to might end up as your MT for UBRS or Scholo mount runs.
---
I used to use shaman Far Sight in bc to watch Mines from LM in AB :) very handy
---
Rogues have problems in any kind of group pvp thats more than 1vs1. You cannot go wrong with mage, but warlock and hunter are great choices as well. But I wouldnt pick rogue for what you described
---
As per other comment in this thread, reckoning stacks to 5. Reck bombs of 5 hits can very much kill some classes from full. You cannot sit to force crits, but against a rogue or hunter pet for example the crits stack up quickly
---
I really wanna, but I also am trying to stay away from Twitch and the launcher so I don't go insane!
---
Experienced exactly the same combo as you, i rolled a rogue for pvp and gold farming so my main raiding priest could stay his spec.
---
&gt;I love the idea of Rogue and I want to main one this time around, I'm just not convinced it's actually the class for me..
---
?..? You love the class but dont think its for you because? 
---
Maybe it helps list the stuff you like and dislike and see whats got more entries.
---
Im rolling main rogue this time around because i want to experience vanilla from the dps point of view.
---
Im not gonna sugar coat it, being a healing priest in vanilla was rather easy, i rarely struggled to do my job and there wasnt really a lot of fights where you needed to do something special as the class.
---
I know picking rogue will propably not be a challenge either in terms of rotation etc. but nevertheless im excited to main the class this time and focus 100% on his progression.
---
Can someone tell the author of Classicdb to put a note on it that it's a pserver DB and has incorrect values for classic? So many posts reference "classicdb" like it's an actual accurate DB and claim damage should be higher....
---
I found a guild that matches what I am looking for on discord so I can roll with them at launch. I'm sure I could have just found something similar organically, but I'd rather plan ahead and find people who seem cool ahead of time.
---
&gt; Stopped reading at the "shadow priests are bottom of the barrel, no decent premade would even consider you", obvious trolling:(
---
Is it, though? If we're talking about PvP meta for premade WSG/AB that has developed since vanilla (so not actually premades people ran back in vanilla, because what people run now is far superior), it's pretty void of Shadow Priests by and large. 
---
Their main purpose in PvP is Dispel Magic, for both allied and offensive. Their damage is fantastic in a 1v1 scenario, but that's not what premades are. As a result, their damage gets dispelled for the most part and they run out of mana fast (compare that to a Warlock who doesn't struggle in the mana department -- Warlocks can also focus more on burst with the right gear and talent setup making dispels far less bothersome not to mention the utility and more consistent CC they bring).
---
Meanwhile, a non-shadow Priest brings all the same utility (Mana Burn, Psychic Scream, Dispels, Power Word Shield) barring Silence (and even then you can spec into that and skip PI) while offering stellar team support through healing. Really, you'll struggle to find premades run Shadow Priests but there's plenty of room for Disc Priests. 
---
If we're just talking Dueling or WPvP, sure, they're good. Real good (except in WPvP they run out of mana in 1vX). But that's not premades. 
---
-----
---
As for OP, you're contemplating playing them just for PvE endgame? Dungeons and leveling will be no issue as Shadow, you'll enjoy it I'm sure. Endgame though? It's very difficult being that singular Shadow Priest a raid might take (unless we're talking super casual raids struggling to fill spots) but perhaps more importantly would you be satisfied with their very simplistic "rotation"? In addition to running out of mana incredibly fast meaning you have to farm Dark Runes and even then will run out? 
---
I love Shadow Priests thematically, but it is hard to justify playing one if you literally dislike everything else about Priest. I'd consider them if you're cool with swapping to a healer for raids and Disc for premade BGs. Otherwise I think you're much better off with a class/(spec) that offers more options.

Not as much of a pain in the ass as questing in a group - it's going to be very slow xp. With dungeons you should be fine, some people might die but they can run while you clear trash.

---
Then you see how much people want "true vanilla OSRS" and all of them get shut down the same way we used to be back when we asked for Vanilla WoW.
---
Maybe forcing change on people isn't always fun. But judging by this reddit, everyone has their dream game, seems like we expect 30 million players and everyone gets their server.

How does it work now then? Can't you still carry 5 charges and 1 shot somebody?
---
I subbed to have a chance at the Beta, and I got a Stress Test invite this week. I'm hoping that a Beta invite follows, but I doubt it.

no it didn't atleast on my server there were massive world pvp til mid wrath. not as intense but deffo not dead

Probably a lot less of a pain in the ass than a solo leveler. Or a 3 man group with no rez. Or a duo with no rez. Or even a 4 man with no rez.
---
I wouldn't worry about it.
---
Pay attention to what you are pulling and dont get distracted and you will be fine. Besides corpse runs are part of the game.
---
If you have a lock have them SS you.
---
This is what I was talking about. The 1 shot shit wherey ou have 1000 million stacks is silly. Glad that it still works. How good is it for PvP? I imagine a must have since the burst damage is insane, especially vs classes where you can connect for only moments like mages and hunters.

I have never even once rolled or been asked to roll for chests. I am surprised that so many people in this sub think that it is well established etiquette or protocol to roll for chests. Most of the loot from chests are whatever and BOE, if someone else needed something in it any decent person would trade it rather than vendoring. I really hope people don’t make a big deal over a couple silver worth items because nobody rolled.
---
Look at this: [https://youtu.be/k9hMeOi6eaY?t=103](https://youtu.be/k9hMeOi6eaY?t=103)

Could you explain the "diminishing returns" in a DPS context? Assuming two available upgrades for two equally geared DPS, I would imagine giving both to the same player would net a higher total performance than splitting them. Basically, giving the extra crit to the warrior with the biggest sword makes sense, right?
---
I completely agree. I only ever raided on my paladin in vanilla, and I don’t recall any set list of best gear. I figured some out myself through wowhead or thottbot and got what I could. I probably had far worse stats than possible, but it still worked.
---
Research purposes

The cd on brez will fly by. and as mentioned in another reply you can only rez 1 person so if you and only you survive then everyone else will have to run back anyway. Just dont forget to keep your reagents stocked
---
The elementals in 1KN are non elite lvl 27 and hit for 60. Meanwhile you have lvl 30 elites in RFK hitting for 50 damage. Both on a warrior with 2H.

---
You have 13 active subs?
---
Two you like waiting two hours for an AV que? Because that’s what it’s like without cross realm.
---
If your class has the ability to heal in classic, you’re a healer. Don’t think it’s going to be any different for you. That’s the best way to think about druids, paladins, etc. 
---
Sorry bro
---
I have just enabled. Well see what happens due to the music
---
BFA is like rubix cube speed run. Classic is like a 5000 piece puzzle.

Good thing about BGs before cross realm was that they were terrible and people did do wpvp instead.

&gt; Ah yes, the hash tags that must apply to every single person who happens to dissent from the cultish like belief that everything must stay the exact same way as it was in 2004-2006. Fuck off with that hash tag shit, doesn't apply to me, doesn't apply to every single person that disagrees with you.
---
Just having some fun, by this sub's wacky standards I'm a pro-changes extremist. 
---
&gt; How about you accept the idea that maybe some small increased difficulty (after all, we're just talking about raising the damage of some elites in dunfeons, which are supposed to be hard!) that those changes would be good for the game?
---
I would totally support Blizzard if they said they wanted to beef up the difficulty to make the game interesting for experienced players with modern computers and internet connections, especially in raids.
---
I’m sure.
---
not really the point through it it?
---
Eh it’s gimmecky. It’s like a windfury shaman. Sure when the stars align and you see 5-6 crits pop up and a mage instant dies it’s fun, but in 1v1 duels against casters it sucks and 8 times out of 10 all you see is “300/700/miss/miss/dodge/miss/300. Overall deep ret is more reliable so it depends how you like to play.
---
Vurtnes vanilla pvp still holds up though.

Don't worry, only 2314 hours till release.

It’s time to break down the first playable version of World of Warcraft Classic that we’ve been given as the closed beta dropped this past week.
---
We hear from Defcamp &amp; Polydox in a call recorded after two days spent with the beta, and then takes another call from Ayle after six days with the game, as the callers cover off on bugs, PvP and whether or not the game is fun and running well.
---
After that, we hear from IT professional Linkson, who stops by to give further clarification on exactly what Blizzard’s proposed ‘layering’ system entails, explaining it further to the listeners.
---
And, finally, in saving the best for last, vanilla WoW class designer Kevin Jordan stops by for the last instalment in his fantastic ‘Ask Kevin’ series, as he sits down with the Countdown community to discuss WoW, MMORPG’s, the gaming industry and Blizzard in a candid, final interview.

Dont Think they use wtf anymore.
---
Joana said the numbers seems fine and I trust him tbh.
---
At least we can bury the idea that you need CC in dungeons
---
They'd just need to itemize gear for druids and give every tank a ST taunt I think.
---
I believe some settings you can use the modern graphics but  there is a "classic" button you click to make the water and foliage lower quality like vanilla .
---
Same way I always have. Wait until someone starts spamming in the channel that they are recruiting and then go to that guild. If it sucks leave and try my luck again. 
---
Or if I happen to group with someone and we hit it off then Ill ask to be in their guild (if they belong to one)
---
Well when you're going to kill level 2 wolves you don't need your UI to be that organized tbh..
---
I'm a private server player and I don't see the issue. He was laughing because he was right about the numbers being right in beta. I'm not much of an Asmongold fan but you clearly don't like the guy. Thanks for wasting everyones time.
---
It sure is :)
---
enhancement shaman is a really fun rng spec, but its more of a meme-spec tbh and can be outplayed easily. If you want to play a disruptive melee class, your only serious options are rogue or warrior. rogue is better in 1v1 situations but struggle with group pvp while warrior defines the group pvp meta.
---
Ah, it's been a while.  I was invited to the stress test but wanted to see if i could worm my way in. Desperation took over
---
It’s their fucking job!
---
Last Beta invite wave was EU only, so I guess next one is US only.
---
Gear and experience/skill let’s you tank far more than the points in prot. Unless you are main/offtanking for entire raids, I’d recommend an impale/fury build. I played that on private servers and tanked everything other than rag in MC, and everything in BWL without any issues, filling in when other tanks were unavailable.
---
Bit early to conclude anything raiding related.
---
Bad move in this scenario but I've been watching this guys stream a bit lately and he's a blink God. He's won a bunch of duels by blinking right ontop of people
---
Somewhat correct. Low level water gives the same chance to skill up, but if you go to a high level water with low level skill, you will not skill up as fast because skill ups require catching a fish.
---
by the way how many people get into stress test?
---
What videocard? Are other games working fine?
---
I myself had NVIDIA+Intel but recently upgraded my PC and I am now running AMD GPU + CPU because of the amazing AMD opensource drivers that is in the Linux kernel.
---
What I did on both installs was: https://www.gloriouseggroll.tv/how-to-get-out-of-wine-dependency-hell/
---
For Ubuntu the relevant part is:
---
    wget -nc https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/winehq.key
---
    sudo apt-key add winehq.key
---
    sudo apt-add-repository 'https://dl.winehq.org/wine-builds/ubuntu/'
---
    sudo apt update
---
    sudo apt install --install-recommends winehq-staging
---
    sudo apt install winetricks
---
If apt-get complains about missing dependencies, install them, then repeat the last two steps (update and install).
---
I never tried the Ubuntu variant since I am running Manjaro Cinnamon based on Arch and there is a single line to used to install all dependency's.
---
The above should install all the relevant gaming libraries needed to make pretty any game work.
---
By that I mean, you should not run into issues where a game doesnt work because you are missing library X.
---
Having said all that, did you used the Lutris script to install World of Warcraft?
---
Also try running Lutris or whatever you have used to launch the game, through the terminal. In the terminal log you can probably see what you are missing. Something is wrong since you cant run 3D graphics.
---
I hope I was of any help.
---
Fuck you got on this so quick.
---
Dude windows literally has a print screen button and has done pretty much since the dawn of fucking time, in wow it even just saves it to a folder.
---
The problem with these mentalities is that the defector can really be the only one that defects before the group crumbles. Imagine if you have a heal spec dpsing and a dps spec with dps armor that's tanking with a 2 hander. Going an off spec to perform a specific role just forces the other players to carry you.
---
It's not inconsequential, because people are constantly posting guides and videos referencing pservers as a source when the source is as reliable as "my mother said so". Which, by the way, kind of makes your claim that "everybody knew that" hyperbolic at best. Not everybody knows that. I've personally had to explain to a lot of people things as simple as bag drop chance being increased in starting zones, so if people are *that* ignorant, then there are surely people who don't know anything about other changes.
---
Again, the problem wasn't "dont question things", it's "stop moving goalposts and using data from an unreliable source". Which people do, a fucking lot. A good number of people do use pservers as biblical truth. Misinformation is a real thing. Hell, i had to correct someone in this very thread who still thinks the boat mount was supposed to be exclusive to the 6 month subscription promotion.
---
Quite the opposite. Hardcore guilds always go for lootcouncil.
---
The realms aren’t even up yet. I have beta access and they aren’t even showing up.
---
Related: is there a way to set up keybinds and such with a text file? So I can take care of that before the game actually launches?
---
Had the WoW talk with the girlfriend last night, and somehow convinced her to play classic with me!
---
She's thinking Warrior or maybe Druid.
---
I'm leaning towards holy paladin to let her learn the ways of the warrior and keep her alive along the way.
---
Don’t even need to trust a streamer, Blizzard themselves said yesterday the numbers were fine.
---
Nah, I stopped playing at the start of Data. I can imagine it though!
---
If you are a hunter and roll for Hand of Justice for the +20 attack power when there is a melee in the group, because it is an upgrade you will not make a lot of friends. Same goes for warriors and rogues rolling for good ranged weapons, because it is an upgrade, when there is a hunter in the group.
---
Yes, he's going to dodge, parry, take fewer critical hits, fewer crushing blows. But for regular white damage, the only factor mitigating damage is armor value. Which is the only thing I'm comparing.
---
No it kinda isn’t. Blizzard provided proof via blue post in a thread on the forums showing that the numbers were fine.
---
Holy shit you are insufferable
---
Okay, enough is enough. Im out of this sub. All of you guys are pathetic, both the #NOCHANGESREE and those who defend the changes.
---
Peace
---
Did they ever state a reason for the level limit? I don't see how it helps with the stress testing.
---
There needs to be almost literally 1 warrior for every 5 people. They are necessary for tanking dungeons. Most of these people saying they are going warrior will never truly endgame. It just aint gonna happen. People will back out or irl will hit or they will reroll or whatever. There will still be a lot of warriors, though. Don't pick something else because you think Warrior will be over-saturated. Play what you want.
---
Ah man, I'd actually somehow not considered Hayven.
---
I was thinking maybe the beta and the stress test is somewhat related, so i could have changed the realmlist from the stress test to the beta servers instead. False hope and dreams of playing classic now
---
This is the best shitpost in history
---
Yep. All high iq people take off the second week.
---
I dont really mind the guy, I just wanted to see more peoples opinion on him and that clip in particular i think showcases how he is borderline toxic and how sometimes he views himself above others. That might be just a stream persona idk, havent watched enough to know. But yeah just wanted peoples opinions
---
I wish people could use the correct terminology but guess people are too stupid to know the difference.
---
Don't trust blizzard to do anything since they basically turned WoW into a slot machine. Blizzard has incentives to tell players what they want to hear, Joana has ground experience and has no incentive to tickle my balls and blow smoke up my ass.
---
Showing that one boss mob was fine yes.
---
My friends and I are making a casual guild and we’ve decided on just purely loot council. DKP has a lot of flaws and it’s also very time consuming to keep track of, as long as you have a good council and rotate random players every raid into the council it should be fair. If there’s a issue you deal with it, just like any other system.
---
Please confirm that it's the right time. I live in EST, I think this is +3 from PDT, so 4pm PDT + 3 = 7pm EST.
---
&gt; How difficult is it to understand that a warrior with leather pieces and no shield takes more damage than a shit geared tank with a shield?
---
Actual damage taken, yeah, a bit more (we have already been over how relatively little difference armor makes). But he has a lot more health than an average geared warrior, which makes him easily survive a couple of elite mobs since they kill them really quickly. 
---
A tank with shit gear and a shield also survives the thing he was doing really easily. People in normal vanilla was not dying to a couple of normal elite mobs in dungeons.
---
i didnt get it because i refuse to sub to BFA
---
Hand of Justice might get you in trouble on the server because it's considered BIS for melee classes, but ranged weapons? Nah.
---
You access the stress test and then you get the boot. It's not the beta, it's a stress test. It's why it had a different name lol
---
The stress test server is open for about 24 hours - its just the first two are being actively monitored by Blizz staff. So if you dont want to stay up/participate in the actual hard-testing you can just play after work the next day :)
---
Extremely fun.
---
lmao this post is gold. If only it was that easy, id make a burner account and expect a ban lol. 3 months ughhh!! leedle leedle leedle leedle dont mind me here, just keep swimming, just keep swimming, swimming swimming
---
From what I remember it seems fairly equal. Nost had some mobs that hit really hard, but that was about it.
---
Are people forgetting, that one of the main reasons for classic, is that a large player base continuously dedicated themselves to the original game, by choosing to play private servers?
---
Even before nostalrous, Before the petition was made after nost shut down, playing private and not subscribing to retail was like a protest. After examining this player base, and the numbers blizzard chose to do us this favor, thankfully! 
---
As someone that has been playing this game most of my life, i find it really odd why people get this weird sense of entitlement about it. I don’t know where this comes from.
---
Negative. You can wait.
---
Not any framework addons I can see working. Mainly stuff like mobhealth and vendorprices
---
This is what you all wanted.
---
On their connection guide they tell you to download the 3.3.5 client along with their custom launcher. You're always going to know the expansion the server is built on top of because they'll tell you or the client they ask you to download.
---
For people that don't know, Project Ascension is a custom server that with a bunch of unique features that completely change the game.
---
I was leaning more towards maybe Friday-Thursday.
---
Ahh yes i forgot about loot council. I dont think thats gonna be that popular tho with all the abuse stories surrounding it. Personally ive never been in a guild that uses it and horror stories are all i hear about it xD
---
Yeah it turns me off a bit too
---
Plate is fine for warrior, there are just a lot of non-set pieces that drops in dungeons that are better than the tier set.
---
I'm at work, got gf to download the client at home and check for beta servers.
---
:D
---
It is hunter preBIS for the 20 attack power.
---
This is the only reasonable thing I have read so far...
---
Sorry, no more pages in my notebook to add for your interesting arguments.
---
No, he's right. This information is from TBC, but it was the same in vanilla as far as I can remember: https://wow.gamepedia.com/index.php?title=Fishing&amp;oldid=1003558#Increasing_Fishing_Skill
---
The only reason to move to higher-level areas is to get higher-level fish for eg. cooking.
---
Okay, buddy. 
---
If you actually put your paranoia away for a second, they provided screenshots of situations exactly replicating what the streamers were experiencing on the 1.12 reference client in house, and they were the same.
---
I can’t wait to be warlock. Helping others by dishing out healthstones, soulstoning tanks or healers, using curse of exhaustion for fleeing mobs, having my banish target on Garr etc. Oh and I can summon. Can not wait!!
---
Haha, I'm not english native so it seems to earn is more like you did something great enough to deserve it. Actually, he applied to get the beta access, sure it's not enough to "earn" it, but enough to "win" it. Thanks for the reminder :)
---
&gt;How about the fact that the only guilds who have ever completed BWL in 30 mins are completely decked out, and in full world buffs and flasks.
---
Ok, but I'm not really speaking about 30 minute speed clears and more to the fact that it's still going to be cleared by guilds very quickly in terms of progress to clear time.
---
&gt;Blizzard has already stated on record that private server bosses in raids had all the armour values and resistance values off, also how spells interact with bosses. That means the whole meta will change and you can’t just cram 30 fury warriors and rogues now for speed because of new armour values.
---
That's an exaggeration of a statement by far. And from what we've seen the tuning is in some cases likely to be harder on pserver if you look at the boss itself only.
---
It doesn't really mean the 'whole meta' will change either. Nor does it mean you 'cant just cram'. You've made two very sweeping statements there without any real grounding. Especially since if armour became an issue it would just swap warrior dps spots for mage, f.e. Not exactly groundbreaking or something that would increase difficulty.
---
&gt;But yea keep dreaming of 30 min BWL runs every week in a casual-semi serious guild.
---
The guy you commented literally ONLY mentioned "top of the top guilds" and I didn't mention 30 minute clears specifically at all.
---
So yeah... I dont know why you are so hung up on 30 minute clears rather than just the fact that all of the content is extremely easy by comparison to live mythic raids.
---
For the same reason they have a pathing step height higher than players and why they can walk up steep inclines. Prevents them from being trivially exploited, especially in the absence of the ability to jump or the decision making to know when to.
---
&gt;Lok'tar Ogar, brother!  
---
&gt;Let me hype you up about the Horde, right good and proper.  
---
&gt;You don't want chaos? Great. There is no chaos in the Horde. The Horde is not about chaos. It's about brutal *efficiency*. Orgrimmar's buildings are as they are because they get the goddamned job *done*. The Forsaken literally clawed their city out of rock just to fucking *survive*, man. You know how much pain and anguish exists within a Forsaken's mind, having achieved sentience after enslavement to the Lich King? A whole hell of a lot, I tell you what, but they've got a job to do, and that job is survival (and pure, unbridled vengeance).  
---
&gt;Survival is the name of the game. The Horde is a band of merry misfits, just trying to survive in a hostile world. The Orcs didn't want to be here. They were literally brainwashed by a bunch of fucking demons that shattered their homeworld and drove them insane, but they broke free of their bonds and, as a reminder of their former enslavement, impaled Mannoroth's big fucking head on a sixty-foot-tall pike. The Darkspear Trolls, maligned and hated by their kin for the grave sin of daring to help non-Trolls, eke out a meager existence on a pile of small islands. The Tauren find peace with nature in a small enclave surrounded on all sides by desert. The Forsaken, cursed with their very existence, struggle just to keep on not-really-living and not-really-dying.  
---
&gt;They find brotherhood and camaraderie in their shared suffering, and they fight for honor and the hope of a future prosperity.  
---
&gt;What the fuck does the Alliance have to offer? Ancient, decadent cities of their long-dead ancestors that they claim credit for, when in recent generations their legacy has been little more than xenophobia and racism? When Garithos, made leader of a full regional contingent by sheer chance, utilized his role to damn the High Elves and let the Sunwell fall? Or perhaps when the forces of Stormwind, instead of focusing their hatred against a literal intergalactic army of demons, decided that it was really the Orcs' fault that the Second War happened, and proceeded to enslave them and put them in concentration camps? So blind to incompetence and nepotism in their ranks that the highest elite ranks of Stormwind host not only the daughter of Deathwing but the nascent Twilight Father? And the Gnomes and Dwarves tinkering away in a mountain, giving fuck-all attention to anything north of Grim Batol? Or maybe the prissy and ancient Night Elves, screwing about in a magical tree in the north of nowhere, so incompetent in their racial history that they lost both Azshara *and* Nordrassil? Well of Eternity kaputt and all? And despite having millennia-old expertise with the machinations of the Burning Legion, they still don't prepare properly for Archimonde's assault? Nor does Dalaran, when the Kirin Tor are besieged "without warning", having conveniently not only ignored Medivh's warnings but also ignored the fact that he was possessed by Sargeras in the first place and also they're a bunch of goddamned super wizards? Might as well just put a big ol' bubble around their city and pretend they don't exist so that they don't have to help out any of the besieged citizens of Lordaeron.  
---
&gt;The Alliance's legacy is inaction, their birthright unearned and their morality tainted by base prejudice. They lay about, and when threats arise, they continue to lay about until it's too late to do anything but damage control, and then they blame their problems on the funny green fellows and throw them in camps. They're corrupted by the malaise of prosperity, and their shining cities belie their slow downfall.  
---
&gt;Who do you want to be associated with? An army of downtrodden, abused underdogs fighting for the right to live and assembled through fast bonds of wartime brotherhood, or a bloated bureaucracy of racist, snobby malcontents who abandon their allies to the Scourge and pretend themselves wise merely because of the age of the bricks beneath their feet? I prefer the underdogs. For honor! *For the Horde!*

Yes. Why should I watch Content at all ? I never understand why People watch streams and waste their time they could use to Play by them self...but thats my personal opinion.

Mah heart

With a ton of effort, if you have a better spot idea do lemme know

FOR THE HORDE!

They will 100% not sell tokens in classic. People would go mad if they do...
---
Just wanted to throw out there that there will be a lot of raids wanting at least 1 enhancement shaman for enhanced windfury totem. That thing gives your melee insane dps increase.
---
:(
---
LOL

When I first started playing wow as a nelf hunter there was a 60 mage running around the starting area for some reason. He invited me and gave me  a portal to IF. The thing is my computer was so shitty it was just completely lagging out and I couldn't walk anywhere and I was scared because I didn't know where I was. I ended up hearthing back so I was safe but a later that day my brothers nelf rogue got stuck on the boat to menethal harbor because the same crap computer couldn't load fast enough for us to get off the boat before it started heading back.
---
34 hours is not one day 4 hours what are you talking about?
---
Probably keeps people in the leveling zones
---
Your bags will most likely always be full anyway with pots, reagents and other garbage. Other classes has other crap to fill up their bags, like hunter using either one or two quivers, that's two entire bag slots for something class specific. Then we have rogues with their poisons and vanishing powder. More or less all classes has a shit sandwich, you just has to pick the sandwich with the least amount of shit in it. I wouldn't worry about soul shards.
---
Convince her to play warrior, Druid is by far not as good in tanking and Meele DD (and go for Human). Nobody needs druids...
---
I'm not on the BfA hate train, but I will say that WOW has gone in a direction I no longer want to play, myself. 
---
Hanging out in IF or Org, I'd see players shard out as they ran toward me, a completely empty and lifeless main city, and almost no one talking to each other in chat. I hit a button and joined a group in gnomer, never leaving the spot I was standing. Never even seeing the huge front gate of the ruins, just insta-ported into the dungeon.
---
A gnomer full clear took *five minutes* and no one talked, got two epics and three blues at the finish. Last time I did gnomer in vanilla on my warlock, it took around an hour, made three friends I played with for years in TBC (we did Karazhan and Gruul's together).
---
Man the idea that Jeff could just randomly have been asking me my opinion on the patch notes and me not knowing is kinda cool.
---
Since it stays up for a full day, can't we have a ratchet vs crossroads mega battle of the 5's at a specific hour or something?
---
Yeah being in the beta is pretty fucking dope. I've got a level 30 pally and its fun as fuck.
---
This has always been a "concern", but in my experience never mattered.
---
I've played each and every expansion as it released. The initial rush always dies down after midnight and/or I've been able to get ahead of the pack.
---
Obviously it was a bit different when leveling took mere hours (WoD, Legion etc.), but I'm still confident I'll be able to get ahead of most by the time I go to bed.
---
Blackrock Depths says "hi"
---
I am trying Questy to see how properly that works and trying the addon called Focused where I can easily align my unit and target frames. Also will probably install a swing timer addon and align my chat and combat frames.
---
The other addons still needs to be updated. :P
---
Even as Teenager I was lazy as fuck in regards of Gold farming. To get my epic Mount I really scammed a chinese Gold seller. Dont think this method would work today, but I had my epic Mount in bags before I even reached lvl 60 :D (That was before the patch which swapped Mount and skill Prices)...
---
Well that's still more proof than some of you pserver apes have :)
---
Thanks. And no, I actually didn't know these things. I started back in TBC :)
---
Yeah, that was my mindset at the time. But he had already quit by the time we cleared up to Cthun the next week.
---
They checked with their reference build and found it worked that way in Vanilla, too. Therefore not a bug.
---
Just kidding. Here is the post. Not sure if it's the same issue, though: [https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/tech-launcher-keeps-erasing-retail-version/177759](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/tech-launcher-keeps-erasing-retail-version/177759)

This seems misleading/clickbaity at best, and off-topic (focused on the streamer more so than Classic content) at worst. Sorry, I am removing this as a Rule #7/#1.
---
What feeling? Joana has vanilla videos of his path from 1-60, he has the numbers archived. It isn't a "feeling".
---
Thanks man
---
&gt; If WoW tokens existed back then I would've bought some for myself, and probably for some of my friends too.
---
Exactly. My girlfriend at the time and I were both majorly into the AH. I did a lot of mount-flipping with TCG mounts in BC/WotLK/Cata and shit. She completely dominated the glyph market once glyphs came out, and flasks before it. Put together, our net worth was over 1mil in WotLK and she actually gold capped @ 1mil multiple chars in Cata.  
---
That was gold we never spent. Expansions ticked by and we kept playing and never had to dip into those reserves almost ever. Basically almost never touched it. Like you, we had just removed millions of gold from the economy with no intention of really ever spending it.  
---
Once WoW tokens came out? Our accounts coasted on them. I make over $400k per year and affording a sub is like laughably inexpensive, but the idea of paying for my sub with tokens was somehow romantic. Like I was getting the game "For free" now. And yep, exactly as you mentioned -- sure enough, whenever I invited a buddy to the game I told them I'd pay for a few months for them with WoW tokens for them to try it out. Bought tokens for random friends all the time, and so did she.  
---
Over the years, my wealth dwindled as I would come back to WoW occasionally "just to check it out" and *always* paid for a WoW token to do so. Basically since WoW tokens came out, I dropped from a net worth of around 4 million gold down to a net worth of around 100k gold.  
---
That's upwards of 4mil gold entering the economy that never would have re-entered if WoW tokens weren't introduced. And people never consider this aspect of it. WoW tokens are more than just a way to buy gold, but also a way to sell it.
---
Best pvp class at level 5?
---
Do the servers stay up for 24h? I thought it was just for 2hs. But I agree, it wil be starting at 2 am for me so that will be a nope.
---
lucky you i still download 220 KB/s
---
and upload at 50 KB/s
---
my ping is around 80
---
I don't care about the specifics on the terminology.. people disappear on screen in open world.. BAD.
---
Joana is the world’s record holder in levelling speed from actual Vanilla... long before “streamers” were a thing.   I don’t disagree with you that Blizzard deserves the benefit of the doubt but the person you’re replying to isn’t wrong either to be honest.
---
So if it's BETA &amp; STRESS TEST it's only for stress test without full beta invite?
---
...No treble.
---
We don't know when DM is gonna get released and then Hand of Justice is not preBIS for Hunters.
---
Just like weapon skill, first you gain a LOT and after certain break points, the gains will become a lot less. Pretty sure you can get crit capped with world buffs.
---
Additionally, your raid is most likely ALWAYS threat capped (in tryhard guilds), meaning spreading out the dps upgrades among multiple ppl you increase your raid damage when more people can do as much as the tank does. 
---
Doesnt make sense that one guy could do more but is limited by tank threat anyways. And upgrades are always relative to the current gear. Some item might be a 1% crit upgrade to the top dps, but for then 2nd dps it might be 1% and 15 str.
---
Not to mention stacking everything on few guys can kill a guild. Make people leave and there is that possibility that the stacked guy gets poached by a better guild.
---
Multiple reasons why putting your eggs in the same basket isnt a good idea.
---
The Steam controller is pretty good for playing games not strictly designed for controllers. It can be a bit of a pain to get it working with some non-Steam games thanks to launchers, but it should work with WoW as long as you add WoW.exe as a shortcut to Steam. Or you can use something like [GloSC](https://alia5.github.io/GloSC/).
---
Thank you
---
Time Warner Cable is for true Classic fans. They haven't increased the speed in my area in over 10 years.
---
Dude paladin life was so hard in vanilla.  I'm glad I experienced the hardships.
---
Yes, being a hybrid class you were always broke.  All it took was 1 night waiting forever for a tank to think you could tank.  Then you were broke from having to respec.
---
Paladins should be PVP retribution, or just accept their duty as a Flash of Light - Blessing bot.  Good luck with grinding, cause it takes holy pally forever to kill a mob.
---
So don’t take advice from anyone then since nobody has the reference client? Why even beta test at all?
---
Torn between Druid, Mage, Priest, and Warlock.
---
Druid was my Main through all of Vanilla up to CATA when I stopped. so Im for sure going to go druid but thats going to be my gank/Wpvp character mainly and Im not sure I want to start out with it being Ive done it all before.
---
Mages are fun and I enjoyed mine on a pserver. But it seems like its the most popular class choice at the moment so Im not sure if I want to start off with a mage. Mage would be my pvp/farmer
---
Priest was going to be my raider. Always wanted to heal and figured being a holy priest would be a fun change of pace from the melee dps  (feral druid) I was used to. Also Mind Control
---
Warlock. Easy leveling, free 40 mount and can farm Dire Maul and I like fearing people and dotting them up.
---
The hunter training quests were race specific as I recollect, so, back to Teldrassil.
---
This is true for Fortnite as well. Say what you will about the game, but it is beautiful now in much the same way that WoW was 15 years ago
---
I restarted computer and bnet, everything. Still not there hopefully they fix it today.
---
how could i better ask what peoples thoughts on streamers in classic and toxicity that possibly comes from them? like would not naming anyone help?
---
I think it brings back funny memories.   I played a Hunter with similar ammo problem.  Left town with a gazillion bullets and came back with loot. 
---
I have a bunch of less fond memories of people suddenly running out of ammo or shards halfway into a dungeon :-)
---
Same. At least it was the PC Diablo, imagine getting mobile emails whilst checking for beta.
---
I miss making a level 1 priest and helping hogger raid
---
Yeah, I've never really had a problem with expansion launches (although I missed MoP and WoD launches). However for expansions we had a general idea of how popular each server was going to be. This time we have no idea how many servers will be available and how many players to each one.
---
Grats
---
They’re not going to, nor should they, take the time to show you similar proof for every single mob in the game.  The point of what they did show was to give you a basis of understanding for how their internal numbers tuning was done.  It’s accurate.
---
Mage master class
---
I mean I'm always up for a challenge, so I don't mind them increasing the difficulty.
---
But I doubt they're gonna do that, and I loved vanilla as it was back then, so I'm sure I'll love it again :)
---
Low chance? Then why could nobody kill it?
---
I would pay large sums of money to be in your position right now. To not know anything at all, and learning it all over again.
---
This whole ordeal is giving me too much stress.
---
Why complain when there is literally a button in graphics options called CLASSIC.
---
I pay with game tokens, with no active subscription linked to a CC. I got the stress test.
---

so the "test" might be 2 hours but the server is up longer.
---
My take is this:
---
All the healers in Vanilla we’re good, however we have this current wave of theory crafting and #’s dependent type of play, WoW Classic will have a different hierarchy across the board; minus tanking 
---
I remember Druids being strong, yet theory crafting atm has them at the bottom for Classic, all we can really say is wait and see for the “eye test” in game
---
It’s the client for the beta test &amp; it’s the client for the stress test

Everyone needs to allow themselves to be noobs and not care about things like efficiency when playing classic
---
If you're playing on launch day and don't want to be horribly behind I would stick to your own starting area and just meet up with your friend in Loch Modan or Darkshore past 10.
---
Probably best to join your friends after you do your quest. You also have the advantage of easy owl access if you want one.

Loot Council like we did in Vanilla.  DKP is a horrible, and often selfish, system that doesn’t lead to meaningful progression.
---
Can't wait to miss this due to being on the wrong layer. Or watching enemy reinforcements appear out of nowhere when they're invited to the enemy raid group.
---
Listen buddy, those pesky minmaxing tanks are preventing themselves from being critically hit and randomly one shot by bosses.  if you want to be the main tank in a 40 man raid, you have to reach the defense rating breakpoints, so that the 39 other people doesnt have to play slot machine every time you pull a boss.
---
You beat me to it, have my upvote sir.
---
Well yeah of course, i mean it's only 1am to 3am.
---
Then 4 hours of sleep and off to work. Who cares if you look like a zombie at work? "Sorry I don't feel well,spent the whole night retching so I didn't get much sleep" works quite well in cases like this.
---
I enjoy it for PvP and I'll be rolling on PvP realm, I should say I was not sure if it is the class I want to PvE with as that will be a big part of what I hope to do. In any kind of fantasy game I always go for assassins and stealthy classes first. I always thought rogue gear was some of the best looking and in particular forsaken look amazing.
---
Of course they are not gonna test everything, I'm not saying they should.
---
But this test wasn't what people were complaining about it though, people were complaining about dungeon elites not bosses. The only reason the post about first boss in DM is because someone could find actual vanilla footage of that mob.
---
Wow what a blunder its literally nothing like the original #nochanges
---
I woke up and had to leave for work in 20minutes. Saw the pop up window got hyped as fuck and downloaded in (fast internet ftw). When I logged in I was like: „fuck it. at least I can go to work without being hyped the whole day“
---
Somebody tell this guy about Druids.
---
https://discord.gg/uscwdeP
---
Who cares about some random mobs 1-10 though.
---
I dont know why some people, you included, are so dead set on making everything into a pissing match at every opportunity.
---
TILL YOU DIE!
---
It matters though. They are all different things caused by different issues.
---
HAH way too much effort for a shit post 😭
---
I used to listen to the 12hour remix of ameno - era on every expansion when lvling. I guess I'll have to listen to it atleast once during the classic launch.
---
I was curious about the same question as you and I found this thread. Holy shit this community is toxic. So much hate for asking what I believe a pretty viable question.
---
I mean, why on earth would you marry someone who'd leave you over your hobby that you're passionate about?
---
That sounds a lot like settling with what you got to me, lol.
---
Tbf it's not necessarily boosting for a lot of altoholics. I have one of every toon at max on retail and I levelled them all up myself.
---
Still I understand what you're saying. Will also be trying very hard not to get sucked into doing that again when classic arrives. Already picked my race/class and plan not to touch anything else.
---
Good advice, thanks!
---
The stress test seems to be 2 am - 4 am here and I need to be up for work at 5 am. I guess I'll try to play a bit after work instead.
---
TBC was so good on a lot of levels. I think class design and mechanics were at their absolute best during this era. Every spec* was vastly improved, if not to full competitiveness at least to deliver on the promised class fantasy. Dungeon and Raid design was inspired compared to what came before**, and so much was just genuinely Good. 
---
A lot of bad had its roots in TBC too. Flying and the Daily Grind being the most obvious, but while Badges are a cool idea, they should not have been the catch all currency for every tier throughout. I feel like the power gap between tiers was wider, and the catch-up mechanics too strong.
---
*Except maybe Survival Hunters? I seriously have no idea about this spec.
---
**Black Morass sucked. Hyjal was great the first time, but damn did it get tedious pre-Archimonde.
---
Right lets immediately insult pservers for no reason, I'm not saying pservers are accurate at all. They do have proof of various boss armor values from vanilla footage with abilities like Kick that does flat damage and have chosen to increase them because it's too easy.
---
Torn between Druid and Shaman. I loved playing a resto druid in Wrath due to strong raid healing and feeling more mobile than other healers. It looks like from the research that Druid healing in classic is just healing touch spam though, which doesn't sound that fun. I don't have any experience with a Shaman but their healing seems like more fun in Classic. I will definitely level what I don't main as an alt but don't know what I should take into endgame content.
---
Health doesn’t matter here, I’m only interested in how low damage the mob deals. 50 damage for a 30 elite hitting on a 2H warrior is just super disappointing.
---
if they confirm this in the reference client I will acknowledge it but I’m never going to like it. Brain dead low damage like that on trash really takes away from the experience.
---
Again it doesn’t matter what the mob was.  It could have been a level one boar in the valley of trials.  The point is Blizzard showed their process and the reference client says the numbers are correct.  Will one or two mobs need tweaking?  Maybe, but generally the numbers are correct.  Private servers have been guessing for years and people have been adapting their memories from that.  It’s not accurate.
---
"Dont upvote"
---
Dont tell me what the fuck to do
---
&gt; Averages don't matter here, because the average person doublechecking exact combat numbers is almost assuredly older than the average user of this sub.
---
What makes you think that? I'm thinking they're almost assuredly the same age as the average user of this sub.
---
Does that mean you'll leave guilds when your armour changed? Or force them.to change their tabard?
---
Just trying to give what perspective I have, I don't know if any of what I indicated is brag worthy, just trying to indicate what I "\*think\* I remember from top tier content, and my experience as I remember it, was counter to what everyone is saying, so I'm confused...
---
I'll try and edit...
---
Well, that's still better than what I have...
---
DKP has the same horror stories and we are talking "hardcore" guilds, they care a lot more.
---
On pservers for example, about 90% of the guilds are lootcouncil, the rest DKP.
---
These streamers are bad and promote bad culture with the things they say. Nothing against cursing but calling other players "A real f*cking dumbass" and other things similar promotes this behavior that you would normally hear on xbox live in a fps game. This crap has no place in an mmo. This is the type of toxic behavior Blizzard was trying to get rid of in Overwatch.
---
R/wow has 1.000.000 subscribers

Druids can be cute cats and RAWR bears. Warriors are just weapon-swingers. Make sure that the class your gf picks fits her personality and playstyle. Endgame only really matters if she's an experienced gamer.
---
I hope so because then i can play more tomorrow before work.
---
i renewed my WoW sub just to have better chances of getting in and havent yet :&lt;
---
Go full BM, it's much stronger. Your rotation should basically only be hunters mark and serpent sting after lvl 20 or so, since Arcane Shot (and Aimed Shot, which share cooldown with Arcane Shot) costs too much mana compared to their dmg. You want to never have to drink or eat, and just constantly run around and chain kill mobs.
---
I'd definitely just go full BM, since the talents offer very strong buffs for your pet.
---
&gt; Nobody ever says “LFG DM”.
---
LOL, ok Cata baby.
---
Calling druids 'extremely good healers' is just inaccurate, because you're comparing them to the other healers. If you have players of equal skill playing each of the healing classes, druid isn't even close to the best in a pve standpoint. Their numbers aren't nearly as good and every other class brings something much more valuable. Druids have mark of the wild, innervate, battle rez, but 1-2 druids is enough for that. It doesn't compete with paladin's near infinite mana pool and blessings, priests healing output, or shaman's group healing/totems. In 5 mans this discrepancy just stands out even more. This isn't to say you shouldn't bring druids. You should always bring whoever shows up and can press buttons in the right moments, but the numbers don't add up overall.
---
In pvp however, druids are amazing, though a strictly 'resto' druid isn't anything exciting. What makes druids *truly* amazing is that in pvp, they are actually what a druid is depicted as in the lore. You're constantly shifting, controlling the battlefield, healing, running all over the place...a good druid in pvp will always have a spot in my team.
---
I would love to just be in the stress test and I don't even get invited to that.
---
Always someone with a chip on their shoulder who takes offence if you mention experience to give a point of reference.  I wouldn't pay him any attention.
---
The horror stories come from people who contribute nothing but feel like they should have priority on every piece of loot, over their core warriors and healers that are progressing the guild through content.
---
Yes they both are
---
Chris Metzen is the MAN! The dude is great.
---
Even heroic raiding is challenging but fair.  Mythic raiding is a real ball buster.  Hard to get that many motivated people in one place -- it is a lot of wiping.
---
I got you beat ez pz
---
lol pretty much it. i also doubt that kids is their biggest audience so there is no real reason to it. i mean, they actually know your age... i always open tickets writing formally and they reply in a corny borderline/cringe way and im like wtf?
---
I think a rogue is your best bet. Great for duels and bgs while not being overly gear dependant. Pretty much perfect for what you want.
---
Is ele/Reston the best combo to go in pvp? I see so many 2handed melee weapons playing shaman and that doesn’t feel like ele.
---
Legendary communication.
---
&lt;3
---
I used to play monopoly on a compaq with a monochrome monitor. I could print to my sweet dot matrix printer! War never changes!
---
Only downside to Tbc launch heroics were immense amounts of 360 cleaves and cc being so incredibly important but not altogether available for all dps.
---
&gt; If you only follow wow, sure. But Hearthstone and Overwatch are completely different stories with Jeff Kaplan and Ben Brode.
---
Brode left after the shitshow that was Shudderwock. OW has been completely ruined by its SJW pandering anticompetitive bullshit. HS has a super greedy business model.  
---
Both great games. Both games ruined by the company.  
---
Blizzard has been shitty. Their stock plummeted from a high of ~$80/share about 6 months ago down to holding around $45/share consistently now. And this was after being around $60 1.5 years ago for an extended period. Rest of the economy is doing great. And I say this and someone who held over $100k worth of ATVI in my portfolio and got the fuck out around $70 last year when I saw the writing on the wall, which was even BEFORE the travesty which was BlizzCon.  
---
This year, I will not be going to BlizzCon. This is the first year in over half of a decade that I will not be going.  
---
I had every single Hearthstone cardback that was obtainable in the entire game until last November. Almost every single card in the game. Over 30 golden legendaries. I'd put out about $200 into every expansion that came out, even *knowing* it had a shitty business model which was exploitative. But the game has just gotten worse and worse and fucking worse. They're nerfing Rogue Preparation now instead of just HoF'ing it. I quit cold turkey in November. Haven't missed it. Have easily saved over $1k since then. I've missed like 6 months worth of cardbacks now after not missing a single one since the very first season in, what, April 2014?  
---
I played WoW from Vanilla until WoD, with only really one break for the first half of Cata. I played it hard. Easily over 25k hours. ~240k HK's on my account, pre-nerf Insane title, rank1 DPS at varying times/varying classes on my chars. Did MoP challenge modes, 2x Gladiator (S2/S3)... near the end of MoP I had almost every single achievement in the game (missing like 5 in total -- 250k HKs, 10k PvP pet battles, and a few others).  
---
I played WC3, D1/D2.. I was a 12 year old kid playing fucking D2. And I played it all the time.  
---
I never got into SC/SC2 really, but in OW I got up to Masters. Peaked around 3800 or so. Not truly incredibly good, but significantly above average. And what they did to that game is a tragedy.  
---
This company has turned to shit. There are so, so many reasons not to trust them. Almost every single game has shit smattered all over it in one way or another. I've ranted enough. There's no debate here. Blizzard needs to claw their way out of the ground on this one. I'm very pleased with what I've been seeing so far, but also fuck layering. So we will see.  
---
Anyone who is 100%'ing into Blizzard is just giving into bullshit hype and should just crawl back to their cryptocurrency subreddits where they belong, because that's the exact kind of idiocy I see there.
---
Server is off line for a few hours. So, contain your excitement.
---
Yea this is a nice sentiment and I'm excited for you, etc; but I refuse to encourage the growth of the Alliance! For the Horde!
---
A lot of us are remembering classic, but not 1.12.  I specifically remember how the last few pulls before the final boss in LBRS were... They were nerfed long before 1.12, but I'm still always going to think of it that way.
---
Oh really? Just checked Blizzard Acount Stuff and I've got a second Legion PTR too.
---
Stress test only.
---
Only expansion I've been on private servers for (since I never really liked Wrath/TBC compared to vanilla. They're fine, I just prefer vanilla if going old school). Was a lovely expansion.
---
Believe it or not, i don't care about OP's problems. And indeed, that's what i wanted. Not OP apparently.
---
Thank you for telling me what's fun and what isn't! I will now go on trying to enjoy what is actually fun, i.e. playing casually, instead of trying to make my character the best it can be (since that's just boring).
---
Imagine... if I hadn't ran into you I would've gone on enjoying all the wrong things, and not the things that are actually fun! My savior ❤️
---
I just hope I die during wotlk. Problem solved.
---
I use the stress test to craft a level 5 wand as soon as possible
---
Love your work. Keep it up bro
---
Every person who played back then has to fit a little mini resume into their posts. It’s obligatory I guess to mention nax, high warlord, and AQ40.
---
*“Just letting you guys know... I’m a badass”*
---
Exactly and a prime example is osrs, that game is thriving right now and it's all because its community driven
---
Because people type and comment without thinking and researching because it "feels" like it must be true, thats how we get posts like "this cant possibly do X damage it must be bugged"
---
so annoying - this info is not hard to find.
---
Check you're launcher for "Beta &amp; Stress Test" you are probably in too
---
Then play something else.
---
LETS...GO?
---
Troll Rogue on retail TBC era?
---
I'm 99% settled on feral druid tank. 
---
I know their survivability is mediocre but I don't think it's an issue aside of some selected fights (or when healers suck).
---
I know their threat can be very decent, but I'm curious if anyone knows how decent? Can I hope to outthreat a non-threat-geared TF warrior if I spam MCP? Can I hope to outthreat a non-TF T2 warrior with AQ weapon?
---
Most likely no one knows the answers but guesses are welcome :)
---
Shut up nerd. Boom roasted.
---
Are they fun to play? Feels like they just have one way to play if you wanna be good
---
Farsight in not working as it did in vanilla not sure if eagle eye is either. It should be canceling the current farsight each time you click the ability again and the only way to chain it is to cliick very quickly.
---
currently it works like retail where it lets you have a second farsight queued up as the current one is going.
---
I guess my point was I didn't feel like my experience was good druids vs poor priests and shaman...  I feel like the priests and shaman I was playing with were some of the top of their class at the time, which was why they were in the progression position they were in...  I have a specific recollection of Shaman struggling during vanilla content, but it's been 13 years, so I could just be horribly mistaken in my memory...
---
Sheesh, this guy pays $195 a month on a game whose community downvotes him to oblivion
---
Still at work, that's why I asked - will check when I get home.
---
Absolutely no idea, but expansion launches always get a crapton of players returning, and also TBC/WotLK had millions to begin with. The longer the leveling process, the more you can get away from the mass of players. 
---
In WotLK I practically had Storm Peaks and Icecrown all to myself. In MoP I saw a few people in Dread Wastes and even a handful more in Nagrand in WoD.
---
Of course I can only speak for myself, but I thoroughly enjoy fast and efficient leveling and will definitely be aiming for the same in Classic, as much as conditions allow.
---
If you can only see the stress test server then it's that.
---
Damn, that sucks. Maybe they'll send out more invites after the test is over but that's thinking optimistically.
---
Use it as an excuse for your guild to funnel bags to you (onyxia bag, core felcloth bag, etc)
---
Yes, but would be awesome with more. Considering this is now a core concept in retail. With a new one coming in next content patch
---
Thank you for the insight, I appreciate it!
---
Honestly if I decide to main a Druid I would want to heal anyway (and messing around with a balance/resto spec in PvP). I only asked because I was curious why I kept seeing that one weapon mentioned for druids
---
because there will be no more excuses for being a criminal scum besides that you're too cheap to pay 15 bucks a month
---
This is great. I remember playing WC1 in 94-95 when I was 12 years old. My English was ok even at that age, but I had no idea what "morass" meant. And since it had Black in front of it it sounded even more mysterious. 
---
It's a shame the Black Morass didn't make it to WoW, it's one of my favorite warcraft place names.
---
Ya but, defining someone’s “best” as speccing into a spec you deem to be “best” IS entitlement.
---
I'd say it's about the norm in gaming subs tbh. Not many gaming subs that are chill. The more popular they become, the more trolls and toxicity you get.
---
Why is everyone saying this? The realm is offline for me? (EU)
---
Might be kited. Or a GM was bored and spawned it for luls.
---
To avoid misunderstanding i should ask first - did you start this "bug discussion" because of my "bug" explanation or it's about "should we report everything is different from 1.12"?
---
If it's first part - thank you, i will also discuss it with my Senior QA buddies to be sure.
---
If second - developers asked us to search everything different from original game.
---
&gt; We rely on feedback from the community. We have avid fans, not just players from the community but Blizzard itself. With the beta, we expect people to **call us out on things we missed**. We try to be extremely thorough in researching things to get it right, and when we do miss something, we'll find it and deal with it there.   
---
&gt; I can tell you already, that with our internal alpha testing, the amount of time people are putting into this and what they're finding is pretty spectacular. Getting that feedback is a good way for us to verify that **we're hitting the mark on what that experience was like in Classic**.   
---

---
Fair enough. Ive never used loot council so idk where the stories come from only the resulting stories.
---
Hi, /u/smidivak
---
had a nice, sensible chuckle at this.
---
Exactly.
---
Quel'danas and Northrend made appearances in WC3 (did Quel'Danas get called by name? Or was it just the 'Sunwell Island' or something?). The Ulduar here is actually likely to be what became *Uldum,* which had a minor appearance in vanilla as a closed off vault in southern Tanaris, and then expanded into being the name for a whole region in Cataclysm, as the bottom tip of Kalimdor (which makes sense with this continent's placement).
---
Tbh LC is pretty garbage too.
---
That was the original plan but sounds a bit boring lol. Plus figured that it'd be nice to learn shot timing for late game.
---
I'll probably end up going fill BM for lvling if it's that's strong though
---
Thanks for the help!
---
ah okay, well obviously depends what spec you gonna roll for pve, some of the specs arent exactly thrilling no.
---
As said, it was just to give perspective that what I was seeing wasn't in low tier or fringe content, but the primary avenue of what was considered high end play at the time.  I never achieved HWL, I didn't have that drive.  None of the things I mentioned really make you a "badass".   Hell, most people perceived HWL as a mark of extreme dedication rather than skill.
---
I dont know why, but this actually looks cooler than the 
---
 map we have ingame.
---
Brainlet definition
---
Ive never had any problems with DKP in the guilds ive been in that used it. Could just be confirmation bias tho since ive never been in a guild with loot council so i only hear the bad stuff and never see the good.
---
Just doing M0 at the gear level it drops is more punishing than Vanilla? You must be talking about 400 ilvl+ doing M0-5 being more forgiving, but overgearing has always been like that
---
Nope. I remember someone kiting one of those, to Ironforge. People took advantage of it, for weapon skillups until a GM removed the NPC.
---
No, you could kite those to wherever you wanted because they turned immune for a while once they dropped to 1 HP (only while you were on a specific quest I think?)
---
You can reach skill level 75 in a capitol city.
---
Different mobs have different ways that damage is calculated.
---
.. hooks
---
I just got it. Hopefully a streamer organises some massive raid on hogger or on another starter zone if possible. Would be fun
---
It is such an easy mode for a mage.
---
You also bring so much utility, have teleports and can make food for yourself.
---
Yes, the initial stress test is 2h, but the stress test server will stay up longer. 
---
Blizzard post : The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT).
---
https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-1/178282
---
So the server is up for 26 hours.
---
Because I know that by and large if one mob has correct damage they all have correct damage. People in the community have already compared old videos from SFK to the beta, for instance, and they were correct.
---
Complaining about mob damage because it "seems" low is a waste of everyone's time. Such complaints are almost certainly just mistaken. If you have reason to believe something is broken, do your fucking job as a tester and verify that it's actually broken before reporting it. If you're not in the beta yourself, do everyone a favour and stop making a big fuss about shit you see second-hand on stream.
---
For instance, if the same mob normally deals reasonable amounts of damage, but at other times the damage is inexplicably low, then that there is probably a bug. This is how the Stoneskin totem bug was caught.
---
It is not really a problem just a minor inconvenience
---
Yeah how the hell do i get in? Got it installed and everything, realm is just down
---
hm ok, then ill join them later.   
---
Are owls that good? But I think I have to go with the nightsaber stalker for extra nostalgia if Ill get my pet there.
---
I loved Mists, but the dungeons were pretty bad. They were cool to do once, but their overly gimmicky nature made them feel terrible on repeat. There wasn't much reason to do them, but in previous and following expansions I liked doing dungeons even if not totally necessary. Dungeons are like the core of the game to me.
---
As others have said I think the far better option would be to copy your character from the Vanilla to the TBC server so you don't actually lose it if you want to go back and play the vanilla server.
---
But still. Kiting a mob all the way from Blasted Lands -- how does that even work?
---
Maybe they can crash the servers every couple hours, too - for that "true" vanilla experience /rolleyes
---
It's not just one or the other; and definitely not a 90/10 split.
---
There's loot list, suicide kings, EPGP, modified SK, gold bid, GDKP... it goes on and on.
---
&gt; Beat tanks generate threat through Maul and Swipe spam in Vanilla (that's literally everything except for fearie fire) and Maul, just like cleave and heroic strike, only gets used on the next auto attack. In raids you get punched hard enough to get a good amount of rage, which means you can basically spam Maul. With 50% faster auto attacks (and therfore Mauls) you get higher threat than warrior tanks could dish out.
---
No. Just no. Fury tanking out TPS anything.
---
thank you anonymous redditor: https://i.imgur.com/xDFpCw3.png
---
Yep, the true kings of vanilla when it comes to being the all rounder and most convenient class to play.  The worst you get is people bugging you for food and portals
---
Hey, can you tell me what is appearing for you here: https://account.blizzard.com/games? Currently at work and can't check the launcher :&lt;
---
Here's hoping.
---
OPTUS UPDATE:
---
our tech team is working through an issue currently impacting access to some websites. Please DM us with more info if you’re experiencing difficulties and we’ll get back to you as soon as possible. We apologise for any inconvenience.
---
Yeup. Pruning began with WoD. Mists went a little nuts with its abilities, even. Warriors got *three* new abilities at level 87 with their Banners. Druids got god damn Symbiosis, which was the most complicated ability in the history of the game.
---
Depends on context. In Westfall or Redridge I would use 'DM', when whispering people or in more global channels I would spell it out.
---
were you subbed at the time of getting the key?
---
Wowwiki has an explanation of how it worked in Vanilla.
---
Why
---
you are likely to get 1st pick for later larger betas too
---
What's your experience with the Mythic+ system in Legion/BFA? Have you ever tried it out/completed a high level mythic+?
---
You're welcome now go away.
---
I think this game is going to challenge a lot of people’s beliefs. 
---
Initially I think we are going to see so many players at launch that it’s going to gut the retail population for a bit, plus a lot of former players will return for nostalgia sake.  Servers are going to be busy. 
---
What will then happen after the initial rush will be very interesting. 
---
I would imagine that after the initial hype and flurry wears off, some folks with rose colored glasses will see the time investment involved and realize they aren’t kids or in college anymore, and trickle away. 
---
Likewise, casuals getting in on the hype won’t really like it and we will see it trickle off for a few people.  Some current YouTube reactions of players that never played Vanilla are already tear fests. 
---
Finally, a lot of hardcore folks are going to realize that the game, especially raiding, isn’t as hard as they remember.  The mechanics for fights in many cases are nowhere near as complex as some fights now and since , and the community has gotten wiser. Back in 2004-2006, most folks were morons when it came to mechanics like interrupts and not standing in shit. Honestly the real challenge will be getting 40ish people. 
---
Streamers are also going to mess with server populations, and when those streamers stop playing the game will their server population die?
---
In the end this game is going to be very popular and I think it will sustain for some time with a very stable population was the initial flurry fades a couple of months in. MMOs live on content though, and eventually this game will offer nothing new or the stuff that is there will be too unobtainable for a lot of players that can’t find a 40man.
---
You're probably remembering it correctly. At the end of the day a great resto druid &gt; a bad anything. I don't really ever have a problem bringing a resto druid to anything, but from a pure min/max standpoint, druid is the one class that I try to avoid having too many of.
---
&gt; Truth is the people posting those screenshots didn't like his political stances and that's all there is to it. 
---
Got anything to back that up? People posting stuff like that seem a bit childish to be politically driven to me tbh.
---
Apparently Pandaren had been one of their considerations for the Burning Crusade Alliance race in place of draenei. Samwise was constantly looking for a place to bring them in, it just took some time before they got their chance.
---
Well the only reason why I even consider playing warrior (3 viable specs) is because gold sellers exist, otherwise I would just play hunter or mage
---
Screech is really nice for multi-mob tanking, but If you're leveling with friends it hardly matters. Get your kitty.
---
its by using the API of the current game. You can use "!" to prevent canceling abilities on cast, but still be able to cast it back to back.  
---
I believe you could create the same thing with the vanilla API given how powerful it is, but the specific "!" function of the API was added in the TBC+ API
---
It is the red and yellow set. its a hybrid set more than enhancement.  the set enables the (in my opinion) the strongest pvp spec of them all for BG teamplay.  The Elemental/resto burst specc, which can pretty much vaporise any target in pvp instantly when your combo crits.
---
I was hoping elites to be bugged. Now there's more and more evidence that Classic is going to be easier than private servers. 
---
Now we can expect 15 minutes MC speedruns, and Naxx cleared 1.5 hours after its release.
---
Back in the day when I pulled all nighters and 4 am rolled around to keep my self awake I'd blast "Live to Win" and it did wonders
---
Where's the fishing party at boys?
---
i had to change my region to NA to even see the retail PTR, could it have something to do with that?
---
Wrong
---
After I hit 60 on my main, I will for sure do alot of twinking! Personally, for most of BC and wrath I would lvl my main to max, mess around a bit and then make tons of twinks at different brackets. I have done 19, 39, 60, 70 and lvl 85 twinks during my time playing over the years and loved it. The thight knit community was great. The best was actually the research and thinkering, trying to make the most at your lvl. Like getting the STV arena trinkets and fishing rewards at 19, or quest items not meant for your lvl etc.
---
The debuff limit will be 16 instead of 8 in mc blizzard has announced. This will help warlocks early on being able to use Corruption and maybe get the shadow buff from priest.
---
I understand how defence and serious tanking works, I’ve farmed the full defence prebis set before, I’m just trying to relate to people who like the dungeon sets, chill.
---
Being real though - If threat isn’t an issue on bosses for the tank, they can just keep up improved shield block anyway and never be crushed or crit, making their defence rating basically worthless. If threat is an issue, you probably want to take more DPS gear to keep aggro. So it’s situational. Hitting defence caps is important, but overrated. Skarm has talked about this before.
---
I would like to play melee dps and play alliance. I'm the kind of guy that likes to minmax.  Which race, class, spec combos would suit me best?
---
thoughts on adding LFR? it takes a long time to from a group of 40 people especially on low pop servers. Cross realm auto matchmaking would be really great, it lets us go straight into the action and experience the main content faster #nochanges 😎 👍
---
Oh okay, never realized. Rather impossible to enforce such a rule, though.
---
It's because you don't use the Print Screen key.
---
Fuck off casual scum
---
For me it's 2x Legion PTR but I think I don't have Beta Access, just Stress Test
---
sure, have a look: [https://i.gyazo.com/d346fdb600f294397b44891d6e27f613.png](https://i.gyazo.com/d346fdb600f294397b44891d6e27f613.png)
---
It's mostly for the stress test only I'm afraid.
---
Source: I got one and was jebaited.
---
Nothing relating to the test server, although I have downloaded the stress test client.
---
Only stress test invites, right? riight?!?!
---
Everyone has their slot - a rejuvenation bot resto druid can do wonders to help smooth tank healing and raid healing, but they aren't the strongest healers in vanilla. That being said:
---
You can heal any 5man content in vanilla with a druid. People might complain about only having battle rez, but it's not THAT big of a deal.
---
You can raid any 40 man content with druid healers.
---
You can raid any 20man content with druid healers.
---
If you're good at pvp, you will be highly desired in pre-made BG groups for your flag running ability. AB groups will also utilize you, but expect to play a lot of defense, as a druid can hold a node solo for quite a long time while you wait for backup.
---
Ahh, but i have all the upvotes
---
Are you being intentionally obtuse?  Do you think Blizzard isn’t aware of how their own game works?  They’ve shown the testing environment and their basis for comparison.  They provided examples so that you know they’re doing it.  You’re caught up on one silly mob that is likely perfect but your memory is skewed by private server guesses.
---
Classic but with some of the TBC class/spec balancing, Keep the hope alive.
---
Nostalgia, it isn't vanilla if the resolution is too good.
---
It was a thing and an art in itself in vanilla. I've seen Lord Kazzak being kited to Stormwind and whiping out the whole city.
---
What time is the stress test?
---
You can't play Vanilla and 14 at the same time sweet summer child
---
Miss the days of going into Game
---
Yeah, that's the only instance and I didn't go far enough on private servers to see that. Generally, as far as I've read, you only really take DW tanking warriors for speed runs?
---
Oh nice that looks like mine, the second Legion PTR wasn't there before. So I guess chances are I'm in the Stress Test too : ).
---
Thanks kindly! That is indeed the plan!
---
I had an extra legion PTR, and when I checked launcher, Beta &amp; Stress Test. Logged in, Stress Test realm (which is offline) only.
---
Never really enjoyed playing a rogue in PVE but for world PvP, duels and BGs they are lots of fun. I mean, your other choice is shaman. If you're wanting to play ele and blow people up, you're going to need good gear. Really good gear. Same with enhance. You mentioned you didn't have time to raid.
---
Rogues have some abilities with high base damage, allowing them to do good damage without necessarily having the BiS gear available. Also imo, rogues have a higher PvP skillcap that an enhancement/ele shaman.
---
I think what's more likely is we will almost definitely see TBC servers running in tandem with classic wow servers, maybe even wotlk if TBC is a hit. It wont take them nearly as long to work out the coding and porting with these expansions cause they are far less bloated as classic wow was. I also think its entirely possible that we will be seeing a wow 2.0 coming down the pipeline, rather than new classic content,  as the tbc and wotlk legacy servers get sorted in years to come, I'm thinking like 8 years from now maybe? Wow 2.0 would probably closely mimic classic in terms of the core gameplay, community and raid themes. I'm also kind of basing this line of thinking that wow retail becomes a bit of a ghost town and they look for new ways to generate income. Just my two cents
---
Also, your original posts reflect reality better: you can have theorycrafters sitting in their chair and talking about theoretical stuff, comparison and numbers etc.
---
However, good players are just good no matter what they play. In that sense, it is irrelevant comparing numbers or other theoretical stuff.
---
You can have a full premade with the best class composition with bad players, or an awful comp with good players. I think its out of question which team will win in instanced pvp...
---
As for your memories, I think you played with good players during the BG grind. As for pve, probably those druid players were just better than the other healers (or were slacking less :p).
---
The only time this good/bad argument is not cutting through is when we compare one button dps classes in a tank and spank pve encounter
---
We can't see this in the 1.12 build, but way back before any talent tree updates there was a partially OP hunter build. Getting the Rake pet with 1.0 attack speed, you could do a bm build that healed you for 40 every time the pet attacked. With the attack speed on crits, it wasn't impossible to get that every 0.7 seconds. For Vanilla that was an ABSURD amount of healing. Especially for one of the only classes able to kite. 
---
It was changed very early, but saw a vid of some dude geared well doing it and he was a force.
---
Is there a list of Classic-compatible addons anywhere? I'm expecting pfUI to become available as everyone uses it on pservers and its excellent, but it needs a good hour setting up
---
Sounds like maybe you should flip a d4 die. They're all versatile, fun classes.
---
2008 here, got one this morning. I started in late BC.
---
I think it's correct. I also think druids work just as priests do. Don't quote me on this, didn't raid on either.
---
Ye, that's the confusing part - I think they labeled it as Legion PTR on the homepage.
---
Play what you want
---
It's the opposite  for me. I got into the stress test, but I haven't got any emails about it. (not in spam folder either).
---
HC BM was probably the most fun I had in TBC tbh
---
Roll nelf or gnome, thats what my alt is gonna be. Nothing more fun than a tiny gnome running around!
---
Not even using a CRT monitor. 
---
If your monitor weighs less than 20 pounds and barely fits on your desk, we can't be nostalgia friends. And I was going to invite you to my hogger raid. For shame.
---
shut up brainlet
---
I mean the chances to get an encounter **without** any bugged spawns was low.
---
Perhaps i'm missing something but the green bar - autoshot timer/swing timer?
---
I thought mods were disabled in beta?
---
Must be nice at least getting into the stress test. -.-
---
I really does! LOL!!!
---
JO'GAR OGAR for you!!!!
---
Got Beta &amp; Stress Test. 
---
Accounted created in 2014  
---
On and off subscription for last 5 years. Never played Vanilla.   
---
Waiting for server to go online. Figure around reset time? LOL
---
Got the same problem. Blizzard just trolling us at this point.
---
I guess mine said classic beta and stress test but I didn't look at it much before work.
---
You need to [learn to play](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ctVrpQ-orss) somehow.
---
5 days played doesn’t mean 5 days irl lmfao
---
No, as long as you have a WoW sub you can play
---
&gt;then people would most likely play at 5 fps, due to how many polygons (orders of magnitude more) the modern characters have and the particle effects, shadows etc.
---
Are you able to back that up at all or are you just purely speculating.
---
Yes, most likely - but that's what I was looking for.
---
I saw it on my launcher but got the email immediately after.
---
Human fury warrior.
---
(It did.)
---
THIS x1000000...I'm getting older(27 in a couple weeks) and I probably should try to find someone to settle down with but god damn...I'm willing to put off for 1 more year while I poopsock WoW classic with all my friends I've known since 05' Classic!
---
If you just got it this morning or last night, it's only for the stress test.
---
EU stronk, EU never weak. The expacs always launch at around midnight each time since 2005, so we are used to it.
---
Ben Askren plays classic?
---
Stop replying to this guy man, he’s a cuck
---
Tbf, the quality of a crt monitor is quite well simulated.
---
I've been invited to participate in the stress test. On the launcher it states: "Beta &amp; Stress Test: Classic WoW", however, when I go to log in, only the stress test realm is shown as offline. No complaints.
---
Not even difficult tbh. Mobs had no fixed area, so you only had to stay close enough and keep kiting. I suppose its even easier when the mob cant die as you dont need to be wary of killing it
---
Addons work in the beta, but they must be ported for the beta client. I wrote that addon to see my reload/shot timer.
---
Oh, yes, I see it now.
---
I don't think level 20+ boars exist
---
its even more boaring playing like this. Its more of a "waiting for respawn" game.
---
You will need to go back to Teldrassil to do your hunter quests. Don’t let that stop you from playing with your friends though!
---
World of Warcraft: fishathon!  I’m down
---
Made its way in as a dungeon in TBC i believe.
---
For alliance you go gnome for pvp, human for pve, for horde you go orc.
---
Holy shit I never thought about just rolling a die upon launch to decide on a class. Hmmm...
---
I couldn't bring up the addons menu (or am I too old for this?).  Is it done at char select, or do you just drop them in the addons folder - I noticed it existed.
---
It was about the definition of a bug. If Blizzard indeed want testers to report everything differing from 1.12 as a bug then you're absolutely right and I'm in the wrong, but that would leave them with a lot of junk. Ie the menus being transparent, the damage font being different, more options in the graphics page, etc etc etc that are different from 1.12 but NOT bugs. In my world, a bug is something that wasn't intended and isn't working properly. All of the above is working as intended while being different from 1.12 so reporting it as "bug" is really strange imo
---
you want to be night elf, play night elf, looks &gt; racials especially if your not a hardcore pvper.
---
If you don't know how to manage a simple thing like soulshards, warlock is not for you anyway
---
Prolly just for stress test , this is NA right?
---
You only make food for pt members or ask for money in return.
---
Honestly, not that bad.
---
Sheep is a very good CC in the dungeons. As a warlock, i remember tanking one of the mobs with my voidwalker just to have no risks. Kinda works as a CC but tank needs to aggro if VW dies. 
---
Also healers forgetting to use a fucking soulstone and releasing their spirit is really annoying. I much rather SS myself then
---
Vanilla priest input: You typically had around 6 priests in a raid and would be designated a group to buff back then.
---
If you didnt bring enough candles for buffing, you could whisper a fellow priest (NOT THE CLASS LEADER!!) to cover for you :P

My sub is canceled with 14 days left active and I got the stress test last night.
---
this is how the beacons in LOTR worked lol
---
They couldnt die unless you destroyed a specific stone/crystal no matter what. I remember pulling one of those without knowing that...
---
Yes and that's why they do sharding in such a situation in modern wow, so that you don't have 100 chars on the screen, thus slaughtering everyone's fps.
---
As a fifth race for Reign of Chaos, yes. In 2002. With some other goofy details. Then they got slipped in as minor easter eggs, followed by a minor side character in The Frozen Throne with Chen Stormstout which more or less shifted them out of joke territory. Pandaren weren't just considered for Alliance race for the Burning Crusade but were in development, so even *during Vanilla* they were working on them (before eventually deciding to bring in the draenei on the back of a few retcons).
---
Yeah, I definitely won’t be giving out free food to ransoms, they need to pay
---
At that point just pick Druid and roll whatever faction your guild/friends are going.
---
Yea I'd be pumped to even get a chance to stress test! Unfortunately none of me or my friends have gotten invites :(
---
I did. Maybe sub isn't needed for the actual stress test, but can't find information about that anywhere yet.
---
Proof if anyone is interested: https://imgur.com/a/oiyg7So
---
Usually it’s priest or Druid pick
---
Thanks for replying! 
---
I might of missed this part but is there no pvp gear in vanilla?
---
Someone linked "willitclassic". I dont recall the domain, but you can google it.
---
It was possible on smaller servers. I solo grinded to R14 from April to August 2005 on Stonemaul. That was when Stonemaul was a low/med pop and very few people were doing the grind for various reasons. On a larger server, I doubt this would have been possible. In Classic, with cross-realm BG, no chance whatsoever.
---
Oh oh oh you are such a badass dude
---
Could be 1.12 thing, plus 13 years of 1.12 on private servers to discover the details.
---
The addons button on the character selection screen wont show up unless you have addons installed. You need to put them in your classic client's addon's folder and restart the game to see the button.
---
give paladins a taunt and boom I'm happy
---
When is it coming back up?
---
I activated a subscription to go after my current token two days ago because I was afraid I was ruining my chances. Got into the stress test as well, but am glad to know it doesn't seem like I blew it before then. Thanks for the info!
---
&gt; they're using the BfA 8.1 engine
---
AFAIK it was 8.0, any source on this?
---
Out of curiosity, If I was granted access to the real Beta, would there be a "WoW Classic Beta" entry on the Games and Subscription Site?
---
TIL there was respec cost decay!
---
It will only be temporary, chill buddy.
---
+1 informative, ty
---
Minor inconveniences is partly what makes vanilla so great. You have to micro manage things and not get everything handed to you.
---
Virtually 0 downsides unless your in the most competitive raiding guilds
---
My main was a mage from vanilla to wotlk, 300 days of /played. I never be bothered a lot with portals and food/water. Maybe 1 or 2 people per week asking for something. Not bad actually.  
---
But a lot of food/water prep when raiding tho...
---
This is pretty much how it worked. Individual players who died during pulls would call for a buff in raid chat with the group # they were in. I didn't play Paladin but I THINK they had an add-on to manage who was doing Might/Wis/Kings on each group.
---
[From a blue post](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291829/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-22nd)
---
"…May 22, from 4–6pm PDT…" "The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 (becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT)."
---
Was tempted to ditch work today to play the stress test when I got the email that I was invited, however money 😭 even 5 levels and 2 hours of play would have been great fun.
---
You say there's virtually 0 downside, but what's the upside?
---
Imagine no flying.
---
Why was he against Vanilla/Classic? I just remember him saying that Blizzard was in the right for shutting down Nostalrius (which they were).
---
There was but I'm not exactly sure which phase they will be introducing it. I wouldn't expect it any time soon.
---
You dont buff everything before each pull, fortitude last s for a long time. Blessings are a little bit worse, but the paladins in my guild in vanilla had an addon for it. (You whispered the paladin something like ”salv” or ”kings”. Then the paladin could just press a button) 
---
This was before the group blessings.
---
If you never experienced a 20,000 player queue, massive lag spikes, and trying to quest in a starting area that has 500 people in it, you never played Vanilla.
---
Bring it.
---
Not in vanilla. If your skill is too low you won't catch anything at all. You just get a message saying the fish got away when you try to click the bobber.
---
allow me just clarify, the streamers play together you end up having him involved, my issue isn't his stream as I don't watch, its they way he bug reports false shit and then spends time complaining, his overall attitude stinks and it shows through people's streams i watch.
---
I'm not triggered at all, just don't like these elitist pompous people who cry and go toxic when things don't go their way. and clearly for my up votes and your down votes the community who are watching all this classic content etc all agree.
---
Strangely, that doesn’t actually sound that bad. Nice!
---
I’ve been wondering what “until Thursday” means. Is that a hard cut off at midnight and if so is it pacific time? Or is there a chance that it will be later into Thursday potentially until the end of Thursday and midnight Friday?
---
I was always advocating for a re-tuning to compensate for all the knowledge we have and keep the challenge. But we're not getting it. 
---
Devs *should* do whatever they think is right.
---
unfortunately for you, and me, and many others is that we didnt get beta access- we got stress test access. it goes live in 8 hours time and only for 24 hours.
---
Yeah it can be a bit mind numbing, but I usually try to pull the next mob before the first dies, serpent sting, tank the new mob with my pet, and then finish the first one off. Kinda chain kill, with no breaks. I found some fun in trying to maximize my grind speed :) 
---
Oh, get an autoshot Addon timer as well. It really makes it easier to kite and not clip autoattacks, and it really improves your kill speed 1-10, since you will get in 2-3 more autoshots before mobs reach melee range. Binding A D to strafing instead of QE also makes your life easier :) and np!
---
His happiness?
---
I can't wait for the 1st gnome Hogger raid of classic just getting to him will be a feat of strength at level 5.
---
I know that , asked cause you stated that the server will be offline for a few hours ....
---
Ignore the fuckbrain troll - your experience shows you have a worthwhile point of view.
---
Great to hear, thanks for the link!
---
It did! It's a dungeon in TBC caverns of time.
---
They're offline for everyone right now, test doesn't start until 4 PDT.
---
fresh account I bought bfa 4 days ago....I got into the stress test.
---
If you start neglecting your spouse over a hobby damn right he/she should leave you. Don't care if its videogames or extreme knitting.    
---
A hobby is good, being passionate is good. Doing nothing else to the point of neglecting everything else is NOT good.
---
I think by 1.12 they had greater blessings that would do every class with whatever greater blessing you used no? I wasn’t a pally but I think that’s how it worked by this patch.
---
God if you were on the original WoW forums and saw his behaviour you'd have no difficulty. He was fucking raving lunatic.
---
But clearly he got a lot of therapy or something, because there is only a vague hint of that now.
---
You are correct about the 3 hour difference and the timer is correct.  However, are you sure you don't live in EDT currently?
---
Yeah is this a bugg? Pretty cool if it isn’t
---
I say this every time there's a blizzard classic post or blog...
---
Spotted the "A" team.
---
So that means they actually use the same base code for pathing I guess? Because I learned long ago that spastic movements could fuck up mob pathing to reduce getting hit when doing those low level runs through high level zones. 
---
I originally learned it in Asheron's Call. Because there, strafing while running forward did not alter your actual direction, it literally added sideways movement to your forward movement. That basically made it a speed increase which let you outrun mobs. 
---
So I tried the same thing in WoW, and while it doesn't increase your speed, for some reason strafing randomly would cause mobs to pick a slightly off direction every once in a while instead of straight lining to you, essentially slowing them.
---
Do you need a sub for the stress test or is that just required for the beta?
---
I've been running a 4am-11am sleep cycle since the beta started, watching the streamers far too long into the night. So this isn't gonna be too hard on me. Then on the other hand, i do have an exam on friday.. \*cries in \[Dwarvish\]\*
---
Onyxia Deep Breath mechanic confirmed - RNG based.
---
Good find - thanks for posting this.
---
Meters will vary from guild to guild. Maybe yours just had very good druids or very bad shamans, or maybe an absurd amount of druid gear dropped so they were overgeared. Also, druids did end up being good enough healers in the second half of vanilla. The problem is mostly in the first half where the output is simply low.
---
As for PvP healers, druids just lack the two core tools: a proper flash heal type spell and a dispel magic. HoTs are really awful in PvP, Regrowth costs a million mana, and you offer almost no direct support besides rooting people. You don't increase anyone's damage or protect against CC, you just move around and cast bad heals.
---
Back in the day, people were pretty bad at the game and things like engineering weren't so widely used. Under those circumstances, druids can be a bit better because its mobility is particularly effective against bad players who don't even use grenades or any other anti-kiting moves. It was a lot easier for a druid to compensate for the lack of better PvP abilities by being hard to reach, but these days it has become a lot more technical. A druid isn't going to run rings around a PvP fight while putting out good healing at the same time. People simply know how to counter that.
---
Druid seemed better back when everything was hard and Rebirth/Innervate seemed hugely important, but over the years as players got better and every raid fight was analyzed down to the smallest detail, people just started to use classes that performed better. I certainly have no recollection of druids putting out good healing the first half of vanilla, but I remember that they became better on the meters in AQ40 because there was more AoE so you could get more out of blanketing the raid with Rejuv. I also remember people arguing that this was "bad healing" since it wasn't what really made a difference, those ticks might amount to a lot on the meters but didn't actually save lives.
---
I also remember druids being very good raid healers, only lagging behind in dungeons heavily because of no ress like you say.
---
If you got beta and stress test that means ur in for only stress test or for both?
---
On Preach's stream earlier, he was moving items about in his bags while corpse running.
---
You couldn't do that as a ghost in vanilla, or TBC.
---
keyword: were
---
&gt; Its ok to do that, using pserver data as proof isn't.
---
Nobody was saying private servers were right or using pservers as objective data.
---
People brought up vanilla WoW videos uploaded over a decade ago as "evidence" of this. It has nothing to do with being pserver specific.
---
Ud rogue bc she got told probably. Regardless, as Alliance i condemn any undead, especially rogues
---
This is how they should do it.
---
Fucking hell, why don't you just nail yourself to a cross?
---
There are special weapons with Feral Attack Power on them. With those weapons you sort of scale. **However**, there are only 4 of those weapons in the entire game:
---
* Mace from world boss dragons (probably virtually unobtainable)
---
* Mace from AQ20 quest (doable)
---
* Mace from Naxx
---
* Atiesh (legendary staff)
---
Problem is, those weapons aren't in the first few phases. Your damage will suck until AQ is on farm, i.e. Stage 5...
---
The level of the MOB affects how much armor you need to mitigate damage, but the level of the one taking the hits does not. All being a higher level SHOULD do is give him access to much higher armor values than someone at the same level of the mobs should have.
---
What other vanilla examples of stuff like this do you have? I feel like leveling in this kind of way was not at all more common back then. It took people longer to hit max but it wasn’t because people were content locking themselves.
---
Human Fury Warrior for PvE (Dwarf or Gnome OK for PVP)  
---
Human Rogue for PvE or PvP (Dwarf/Gnome/Night Elf acceptable for PVP)
---
Human is important because of the bonus weapon skill in PVE (It also helps a bit with PVP) but if you are going to have any focus on PVP, I would consider the other races, particularly if you are playing a rogue. Dwarf stoneskin is an absolute godsend.
---
You save up some stacks and hit someone with 5. Make sure to have seal of righteousness. And congrats you just hit someone 10 times in 1 second
---
Yes, but they were then added into Frozen Throne as actual characters after community response.
---
They were Canon way before WoW.
---
Pally Power was the add-on. It allowed for paladins to mark which blessing they were buffing for each class. And you could see what the other pallies were buffing. I hope it's recreated.
---
I'm using questie on a pserver rn.  Honestly, I hope blizzard breaks it for classic.  It sucks a lot of the authenticity out of the experience.  I know there's still going to be websites and coordinates, but we had those in vanilla.  Questie makes the whole thing feel like retail, I've found quests I never knew about and shouldn't have found because I didn't explore.
---
Probably not a popular opinion, but it's mine.
---
He was completely unprofessional for a couple of years, maybe three after WoW released. He actively started and pursued nasty flame wars on the forums and was perhaps the worst trollon the official WoW forums during that time, as Tigole.
---
The one day Tigole stopped posting. 
---
Kaplan kept working at Blizzard so we can only presume he either got disciplined by someone or had an intervention, or otherwise saw the light. He came back later with a different tag and different behaviour, but clearly something happened. Possibly just being told to stop flaming the players or he'd get fired.
---
Or human rogue
---
As warrior more often then not, you will have to go tanking. Or prefer a Def Warrior.
---
Normally you would also prefer in a smaller group to avoid having the same class more than needed, and some tanks might actually refuse to play with a fury warrior to avoid rolling on items.
---
That’s just like your opinion, man. 
---
They’re a bad addition to the game and MoP was a mistake.
---
Damn, this started out well and now I'll go down with the sinking ship.
---
OMG I've been thinking about looking that show up again. I'm not the only one it seems
---
I LOVED wildstar because it was challenging and I personally thought the world was well put together. Leveling on the moon was such a fun experience. 
---
I think that game died from infighting and management more than anything and that there really wasn’t much for casuals to do besides build houses. Even the dungeons were very, very difficult for some people.
---
 Havent seen a single guy that claims privates servers are correct. People should focus on whats correct in upcoming release and not being overly in blizz's ass nor againts it with stupid statements like privates are perfect.
---
These are some life goals right here man. As a husband and father myself. I hope one day i get to experience the joy of gaming with either my son or daughter. I have a bit to wait as they are only 1 and 3 but i really do hope they have an interest in it.
---
Very quickly.
---
There's data values (easily validated) and code.
---
I imagine they're confident in data values, and probably fairly confident in code, but might have missed some edge cases.  So they check.  If they find a discrepancy when comparing outputs, go digging through code to figure out how the input values didn't result in the same output.
---
same, i was so excited at first
---
Sure there is, more portals
---
I would say the neutral panda hero was more of an Easter egg/reference than real cannon. But that’s just my interpretation of the text in game and not any meta-text/developer statements since I didn’t read any at the time.

Who cares about stress testing, its like 2 AM in europe when it goes live so not that many players.
---
You can spot heal with HoT spells on a druid. The healing touch thing is usually because only one druid is putting out HoT's, since they don't stack. TBH even if you are the healing touch guy there's still plenty of other buttons to press as far as cooldowns go.
---
Shaman is fun and windfury is hilarious.
---
Both fairly easy to level classes. I would say druid is a bit easier to level and slightly more rewarding in the endgame because druids are a fairly low pop class.
---
Never bought gold from them, is there any safe way to do it where you can pretty much guarantee not receiving a ban?
---
Yeah the stress test download didn't even give me enough time to get that nervous excited-and-have-to-poop feeling.
---
Good I hope the RP-PVP community atleast gets 1-2 servers Per Region
---
The issue was non-boss elites
---
Lol to anyone who doesn't remember duels before 60 were HORRIBLY imbalanced in Vanilla. 
---
Shaman could shit on any caster like +15 levels by the time they were 30. Nothing they could do vs a ranged interrupt and grounding totem, among other things.
---
afaik, stress test only
---
At the highest level private server meta just pushed druids out. When every kill is a speedkill there are no mana problems, targets get topped off instantly and if you could you would bring a shaman for every group for the totems. Then you need few priests for the magic dispels to cover all debuffs and now druids no longer fit into raid or the the meta. Of course it's not black and white, druids are not that far behind/useless and you can clear the content with a balanced team of healers easily. 
---
In PvP it's bit more harsh for druids, because players have learned the power of offensive dispels and you just can't hard cast Healing Touch in PvP, and you lack the offensive power of a shaman or a priest. But in both, PvP and PvE, druids are fine until you are at the highest level of play, then the class gets pushed out by the meta.
---
You should’ve put “don’t downvote” in this comment then
---
Kinda lame the stress test is so late for EU
---
the only way LC can be bad is if you have officers who make poor decisions. LC in the right hands is what's best for the guild. I've been in guilds that used both systems. while there were other factors, the guild that used DKP broke up at Vaelstrasz and the guild that used LC got US firsts in Sunwell
---
he only asked for the disadvantages compared to human vs night elf, upsides are the night elf looks cool I guess
---
sorry to break your boner against private servers, but the beta is here for people to test and inquire about stuff like this, not to assume blizzard has it right because then what would be the point of the beta?
---
its like you are waiting for anything to stick it to private server people, people without whom we would not even be getting classic. 
---
This hate is childish and speaks to ur maturity....
---
and to void your point.... on horde side when damage reported as incorrect, turns out stoneskin totem buff was persisting even after dispawning it.
---
Damage number can be wrong for many reasons... wrong formulas, buggy buffs, hidden effects. not necessarily the number input in the database being flat out wrong.
---
wondering ab this too
---
Yea good luck getting any of those weapons
---
Personally I would say go rogue or enh shaman if you like feral druid, it's much better for pvp in my opinion
---
Careful about spoilers though. I don't think he includes spoiler alerts to the videos about old WoW. 
---
If you don't know the story behind Defias Brotherhood, I envy you so much. It's so epic to start with "they're gang of thugs terrorising the vineyard" and then slowly discover the whole picture.
---
There're thousands of other lore pieces ofc. I highly recommend to play Warcrafts indeed. WC 1 might be a bit of an overkill but if you're a real geek and wouldn't mind not-too-intensive lore...
---
Out of your choices I'm going to say mage. Seems like that's the class you want to play and the only thing stopping you is the popularity of it. Well, lemme tell ya, it's popular for a reason!
---
I'm personally rolling warlock for that reason. (Also to be a god when tier 2/2.5 rolls around)
---
Since launch happens during the week leading into a holiday weekend in the states, I'm going to take it easy the first two days before taking off Thursday/Friday to benefit from the long weekend.
---
Should be fine by then. Ideally you want to be free of starting zones before the weekend, when the second 'wave' of people start jumping in.
---
You are incredibly efficient at drawing on Snapchat!
---
138 780 minutes.
---
This video again...Nobody cares
---
You are a legend I had no idea this was possible!
---
What do you use to draw these?
---
I would give her a fair heads up about warrior leveling, you know, not very enjoyable for the first 40 or so levels.
---
What does that even mean?
---
most likely stress.
---
Lol oh okay :). Thought you were giving it am F and not saying why Haha
---
there are two servers, stress test server and beta server. the stress test server is available to anyone who got into the stress test, is capped at level 5, and is only going to be up till Thursday the 23rd. while the beta server will be the 30 cap thing everyone is familiar with and is limited to those who got a beta invite.
---
Zach should really play an orc shaman
---
yes
---
why you think I paid $ ?
---
Priests are by far the worst. Max rank fort is \~half of your maximum mana. Most priests will buff fort AND spirit.
---
Druids are 2nd worst just because of number of druids in raid. Usually 1 or 2. If you alone, then its about same as a priest. 2 its easier.
---
By far the simplest is paladin. You press pallypower 8 times, barely loose any mana and can do that before, after, mid pull.
---
Usually the horde have lots of locks, and the alliance has few. But who knows thats just past trends.
---
You know that? Lol ok then, pack it up -  testing over. This is getting ridiculous, let Blizzard do their job without giving the community shot for suggesting what to test for. 
---
Obviously it doesn’t help that they choose a boss whom fucking nobody has any problem with damage wise.
---
I upvoted you. Thought I’d be a rebel today.
---
Active is active. I am inactive
---
Microsoft paint
---
Good fps yes ofcourse, but with the current engine the fps doesn't drop that much with the old assets.
---
You definatelly have something in your system acting weird, if you don't see a fps increase due to multi-threading - it is a substantial fps gain in every test published so far --- simply it enabling multi-threading has to give a boost to the fps on anything other than single-core cpu. I have tested it myself on 2, 4 and 8 core cpu systems and it's a noticeable improvements with either of those, in the crowded areas.
---
My face right now. I wanna cry
---
&gt;  If Blizzard indeed want testers to report everything differing from 1.12 as a bug then you're absolutely right and I'm in the wrong 
---
Yeah, blizzard wants us to "report **everything** differing from 1.12", so that's why i tell it to previous guy quote.
---
&gt; AddOns can easily replicate that anyway, what's the point of taking that out? 
---
snusketeer, thank you for your feedback, you saw something going wrong, you politely answered and gained some examples. Nice to meet people who can handle correct conversation.
---
Still active sub then i guess. Problem is the tokens got way too expensive in EU
---
Indeed
---
Level with herbalism and skinning. Save all your materials. Get 60 and drop skinning, use your materials to level it as needed. Get any BiS you need from LW, drop LW and switch to alchemy. Alchemy is the obvious choice because it will continually make you money as long as there's an active population.
---
The worst part is he is doing this in beta. It will be wiped at some point :(
---
 That’s just like your trash opinion, man.
---
Oh god, I hope class leaders make a come back.
---
I think it's very unfortunate that it seems a lot of the people here who come "because the community in retail is so antisocial and bad" are *precisely* the reason it is that bad and antisocial...
---
The purpose was to use the time with the Classic client for building the UI for the actual release of the game.
---
 /join world
---
105 days is more than 5 days irl after launch?
---
you need to farm soulshards.
---
Every game doesnt need to be fortnite.
---
Warrior with mana? Have you even played WoW
---
I also mentioned it’s mostly true for dps warriors. Most bis items for fury/arms is actually leather and mail pieces. For tanking, yes, plate is far superior that most every other armor type.
---
Play on a RP server - that will do it.
---
But what are you gonna do when max level is 5?
---
jeez the hate boners. all these people orgasming just from sticking it to pservers people.... i really do not get why the hate.
---
this is a beta, if you do no question oddities then what is the point?
---
We do know that.the question is though to people that got access today some of them write onto the launcher quote beta AND stress test .
---
Does that mean i got access to both? Asking due to the fact that when i opened the game there was only the stress test server.If it would be only for the stress test it should write stress test classic NOT beta AND stress test classic
---
Goblin start zone
---
Macros seem to work like BFA syntax.
---
There is no focus macros since focus isn't in the game.
---
LUA functions like UnitCastingInfo will not work since in vanilla you could not determine what spell an entity was casting with LUA.
---
It takes 15m
---
I'd definitely agree with this.  
---
I was a part of a guild as a "second stringer" brought into raids when they needed fillers. We were raiding Serpentshrine and I was getting no gear out of the raids. Even when I pointed out to people "hey, that isn't an upgrade for you" I was ignored. I was forced to do heroics, find crafters, etc... do get my gear. I was topping their dps charts and they STILL weren't giving me gear.  
---
Gearing was all over the place in TBC. In some ways that made it wonderful for those struggling to fill certain slots with better gear. In other ways it made it even more grindy and time consuming wanting that BiS piece to drop off a specific boss, whether it be in GL or hMT.
---
I have the same second legion ptr, I guess that is the test realm
---
I think there will be more than vanilla but I doubt they will be over populated. 
---
At the end  of the day they’re still worst than warrior/rogue/mage. 
---
Sure in naxx they can outperform a mage, but when you under perform for 2 years before that you’re still worse lol.
---
I'm gonna be working out How much exactly i'll need for cooking/firstaid/fishing/mining/herbalism and the fastest route to grab each one to be as fast as possible.
---
can we please be done with this nonsense
---
Hello.. I do appreciate the thoughts, but yeah.. no dude, your method of communication is obnoxious and condescending, not clever or interesting. This is not some academic board at a uni, so do come back if you'd like to drop the act.
---
i can confirm this is not a good idea, i had the same idea (tryed on a 1300€ notebook from work - pretty bad graphic card ) and i can tell you dont waste your money on a bad Notebook
---
Tuco still modding over there? I used to literally go to his house and watch him raid on EQ in his basement. One of my best friends married his sister.
---
Which part of these? That people were dropping to sub 5 fps or even slideshow-like, that was a fact for the majority of the players - whoever played in vanilla knew that unless you had a very potent pc, you and your guildies would barely be able to play in AV. In my vanilla guild we only had 'a lucky dude' who was able to actually play at decent fps in AV and MC.
---
Its not a prank, this is a legit test and blizzard is asking for our help so WE can get a smoother launch.
---
Aah I see. And last question, what race do you recommend for rogue? Undead for pvp or orc?
---
go through the nostalrius forums or other pserver stuff and there are a lot of items that frequently get undersold. There's stuff like items you can buy from a vendor and sell on AH to save people time, had 75gold on level 21 which is obviously a lot.
---
Until I read it on this subreddit I've never ever heard anyone refer to deadmines by anything else than DM. DireMaul was always with wing added.
---
Yeah true. But they are just a little bit behind. In pvp they beat rogues and mages
---
That's exactly what I will be doing - I currently play on Moonglade/Steamwheedle/Sha'tar cluster and will be looking for a similar sort of community. The last thing I want will be hordes of kids chasing some fotm streamer.
---
That green Mr T/MC Hammer
---
I can get behind this.  
---
Though I will say, I remember people using engineering ALL the time in Vanilla.  Bombs and Rocket helm were very prevalent.  
---
Further I don't know if I agree that people were "pretty bad at the game".. I mean, I guess I can agree with it, as a whole, because it had a higher population of people that were maybe not great, and the MMO genre was hitting its mass market appeal.  
---
But I feel at the top level, these players were not bad players by any stretch.  I feel like the top 0.1% of skilled players in the early 2000's were likely capable of the same feats as the top 0.1% in 2019, it's just they focused their energy on different games.  
---
Maybe this becomes a Jordan vs LeBron scenario though... and I do agree that 13 years of micro-tuning has likely created some level of discrepancy.
---
When our server went down during our regular BWL raid time, we made a gnome only guild on another server, and ran from Dun Morough to SW.  One of my favorite raid nights, other than our first Ony kill.
---
We did a hogger raid when we got there, and then ran to Orgrimmar through STV/Booty Bay.
---
Not so sure bliz would remake the expansions, maybe tbc but idk, hard to sell people something they’ve already bought. 
---
I was kinda thinking it might be cool to just go a completely different route with classic. Like instead of tbc we get something else entirely but keep the gameplay style. That way blizz could at least justify charging for it cause it’s somethig completely new
---
Next solo it :P Looks possible, especially if your pet is alive and you start at full mana.
---
I haven't seen the video but even if I wanted to play on a non streamer server - where would I find one? Streaming nowadays is very popular and there's bound to be one famous/semi famous guy on a server. Regardless I don't think they will have any impact on my gameplay and fun I have in the game.
---
Maybe you'll never **need** CC with the right group in 5 mans ... but if you ever have to run one with an underleveled healer, a poorly geared tank, odd specs, or intermittantly afk people, then CC will really start to shine.
---
Tried to teach him not to keyboard turn, and not to click his abilities, but he’s old and it’s hard for him
---
https://willitclassic.com/ - for the lazy
---
credits to  [Karmond](https://www.twitch.tv/karmond) for actually doing it, I just told him where to go XD
---
Wow, you really are ignorant - Which laws have been broken? Because the only thing being broken is ToS.
---
I got it too, EU.
---
you are refering to playing on a notebook or remote streaming?
---
launch the client and see which servers are available. Most of us only have stress server available
---
Additional cons:
---
- Soul shards
---
- You will end up as a summon bitch if you raid with slackers
---
- Boring as fuck in raids
---
- WoTF if you are an ally
---
- Mages are better in almost everything except being an edgelord
---
Lock is going to be my 2nd char btw.
---
Sure, but their was no point in you being disrespectful.
---
I mean, there were addons back then that quite literally played the game for you, at least when it came to healing, dispelling, etc.
---
Things like that are actually more restrictive now.
---
It says that because it's the same client for both beta and stress test players
---
Asmon ran the first 2 SM too
---
No. At this point you're just unwilling to shift from your opinion because you'd have to shift your position. You've dug in, and you're not changing your mind - Whatever, mate. You choose to be ignorant, good on you.
---
You can just say no to summons
---
Eh we're in a post "you think you do, but you don't" era -- if post naxx is going to deliver more profit per dev hour than putting those devs somewhere else,  well get post-nax content
---
World record on Blizz servers is Joana at 4 days and 20 hours. That's a total of 116 hours.
---
But you need an optimized route for that + be able to perform well without enough sleep.
---
So I guess if you manage to put 120h you will either be 60 or very close to it.
---
Resto shamans are a very big want in raids being the only class with an AoE heal
---
“...the world, of Warcraft.”   /sniff
---
Take a look at the comments, Deadmines was being called VC before Dire Maul was released.
---
https://web.archive.org/web/20050518092536/http://www.thottbot.com:80/?i=5664
---
As a side note, level 59 twinks were HUGE dick energy in BC
---
Shard farming sucks, but just have a shard bag and whenever you kill a mob just drain soul. Make it a habbit so you don't even realize you are farming them.
---
What kind of epics are you getting in gnomer??
---
Elemental auto attacks were fairly notorious for being heavy because armor was worthless. BRD fire elemental trash would hit 250-300 a swing unless you had fire resist.
---
Wait what guild was this? Just out of curiosity as I bumped into this post, I also played on Burning Legion - EU until the move to Magtheridon that is; alliance though but I might have met many of these players in pvp.
---
Sadly I dont have any of my vanilla screenshots anymore, only from TBC and beyond :\\
---
They nerfed a lot of this stuff before 1.12
---
He's a good dude. A lot of salty / jealous players like to trash talk him but at least he has a pleasant personality.
---
With the increase in debuff slots for bosses, priests with Shadow Weaving may be a lot more common in raids - that's a 15% increase to walock's shadow damage which may help them before Naxx.
---
Yeaah! Ai toddly undahstend yuu!
---
Definitely would not bet on corruption. Maybe one lock in the whole raid.
---
And here I am thinking that “No changes” is self-explanatory.
---
Even the top players back then just weren't as experienced as they are now. It's kind of self-explanatory: back then, noone had more experience with the content than however long it had been out, which could be as recently as the latest patch. On private servers, thousands of players have been playing vanilla for years and years, and while doubts can be raised about the accuracy of some content on pservers, the actual class mechanics have generally been correct. Those aren't guesswork, after all.
---
&gt; The worst case scenario right now is that Blizzard's data is correct, and the dungeons really are as stupid-easy as they currently are in the beta.
---
The dungeons *are* stupidly easy. Early bosses had almost no mechanics beyond a heroic strike or summoning adds. They were hard because we were young, new, and we didn't have a clue what we were doing. We didn't know how to spec, how to maximize DPS and APM, we had no access to comprehensive online guides.
---
I think it's definitely solo-able, but we both needed the item so it made sense to do it together. With the method I used I am kind of forced to sacrifice my pet in order to kite it out to a safer area and avoid getting dazed, but the pet missing isn't really an issue.
---
It's all about perspective. If you could buff people in real life... would that ever get old?????
---
Yeah this has been here for a long time, shaman can do the same thing too with far sight.
---
Open game, if you only see 1 realm on realmlist, its stress test troll, if you see 3 realms you are very lucky and got in.
---
People called it VC on my server when I played vanilla.
---
Wow was lambasted as a casual mmo when it came out, it takes a lot time to grind but it was never difficult.
---
Do we even need evidence? If the community's consensus is that mobs need to hit harder then so be it. Just ask for Blizzard make that happen. Period.
---
Excesse - horde. 
---
What was your guild?
---
That's a F****** -50 dkp minus!!
---
i hope being selected for the stress test means that we'll be on the short list for the next round of proper beta invites T\_T
---
I kind of do the same when i'm not at home and only have my work laptop in the evenings.
---
I enabled RDP on my own gaming laptop and playing retail wow through it.
---
The only downside i have is holding a mouse button to look around. (makes the camera go everywhere)  
---
I enabled the auto camera ajust in wow to kind of solve this.
---
Its not ideal but the fps and inputlag is totally fine and the game is playable. (maby not for raiding but questing and some battlegrounds are fine.)
---
Theres also game streaming software so you don't have these problems but unfortunately i can't install anything in my work laptop so i don't use that :) .
---
Haven't tested gaming, but the best performing remote desktop software in my experience is NoMachine.
---
OH THE MEMORIES AHHHHHH
---
Yeah, since example the damage numbers were done in bulk as database re-format, if you check few values, you are fairly confident that everything is fine after that.
---
Its the other layers of damage that they have to worry about, like armor reduction, buffs etc that those are applied correctly in the calculations. That cannot be transferred, that had to be coded again.
---
Not counting the TBC dungeon, it kinda did. 
---
Just kinda blew up and became the Blasted Lands.
---
They aren't going to make expansions for classic and retail. It's just not happening.
---
You sure that you're not just waning very often and it's not another issue? Good luck out there!
---
It's definitely doable. Much easier if you will be on your own network. I used to do the exact same thing with Elder Scrolls Online and Steam streaming. I would give it a try before making any big purchases since you have nothing to lose.
---
I know that I need to play an Undead. However, I can't decide between Priest and a Rogue. 
---
I absolutely love the rogue aesthetics and fantasy. Leather armor, daggers, spell icons look great (Weird reason, I know).
---
The only downside is that rogues are dime-a-dozen, everything will be harder; pugs, gearing, competition, etc. - Also probably a harder and spergier class to play in PvP.
---
Priests on the other hand are also interesting, fantasy is interesting, aesthetics with shadow are amazing but shadow is a meme spec; outside of PvP. 
---
Mind Control is fun but you are absolutely stuck with a dress and you are healing most of the time, wich I don't mind that much, but still..
---
My brain is telling me Priest for general QoL: with finding PuGs, gear, guild and general usefulness, but my heart is telling me, fuck all that and play a Rogue.
---
&gt; apologise for another stupid thread
---
Apology no accepted.
---
Be glad you got into somthing my dude. Id kill just to play level 5s.
---
You realize mob damage was HEAVILY reduced before around level 10 right? At leas, 6 and below mobs hit for 1-2 damage. 
---
I used to level locks by just throwing corruption on anything in sight in newbie zones and never die. Just kill as much as humanly possible at the same time. In Vanilla.
---
Yep, can confirm. Got an invite for stress test only ;v
---
a) Play what you want.
---
b) Temper your expectations accordingly. You likely won't be invited to tank for a competitive raiding guild. You may well have to argue your case for a DPS slot in that type of guild. If you know your class well then a 'casual' raiding guild (is that an oxymoron?) will be glad to have you.
---
c) As far as leveling in the human area the two disadvantages will be the time you 'waste' getting there at a low level and you'll likely have to get back to Teldrassill at level 40 to purchase your mount. Unless you really work at human rep.
---
I would recommend getting to at least level 5, if not 10, before setting out on the haul to Stormwind.
---
Warlock in vanilla wasn't played much, i'm having so much trouble deciding what i want to level. It's between a warrior, mage or warlock.   Mage has it the easiest out of the 3 classes though. Warlock has so many fun spells though Infernal being at the very top.
---
Hey guys check out my stream on pornhub, just search gayboyweiner
---
We all know there are gonna be people with level 5 twinks, complete with low-level enchants, BiS quest/crafted/drop/vendor gear and the likes, and there will be a dueling tourney in goldshire.
---
I say release Kara as a 60.
---
It definitely was important to me. My entire play style would change if I saw corpses of players OR mobs.
---
There is a lot more to the game than raiding. You're going to spend ~150 hours playing alone before you get to 60. With that said, druids are more mobile. Shamans have no instant heals(other than NS talent) or hots(healing stream totem excluded) meaning that they have to stand still to do any meaningful healing. Druids can reposition while tossing hots. Druids are not just spamming healing touch unless the hots are already up. Shaman spam totems, stay in the totem range, and then spam chain heal.
---
Ya basically the same with me but mine expired just 3 and a half years ago.
---
Ah of course I remember that guild, I think the guildleader was called Matija, a shaman. I played in Khadgars Rage for the longest time, Issh (rogue). Good to see some nostalgia inducing posts like this :D
---
The hype for classic is making want to play bfa less
---
I like where this is going
---
Both are great, although I'd probably go for the orc since rogues are already good against locks and priests. 25% stun resist racial is crazy considering how much engineering abuse goes on in classic PvP.
---
Is the countdown timer right on the time?
---
Ouch, that hurts me just reading it...
---
As far as gear goes, I guess. Bear tanks do just fine in dungeons, they just lack the gear to tank in raids. Alliance druids suffers less from that since BoM and BoK helps em, but horde with windfury just shatters past it once gear (AQ40) kicks in.
---
DW tanking is a thing as soon as the gear permits it, meaning hit cap, defense cap, decent armor stat without shield kicks in. Most "resistance" fights won't be DW tanked, though
---
To see the current state of addons that are coming to classic: https://willitclassic.com/
---
Pfui wont come to classic unfortunately: https://gitlab.com/shagu/pfQuest/issues/88#note_172703673
---
They should bump up the damage anyway to make it more challenging
---
As long as the barrens chat is accurate in the upcoming classic release im happy.
---
You can hit 60 in 5 weeks. You can be geard up in 1 and raiding fulltime after that
---
Humans are "unfinished" undead.
---
Okay, good to know I'm not the only one who thinks vanilla content on YouTube is extremely bloated.
---
VC simply does not make sense in anyway whether some people called it like that or not. It is nothing than a bad habbit. Call both of them DM for all I care or DME or DMW. VC is a nonsense term that makes no sense.
---
Number of warlocks will be VASTLY increased, just because ppl that are more hardcore will this time levelup multiple warlocks to L20 just to summon people around the map (for gathering world buffs, getting to instance/capital faster when HS is somewhere else).
---
 Ye beta is perfect, 0 bugs, ready to ship! close it and release the game.
---
Tauren has a very awkward pro/con situation in vanilla. Their hit boxes are so massive, that you can melee hit them from what appears to be 8+ yards away. Although at the same time, hunters (who can't attack within 8 yards of a target), have to be basically 16/20ish yards away from a Tauren to actually hit them. So as a Tauren you can make it really hard for hunters to keep enough distance to constantly hit you, but you will also have melee classes hitting you from quite a distance.
---
I would like the idea of you can opt to transfer a character to the BC server, but it’s permanent. Makes that decision more meaningful, but you aren’t forced into new expansion content unless you want it.
---
That makes sense even though they could have worded differently.
---
Understandable. I still remember, or I think I do, most quests from back in the day, but I am mainly using Questy to make sure I have done all the quests in a zone before moving on.
---
Since I am in no rush to 60 this time, I want to do every zone as 100% as possible and Questy can help me with that.
---
bruh moment
---
this is hilarious. this is not a competition you know that right?
---
the only one keeping score is you, playing alone....
---
this is not about who got it wrong or right, this is about reporting oddities to ensure the most authentic experience possible.
---
When someone name a pserver as a reference for something "possibly" being incorrect, it is because no one can fucking remember what a mob at level 20 was hitting you for 15 years ago.
---
and no that is not because "most pserver players never played vanilla"... that is the dumbest thing i ever heard.
---
pserver people are blizzard fans who lived warcraft and then world of warcraft. expect when the game started heading down a path they did not like, they were not blinded by fanboyism. and they quit the game. few in tbc, more in wotlk, most in cata and beyond.
---
Pservers were created because there was a potential for a part of blizzard community that was left untapped. those same pservers is what then showed to blizzard in 2015 with nost the potential that vanilla had and they realized that they can make really high profits.
---
without pservers we would not have wow classic...
---
Please stop the hate. Most people here did not enjoy modern wow because of how much the social aspect was destroyed and there was no sense of community anymore... by acting like this we are breeding a toxic hateful community that is seperated over trivial matters....
---
I wish you well.
---
Toxic?  He was right.  The toxic ones are the private server crowd that refuse to admit that most of the private server guess work, while good, was not correct.  I hate Asmongold but what he did here wasn’t toxic at all.
---
&gt;Can you imagine how poorly retail WoW would have handled this due to the game trying to shard people?
---
&gt;If Blizzard isn't learning anything from this Classic Beta in terms of improving Retail than they never will. Long live Classic. 
---
Blizzard did explain why there is a difference like this between classic and Retail, and it's not because of sharding. The explanation they provided was that most abilities are a lot more complex in BfA compared to Classic.
---
Someone should test this in BfA. Have 4 Raids try to meet up, have everyone turn off all their buffs, and not use any abilities, just walk around. 
---
If the blizzard explanation is correct, this should be as smooth as in classic.
---
It wouldn't be a 100% accurate test, but it would at least give an indication on whether the Blizz explanation is plausible or not.
---
In any case, Blizzard has acknowledged this difference and if I recall correctly said they wanted to look into this for Retail.
---
Let's try to be constructive. Sharding has not been good, but blaming bad performance on sharding is not constructive since we don't have anything to back it up with.
---
Go gathering professions. Herb and mining go a long way, and you don’t need to kill anything.
---
Back on the 1.12 private servers we used dkp. But we geared the important roles like tanks first. So when we geared through naxx. Tanks went before all the other classes on t3 tokens. But weapons and such were pure dkp. Thats how i got my MSA while still being 50/50 t2/t2,5. And everyone in the guild was cool with it
---
The client is the same for beta and stress test, so the name in the launcher has both. Your access to each server is based on what email you got. The email I got specifically said stress test, but the name in the launcher still has both.
---
"No changes" is itself a change.  WoW has always been a game that is constantly tweaked and updated.  In 2 years or so we're going to have to do something or the game will stagnate.  I'd rather go with a 1.14 classic than a 2.0 classic.
---
That is perfectly normal.
---
Fucking hell, people used to fear SM but it wasn't a hard instance at all. I leveled a priest first. I could actually tank some shit on my own for a time because so many groups would involve tanks not able to press buttons. I often would be the puller with SW:P since they didn't know how to pull. The challenge was not pulling the wrong thing at the wrong time and getting 10+ mobs. Pulling 3-4 though? The damage was pretty insignificant. Tanks would die because healers were REALLY bad at healing. Not because they were being hit hard. 
---
Also if it is SM graveyard, that is like a level 28 instance. Health pools then would often be like 500-600. Getting hit by 4 things for 50 every 2 seconds is INSANELY high damage back when it was often a lot to expect for a healer to cast 2 freaking heal spells.
---
Yall really do not remember what the average player was like back then, do you?
---
And you can then say goodbye to the raid spot.
---
What else would you call a guy who charges by himself into a raid of 40 people?
---
They don’t really beat rogues in PvP imo.
---
Yeah sure on the highest platform of skill in 1v1 matches, but realistically every fight won’t be a duel. Locks will die to rogues just as much as they kill them imo
---
Professions mostly
---
I want engineering for pvp though.
---
There are no pandas here, thankfully.
---
I think Mythic+ usually were a blast, especially doing it with friends.
---
Blizzard definitely still has alot of challenge in the endgame, it's the way they're treating the journey there that's problematic. The leveling experience shouldn't be a slog until the real game begins. Cataclysm's revamp of the questing zones was nice, but everything until endgame just feels like playing an empty singleplayer game which honestly isn't enjoyable.
---
Is there a PDF edition?
---
Make an alt or piggyback off mining, best advice I have for ya haha
---
They will. 40 people is too many for one raid leader to manage.
---
I will be in my own network. The PC connected via LAN and the Notebook connected via WLAN. So Steam Streaming is a software which is able to stream classic wow? Sorry for the noob question but i was out of the gaming community for years
---
Finding the perfect roll green +fire damage gear was definitely the worst part. Or trying to find a pendulum of doom.
---
I am also planning on this. Been shopping for a notebook, but waiting until late July or early August to hopefully get a better deal.
---
I'm gonna go for something beefy with a GTX 1060 or better though. I'm justifying it to myself by dual booting to Linux so it can pull double duty as a work laptop as my current work laptop is 7 years old.
---
The RDP thing might be borderline playable, but still unpleasant. What is your budget for a notebook?
---
You telling me you're not even touching the all important cooking skill?!
---
It was called VC on Arthas and Stormreaver for me at least.
---
It's like trimming a bonsai tree :D
---
I bet that continues to be the case as people hate playing locks into undead
---
I don't think drop rates require a representative sample, that would only apply for things like world drops.
---
You either farm nodes, or play in AH (buy low sell high), or get a alt hunter who can farm.
---
You get a pony instead of a Saber
---
My sub lapsed two days and I got stress test access yesterday. Inactive, but only for a day.
---
Seems to be required for them to consider you for either. guess I won't be testing any stress for now :(
---
Okay, so I'll bet you're busy reporting layering, loot trading, transparent water, transparent menus, bnet integration etc as bugs?
---
Not exactly as 1.12 =/= not working as intended. That's my entire point. If you want to report it anyway then go ahead, but it's pretty pointless to report conscious choices by Blizzard as bugs since they're not going to fix it and it's just going to clog up their bug reports. It would be better to save that for actual bugs, such as totem effects being permanent. That is, things that aren't working as intended and aren't things deliberately put in place by blizzard. 
---
But let's drop that now. I think we've made our points.
---
you want everything without giving something in return, it doesn't work like that
---
When I got the e-mail and it said "max level 5" I just had to laugh. I'll just stick to my pservers until I get a "real" beta invite
---
And you can wait 20 minutes for the slackers to come to the raid \^\^
---
....if you arent lying about your play history, you already know that 20-30 hours is the amount you need for the upper end content.
---
I'd have to log in and check the toon I was playing during the LOD trial - it was over a year ago.
---
Warriors are common.
---
Good warriors are rare.
---
Man i feel this hard,
---
Especially about the hardware. I was a BC baby first coming into the game Christmas of 2007 but at the time i was using a very basic dell desktop that was handed down to my family from my uncle. Was playing with windows 98 never going over 10 fps in the game. Leveled a warrior to 70 that way and then to 80 when wrath came out. All while never seeing over 20 fps.
---
I can't wait to experience the grind and the leveling with no lag. It is going to be crazy.
---
And i would say my biggest mistake in the early days was not appreciating the true feel of an MMO. That being i never talked to anyone except my friends. I never tried to party up with people i didn't know. Even if they were doing the same quests that i was.
---
This time around I can't wait to meet new people and enjoy a social game again. I am planning on playing a rogue and helping anyone i can while leveling. 
---
Also i do plan to throw in a little RP while talking to people which is something i have never done before.
---
And the last thing i'm excited for is a brand new economy. Everyone will be poor and professions will actually be useful. And leveling them will actaully feel rewarding once again. Seriously can't wait for classic.
---
thanks,
---
and.. 
---
noooooooooo
---
Everyone had a different experience back in Classic. Some people most likely said #nochanges because they thought their *experience* was what the game was actually like.
---
And now, it may be, that this isn't the case. Some people may still want no fundamental changes to the game and still support nochanges, but at the same time may feel the game is simply too easy and wouldn't mind to see the enemies buffed.
---
Easy enough to brush things off with a snarky comment, but at the end of it there's still a discussion to have here.
---
/r/madlads
---
No, you have access to only the Stress test. The stress test and beta client are the same so its the same download, servers will be different. Access to the stress test does NOT mean access to the Beta.
---
I also am just in the Stress Test :(. But its better than nothing! Glad i could help.
---
Locks are better at PvP
---
That sounds great. You are refering to standard Microsoft RDP?
---
Do you know why some healers are called "Heal sluts", OP? Do you *really* know? ;D
---
Seriously now: sell herbs, play the AH, etc.
---
Dirty secret is blizz doesnt really care - so if youre not too blatant about it youre probably good. It keeps you subscribing and the goldsellers subscribing.
---
They changed it on private servers to make fishing harder. People who claim otherwise only have selective memory
---
&gt; /use mana potion
---
&gt;  /cast Bear Form
---
Tips in particular.
---
yea that is why they wanted a beta and that is why there was a bug on horde with shaman totem retaining its effect after despawn and therefore affecting damage numbers.
---
FFS are you actually hating on people for actually testing the game. this is what blizz want people to do... take anger meds...
---
straight from the warcraft manual
---
Yes! I got so excited when I saw "Wow Classic" on my client. I was so pumped until I saw "Stress Test 5/22 6p - 8p"
---
Yes, standard microsoft rdp
---
Complete with your own class chat channel and in-jokes.
---
Be a total noob fick it. Don’t let a streamer ruin your first experience.
---
Hey I checked this morning and I've got the option now.
---
/r/technicallythetruth
---
I will, and this is also partly why I want to play holy pally with her so she can learn how to pull, generate threat and prioritize targets with me keeping her alive and providing a little light dps on the side.
---
I know that I will be a horde hunter. My question is, how much do the facials matter? Should I be going troll for pve? Would it be a waste to go Tauren if I wanted to?
---
Same got it pop on the launcher last night and still no email
---
Using a wand?
---
Lol let's go with that.
---
Thanks so much. That sucks about pfui. Do you know of any good alternatives? ElvUI or something? I really struggle with the default ui.
---
Mages are also boring in raids
---
That’s my thinking. I also wish blizzard had a way to look at the age of all active accounts and accounts dating back to vanilla that are active should have some priority. August is just too far away.
---
It does limit Blizz from releasing new content at 60, though, imo. Can you imagine the outrage if TBC servers opened up with a one-way ticket, and then Blizz adds new level 60 content. Especially if it went the route of OSRS with years of content additions. Then TBC becomes a trap for unwary new players who don't realize there is more content at 60 than at 70.
---
Some poor sap donated to Asmongold last night saying that he was so excited because he got a beta invite. Asmon responded, "Congrats, just make sure it's not just the Stress Test invite." A few minutes later the poor guy donated again and said that it was only the stress test. F's in the chat.
---
depending on how serious my friends are gonna be about classic i may remake our old guild but otherwise i'll just join up with other nice people on the server.
---
Hey did you have to do anything special to get invited? i'm subscribed to the beta and to wow but i didn't get anything yet
---
When you download the Beta &amp; Stress Test client it will tell you what you have access to. If you log in and the server says “Stress Test” then you only have access to that when it opens today. You will not be able to create a character until the test and you don’t have full beta access.
---
Creating new continents in classic should be shunned and downvoted to oblivion, how the fuck are people up voting you? New continents ruined wow.
---
maybe not where you live, but some of them definitely do.
---
doesnt change that it's a shit job and people gotta let them have their fun instead of this srsbsns bullshit.
---
damn you remember damage numbers from 2005? is ur brain stuck since then like that D key on ur keyboard ?
---
He should be a NE hunter or priest for them to go full bore breaking them.
---
My argument is that they're recreating classic for exactly what it is. Having incorrect values or making it easier or harder, whatever the case may be, isn't authentic..
---
DM is phase 2.
---
What?! Reason? Here?!? Begone!
---
it does in retail! Cmon down to the homogeneous lane!
---
You're putting faith in leaders and expecting them to know what's actually best for each player. That's fine when it's a 10 man, but at 40, it's honestly too much. People fall through the cracks, and people end up going through long stretches where they feel they should have gotten X piece, or that person who got Y was a bad pick, etc. No matter how hard the leaders try, you need to have a really tight knit group for LC to work with 40 people and not have drama, and you need extremely fair and knowledgeable people determining loot for each class and member.
---
And I'm not saying DKP is better, it has tons of issues, but those aren't the only 2 systems. But generally, having a system where the players have more agency lets them feel like they have more of a say over what gear they get or pass on; and that just ends up reducing drama.
---
It means just that: The game as it really was, not what people remember. And it's being proven now the game was not as hard as people claim to remember.
---
I'm with you man. People on Archimonde always called it VC
---
There are two things I'm dying to see (and will be participating in if they happen, since I'm on the stress test):
---
1) lvl 5 hogger raids.
---
2) A huge group of lvl 5s goes to the westfall coast, swims to grom'gol (thats the STV blimp to Durotar, right?) and everyone gets to Durotar and flags for pvp.  Bloodbath ensues.
---
Originally the game was planned to include only 5 levels, only last moment they added 55 extra levels and raids.
---
A current theory is, that all the procs, extra effects etc. all going off in a single location are just too much for the spaghetti code. If you think about it, it's pretty reasonable, although I am sure they can fix it.
---
Currently, in WoW it is like this: trinket procs, spec sepcific procs, azerite procs, weapon enchant procs, and of course spells go off. They also removed snapshotting with WoD, so now every second every spell's damage or healing gets recalculated instead of being static damage/healing like it was in pre-WoD times.
---
I mean, in a big fight a single person usually has multiple buffs active, procs and hots on them as well as eventual DoT effects or AoE abilties on the ground. Let's say that's on average 10 effects per second (eps) being calculated for a single person. That's 100 eps for 10 people, 1000 eps for 100. And all of that data has to be sent to the server and back to the client for every participant in such a battle, all while outside of those battles there are other people doing their things in range since most of the ingame world is seamless.
---
And I am at the lower end with 10 effects per second per person.
---
JBAITED
---
If blizzard adds content and makes classic thrive like Jagex did to their old school version of runescape, I’d hope to see the content patches to WoW look like this - following the original vision of the game.
---
Titan bar up top. Check.
---
Wow i am surprised that works. Sounds like auto camera is perfectly fine for grinding or farming herbs etc. 
---
What connection do you have between your gaming and your work notebook? Internet or are they both in the same LAN?
---
It's the stress test up to lvl 5 and like myself count yourself lucky Blizzard considered you worthy to be apart of Beta progress.
---
&gt; There wasn't even this PC culture we have now either, you could say literally anything and most people would laugh it off.
---
People have been whining about "political correctness" since at least the 90s.
---
Stratholme orb runs.
---
no they used the only available info to QUESTION the data so that blizzard can check if there is any error in the calculation or remaining buff reducing dmg numbers. (like the shaman totem bug)
---
\&gt;  the only one keeping score is you, playing alone....   
---
Says the most invested player of the game.  
---
\&gt;  When someone name a pserver as a reference for something "possibly"  being incorrect, it is because no one can fucking remember what a mob at  level 20 was hitting you for 15 years ago.   
---
That's why Blizzard have the 15 year old game running in their offices. Neat, huh?  
---
\&gt;  and no that is not because "most pserver players never played vanilla"... that is the dumbest thing i ever heard.  
---
Yeah, I haven't even heard anyone say it until you did just now. I guess that means that the dumbest thing you've ever heard is something you said yourself. Brilliant.  
---
\&gt;  without pservers we would not have wow classic...   
---
Absolutely, private servers are 100% responsible for Classic being a thing  
---
\&gt;  Please stop the hate. Most people here did not enjoy modern wow because  of how much the social aspect was destroyed and there was no sense of  community anymore... by acting like this we are breeding a toxic hateful  community that is seperated over trivial matters....   
---
I'm not hating on anything. I'm just stating the obvious fact that you can't use private servers for comparison because private servers are mostly incorrect in mostly every aspect of the game. Especially when Blizzard have an actual 1.12 client running and can compare stuff to. That's also why every single thread about if things are or aren't correct are compared to actual 1.x gameplay - NOT private servers.
---
YES ffs thats the dream man
---
Lol you think you’re gonna be able to make the run in two hours? Trying to get to 5 first will possibly take at least 30 mins haha
---
oh sorry, remore playing through a Notebook, playing on a good Notebook with mouse is nice
---
I'm going to keep requesting blizz to set aside a few stream free servers.  I think the demand is there for them.
---
JBETAdid
---
TFW hes still beating this mob with wrecked gear
---
&gt; Everyone had a different experience back in Classic.
---
No.  No they did not.  This isn’t some “I experienced things differently” political sidestep this is reality.  The numbers of Classic were what they were.  Nobody experienced it differently because everyone had the same client and the same numbers.  The reality is 1.12 was the tail end of Vanilla and people just have to understand that most of us levelled well before 1.12 so memories aren’t always going to align with the reality of 1.12 and its tuning.  
---
&gt; Some people may still want no fundamental changes to the game and still support nochanges, but at the same time may feel the game is simply too easy and wouldn't mind to see the enemies buffed.
---
WoW Classic is WoW as it was.  That means exactly, or as close to it, as it was.  There’s no discussion to be had here because that’s what the community has been asking for in the past decade.  We want Vanilla WoW back not some changed fantasy land, there’s still private servers for that.
---
&gt;You know that? Lol ok then, pack it up - testing over. This is getting ridiculous, let Blizzard do their job without giving the community shit for suggesting what to test for.
---
You know what? There's a lot of stuff in the game besides mob damage. All the various non-database related mechanics are where testing is needed the most, and that's where the overwhelming majority of bugs so far has been too.
---
&gt; Obviously it doesn’t help that they choose a boss whom fucking nobody has any problem with damage wise.
---
That boss was literally the first example the OP of the thread they were replying to brought up. Put the goalposts down, buddy.
---
Hunter alt then farm tribute,rogue alt farm BRD pickpocket etc... money won't be a problem then.
---
Else it'll be from professions...
---
I want to be feared in battlegrounds. Are there any classes that noticeably shine over others? I like warrior, melting people with enhance shaman, and played a hunter 15 years ago when classic came out.
---
Any suggestions?
---
Added to my bookmarks thanks man!
---
good info, but i guess they counted you as subbed or smth.
---
The stress test is up for 24 hours I believe
---
This, I like this
---
&gt; Are there any other problems leveling a race in the wrong starting area?
---
The only other one that occurred to me, and it is fairly minor, is that you'll likely have to return to your own races area in order to purchase your mount at 40.
---
IIRC you can purchase other races mounts when you have Exalted rep with them but it's unlikely, unless you really push it, that you'll have Exalted by level 40.
---
Just saw ElvUI is planned, so that might do.
---
That is pretty cool. I guess I never thought about using the skill this way. I always assumed I can only  use it one time and cant go further than the initial cast.
---
If you played Paladin, you know first hand there are always defectors to the group buff. They can right click it off and you can individually buff them with what they want. You end up spending a lot of time on buffs regardless of the group buffing.
---
The main problem with paladins tanking in vanilla was crushing blows. Druids had a large enough HP pool to *kinda* get away with it, but prot pallies were screwed.
---
Other cons:
---
.) Rog/warrior are the hardest matchups, the two most overpopulated classes
---
.) Only good in wpvp with the right demon out, you can get suprise attacked easily
---
.) First target for melees to stick on in BGs because of no escape ability
---
.) Soul shards not only for raids but for duel/BG sessions
---
.) Several hotkeys which maybe annoying for less experienced players
---
What remote software did you use and what connection did you have?
---
Weren’t stun-lock rogues basically unstoppable in PvP?
---
I kind of wanted you to keep going.
---
Sounds good, will try
---
I just cannot understand how you make it your mission to defend a company for doing its job towards its customers.
---
maaaaan...
---
stay salty kid
---
Its almost as if the people who want changes don’t actually want to play vanilla WoW.
---
If u care about rolling on Items u shouldn't take any plate and mail in grp as dps
---
Not sure if I want to play rogue, warrior, warlock or hunter.
---
My main since vanilla has been a hunter and I’ve always loved playing him. I think this time id like to try something else though. I enjoy dps but I’ve also main tanked in bfa for raids and mythic plus so prot warrior sounds great too. 
---
Warlocks have always fascinated me and I love their gear looks endgame, same with rouge. 
---
Currently playing as a rogue on beta to practice my speed leveling, so I’m leaning toward that.
---
Looks a lot like middle earth, except the black(rock) gate is too far north.
---
The server is up for 24 hours.  The 2 hour part is their "stress test", but they are leaving it live so we can play around.
---
2006 account. got nothing.
---
I might give it a go if there is a massive lvl 5 world pvp fight somewhere. If nothing else that would be fun to watch until the servers break.
---
I mean your definition of retarded is gonna be key here.
---
Sodapoppin and venruki have been a joy to watch, but I don’t know what you’re into
---
Haha, alright. Buying gold would’ve been unthinkable to me back in the day, but in our era of micro transactions, and, er, knowing how much cash an hour of time is actually worth, I’m not totally against it.
---
You should update an album with all the pictures. it is quite the story now.
---
It’s not even a question of the demand, it’s impossible to police.  Blizzard isn’t going to dedicate a human being, or a team of them, to watching streams and seeing what server the players are on.
---
Gathering or alts. I was a holy paladin. I was herb mining.
---
Funny how it says BETA and stress test, why wouldnt it just say "stress test"??
---
Ohhhh okay. I knew they were leaving it open. I just didn’t know we would be able to play during non stress test hours
---
This dude is definitely Divergent.
---
True, but one slot doesn't really seem like a lot
---
Watching streamers is pretty much cuckoldry, so you have no right to complain about autism and retardation.
---
Is it? It was mentioned like that during the BFA Beta, but I haven't seen any mention of that in the version that made it live.
---
Move Trevor from group 1 over to group 2 so they have a tank!
---
Poor group 2, has a nameless woman and no tank.
---
So was his/hers. It's funny cause it's true. Moron.
---
Hast du ein aktives Abo?, wenn nicht, dann hast du keinen Beta Zugang, sondern nur Zugang zum Stresstest.
---
I actually stopped wanding because of this issue. I've narrowed it down to the enemy actually dying to the wand, so if I drain soul or something right before death it's fine. 
---
Also I haven't gotten this issue in the last day or so, even when I landed a killing blow with the wand.
---
Lol. Except I clearly edited my original post to acknowledge that I was wrong and thanked the person for the correct information before you Mongos started down voting.
---
Unpopular opinion here. I would prefer buff damage mobs. The point is that I have learned a lot since 2004. Given that today I know how to gear properly I will not be experiencing those difficult mobs fights.
---
so fucking accurate
---
Be that as it may, the viewership for Classic Wow skyrocketed and is still at the top.  The interest is undeniable and people are getting excited.  From a business standpoint, the choice was a success to generate hype and marketing.
---
Is this graphic exclusive to eagle eye? I kept seeing it yesterday while questing in the badlands and had no clue what it was.
---
&gt;Boared of the same old thing watching your usual streamers?
---
not saying it's a no go, just listing the point;&gt;
---
Same. Do you have 2 PTR accounts?
---
Shadowmeld is lot of fun.
---
I used to play feral in PvP back in actual vanilla. I only had the blue PvP set and the epic hammer from AV (The Unstoppable Force) for most of the time. 1v1 I'd beat everything, including SL Locks, except Warriors in AQ40/Naxx gear (far too much damage). With the epic PvP set and a Feral Attack Power weapon it would have been a lot easier, though.
---
Couple of points:
---
* Gear sucks. Unless you can no-life your way to R13, you're stuck with the blue set indefinitely. *Maybe* you can work in some T2.5 pieces from AQ and some non-set pieces if you raid. The movement speed bonus (3 piece PvP set bonus) is absolutely mandatory, and you also want the stealth detection on the gloves.
---
* Weapons and scaling suck even more. Ferals don't use weapon damage in classic. You always have a 55(?) DPS weapon while in Cat/Bear Form, while Warriors will eventually have 85+ DPS weapons. The only relief is FAP (Feral Attack Power). There are 4 weapons in the entire game that have FAP on them, and all of them require raiding (world dragons, AQ20, Naxx, legendary staff). The only weapon that's reasonably acquirable is the AQ20 mace, and that won't be in the game until Stage 5.
---
* Your damage sucks. Cat only does competitive damage when abusing certain consumables (e.g. Manual Crowd Pummeler) and when powershifting. Neither is viable in PvP. You can get some decent Shred crits in PvP, but the "high damage" spec (14/32/5) is still pathetic when compared to actual DPS classes, and sacrifices a ton of utility and healing (Insect Swarm, Nature's Swiftness, etc.) for a bit of damage. Something like 1/29/21 is far more versatile, but you won't kill anything quickly.
---
* Balance sucks. Horribly mana-inefficent, burst is random (depends entirely on crits) and requires hard-casting of slow spells. You're squishy as fuck and basically dead whenever you get stunned out of Bear Form. There's virtually no leather with spell damage, so you need cloth pieces (which raids will be reluctant to give you). It can be a meme in PvP when you Starfire+Moonfire someone from stealth and it all crits and blows someone up, but that's about it. In raids maybe you can be a crit-aura-bot for a group of Fire Mages or something.
---
* Resto sucks (beyond 21 points). A lot of the deep talents are weaksauce and don't scale (e.g. Improved Rejuvenation only buffing the base healing). On the upside this means that a Feral/Resto hybrid spec is still good even in raids (huge mana pool) and you might be able to play your PvP spec in raids without respeccing (1/29/21).
---
* Your mobility is great. It's similar to BfA, except there are no Monks or DHs, no Death Grip, fewer classes have spammable snares, Warriors don't have Leap, Rogues don't teleport, Shapeshifting hopefully won't be on the GCD, etc. so you can actually get away from things again. That makes you an obvious flag carrier and points defender in battlegrounds, and usually guarantees 1 spot in a premade. In Open World PvP you can kite like a king because of how much space there usually is.
---
* You don't really have a role in group PvP beyond flag carrying and defending. Feral doesn't do enough damage to replace a Warrior/Rogue, none of your specs have enough CC to replace a Mage/Warlock, your healing isn't good enough to replace a Paladin/Priest, and your utility isn't enough to replace a Shaman. That being said, I did play Resto in group PvP for a while and it was surprisingly fun. Most of the time I would DoT everyone, peel for our squishies (Feral Charge + Roots to control the opposing melees), tank in bear when focused, and throw heals around. However, I should also mention that I was Horde, so there was no Shaman to purge all of my HoTs (technically Priests could have but they were usually too busy doing more important stuff).
---
* You're great in duels. Classic has a lot of great 1v1 classes (Frost Mage, Hunter, SL Lock, Shadow Priest), but Druid is arguably the most consistent. You have no hard counters, you can Prowl to pick your fights, you can escape from most bad situations, you're just incredibly versatile. However, most fights are going to be quite long, and the risk of more players (friend or foe) arriving before it's over naturally increases.
---
Personally I'm still undecided whether I'm going to play Druid again. I loved being the playmaker in battlegrounds, as well as prowling around the open world to engage in all sorts of PvP skirmishes. But I hated the gear issues. It's incredibly tempting to just go for something like Mage or Hunter, because I can just raid and automatically get the gear I need. As a Druid I'd need to at least get to R10 again, and there would always be that tasty R13 carrot dangling in front of me, impossible to reach now that I have a job and can't play 18 hours of WoW every day for months.
---
Well Shamans have ghost wolf form so their mobility isn't terrible.
---
I thought the skill sounded lame so i didn't even buy it :P
---
In PvP I'm pretty sure you can make the argument for Tauren over orc.
---
only fool can roll a healer, u need thousands of gold in classic and even the gathering nodes r being contested and as healer u will almost always lose vs enemy DD, and u will also lose vs friendly DD when node is contested by mobs DD will always kill the mob faster and grab the node before you. only option is to play AH.
---
I’m actually taking that into account with my statement above.
---
Even with a weaving priest warlocks wont pass the big 3.
---
In BWL they’ll start to catch up to mages, then locks make a ton of progress with all of the hit great in AQ but that’s the same time mages go fire.
---
I had the exact opposite problem. My University was extremely large so they had complete shit internet.
---
They sorta faded out in the private server scene, because the kind of people who play on a vanilla private server are generally the kind of people who already know their class. But with Classic launching the population of Vanilla Beginners will be huge, and I expect Class Leaders to be a big thing again. I'm aiming to be a Druid CL wherever I end up.
---
Technically you could do both. Play the opposite faction you want to play at release. The quests only really start to overlap post level 30 content. I expect the cap to raise though so that will be on you to stop.
---
Yes, works fine for grinding and farming herbs.

Hi, /u/vanjavk
---
Regardless of what people think, there isn't going to be a perfect ratio for every raiding guild out there. The top guilds are going to have the perfect builds and everyone else is going to have to form raids out of scraps. 40 people is a lot of people. Taking into account they all need the same playtimes. Most guilds will be 10-15 dedicated people with proper roles and the rest will be fillers.
---
Do I have to have an active sub and win the RNG lottery to get into the 'Stress Test'? I figured it would be available for everyone, but the only options I have related to Classic is the Demo from BlizzCon, and the only option is to Uninstall. https://i.imgur.com/wCs2B8u.png
---
You might have been in a guild with sub par healers. Like sometimes I would run a pug MC or BWL and I'd top the healing meters on my druid, because I was healing against undergeared players or just bad players. But then I'd heal in my main raid and would always be competing for the bottom few ranks on the meters, because our paladins and priests knew how to play.
---
I'm willing to bet you weren't putting out effective heals, and were over healing quiete a bit, overwriting other druid hots and wasting raid Mana.
---
Unbinding the map key might be really immersive. But i guess me personally would get more annoyed with this, might work for some thou.
---
That's what she said?
---
Hi Silhoeette!
---
Love both classes for the same reasons! Both are very rewarding imo and you won't regret picking either. Like you said, priests really fulfill a role that will more than likely be underrepresented so it will definitely be easier to find groups and gear up if you were to go holy/disc.
---
Shadow on the other hand is actually not such a meme in PvE raiding - usually one per raid is normal for shadow weaving (+Shadow Dmg buff to whole raid) and moderate mana regen for your group, you will be placed with healers. In undead instances you also have a form of CC which is good for 5 man groups. In world PvP shadow rules all, with so much sustain, DOT, and fun spells (mind control like you mentioned).
---
I am expecting rogue to be quite overpopulated on the PvP end of things, but I think you will be surprised how easily you will be able to find a raid group as rogue or PUG 5 mans. Rogues in PvP are insanely fun to play as, but they are reliant on longer CDs to pull off the insane tricks you see on a lot of highlight videos. 
---
Not sure this big block of text will help you make a decision but either way hope you have fun with whichever class you pick!
---
1) You were the one that brought up rolling for the ravager, of course you would not need it as a warrior... 
---
2) The reason i used SM armory as an example is that Raging Beserker helm is BIS leveling helm for all 3 classes
---
3) If you are trying to go for a 'fast levelup' - running any of these instances would be a waste of time
---
not sure if it's actually nonsense. ESO launched and all the prelaunch ESO beta streamers all decided to roll on the same faction. PVP was a little lopsided for awhile.  They would have sooooo many people ...they used lag as a weapon.
---
🤣
---
He said if you got beta and the stress trst. They're not removing people from beta for the stress test.
---
Same here. But we see again how hard they shit on us europeans again and again :D
---
I got the pre alpha client in 2002 via leaked bit torrent and played wow on single player private server and my friends and i setup a server and did dungeons over LAN.
---
Does the stress test only go on for 2 hours?
---
Some people just ain‘t never happy
---
I got into the stress test but didn't get an e-mail
---
Read the site  
---
&gt; To fill our pool of beta and stress test participants, we’ll be choosing dedicated players who meet select criteria from both the WoW Classic beta opt-in and the standard Warcraft beta opt-in. Participants will also need to have an active subscription or active game time on their Battle.net Account. While opting-in to the beta is the primary way to make sure you’re in the running to join the test it doesn’t guarantee an invitation to the closed beta test. We may also consider additional factors such as how long a player has been subscribed to the game so that we have the right mix of players to ensure great feedback toward making WoW Classic the very best experience for the community.
---
Got a sub for the chance and got the stress test, my friend who has never subbed (or at the most did it for one month) who made his account during cata got the stress test.
---
I really am hoping to see people just surrounding any body of water and chatting nonsense, sounds like a great time.
---
I believe it's completely random. 2006 account here, got invited to the stress test.
---
IIRC your own account was always instant mail
---
Doesn’t it start really low as well? Like 50 silver or something?
---
Be careful with streaming as "Cloud Streaming" is not allowed in retail WoW and you could be banned for doing so. I don't know if theres any difference for "in-Home Streaming", but I won't take the risk...
---
I do think the same too. 
---
As for Mythic, it's inaccurate comparison. These casuals don't even corpserun.
---
Don't hate on my boi Quin69, pls :C
---
We will have greater blessings so won’t be that bad. Also I bet someone will remake Whisper Cast I bet. Then buffing is not your problem it’s your class leads.
---
Facials are very important. Makes or breaks a good beauty session at the salon.
---
Seriously, for PvE, Hunter racials aren't that important. Trolls are nice, especially in phase 1 where Rhok'Delar is BiS (assuming the Leaf drops in phase 1), and they continue to be the best PvE hunter race throughout, mostly because Orc and Tauren racials are inconsequential for PvE.
---
That being said, they're going to matter more in PvP, where Orcs are hands down the best. I'm an avid PvPer and am still going to chose a Troll because I vastly prefer their looks. It's up to you at the end of the day, but in my opinion, go with what you enjoy the most, not what's technically best.
---
&gt;accounts dating back to vanilla that are active should have some priority
---
I'm pretty sure they did. I was a day 1 invite with a 2004 acct.
---
It’d be an option for those that like or prefer aspects of TBC over Classic though. Some classes open up more than in Vanilla, which is pretty impactful.
---
But if they went with TBC servers, they most likely wouldn’t be adding new lvl 60 content. If they did both then it’d be expected to add new lvl 70 content as well, then the same for Wrath if they ever did that.
---
and the option is [this](https://imgur.com/qUQ21Wj)
---
No. You don't get beta access.  
---
It is oddly worded, but Blizzard stated those invited to this particular test will only have access to the stress realm.
---

I am really surprised that this is working. Then I shouldn#t have any problems while beeing on the same LAN. Thanks for the information!
---
Not refreshing my mail then :)

You could try steamlink. It supposedly can work with Blizzard games.
---
See now this is where everything gets strange. I have 2 active accounts. First wave of beta looked like streamers and big names only, yet my 04 account got in and I'm a literal no one. Now comes stress test wave and my account made in wod got in, along with 2 friends who started in mop. I'm not too sure there was ever a priority system yet everyone in beta claims they were 04 05 players.
---
It's logical tho. Their employees are from the US and no need to make them work at night to accomendate us. Let the Americans do the leg work and profit from it ;)
---
I've heard tauren hunter is dogshit for pvp, because of the hit box. ie because your character model is so huge, melees and people in general have an easier time staying on top of you so you can't use your bow/gun and that's what everyone tries to do vs hunters. If you're a hunter and you duel a mage, lock, spriest, or whatever, they're just gonna run on top of you the entire time. 
---
Likewise, tauren druid is also dogshit. (did anyone see sonyd's duel vs soda? lmfao that hit box in tauren vs tauren is legit insane). But basically, tauren is broken if you're meelee, and kinda dogshit if you're ranged (druid, shaman, hunter,...). Warstomp is a little bit effective if you're shaman etc, but it's better to just play orc because the most common cc in vanilla are stuns.
---
something a lot of people don't know as well, but gnome mage is also dogshit for pvp (decent for pve because of the intelect), but your arc exploisons and forst nova's are smaller if you're a gnome compared to say a human. So if you're in world pvp, 40v40, or 100v100 or whatever, that can have a huge impact. 
---
But either way, back to the point. For horde hunter play orc for pvp, troll for pve. If you're interested in both, then go orc.
---
This is the definition of Bobby B's redemption arc
---
Enchanting and tailoring. You can make a lot of money from bags. Neither of these require farming of nodes so that makes it easier to compete. Add in cooking and fishing and you can make enough to survive. That's how I did it in vanilla back in the day.
---
&gt; but my heart is telling me, fuck all that and play a Rogue.
---
[Then I think you got your answer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yCC_b5WHLX0)
---
Warlocks rotation is slightly more interesting than mage. Not that it's saying much, but warlocks have Shadowbolt + CoS/CoE + (situational) corruption. Mages is just spam frostbolt/fireball.
---
We will see you in Booty bay!
---
Have any links? That sounds fun.
---
Yeah. I'd like to see the TBC-style class balance patched in if we are going to go OSRS style and add content at 60.
---
I don't like the idea of "trap" specs where you play a class from 1-59 with a certain playstyle and then realize at 60 that it's not viable for endgame.
---

---
Venruki and Shroud have been enjoyable to watch, they have a positive attitude, they are skilled players and go pretty easy on the twitch-isms. Some of the younger guys are fairly annoying to listen to since half their dialogue consists of saying pog or talking shit to other streamers
---
Stonard &gt; Rockard
---
How long have you been playing WoW?
---
my current theory (and hope) is that those selected for the stress test will be added in the next few waves (over the next couple of weeks) to the actual beta test. so by the time of the second stress test (which as of now is june 19 - 20) they'll have progressively larger amounts of people testing the game. that can be repeated for the july stress test as well.
---
I have to admit I got so tired about the layering talk on like day 1 lol. It felt over saturated with all the reddit posts in no time. Will still listen through all of it, it's a lovely show.
---
You know, if you want it to take a day and a half, Blizzard could just mail it to you, first-class delivery?
---
Level 5 full BiS or you’re not getting in on the hogger raids tonight

It’s over mages! I have the high ground!
---
Prostitution in goldshire's inn
---
Ooh i thought it had already started, thanks for clearing that up!
---
So basically TBC.
---
&gt; And pservers were patched together from video evidence from all phases of the game, not just 1.12.1, so it makes sense they get a lot of mechanics like this wrong.
---
Private servers by and large are not based on video evidence. They're based on massive packed sniffed data dumps made before Cataclysm.
---
I remember hating them as a hunter too. But I think they mainly shine in a 1v1 fight where they have the edge
---
Doesn't hunters just auto win vs rogues?
---
Druids are one of my favorites to level. I usually spec Feral for tanking since i love Druid tanking dungeons, but still have some talents to make cat form great in the open world, which makes leveling a great time. Not to mention travel form at 30!
---
I usually just keep a heal set in my bank, and healing goes just fine. Hope you enjoy!
---
I mean it is "just" stress test. I'd still like to play it though... :(
---
The buffs don't last through death in Vanilla, though, right? I.e. you still gotta rebuff after a wipe?
---
Don't watch a lot of streamers usually. But Soupasoka is taking his time to 30. Pretty mellow guy.
---
2h fury is a thing and until 40 the preferred pve spec. If you're on a pvp server, arms is preferab
---
Ok but I have Linen Bandage....
---
Better than BFA Beta TBH.
---
Venruki is the best one to watch I've found. Very upbeat and fun.
---
I'm sure there would be a lot of people who would pay a decent amount of money for a cock-flavoured lollipop. GachiBASS
---
There's no point in time that I am aware of where Shadow Priests top the DPS meters. They're not even the best casters, and are generally limited to 0-1 by competetive raiding guilds. You don't even need to specc all the way into Shadow to get the debuff rolling, so that's generally the path a lot of the good guilds will take.
---
Good news! I heard that Blizzard is planning to roll out "safe-space" servers where you don't need to interact with anyone who might insult you by harshly critiquing your play. It's pretty much a curated single player experience called "Battle for Azeroth"! They just added the new Snowflake allied race so I am sure you can really immerse yourself.
---
Everyone did in early vanilla, because those addons didnt exist yet.
---
You’re in!
---
Normalization doesnt take away the fact that slower weapons are better for instant attacks, except Bloodthirst.
---
Otherwise I agree with the above posts.
---
its a little rolldown list over "PLAY" in the battle.net launcher for World of Wacraft
---
I plan on not using any add-ons (Also not some sort of elitest that hates anyone who uses add-ons)
---
I may add a damage meter later into the game, but i certantly won't be adding anything to make questing faster. 
---
Can't wait to read quests for the first time in almost 10 years.
---

---
Shit, all i see now is "Another Brick in the WoW". You can't put capital W in a place like that....
---
I really shouldn't be this upset over a 2 hour beta to level 5 but FRICK this hurts me as a long time money giver to blizzard
---
Im not really sure yet.  Im in the guilds discord, but its extremely slim pickings for guilds that actually raid at the times i want to (and are on a pve server).
---
I might try to get on a server with a guildie from retail just in case i went to play with the people hes going to, but idk really.  Some of it might depend on what names i end up wanting to use.
---
3 months to figure it out...ive got time lol
---
On a side note, im really shocked at how few guilds are recruiting with a 'traditional' time slot (usually roughly 8-11 Eastern, which is perfect for me in Central time) and on the 'traditional' days (Tu/Th/maybe Su)
---
we definitely attempted a naked naxx run back in the day lol
---
Great question, I would love to know as well
---
most invested player?
---
Not even sure what that means to be honest. i love vanilla, started it late in 2006, never played on pservers until last year. played on 1 for about 6 months and that's all.
---
That's why Blizzard have the 15 year old game running in their offices. Neat, huh?
---
Yes, that is why they made a beta asked us to test, because they can't go on to check each value manually. and the damage number might be different not because of wrong flat value but because of a change in formulas in later expansions.... Neat. huh?
---
Yeah, I haven't even heard anyone say it until you did just now. I guess that means that the dumbest thing you've ever heard is something you said yourself. Brilliant.
---
What is brilliant is the confidence you project when this literal post comments contradict ur very point. Brilliant.
---
and finally regarding the private server data. yes ofc. the actual values were not available man... but it is literally the only available comparison. no one is telling blizzard you are wrong on this. and if someone is... well hes a dummy. what people are doing, and what they should be doing, is point out odd values or behaviors so that blizzard can go and check them manually. 
---
when blizzard build classic, they do not manual enter the data man. they make tools to import them. however this leads to errors and sometimes issues due to formula changes, values that no longer exist and many many more problems.
---
Calling people "hardcore autistic retards" because you don't enjoy their stream, doesn't endear you to anybody wanting to type a sensible reply. It's also not a good look in general.
---
Going both herb and mining is insanely annoying, as you can only track one resource at a time.
---
Nostalgia goggles galore. This is how the game was, it was never hard from a dungeon/raid perspective. The game's base mechanics like threat and leveling was harder. That's it.
---
I do like Venruki. Super chill and actually good at the game.
---

Lul ill just let other people stress test. Ill pass on that. I would only be sad to get to level 5 for a couple hours
---
Classic with a hint of TBC if you will.
---
the swirly animation? yes
---
Yeah or the younger kids who didn’t know mods existed
---
Valid point, I will ask a GM to confirm it is legal before using it.
---
I feel like this has to be a thing because I'm in the exact same boat, however I have no bans on my account so I can't see why it would be :((
---
I cannot decide to whether roll a Paladin or Rogue.
---
I used to play Rogue on Vanilla and  loved every aspect of my class. I first started with a Druid but was so unhappy with that class that i rerolled for Rogue and never looked back.
---
However, i know that there will be a HUGE amount of Rogues to compete for instance/raid spots that this kinda scares me off.
---
On the other hand as holy paladin you are most likely have a guaranteed instances or raid spot.
---
The PvP in arathi highlands with asmongokd and Sonydigital was pretty RP.
---
Same...I was so excited I almost cried, then I read the blue post :(   
---
P.S. I think its really lame if you get invited to a Stress test it has no impact on closed beta invites.
---
Vanilla vet here. I wanted to talk about expectations and the social impacts of picking a class.
---
If you don't have any friends interested in wow there are two paths you can take depending on your playstyle:
---
 *Do you want to log on, level up, explore, bit a pvp, a dungeon, on a random schedule?* Then play rogue, hunter, or mage. These classes allow you to play solo very well. 
---
*Do you want to make friends, always have people wanting to play with you?* Play healer. Druids, priests, shamans, paladins are the first players to receive warm whispers when logging in. Additionally, a **protection** spec warrior would have the same experience, particularly with good gear.
---
This. I won’t be using addons at all. I’m excited to see a fresh WoW without the clutter of addons
---
I'd appreciate that
---
No, they said in a QnA stream that they have no plans for RP-PvP at launch, and might add one later if "the people wants it".
---
That's why there has been such a cry out for it.
---
If you open up the client, you will see the only realmlist listed is the stress test. Only those who are invited to the closed beta have access to both.
---
&gt; It's actually the best thing about druids. You can ~~browse reddit~~ hump the dead raid members in Cat/Bear while the priests and paladins are ressing the raid.
---
It's a bad template for PVP.
---
You NEED 5/5 tactical mastery in PVP. You probably can stay in def stance in PVE, but not in PVP.
---
Anyway fury is not good in PVP, not at least you have an obscene amount of gear.
---
Go 31/20/0 or 31/5/15 if you really want some prot talents (unless you're the MT you don't really need prot points).
---
Jumpcraft? All google results link to minecraft servers. I don't even know what you are trying to ask lol.
---
Amen
---
THAT'S where I remember this from.
---
I understand completely, my other friend who I played with in retail until bfa didnt get in to either somehow. Very strange
---
Logging in at the same time seems like it would worj.
---
Thanks for the detailed reply! 
---
You usually wouldn't have to buff the entire raid as a single priest though, right? I.e. each priest would have 1-2 groups to take care of?
---
Good point, I'll keep that in mind
---
Your average download speed doesn't work and heres why:  
---
Nobody had 350kbits on their internet. You either had broadband, which started at 768kbits and already had double speed options or you had dial up with at MOST 64kbit. Nobody played this game at dial up my friend.
---
I was never a gamer. Wow hooked me. And don't worry you can force them to play! Haha
---
&gt; There are good holy/wand damage spec that are pretty viable in 5. For raid you'll need a full heal spec.
---
When people talk about switching specs like this, they don't mean regularly right? I thought it was so expensive that you'd pick one spec and do it for everything and maybe switch months later if need be.
---
&gt;As for Mythic, it's inaccurate comparison. These casuals don't even corpserun.
---
Afraid you lost me, not sure what you mean.
---
Rp is weird to me. I mostly pvp.
---
The servers open until tomorrow 6 PDT, you have 26 hours on the server
---
Venruki is a legit-good WoW player, and his stream isn't based on him going around being a douche.  I don't watch streamers, but occasionally will catch a video clip published to youtube.  Not sure if Frostadamus is in the beta yet, but his videos are pretty entertaining.
---
I do question Blizz's decisions to have people like asmongold or tipsout be the face of their classic wow marketing front, but you can't argue with the fact that they definitely give the community something to screech at each other about.
---
it might not be the best but simply running 5/10 man dungeons can earn you gold. Strat live is a great place to group farm
---
Yes, go feral and maintain a healing set of gear on the side and you will have 0 problems.
---
You talking about walljumping?
---
Is there any scripting in classic? I can't remember to what extent you were able to in macros back in vanilla.
---
Am I the only one that got both? Playing on actual beta RN :)
---
Depends on what you value more, fun or being wanted? If you go Paladin PvE you will probably be Holy in the end, spamming flash of lights and managing buffs is your only job so it gets kinda dull. In PvP both classes are fun imo.
---
But for that moment they were really good! (Now quote the movie)
---
Thanks
---
Even the developers are having more fun on classic.
---
I’m that case dungeons are boring af
---
Oh, really?  Okay, I should look into it, thanks.
---
I know it's only up to level 5, I figured the point of a stress test is to, well, stress test.
---
Hi, So i got into the Beta &amp; Stress test classic on bnet tonight, does this mean i can only play the beta for the 26 you mentioned or do i now have access to the beta for its entire duration ? Thanks
---
Honestly it should be no problem if you're running any class that can heal. I was just more saying warriors don't really have a lot of buttons to press, but honestly if you're leveling together you can do some AoE pulls and have tons of fun with consecration, thunder clap, etc.
---
Some tips to teach her early:
---
Rend is garbo after the first 10 or so levels (Pretty bad even before tbh)  
---
Stance Dancing (Make her get tactical mastery ASAP and show her the way!)  
---
Threat Management  
---
Importance of Shield Block  
---
Hamstring Kiting (In case she ever goes off on her own)  
---
Which skills not to buy (Pool your gold and help her get her mount at 40!)  
---
KEY BINDINGS+MOUSE TURNING!
---
I could probably go on for hours lol. So much to teach new players!
---
According to WoWhead if you've only been invited to the stress test you won't be able to play in the beta realms once the stress test is over. Fuck you too blizz
---
You'll probably want two seperate gear sets for that, but it's viable
---
I am actually a blind idiot.
---
I'm still doing it.
---
Thank you for this information.
---
Can you be BM hunter in raids at all? Or is it always marksman in vanilla
---
Except you'll almost be certainly be tanking more than one at a time.
---
Their "job"? I wasn't aware you're paying them to convince you that the beta isn't bugged.
---
Started like a month after launch maybe
---
You can't attack Hordes in the Valley of Trials.
---
Would you say it would be a viable leveling spec to go holy until you get consecration and put all your other points in Retribution? Would this allow you to still tank dungeons effectively while also being able to solo decently enough?
---
Oh the community is having a meltdown over streamers? I hadn't noticed. Calling anything toxic after you've just used the phrase "pompous bitch boy" is pretty rich.
---
Hey, sure you can - given you have some competent friends playing with you. But as for the overall does-all build, try this. It seems pretty ugly, but as long as you'll not be overconfident, you'll do just fine during leveling and some low level dungeon shenanigans - be it tanking, healing or some dps.
---

Then why does this question matter...
---
Thank you. Hopefully I get one :)

I've had similar reservations about going holy priest as a main. My guild requires engineering as a prof even if you don't do PvP to cheese through some prog conent, so I'm also limited on professions. However, there are plenty of ways to make gold, even if you aren't a hunter/lock/mage.
---
1) Everyone can farm *somewhere*. With holy priests, for example, they can do DME lasher farm using holy nova, or you can pair up with a warrior and do jump runs and split the thorium veins at the end. I don't play shaman but I'm sure there's *something* out there.
---
2) Recipe runs. Classes that aren't great at solo farming, guild memebers, and friends can all be roped in to helping you farm as a group. Spam BRD or LBRS and save all the blue/epic recipes to AH, and split the profits as a group.
---
3) Orb runs, self-explanatory; those sell for a bit
---
4) Tyr's hand farming: Not great g/hr, but since it's such a PvP hotbed, people will gladly group up with a resto PvP shaman to have their back and gank squad alliance.
---
5) Fishing/cooking: Again, you won't be breaking records for g/hr compared to the big 3 farming classes, but anyone can do it and get 20g+/hr easily. While that's not amazing, it's a decent income.
---
6) Prof alts, something I'll definitely be doing regardless of my main. You only need to get to 35 to max out 300 in any profession, and that's an easy less than 2 days played on a twink hunter, lock, mage, or druid. Grind them up quickly, max their professions, and you can make passive income off daily CD crafting. 2-5g/day/character adds up and is a lot less mind-numbing than straight grinding, plus you get access to max level crafters to mitigate cost on your main. Compared to getting 40g/hr, it'd take you about a year for the leveling to pay off; so you're better off doing it as soon as possible.
---
7) AH gaming: Most profitable g/hr if you know what you are doing, and fastest way to go broke if you don't. Trolling the AH with good addons and tracking the market to buy underpriced items and sell them high has always been profitable and will always be profitable.
---
Those are my main recommendations and gold-gaining plans for my main. On top of that, there's a bunch of stuff you can try to do on server start if you speed run to 60, which can easily set your character up for the life of the game. Like if you can be one of the first to 60 and get 2 stacks of black lotus? That's worth what, 4k on a mature server? You won't need to farm again, ever. But there's also long CD recipes, and if you can plant bank alts there and log in on timers, they can sell for 5-20g each, and you can easily get 1k+ for a couple weeks of effort.
---
Torn to pieces between priest, warrior, warlock and rogue. I have all the classes at Max lvl on retail, but only played the priest from Vanilla.   
---
I want to Get groups for stuff easy, and I have two kids so I don’t have a LOT of time to play.   
---
I will do both pve and pvp (both group and solo).  
---
As I write this it gets clearer and clearer that I should play a priest lul :p
---
Get a shard bag.
---
Don't do herb and mining, go herb and skinning or mining and skinning. You cant track both herbs and ore at the same time.
---
I'm just talking about the trash, not the bosses. You're right that they are "easy", even on private servers they are easy, but I didn't expect them to be faceroll easy.
---
Never got banned in any extension for buying gold. And I did it quite a few times.  
---
Got banned for paying for a leveling service once thought. That was fucking dumb and not worth it. But I was like 16 and thought it would be fine.  
---
But the gold buying is not so obvious. I've never had problems with it, neither the few people I know who did it too.
---
For Eagle Eye you have to use a macro. For the Shaman skill Far Sight, you could just spam the ability itself. If you plan to play a hunter, look up the Eagle Eye macro some time. It's very handy to have for exploring areas you're not supposed to. Like the ocean or Hyjal.
---
They don't have to.  You just let the server population self police.  Blizz just has to enforce it if someone sends them proof of someone streaming.
---
Great to have an authentic vanilla perspective, thank you!
---
A friend of mine had a night elf warrior all through vanilla and was in the top ten for tanks on our server. While not exactly the same as your scenario, I think the difference is pretty negligible.
---
You're screwed, plain and simple. Logging in at the same time may help (or may not, the details are unclear at the moment I think), but even then, none of you can group without a risk of jumping somewhere else.
---
Are they going to leave this in?
---
hey man, some of us work in red hat and/or centos all day. my only reason for running windows is literally for this game.
---
Amazing will try it out
---
Reddit also didn't exist when WoW was actually popular.
---
Killing someone in a stun-lock can only happen on fresh lvl 60 under geared players.
---
Once everyone is raiding, it's not possible anymore, they have too much HP and or armor.
---
Mage is more competitive and minmaxy. And respeccing to Fire in AQ is a very nice refresh while Warlocks continue spamming Shadowbolt.
---
A great thing about RP, though, is that it enhances all those other aspects of the game as well.
---
Your character becomes *more* than numbers on a screen. 
---
"FOR THE ALLIANCE!", "LOK'TAR OGAR!", even those simple catchphrases, shouted at the start of a battleground to hype your team - they hit harder when you mean it.
---
And when you're less anonymous, less one of many faceless players in a team, you connect with your teammates more, your callouts can be inspiring, your defeats can have stakes, etc
---
I'm not the one arguing the armor values is wrong so guess again.
---
I'm just saying it doesn't prove much. And 
---
&gt;Do you think Blizzard isn’t aware of how their own game works?
---
Is a silly argument because time after time they prove they don't.
---
Classic will be using the 8.0 engine and all of its glorious graphics, although I do believe there is an option to go back to the Original models and textures.
---
I wanna play hunter really bad but I’ve seen many discouraging things. Arrows/ammo, there isn’t much of a need for hunters in raids, you share loot with many other classes, etc. My main question is am I gonna actually have a problem getting into raid groups or dungeon groups? I really am hoping to play hunter.
---
I do think early adopters of the game have been give a higher chance, I say chance as Apr '05 EU account here and just the stress test to answer for it. 🙈
---
I'm hoping this is a step closer to proper beta though for me.
---
Unfortunately not.
---
Because if you have plenty of soil shards and are apexes correctly you are a monster in PVP.
---
my current theory is that those selected for the stress test will be added in the next few waves (over the next couple of weeks) to the actual beta test. so by the time of the second stress test (which as of now is june 19 - 20) they'll have progressively larger amounts of people testing the game. that can be repeated for the july stress test as well. 
---
fingers crossed
---
Is Blood Frenzy really worthwhile in this hybrid spec? An extra combo point you can't plan for could be wasted at times. While leveling, how good does your crit in cat get?
---
[DELETED]
---
Stamina doesn’t make you mitigate more damage, and 50 damage is 50 damage, which is just pathetic low.
---
as a horde*
---
Stress test does not mean you can play in the beta afterwards im afraid.
---
&gt; most invested player? 
---
You can't even keep track of your own insults..
---
&gt; What is brilliant is the confidence you project when this literal post comments contradict ur very point. Brilliant.
---
Or keep track of what's being said and how it fits together. Private server players having played, or not played, Vanilla isn't even relevant to the discussion we're having. And the only one claiming they never played vanilla is you.
---
&gt; and finally regarding the private server data. yes ofc. the actual  values were not available man... but it is literally the only available  comparison. 
---
If that's the only available comparison, why are people comparing with videos of actual gameplay of the actual version of the actual game? You know, an ACTUALLY VIABLE comparison rather than comparing with something that's mostly incorrect?
---
Not gonna bother with this discussion anymore. Have fun!
---
Having access to the stress test doesn't mean you'll have access to the beta and doesn't affect your chance to be selected later either.
---
https://www.wowhead.com/news=291829/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-22nd
---
If you cant see beta servers atm (only stress test server) then you cant access beta after test.
---
No, it even says so in the email.
---
:-( I guess I’m just terrible at PvP because I remember constantly getting owned by rogues.
---
:( this is such a tease then...
---
You are asking the wrong question. With all the streaming media out there, why choose to watch someone play a game...
---
Great work. Did you get a new mic?
---
Sounds different
---
They still need to check that proof, which takes manpower.  Also companies WANT streamers, it gives them exposure.  There’s no reason for Blizzard to enforce such a rule.
---
Kind of. Eagle Eye doesn't normally let you spam it like this. Eagle Eye is a toggled ability. So if you tried to use it again, you would actually just turn it off. There is a macro though that lets you spam it. Shaman had it easier, Far Sight could just be spammed with no limit just using the ability. Definitely an oversight by Blizzard, but it's one that is still in the game to this day. At least it was still a thing in Legion when I tried it last.
---
&gt; loot list, suicide kings, EPGP, modified SK, gold bid, GDKP, bid-all DKP.
---
And none of of them are used on pservers. 
---
And it is definitely a 90/10 split on pservers. I'm not saying that's how it's gonna be in classic, but pservers is literally the only indications that we have about what classic will look like, and it looks like it's gonna be primarily loot council, especially for the higher end guilds.
---
Stonewind instead of Stormwind. 
---
What is that temple of the damned in actual wow?
---
1.12 is not Vanilla. It's ridiculous.
---
I can relate :(
---
Gotcha , sounds good amigo
---
The Swamp of Sorrows in WoW is basically the Black Morass (it even has Stonard, as seen on the map). The southern part of the Swamp turned into the Blasted Lands.
---
Well, I was never big on raids back then, which explains a lot of why I constantly died in PvP.  Come to think of it, I still don’t raid in BFA.
---
Probably not if both sides are already in guilds, as guild members supposedly get paired to the same layer as the rest of their guild regardless. But we don't know enough about the specifics at the moment.
---
This has got to be the map they based the Warcraft movie on.
---
"Considering this is now a core concept in retail."
---
We are wanting to get away from retail....
---
That's huge. Is this by design, or is it a bug?
---
Depending on your pet uptime on the boss / trashes I'd argue 5% pet dmg is better than a 2 min attack speed boost that will probably stay at 10% most of the time.
---
You'll almost always get into groups with those classes except maybe for fury warrior and if there's a stubborn tank while you're playing rogue.
---
I'm too lazy to find the blue post, but it said this stress test had no impact on future beta invites.
---
Of course blue posts aren't always right though, and I'm hoping putting a bunch of hours into the stress test will help me lol
---
Maybe if you want to be completely disingenuous and ignore all context. Notice how every time I said it was a vocal minority, stop being defensive. I even posted a thread that was obviously acting in the way I said but you guys just kept making excuses, if you want to be ignorant cool, but don't pretend I'm being anything.
---
These fucking goons can't even do it right. The ratio is always wrong. Fucking idiots. I don't care that this is two months old, it's completely relevant even after the fixes that they keep implementing.
---
It's the same but with some additional rules. It's a bit stricter with naming (Xxlegolazlotrxx is not a name youll get to keep) and the policy about in game chat (say, yell, emote) is semi-enforced to have no connection to the modern day world. So it can give a little bit more tickets sent to Blizzard, but I don't think it actually does. Since the community on RP-PVP and RP are quite mature and respectful which would cause less reports.
---
Otherwise it's just a normal PvP realm for RP-ers.
---
Thanks for this. Sounds like ive got to ding 60. Farm up to get epic mount. Switch to resto to gear up. Then I just need to farm enough gold to respec as needed. Which I will probably just have to farm for when I am in ele spec. I dont need to be rich. Just be able to switch to resto for raids and ele for when I want to zap those damn gnomes.
---
As a neutral party, I've seen far more elitism and gloating from non-private players.
---
I agree with this, I'm just going to play and see what happens. I'm looking forward to classic bringing the social aspect back into the game. Heck I remember making friends in vanilla simply by buffing a player as I went by
---
It was literally Bejeweled. The add-on was created by PopCap.
---
Same boat as rogue, hunter, and mage for solo play but more desired for raids. Maybe best of both worlds.
---
Like everyone predicted, taking the easy mode 1.12 version basically ruined Classic and has absolutely nothing to do with the actual Vanilla experience.
---
They have employees, it's not like they have to hire someone full time to check on the random links they might get sent.
---
Blizz also has customers who don't want streamers.  Not asking for every server to be stream free, just a few to keep some of their customers happy.
---

---
/flex
---
Same, except 2005 for me
---
You're just seeing what you want to see.
---
WTF. +6 intellect - you can **FEEL** your spells hitting harder.
---
Meanwhile in Classic INT increases mana and spell crit, not spell power.
---
What an idiot.
---
Would you settle for a 30 fps experience while playing on the notebook?  
---
If so, I think you'd be rather off playing directly on the notebook instead of RDPing to your main machine.
---
I'm currently looking for a laptop/hybrid for this exact purpose, fanless if possible. I'll gladly trade performance for a silent machine on the go.
---
Priests and Paladins can AoE farm in DM with pretty obtainable gear. Not sure what Shamans or Druids do though. All healers can pair with a tank and sell runs or do reserved orb runs as well.
---
Is this cancer?
---
I love PvPing and don't mind either damage dealing myself or supporting my team.
---
It's just a matter of getting epic gear, which is harder as a Rogue due to sheer amount of competition.
---
0 :(
---
Wait if guilds are per layer, then we just need to find an ally and horde guild that's on same layer, and we'll always be on same layer? Or I'm missunderstanding
---
Wrong, wrong, wrong. EPGP is way more popular than DKP nowadays, even on private servers, and ultra-competitive guilds like Onslaught use Loot list. Hell, my guild uses loot list, and I've seen plenty of GDKP/Gold bid runs from any guild that needs to PUG up to max.
---
You're just incorrect.
---
Though I'm mainly leaning towards shaman, something still makes me ponder if I should play priest instead. I have ideas of how I'm going to level shaman, using enh and having healing gear for dung, but I'm also wondering if I'd enjoy the fantasy of a priest more.
---
&gt; Its not like its TBC Heroics, that was when the real WTF damage for non-preped people came in.
---
I remember doing the Attunement quest in Heroics Shattered Halls (pre-nerf). People failed and hated that dungeon so much that they only did it once, wich made finding tanks especially hard. In the end we managed convince a high geared warrior to help us, but on one condition: He wouldn't respec.
---
So group was:
---
Dual wielding warrior (Tank/DPS)  
---
Druid (Healer/CC)  
---
2xRogue (DPS/CC)  
---
Mage (DPS/CC).
---
Probably the most hectic and fun 5-man I did in my entire wow-career.
---
Then a few weeks later they nerfed it and made the instance a cakewalk :(
---
In WotlK I would regularly play with a fury warrior that queued as a tank, and me a elemental shaman queued as a healer. There were no challenging heroics at all, and I hardly had to do any healing, everything died to fast with 5 dps.
---
Read your email, it says no beta!
---
Honestly the best solution is kinda the least "classic" -- send everyone (unpartied) to the same location. Hopefully there is atleast 1 H/A pair that're in the same layer, have them invite everyone else to a party, that will pull them all to the same layer (and shouldn't change you out until you go through a loadscreen)
---
It's still better than other alternatives. Plus - you are gearing towards crit stat anyway, be it directly or indirectly. 
---
Plus, an extra combo point per fight can make a big difference.
---
my stress test email came in about 30 minutes before my launcher updated to show the stress test server. the opposite happened for my husband, his launcher updated first then he got an email way later. so based on that i think the emails and launcher access isn't synced properly you may need to just try again today to see if your launcher updates.
---
I don't think so, but the altar of storms in blasted lands could be a stand-in for it.
---
Take a raid of 40 level 5 players, and destroy Orgrimmar.
---
True, and thanks those are good tips! I'm definitely excited to relive the magic with someone totally new. I think WoW in the old days did a great job starting off super basic and building up a player's skill set as they level.
---
I need to use it to make sure my addons work properly. I will probably need to rewrite a couple of them from the ground up. Sadly, only major addon devs got invited into the beta, not the small fish.
---
Man, I was thinking of the wrong kind of "facial".
---
You're a good person.
---
They said they wanted a variety of accounts to get in and test, it was never about people only subbed since vanilla.
---
I lost my original account, new one is from 2014, got in.
---
My hope is that maybe if I log on  for the 2 hour stress test they will take note and give me beta access. 
---
A man can dream.
---
Don't play Classic then.
---
From someone that ran a hunter in vanilla there will be a butt ton of hunters...but if you are actually good at it and not a huntard you will stand out cause 98% of the hunter base doesn’t know what they are doing.
---
Rockard sounds like rock hard ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
I get to play 5 levels and 2 hours more of the WoW Classic Beta than I was able to before, no oof from me.
---
outstanding move
---
I didn't get any email :D
---
When I was searching for it (because I was having low fps overall compared to my system specs) I found a ton of people having the exact same issue, saying that changing to DX11 legacy works a lot better. I'm not exactly sure why, but I tested the different DirectX versions and 12 was by far the worst.  
---
My comment was mostly because you attribute all this being possible to the new BFA client, whereas that's simply not true because people do this on private servers with the old client without 5 fps.
---
I'm probably going herb and tailor until I craft the few good items. Then switch to alc to make my own consumables. Self sufficient. Can always sell leftover herbs/pots for repair money.
---
wait, what's up with the 2 ptrs? I have two, don't tell me i'm screwing myself here somehow.
---
You're misunderstanding and putting a lot of emphasis on something that will not be in the game for long.
---
From what I've heard yeah that actually might work. But again I haven't done tons of research on it and they've only released very basic info on layering, so don't quote me.
---
Those employees already have jobs or do you think they employ people for fun?  You’ve clearly never run a successful business if you’re saying they have people sitting around looking for something to do.  They trimmed 800+ jobs last year for exactly that reason.
---
&gt; Blizz also has customers who don't want streamers.  Not asking for every server to be stream free, just a few to keep some of their customers happy.
---
At most a few hundred voices shouting into the wind.  Streamers aren’t this big issue that those people are making it out to be.  They exist in every successful modern game.
---
This looks like something that was in vanilla. Im not sure the name of the "feature" but just like running over the bridge from Arathi to Wetlands you load back in with characters. 
---
I know this is private server and Tips but a quick example. [Link](https://youtu.be/TsVMRZTn8jM)
---
I won’t play with any. I didn’t have add-ons at all for most of vanilla because I didn’t know what they were for the longest time, then didn’t trust the sites to download them. Only finally got them at the end (a few months before TBC), specifically for raid stuff. 
---
Although I will miss ArcHud if no one does that one again.
---
Max was 100 g.
---
The stress test period is 2 hours, but you’ll still be able to log in and play on the stress test server well into Thursday.
---
Me too, EU?
---
There are settings to use the vanilla style lighting, shadows and water. But you can also choose to run full modern graphics (without modern character models).
---
&gt;Farm up to epic mount
---
No, epic mount isn't as big as your basic mount is. It should not be your top priority, it should be way down the list. Having gold to play the AH or speed level alts would be a way better investment of that 1k, you should only get your epic when that cash is burning a hole in your pocket if you want to do it efficiently. You shouldn't try to get it right away unless you are in a hardcore PvP guild where it's a huge difference in PvP ability.
---
So was/is/will be enhancement Shaman viable in PvP and PvE or were you always "forced" to play healer in PvE and Ele in PvP? 
---
Was the shaman feared in PvP? Compared to other classes?
---
I think new zones to explore are fine, as long as you stay far, far away from flying mounts. That is what crippled the world.
---
Yeah but it's with the best leveling class; hunter, and really optimized solo leveling, duo is a bit longer and with a have a slow comp rogue/war
---
Hi,
---
I'm looking forward to level as a druid, but i don't really know how to build my talents to make it efficient. I was thinking about going for a mix of resto/balance to be able to heal casually on 5-man while leveling, but i don't really know if it would work. Any advice are welcome ;)
---
Only gearscore above 24 will get an invite!
---
World first Silithus run here we go
---
Macro isn’t needed. I used to do this all the time in vanilla and 12 year old me had no ideas what macros were
---
Please refer here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brjn96/bluepost\_emails\_sent\_out\_for\_stress\_test\_people/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brjn96/bluepost_emails_sent_out_for_stress_test_people/)
---
My 60 year old mom is coming back after a long break from the game. She started in BC and stopped after MOP. She’s only ever played mage and elemental shaman. What are some easy basic PVE classes she could play in classic?
---
I was the priest class leader and part of the loot council in my old guild. I was friends with most of the priests and we would discuss who was aiming for what pieces of gear, what their biggest upgrades are, who's close to a set bonus, etc. Everyone was generally happy and there was no drama over it.  
---
On the other hand, in my first raiding guild the GMs wife was a priest. He just funneled all of the best drops to her first even though she was not the best healer and did not need the upgrades. There was a ton of drama among the priests. It's the main reason I quit that guild and the main reason they never progressed past BWL. Loot council is a reflection of the people running the guild. When done properly, it is the best way to distribute loot.
---
I need someone to make a BiS list for each class at level 5, thanks
---
Onyxia is pretty hard when half the raid have 10 FPS.
---
Not a bug. Did this all the time in Vanilla
---
Literally read the thread
---
Thats 50% of the comments
---
Just to add to this comment:
---
The maximum reckoning stacks in 1.12 is actually 4, so you get a total of 5 white swings (+damage from seal)
---
You can sit to force a crit if you time it well, you just have to stand up just as you're getting critted and the server will believe that you were standing for the forced crit.
---
[Video example here from Esfand testing it out in the beta, it's working as it did back in the days](https://youtu.be/Op9kWkI4F-I?t=339)
---
I think so yep, does it work though?
---
Will probably be doing the same. Council for legendaries too. Not going to DKP TF
---
i also feel like this sub took a rather drastic turn for the worse after the beta was released. maybe its too simple to say its jealousy from players who didnt get in. But something is up, and its almost unbearable at this point.
---
4pm PST/7pm EST
---
People would complain about it, but I doubt a vast majority of people who dumped hundreds of hours into a character would have the guts to quit them over that.
---
Just wondering if you had a source on gnomes having smaller explosions and novas, because after seeing this I went to research it and couldn’t find anything. If this is true it could help me make a decision when classic launches.
---
You'll quickly learn where all the nodes spawn, but there are also add-ons that show you all the potential nodes in the zone. It won't be able to limit to only nodes that are spawned, but its still useful.
---
Pretty sure s2 glad was recolored t5 right? And s3 was recolored t6?
---
Stress test is capped at level 5? Then I have real beta?
---
You have to remember, that while NPCs can be higher than LVL 5, players can't. So we can perfectly raid horde players if there aren't any higher level NPC's nearby.
---
Though 50+ people raiding the Goldshire mine sounds epic, too. Anything we have the time to do in 26 hours is suitable! :)
---
Might be related to your data. They invite people based on stuff like hardware speccs, internet connection etc. Getting in is actually harder if you rock common hardware, live in a big city, etc.   
---
Personally I got invited into literally every beta (so far) since 2008. My PC has always been ancient.
---
My friends and I quit that game early on becasue of various other problems with the game. We never saw any raids or knew of their difficulty.
---
Fisherman! rods at the ready on your marks get set GO!
---
Not 100% on this, but I don't think that worked. Only money alone was instant.
---
Could be the more modern Role Leader tho
---
Cool I never knew this was possible
---
None of it is popular my friend.
---
One aspect of #Nochanges i always find pretty interesting is. As I am like you and have no hard opinion either way for changes to classic or not. (Started in BC so i wouldn't notice anything anyway)
---
But all these streamers and influnecers who are heavily pushing for #Nochange have literally already changed the game themselves. 
---
Some people who complain about certain aspects being to easy are also the same people who have massive followings now with hundereds of skilled players to help them with content "thus making the game easier than it was" And i'm not saying it's their fault but i honestly believe there is no way to truly get a #nochange experience anymore.
---
Shit even look at hardware. Look at any legit video from vanilla and tell me it's anywhere close to what would be considered a quality video in todays standards. There are many aspects of the game that are going to feel a hell of a lot easier just because you're not going to be lagging. 
---
Like don't get me wrong i understand where the #nochanges comes from, with people wanting to have the same experience (at least from blizzards side) as they had back in the day, but where do we draw the line? Because no matter if Blizzard keeps everything exactly the same the game will still feel easier than it was when it was first released. If blizzard changes anything people are going to complain that it's not the same game while also whining that it is to easy. 
---
TLDR: #nochanges in a double edged sword for blizzard. While people want the game to be the exact same as it was, this inherently will make the game feel easier than people remember (Due to better PCs and Overall smarter people in todays wow as opposed to when it launched). If blizzard does do anything to change the game and make it harder, then the same people who are pro #nochanges will be the same people unhappy that the game is easier than they remember.

Like i said, i don't have a horse in this race as i was not a vanilla player, So take my opinion with a grain of salt. I will still be playing the shit out of classic though no matter how blizzard decided to release it. Honestly anything is better than the state of the game over the last 5-6 years for me. I miss the days of having to actually talk to people. And of making friends. Something i can't wait to do in classic.
---
Wait, bosses are getting an increase in debuff slots? I thought they said they were going to stay true to the original debuff limit?
---
Ok, so no more content?
---
yes, you can easily do this up to about level 50 I'd say. Once you start hitting BRD, LBRS etc...you'll find the healing tougher if you  are feral specced. Not saying it cant be done, but with a good group it'd still be tough. Make sure you have healing gear as well as your Agi/Stam gear for tanking.
---
Hah, I’ve wondered if there was a Match.com of sorts for WoW players (or gamers in general). Not necessarily in a romantic sense, just a ‘looking for a fellow gamer to play with who shares similar play time and in-game goals as myself’.
---
If you don't raid in Classic I'd advise you to gather a special stamina set for PVP so that you survive a bit longer.
---
But frankly, if you don't raid at all play on a PVE server or your life will be misery when the "big" raids are on farm.
---
Im no expert, but isnt most classes rather easy for pve?
---
It doesnt get more easy than frostmage though, rotation is; frostbolt. And blizzard for AOE.
---
If the stress test goes well and they open more realms. You probably will be among the first to get into the full beta.
---
Lowest theyve ever been just before the beta dropped..
---
30 fps is fine but my notebook is like 7-8 years old and has about 10 fps in retail which is not really playable
---
I will level a NELF druid. 
---
I want to heal in dungeons while leveling.
---
I know feral is way to go as a leveler. 
---
Should i even care about resto talents or just go feral and heal?
---
I can confirm there's spell queuing.
---
[This site](https://willitclassic.com/) details all addons currently either working in the Classic Beta build, planned to have a working Classic version, and ones that have no info on their status yet.
---
Will try this, thanks
---
Always a great listen Josh. Thanks for it all 🙏
---
My account has too many red flags 🚩 to get into the beta. I’ve been banned multiple times for bottling and economic exploits so I’m just chilling till Aug.
---
There are some reasonably priced laptops with Ryzen CPUs nowadays. Pretty sure they can handle Classic very well. (Ryzen has better built-in graphics)
---
If I could run the game on a Dell Inspiron 1501 back in 2006, I'm pretty sure it'll work on modern hardware :P
---
Warlock is def the best level 5 class
---
You guys are just wrong though... There have been a lot of [comments like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/eobg1d9/) on this subreddit. The poster obviously thinks that the private server data is completely accurate.
---
I don't think you would add much time with a another class maybe 5 or 6 hours.
---
However I didn't think about the XP loss if you lvl together in the same group.
---
I think you would go faster by playing in the same spot but not grouped.
---
My jaw dropped whe  I saw it was o my the stress test. So troll but at the same time I'm happy I at least got into the stress test.
---
Not true, there have been a lot of [comments like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/eobg1d9/) on this subreddit.
---
Dude at least you got in lol better than having an OG vanilla account and getting invited to nothing :P
---
You only need to worry about layering for roughly the first month. They’re putting it in to help with thousands of players logging in and doing the same content at the same time. Once launch hype dies down, they’re removing it
---
In PVE, I think Mage is the most easy.
---
So not a place to discuss addons.
---
The Frist ptr Account should be from BFA? Maybe I understand it wrong.
---
Are you sure? There have been a lot of [comments like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br86ov/elite_damage_is_way_off_evidence/eobg1d9/) on this subreddit.

Darnasus -&gt; STV -&gt; silithus -&gt; double back to darnasus via kalimdor
---
JINGLE ALL THE WAY is the best movie of all time.
---
Oh my god, it all makes sense. 
---
Only beta I ever got into was WotLK. I was rocking one of the original Mac mini’s at the time.
---
Yeah but there's something about ganking people while leveling, by the time layering is gone we'll probably all be 60
---
Some healers can still farm a bit, holy priests and druids are okay despite not being optimal at mob farming.
---
I just gather and craft and play the AH. I also get a farming alt up to 60. I make sure the alt is always on an Inn and I just burn through his rested xp in my free time.
---
The issue you have is farming. You'd still need to farm to make gold. One thing that is good for healers, is being an alchemist/herber. Then you can make pots and sell them on the AH. They are always in high demand, especially when folk will all be trying to hit up MC/BWL so need consumables. 
---
Once DM is released, you can farm the Lashers, and with herbing, can help you make good gold.  
---
The other option....which is what I am considering (as I also want my main to be a resto shammy), is to level a Hunter too, and use that for farming for me. My main back in 2005-2012 was a hunter, and I could farm 500g over an evening fairly easily. (mindnumbingly boring - but doable).
---
I was thinking if perhaps I actually do some bug reporting and leave positive feedback that maybe just maybe I'll get into the beta at some point.
---
Do you remember your rough leveling build and how often you would tank/dps/heal?
---
Same. I'm going to grab some add-ons for instances like aggro trackers and atlas loot, I'll get equip compare but that's it until I start hitting raids and need to grab some add on for that.
---
None for maps or quest markers though, I've played to many games the past 10 years where questing boils down to follow this line on the map and kill these guys.
---
Yes you are right, i was a hard victim to this bad wording but i bet many more are with me.
---
Well that can't be. Only true elite gamers like me were able to defeat the first boss of Deadmines.
---
I didn't even get an e-mail, lol.
---
Yes but I did previously and both are still labeled PTR
---
Steam is more a game store front and library, but has features like streaming to another device like a laptop or phone.
---
These links will get you started.

Also here is a quick video I found showing the latency for streaming. This looks about what I experience.
---

---
Classic wow is a streamer game
---
go full feral at leat up to level 30 when you will have travel form.  
---
Level 22 you will have 30% movement speed bonus in cat form, this is a huge buff for leveling.
---
It's okay it's just reddit karma nothing to make a fuss about
---
This gnome only guild wouldn't happen to have been.... MannorocDown.. would it?
---
I encountered about 25 gnomes on their way to hogger a looooong time ago, constantly jumping and yelling "Manno down!!" lol.
---
The problem with BM is your pet will not scale as you progress at all. Whereas MM and SV have talents that improve your your scaling abilities, mainly your autoshots, Aimed shot and Multi shot.
---
Probably nothing to do with the fact that hes completely out of bounds
---
&gt; which is just pathetic low.
---
yeah, like damage was in vanilla...
---
Just a stress test invite, what happens when you load it up?
---
From what I've seen of private servers, warlocks will be heavily played 1-30 because everybody seems to think the same things you do, then rapidly fall off in population for the rest of the game as people realize that SB spam suck and they don't like dealing with pet micro, soul shards, and a slower dottier play style. 
---
Meanwhile back in reality:
---
- Locks are the weakest of the pure dps classes (other than hunters). Mages still beat them once converting to fire, it's only odd on dps charts due to how rolling ignights work
---
- Good in solo pvp, except anybody can run away from them, and pretty mediocre in group pvp unless specced for max burst
---
- Tanky as hell at the expensive of much of their ability to do damage, or they can spec damage and have all the vulnerability of a mage without the mobility
---
- Easily one of the most fun classes to level if you enjoy the play style, however not everybody does, some people like to see the big numbers.
---
- 3 locks for raid buffs, and even then the 3rd lock's buff is just buffing the locks, so it's debatable if you should use it unless you have an abundance of locks.
---
I absolutely LOVE the warlock class, but this notion that their this do-everything god-tier class has to go.
---
Feral talents, but switch to a cloth/leather healing set with Intellect/Spirit and you'll be fine till raids.
---
Many people are actually arguing that it's accurate...
---
You know you cant put loot in your quiver right :P ?
---
Please tell me you were not NOT using a quiver.
---
Gondor calls for aid! Thoughts and prayers for Gondor.
---
I legit thought I would get blacklisted from all future betas and such because I signed up for the 1 year deal with the tyraels charger and free Reaper of Souls, but ended up cancelling my sub a couple months in when I lost interest in whatever expansion was out.  
---
    
---
I got in on the first EU wave tho.  
---
I also don't think I'm in the high tier when it comes to sub time even though I started in 2006 cos I let my sub lapse so many times and for long, too.  
---
So my theory is that what matters the most is the amount of $$$ you've spent on your Bnet account, cos that's the only thing I think I'd be on the high end of.  
---
Or it's just sheer dumb luck /shrug
---
You should level as feral, and keep a "healing" stuff for dungeons.  
---

I ran th 1.12.1 cleint (pserver) on my notebook fine. But retail does have about 10 fps so I guess it will not work with classic either at it is the same engine

system&gt;sound&gt;sound in background
---
What do you mean? The stress test hasn’t started yet and won’t start until like 9 hours from now.
---
[The only classic I have](https://i.imgur.com/aSm1mKV.jpg)
---
Lol..I raised her as a single father too. I got lucky. I got into stock trading in the late 90’s, did well during the dot com era, opened a restaurant in 2000, and sold it a few years later, took a good bit of time off and then got back into the market after the economy collapsed. I didn’t get rich by any means , but I made enough to keep from working outside the home. Thank you Etrade.
---
And believe me..I’ve heard the “I hate you” thing plenty..haha. We’ve have an amazing relationship though (and always have really).
---
Yeah I did check this AM which is a 12 hour difference from email but nothing.  I'd love to get in on the stress test itself but even just playing in the next 48bhours would be great
---
And when you crit it hits harder.
---
Yeah, never played any other way. Easily doable, and while I can't strictly speak for WoW, I personally find playing without waypoints and such a lot more enjoyable in video games in general, assuming that the game is actually designed with this in mind. WoW is such a game, and there's plenty of information given out in almost every quest so you can figure out where to go yourself. And if you're struggling, you can just ask the other players.
---
Do you enjoy navigation/exploration based gameplay challenges? Do you enjoy more immersive gameplay? Do you plan to take your time questing and enjoy the journey to 60 rather than rushing through it as fast as possible? You'll enjoy Classic WoW without add-ons.
---
I wish I had friends to play with, none of my online friends or irl friends are interested so I’m trying to find 1-2 people to group with before the game comes out :(
---
I’m stuck. 
---
My main focus will be PVP for sure, that being said I never played Vanilla. I was a BC baby, played up until second patch in Cata. My main was a Ret Pally then a H Pally, so I don’t want to go Paladin again. But I do like the idea of a hybrid class, I like the ability to heal myself and hold my own in a 1v1. So since I’ll be playing Horde like always, I’m thinking Priest, Shaman, Druid are my options. 
---
I don’t mind having to heal in PvE, I just don’t want to be a heal bot in PVP. I’ve played Druid the most out of the three above mentioned classes in BC, but I’ve heard Druid is the weakest of the three in Vanilla. Any input would be much appreciated, thank you.
---
Agree with OP here that the classic was both the game and the experience. (The experience can be divided to the community as vanilla was the noobie mmo=lots of new mmo players, the world, the skills, loot drops, dungeons, boss mechanics, classes, dungeon comps and so on)
---
What we are getting now is the easier bit, the same game with same values. What is missing is the discovery and mystery.
---
To get the same experience of discovery we would have to change the game which could go wrong in all kinds of ways. (One version of chasing that unknown that I've suggested, as a tought experiment, is suffling the loot drops from bosses in dungeons. ) Still no matter how many changes we make we would not get that same wonder of discovery and fear of unknow because for all of that we would need a whole new game, making it not wow classic.
---
So for me vanilla is both the content and the experience but recreating the content is more important as it's easier to create.
---
Cool thanks for the answer, so that burst/one shot was actually a thing and not just a rumor/fantasy?
---
Seriously?  You think they need a full time person to click a few links a week that people from those few servers send in?  You've certainly never run a successful business with that model.
---
You might think there only a few hundred, I think there are more.  Plenty of people don't want to have to deal with someone who is trying to make a living out of the game we play for fun.  If you enjoy it, more power to you, but plenty of us don't want to have to deal with all the headaches that come with it.
---
More than enough content in Classic for me.
---
I’d rather see at least tbc servers and possibly Wrath servers.
---
That’s a good 4-6 years of development.
---
After that or if say tbc re-release fails then I think you can consider future development of classic content.
---
Right but now I'm also a hero because I saved people from having to shift click my name.
---
It doesn't make sense to automatically dismiss any claim based on pserver data.
---
It's just "baited." No need to add "ja" to the beginning of it.
---
I'm with you here on these. I took off warlock and Hunter since my two friends are playing those classes. Leaving me with mage and rogue. Having a blast playing a rogue right now. Not having to drink for Mana is very nice. Although mages have the advantage of teleports and free food. Ugh it's so hard to pick!
---
Haven't received an email in \~16h as well even tho I'm in the stress test according to my launcher.
---
Ok, you've got me cackling like a madman at work right now!
---
well it definitely cant hurt so i was planning on doing the same. leaving valuable feedback on a game (especially since we only have access to it for a limited amount of time) may indicate to blizz that you're worth inviting soon because we really take the testing part seriously.
---
I would still go for warrior, and during leveling off tank.
---
Haha a few links... right.  No, it’s going to be thousands of links because that’s what any community driven thing will generate in a game this size.  Look at the number of people reporting “bugs” thus far that aren’t bugs.
---
Same here, EU got the beta and stress but no e-mail
---
Mostly just the icc ones.  Though you'd always end up with just the tank snd the healer slowly killing loken because they simply cannot understand the dance.
---
sus and toxic
---
I'm having a tough time picking a class but I have a pretty good idea of what I want to be able to do. Please help lol
---
Things I want:
---
Self sustain ( I absolutely hate having no way to keep myself alive when pvping, used to main a dk since wrath)
---
Good at pvp (hold my own in solo wpvp and have impact in group pvp through healing or dps). I just want to feel like I can turn the fight if I play well enough. 
---
I want people to want to bring me to whatever is going on (obviously my skill will have a large impact on this but you know what I mean hopefully) 
---
ATM I'm thinking priest. Rez is super cool, good self sustain, shadow seems like good damage in pvp while also being able to spec heals and try to carry a fight. 
---
I'm also considering mage because the burst is too much fun. I enjoyed the small 1-12 on a pserver I did. No self sustain which is a big bummer. Also I fear they will be over populated and that's kind of annoying. 
---
Maybe shaman? I've never considered one and it seems the totem management and keybinds seems overwhelming. 
---
I enjoyed druid alot but the no Rez (combat Rez doesn't count in my mind) and innervate bit talk scares me away.
---
Thoughts?
---
Got access to the stress test today! Im EU (CET) and this test will starter pretty late for me... so sadly I cant play...even after actually get permission D: fml    
---
\- Why so late for EU?... is this NA servers they test first?
---
I absolutely love warrior. For me it's the class with the most style and best gameplay feeling.
---
That's why i want to play one. I don't mind getting cc'd most of the time.
---
On the other hand warlock and especially hunter with all the petmechanics look fantastic (i also played them as twinks in vanilla).
---
I'm sure i won't have enough time to level multiple characters simultaneously so i need to choose one.
---
I've always regretted playing shaman first in vanilla and not warrior.
---
With my shaman I've raided till the first few bosses of naxx.
---
My warrior only got to mc/bwl/zg/aq20.
---
As I said I'd really like to play warlock and hunter too, but i'm "scared" i'm regretting it again this time.
---
God damnit! Life's not easy :D
---
Id like some input on what to play. My main focus is PvP.
---
I started back in BC, played mage, i liked kiting and owning melee. Teleporting to citys was great!
---
I was always jelous at warlocks and hunters though.
---
However i played both on retail but didnt really like hunters, but Warlocks are fun, and im kinda bored with mage after all theese years.
---
Should i go for warlock? Anyone have any pros and cons? I dont mind farming soulshards.. and class quests seem cool.
---
What are some classes that hard counters Warlock in 1v1? Will rogues and warriors plough through me?
---
Is the Warlock life in classic harder then it seems?
---
I don't aim to be the best at pvp or pve, i just want to have fun, but also be able to win :)
---
This was satisfying. :)
---
You also have to feed your pet regularly to keep it happy.
---
I don't think you will have that much trouble raiding as a hunter, you're still a RDPS after all. I regularly see guilds recruiting them on private servers. Maybe just focus on actually being a really good hunter, those are always wanted.
---
Yep...like half the thread is "no...no it's the original data that's wrong"
---
You need a sub to be invited to the stress tests as well or just regular beta?
---
Lmao no way. That’s amazing.
---
Got one as well
---
I think most people just want to play Classic WoW.  I like new things to, but I just want classic to be classic. 
---
I'd rather classic just stay classic, maybe we'll get a TBC server one day,  but I hope classic stays exactly the way it is
---
Classic is a recreation of 2006 World of Warcraft. This is a fact and not an opinion...
---
Fucking shadow lab rogue mobs .  always showed up at the worst time.
---
I’m in the same boat I want to play hunter but I want to focus in raiding. Some many downsides to playing hunter. I feel the leveling experience will be extremely fun but then will be stuck having to deal with the bad parts of the class. Can’t even use pets in raids from what I hear.
---
just came home from work, did i miss the stress test? i downloaded it and the realm is down :(
---
Jakes on you, I bought my wife her own PC so we can game together. Then, since she's a flithy casual, I can play my Forsaken Rogue on a PvP server when she's burnt out!
---
There are changes between Vanilla and Classic. Client works differently (internet protocol, graphics) and no progressive itemization/class/battleground changes.
---
Can't decide between Mage and Hunter. Looking to do it all: raiding, dungeons, world PvP, BGs.
---
My understanding is that Mages generally do better damage and bring more utility to PvE scene. Raids and dungeons would probably prefer to bring a mage over a hunter. Both of these classes seem to be popular ones. Am I going to have trouble getting into groups regardless of what I pick?
---
In PvP, it seems that both classes can excel and have a high skill ceiling. Is either class less gear dependent than the other?
---
Thanks for any insight!
---
I'd venture to say say the majority of the playerbase has probably around 1/10th the latency they had back then also which makes a huge difference.
---
“DoNt UpVoTe” fuck off, upvoted!
---
You're under the assumption that the class design wasn't fun.  The RPG aspect of the class design back then compared to today is what made it fun.
---
Also, just because some specs weren't viable in high-end PvE content, doesn't mean those specs didn't have use.  They might be leveling, PvP, or 5-mans, but they did have use.  There's only one or two specs that were really in the dumps.
---
1-button rotations were only an issue in high-end raids.  You used a lot more buttons in every other aspects of the game.
---
I feel ashamed :P
---
I got the email late last night for the stress test and under my account settings it says WoW(5) Legion test realm
---
Are you just karma whoring or not aware of private servers that are pretty much identical to classic, at least for first 30 levels. just go play on one and stop spamming.
---
Yes but they are the best class for farming
---
Even then it's debatable, Lock is among a mages worst matchups, but Mage has the better matchup spread overall.
---
You got yourself a nice hole in the Market there. You could be rich.
---
I disagree.  Flying was great in TBC and Wrath, it's Cata when it went off the deep end.
---
I also don't think "welfare epics" were a problem until much later.
---
I didn’t read the email
---
I just want to play Vanilla. That's all. Thanks!
---
If a player isn't close enough for the greater blessing or they click it off, they get nothing.
---
I don't care to argue, I'm just giving my situation. Take it or leave it.
---
Hunters are needed in raids and are solid DPS.  A really great Hunter is invaluable to raids and groups for pulling etc.
---
Below guy is right tho...hunters are very popular and there will be a thousand of them.
---
That's still tankable. And the swoops we're talking about aren't stacked close enough to get more than 2.
---
New zones in kalimdor/east kingdom is fine. New continent is anti-vanilla and should be downvoted to hell.
---
Wow wtf 😅
---
I didn't say that it did? Also, completely off topic...
---
From the person I was responding to:
---
&gt;Everyone already knew private server data was wrong, was there ever a question of this?
---
I simply linked to a post where someone was questioning whether or not private server data was wrong.
---
Its a natural consequence of using the modern client and macro API - I don't see them nerfing it at all.
---
fckn aussies
---
Mines says Beta &amp; Stress test but when I log in it’s only the stress test server lol
---
Tricky since the only proper tank is the warrior, got way better with the tbc-patch (could go feral, tankasdin too then).
---
Druid is probably the most powerfull class in solo pvp.  
---
You are the best flag carrier in Warsong.
---
You can use invisibility to tag &amp; protect flags in Arathi.  
---
In Pvp Outdoor, you can chase &amp; hunt, but cannot be chased.
---
I'd suggest Kala. He's an old HoTS streamer, totally recommended.
---
There are probably tons but I have been watching Defcamp, he's playing UD
---
Not in the beta or anything, but I imagine you would be able to select the live beta servers when you logged in, as opposed to only the stress test server.
---
That's the entire point. It starts when there's a low amount of players and lasts 24 hours, so that they can see how far they can go in a cycle. What's the point of doing a stress test at the evening when the moment you put on the server it immediately crashes because of all the logins?
---
Yeah, only special buffs like weapon stones or flasks persist through death
---
Somehow you missed the point where it would only a few servers and and not the whole game.  So lets say 3 servers at 3k per server.  Yeh, I'm sure 9k people are going to be sending in "thousands of links" a week.
---
He actually wished him and his family a good start for 2019... in May :D
---
Hey I member dying like this
---
I'd like to see horizontal progression down the road, bit I'll worry about that in a couple years.
---
Add-ons solve that problem
---
Oh then it's probably yhe stress test invite, thanks. I haven't gotten an email yet though
---
this is just messed up. they should send you one just for the fact that this happened.
---
you guys aren’t ambitious enough. 4-6yrs of development??? the game is already developed 
---
honestly i logged into my main from Wotlk last week and was very disappointed. the UI and maps and everything just look SO old. they didn’t improve anything in the 10 years i stopped playing and just added a bunch of terrible “QoL” features. 
---
we should be asking them to make a new Azeroth completely in that 6 year window
---
This would have made a fantastic April Fools blue post. Still great!
---
If the stats are the same then the items are not better or worse...
---
I didnt get the email but can see the stress test download on bnet client.
---
Classic uses old models, textures and spell effects, but with modern resolution and post-processing options. It also has options for modern lighting, modern water and higher "ground clutter" density (tall grass, flowers, etc.)
---
The options menus also all use the modern look, rather than the old fullscreen parchment textures, if you care about that.
---
It is incredibly fun. You have so much utility from your totems and purge, however it is outclassed by just about everything in group PvP. 
---
You will be kited around for days, and against a warrior or a rogue with seemingly on demand damage, you will sit there and pull the slot machine lever waiting for windfury to save you. 
---
The one nice thing is that tremor totem and grounding totem are amazing... it just feels bad knowing that a resto or ele could bring them to a BG and be infinitely more useful.
---
So to sum it up: tons of fun and utility with the occasional one shot on low armor targets with the trade off being that the other two specs/builds are flat out way better in PvP. Also prepare to get stomped by hunters who will mana burn and kite you all day.
---
Is it fun? From my experience not really. You can make it work so if you enjoy being a special little snowflake I guess it's for you. Otherwise it isn't work the effort and there's other classes that are a lot more fun.
---
Thanks for being the only person backing this point up with a fleshed out argument.
---
Vanilla hit like 6-7 million concurrent users by the end, so there are probably like 10m+ people with vanilla accounts.  
---
That's more people than live in my country, and even if the vast majority of invites go out to old account holders and most accounts are inactive/abandoned, there are still so goddamn many of us that the chances of getting in are super slim, at least early on.
---
Vocal minority forsure but acting like it isn't happening is just silly
---
That’s fair but who is Jake... and why is he on me??
---
In vanilla, whenever we would get a pug in a BG from Earthen Ring, we'd make them repeat whatever they said in RP form.
---
"SAY IT IN RP!"
---
watching streamers is just as aggressively autistic as being one
---
You clearly don't know how invested some people can get in MMOs. WoW can really consume all of your free time in ways that other games just can't. If you start doing raiding(3-4 hour commitments) 3 or 4 days a week any spouse will feel extremely neglected, especially if this is their first time seeing them play an MMO. I know if I played today like I did when vanilla came out when I was 16 my wife would be livid with me. It goes past just a hobby for some people and becomes an actual second job. Lets say your wife wants to go and see a movie, nope raid night, go out for dinner, nope I am the main tank, can't miss this raid.
---
I like WoW classic and plan on playing it, but I know what it can do to some people and don't blame spouses that can't stand it.
---
I am starting to believe that the slippery slope is real. Here you can see people advocating for changing numbers now.
---
Leveling fishing on a stress test 😂 😂😂
---
I didn’t miss the point at all.  It’s not viable, it’s not necessary, and it’s not as big an issue as you think it is.  Streamers exist in current WoW, Final Fantasy XIV, ESO and every modern MMO or indeed game in general.  They’re not this scourge you imagine them to be.  Avoid the server Soda or Asmongold chooses and you’re fine.  Hell in BC there were servers with popular content creators like Project Lore doing fan guilds.  It was fine then and it’ll be fine now.
---
Going through a god damn existential crisis trying to figure out what class to play, maybe you all can help.
---
I’ve previously played Priest fairly heavily and I’m leaning that way now. However, it’s been a lot of Shadow in the past and I don’t want to feel forced into just one spec for classic.
---
My primary goals are going to be fun leveling experience, dungeons, wPVP, BGs, and then raids in that order. 
---
I generally want a class that has at least two competent specs so I can mix it up as I feel is needed. Doesn’t have to be able to fill multiple roles, but that would be a plus as well. My entertainment for the roles is usually Healing &gt;= DPS &gt;&gt;&gt; Tanking.
---
Some additional thoughts: I usually prefer a ranged class but am open to other play styles. Most likely will be going Alliance due to friends. I’ve worn robes through most all my WoW play time and I’m a little over wearing robes but this doesn’t make or break it for me... 
---
Any thoughts?
---
Yeah I’m leaning more towards Druid for these reasons. But I’m also considering Shammy a lot more bc is the burst potential. I assume Druid is more mana effective.
---
Learn and master the class; there will be so many bad hunters but if you can stand out, you'll be desired for certain mechanics and PvP.
---
He said he hasn't seen it since Wrath, which means that seeing the world isn't a gamble, just a bonus of having a chance at the Beta while doing so. :)
---
There's seriously at least one guy on there that refuses to believe the reference client is real and accurate.
---
The cost of respec doesn't have to be that hig mc is easy there really is no need to be optimal healing spec for it you can easily heal as 30/0/21 just tell your raid leader and he will put you in a non caster group after p2 you can respec by then you should have a decent starting pool of gold
---
While leveling and doing dungeons yes.
---
I said "There's more to life than this" and she said,
---
"I just wanna fish."
---
So your saying remake the Blood Elf zone, but actually added to the world now? Or an vanilla Gilneas?
---
Thought about warlock?
---
\- good damage
---
\- good sustain (hs, lifedrain, sacrifice)
---
\- good cc
---
\- portal, hs, stam, ... support your team
---
\- good burst as destro (i'm not to sure on that one, but it's what i remember from playing warlock the last few days/weeks of vanilla)
---
nah, it will be up later this afternoon.
---
If you're in no rush, read quest texts and explore the zone, it'll yield the same result.
---
Hi, /u/Krelle12343
---
Let's just say it's been on my mind recently
---
That's something that I have thought about a lot actually. There used to be an option to upload dxdiag info to your bnet profile, but since it was removed I worry the info I uploaded on my old HP notebook/frying pan with the 20mbps broadband is still associated with my account somehow.
---
If only I could upload an update on that with my current hardware and data speed.
---
Im at least hoping to make it through on my first toon using the base questing/map setup.  Im sure ill be tabbing out plenty to look up quests, but i really do want to make an effort to figure it out on my own.
---
On alts im sure ill get something.  My first toon i made (in Wrath) i used Carbonite from the start, so i never really experienced wow that way.
---
Its been long enough and my memory is shitty enough that i shouldnt remember *too* many of the quests, but we'll see.
---
I got permabanned a few years ago and I got in to the stress test
---
Thanks a lot for the tips !
---
Geared and skilled warriors and mages would be my two suggestions.
---
I can't decide whether to play a Shadow Priest, a Warrior Tank or a Warlock. Help.
---
Warrior tank has the upside of being needed, so if I don't like how I'm being treated in a guild, I can just leave and find another one. Shadow Priest just looks like it has options for fun cheese, plus, being needed as the guy who shadow weaves would be nice. And warlock so that other than consumables, my raid prep looks like this: Summon Succubus &gt; Sac Succubus &gt; Spam ALL of the shadow damage.
---
Pfui Deibel!
---
As a former vanilla hunter that raided, I can tell you their utility in raids / dungeons is quite good as well. Ice trap was good CC, and frost trap helped us aoe kite. The first fight of BWL is a good examole.
---
Also if you go engineering, you can pull off battle rezes with feign death + goblin jumper cables. One of my most memorable moments raiding was on Chromagus in BWL and we were wiping. I managed to pull off a Brez on a priest right before my debuffs killed me. The priest rezzed after combat was over and rezzed the raid. It literally saved our raid 20mins or so to run back, rebuff and try again. My vent chat was cheering. Fun times.

Dude,  make a friend.  You don't stop being a healer just because you're out doing world content. Find a competent warrior and make their day with some windfury totems and healing waves.  You'll be more threatening in pvp than either would alone,  with your ability to lock down casters and slow those who would try and kite your warrior. You're also not dancing around in a dress like priests,  so you're less likely to get instagibbed.
---
Damn. A streamer didn't get what he wanted. Welp, that put a damper on my day.
---
So does that make beta testers betas? Because I should’ve been invited in that case
---
Shaman sounds like a good class. I would have said Druid but your shadow priest leanings make me feel like you would enjoy melting people which druid sadly cannot do.
---
Just wanted to get an idea of the races people will be playing for the stress test. I'm gonna be alliance on any/all beta tests I take part in bug I'm not sure which race.
---
How viable would it be to pvp as a resto druid with pve talents? I want to be able to heal in bgs without spending lots of gold on respecs
---
I was so excited when I saw it :( Although mine says beta &amp; stress test.
---
You didnt get it
---
"Enough" soulshards are when you have 4 full bags of them
---
I really expected you to click through the portal, fade to black, Skyrim intro.
---
Non-existent. No one's going to be roleplaying on the beta. We roleplayers are already a small section of the playerbase - and the people playing beta right now are an even smaller section of the overall playernase.
---
Now thats an idea. are the LW BiS patterns hard to come by?
---
call me when i can support past level 5
---
breaking a ToS/EULA is illegal dumbass.
---
the problem is there are way too many people with active subs who want to play the beta. There's absolutely no reason for them to use non-subs
---
Care to elaborate on Shammy? I’ve heard Resto is great but the other specs are a bit of a mixed bag.
---
Should the email address be noreply@en.blizzard.com? no em?
---
I’m right there with you, expect I played Paladin in BC-Cata. I would think if your Horde your options are Priest, Druid and Shammy. 
---
Those are the three I’m considering and right now I’m leaning towards Druid, due to the versatility of the kit.
---
Get Engineering.
---
Time zones are hard!
---
Go to bed now or as soon as you can, sleep until the test, play until you go to work, play when you get off work until test goes down.
---
You can do it, I believe in you.
---
I think every kickstarter backer received a pdf version. At least I did receive one. But I don't think you can buy them now (a quick google search at least brought nothing up).
---
As long as there is no additional load screen to go to a new zone it’s fine with me.
---
I have the identical email and I did make it into the stress test. My guess is that OP had no game time &amp; Blizz mistakenly flagged his account. Dunno why the GM called it a 'fake.'
---
Grand Hamlet = [Darkshire](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Darkshire)
---
Oh no, I guarantee you there will be a lot of people still levelling, people levelling alts. You will be able to gank just fine.
---
The first 4 years and a half will be dedicated to getting to lvl 60 :D
---
I dont know of the movie you're thinking, but give this [archive](https://archive.org/details/@wowmoviearchive?sort=titleSorter) a whirl. It might be in there ;o
---
&gt; They could add features from TBC even such as arena.
---
No.  Just fucking no.
---
Typically the buffing is split up among all the players of that class. Four priests in a raid usually results in something like Tom buff G1/2, Eric buff G3/4, and so on. Occasionally, you may get stuck buffing someone else's group but typically, you'll be ok.
---
Hell, i seem to remember having pally power when i was playing in Wrath even.
---
But new metas come out, and we have no idea about legit proc rates and such.
---
Hanzo sword, for example, might be near Pre-BIS (and BIS for a while) for a spec I want to play. But without knowing the proc rate, who knows.
---
Nobody really documented spell gear paladin with Hanzo Sword back in the day. And true the posted item stats might be the same, but there's more than just what's written on the tin.
---
See also Ironfoe. Stats haven't changed... but is it 2% proc? 5% proc? 10% proc? 20% proc?
---
I did the same thing with Farsight back in the day. I once went north from Orgrimmar up into the mountains toward Hyjal. Eventually they stop putting effort into the mountain's, they just have a ground texture of the Redridge mountains and a basic shape. All except one. There's a mountain somewhere with the text "HELP ME" written in grass texture on top of one of the mountains waaaay beyond the player boundaries. I can't remember if it was left along the rim of Hyjal, nearer to Felwood, or right nearer to Azshara. I was standing on the bank when I started the journey, so logically I think it was right, but I feel like it was actually left.
---
Yes, they should be.
---
Classic will likely have a two year life span starting from August.
---
Granted now that they have a framework on how to bring the older expacs to the modern engine it would likely be faster but I don’t see a tbc server being released for at least two years.
---
Queue another two years for TBC, then possibly WotLK and another two before that’s finished.
---
If the remakes succeed and maintain that success to the point they are profitable I could see Blizzard beefing up staff to develop new content.
---
I just think that a lot of people are putting the cart before the horse. Let’s see how classic does first. I also think if any new classic content is created it shouldn’t be like a new expac. Classes/professions should remain unchanged and anything new should be limited to 1-60 content and serve as additional raids, dungeons or events.
---
I've considered warlock but my wife and BIL are both wanting to play warlock so I don't want to be another warlock. They are a very appealing class though and fit most of the criteria. Maybe they will change and I'll give warlock a go. Very good suggestion, thanks!
---
Another way to look at this...
---
Child: Mom, can we get Pop Tarts?
---
Mom: No, we have Pop Tarts at home.
---
Home: 'Store Brand Frosted Fruit Square Things'
---
aaa thank you.
---
atleast i got into the stress test, better then nothing
---
I cannot remember my build, no, but I would say for dungeons I tanked 50% of the time, DPS and heal both about 25% of the time, but that's because i preferred to tank. 
---
Honestly don't think too hard about it man! If you maintain the gear for feral / healing, you should be able to any roll just fine! Remember, most tank warriors level arms or fury, and tank just fine, and most healers roll their respective DPS specs and heal just fine. Druid is no different, only they have access to all three rolls while leveling.
---
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little gnome? I'll have you know I leveled top of my pride in the gentle rolling hills of Mulgore, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Southshore, and I have over 300 honorable kills. I am trained in Druid tanking and I'm the top tank in my entire guild. You are nothing to me but just another tryhard Warrior. I will not wipe a single boss with precision the likes of which has never been seen before in Azeroth, mark my fucking Taur-ahe. You think you can get away with spreading that shit about Bear tanks over the Internet? Think again, gnome. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of Undead Rogues across the Eastern Kingdoms and your Hearthstone location is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, ankle-biter. The maelstrom that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call questing. You're fucking dead, punter. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you with over seven hundred HP Ferocious Bites, and that's just with my cat form. Not only am I extensively trained in Feral Charging a Blink, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the Druid class and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of Kalimdor, you little gnome. If only you could have known what Shu’halo War Stomp your little "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have hopes for a Cursed Tonge debuff. But you couldn't, you didn't, and now you're LFM, you goddamn tryhard. I will shit Tiger's Fury all over you and you will drown in it. You're fucking dead, kiddo. For the Earth Mother.
---
In General its not really a Thing. At least not to the extend from Woltk and onwards.
---
Thats simply because of the reason, that item stats are limited. Besides the 5 main stats (stam, str, agi, int, Spirit) theres really only hit and crit on items. Sure theres some Special effects like weapon skill, haste or arp, but thats pretty rare (ARP for example as a proc from the 2h sword from rag).
---
Still there will be stat weights on how much dps increase 1% crit will give compared to 10 AP. But since theres also % values for crit and hit, its kinda more difficulty to theorycraft here.
---
It's a beta if you're RPing you're a waste of a spot.
---
My sub is currently active and has been for months now :c
---
Haha, where to even start?  
---
Ive read every single thing about classes the last few months.  
---
I have levelled most classes to like atleast 20+
---
I was so dead set on playing a mage, its what I wanna do in world pvp. sprint teleport in to initiate and blow up raids.  
---
But then levelling and especially frostbolt spamming is so insanely boring I can barely level a mage to over level 20.  
---
But ive played hunter most of retail, and leveled it up on the end of vanilla. So thats feasible.  
---
But then again, they drop off on later tiers, and since I will play alliance there will be an endless storm of rogues making my life miserable.  
---
Ive always wanted to heal, and shadow priest roaming sounds super fun. But do I really wanna dedicate vanilla to be a healer primarily and most of the time running around in heal specc?  
---
But I cannot for the DEATH of me decide.  
---
THIS IS TOO HARD!!!! HELP!!!
---
Well my account is OG as well, but having only stress test access ain't useful.
---
Yea, EU
---
This is very good advice.
---
If the beta is anything to believe yeah. The guys running around with WW axe are 3 hitting me as a warrior with a shield on. I’m 25 not 30 but still.
---
ITT: People who didn't read the invite
---
I played pally in bc and it was by far my favorite class. Blood elf pally. I like druid alot but I'm undecided. I'm basically at those three classes just like you. Ugh choices are so hard lol!
---
Blizzard is doing work
---
That's what I said.
---
meh, one sided.
---
I’m not the best PvPer that ever existed, but I’m fully convinced that warlock is the best PvP class in the entire game when geared and specced right. You have pets for every different kind of battle, you can sacrifice the pets for great buffs, you have crowd control, AoE, and a consistent means through which to generate health and mana.
---
Obviously due to being a cloth class they should watch out for melee damage classes, and there sometimes isn’t as much you can do against a hunter who has his own pet and can mana sting you, but other than maybe druid, warlock is extremely flexible and has a lot of great tools. I think you’d really enjoy it.
---
You need to bump up your credentials.  Why would a r14 Scarab Lord want to play with you?
---
I want a 34 inch curve so bad...
---
agreed, the wording is unclear, I only got into the stress test but I didn't know that till I logged in, sad day
---
Well threat metter could be useful for raiding and there are some useful addons which are helping you with GUI visibility and your rotations. I meant questing addons, in game trackers and so on.
---
I didn’t even get invited... :(
---
Same... I was like: “awwww shit I got into Classic BETA!” ... Immediately followed by major disappointment and depression.
---
Well with skinning hes back on the Problem having to kill adds as healer.
---
uhh wut? Raiding guilds couldn't even get enough people attuned to raid. Try pugging anything to get a silver for the attunement and you were fucked.
---
I mean the guy in that comment just said that we shouldn't dismiss p server data simply because it's p server in so many words. I don't think they meant to imply that all p server data is accurate.
---
i have 2 ptr accounts one is regular one other one is classic beta...
---
How do you know if you've been invited? Email?
---
I would say don't get fooled by prot warrior being "needed", warrior is most likely going to be the most played class after release so the competition for pve spots will be really high.
---
As for SH priest I don't have enough knowledge to justify that choice but from what I've heard it's a good middle ground spec in classic.
---
Warlocks as far as I know deal very considerable dps and a few is always welcome in raids groups and they perform decently in PvP. I would assume the gear competition would be slightly high because mage being the preferable dps they might get privilege there.
---
I'll bring my axe.
---
No matter what you decide, remember that this is a beautiful problem to have. Classic is coming and we can all fret over what class we're going to pick, just like we did back then.
---
Yeah in the case of a priest that wants to farm and heal I'd say spec holy wand/damage until like UBRS, and at UBRS go full holy then don't switch back. 
---
But once you get your epic mount, if you have enough, go for it, it's the best "fun" investment, but it's a pure money loss so take care about it. In 3 years I did respec like 15 times at most I think, sometimes was a mistake.
---
If you wanna go Engi, just get mining as second Profession.
---
Mining is the most cancerous gathering Profession to Level, but its good to make Money later on.
---
Yes. It is very similar to BFA style macros and not like 1.12 macros which were horrible.
---
In TBC, I played the game when addons existed but without it. I am rather asking about your point of view doing it now.
---
Are these in order of level? Kind of seems that way.
---
What addon is it?
---
In other words, the odds of me getting Thunderfury to tank with are low at best
---
Druid’s have more ability to sustain their mana (innervate creams mana tide, also natural 15% regen talent) and they tend to have higher mana pools as they don’t need to distribute their stats across as many categories as Shaman do. That being said, constant shifting can make you go OOM just as fast as slamming 80 totems and burning all your cool downs as shaman.
---
Druid’s basically have to choose between what task they need to do at any one time, Shaman can drop a windfury and start slamming people with their axes while also using their mana solely for interrupts or healing. It’s a very different dynamic.
---
I'm talking about drop rates in a 40-man guild. Took me about 10 months as a co-raid leader/mage captain just to get full Tier 1.
---
Don't forget about the old launcher as well
---
they literally have way too many potential testers
---
I think if your going to want to play a melee hybrid Druid would be the one to go with, Heart of the Wild Spec.
---
If you want more burst potential I’d say go Ele/Resto, but I heard they OOM quickly without the right gear.
---
I saw that.   So many hours without beta T_T.
---
meh locks are fine after ZG patch cuz of that sweet Bloodvine set. Will probably be higher dps earlier in Classic due to 1.12 itemization as well.
---
200Iq strat
---
Is there a way to get this now? Or do I wait until it’s released on amazon or wherever
---
I would give it a shot. 
---
I would have to level from 1 to 60 without boas and we shouldn't use new gear, only original gear from vanilla.
---

Dont forget to equip your main weapon after fishing!
---
That’s what I’m saying.
---
This was my situation at the end of Vanilla : I was on a PVP server but only with blue gear. It sucked.
---
Okay if you want my hyperbole translated into real life, then here is how it's actually going to happen. The streamer's bloated guild of orbiters and paypigs will constantly be farming Un'goro, basically putting a total monopoly on high level crafting materials. That means you are paying the streamer exorbitant rates for pots and BiS crafted gear. Your guild will not be able to compete with the streamer's guild on progression. Once you fall behind you will never be able to catch up because the streamer guild will just have more consumables and gold.
---
You did not mention druid, is there a reason?
---
I guess other classes have better burst and damage, but you got all of the mentioned aspects.
---
You can hot yourself and switch to bearform for sustain, root someone as cc, can heal/buff as support, can deal decent damage.
---
Only thing is druid is always referenced as "Jack of all trades, master of none".
---
That said i've never really played druid myself at 60 (tho i remember leveling one to around 50 as feral/cat and enjoying it)
---
I did the twink, both at level 19, 29 and 39.
---
My absolute favorite was my 39 warrior. With full scarlet set, enchants across the board and the blue 2 handed sword that throws shadow balls, he was near unstoppable lol.
---
I will be twinkling it up again, for sure!
---
You spawn outside of it now
---
Yeah, my main goal is to play game how it was meant to be played. Doing quests, taking my time reading them and trying to finish everything in every instance. I did that once and enjoyed hell lot more than strictly rushing to 60. I am always kinda confused where to go when level zones split though but turning map off and not looking for anything in the internet could be fun way to go and definitely very satisfying.
---
I got into the stress test but it says "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic" unlike OPs picture which only says "Stress Test".
---
Does that mean I can play on beta servers as well?
---
Are people really debating the difficulty of the encounter? It's always been easy when taking the slow approach with CC. The problem in 2004 and 2005 were people mindlessly aggro packs of mobs.
---
Is 2 years worth of content not good enough?
---
Pro:  
---
Easy to level  
---
Decent DPS pre-bwl  
---
Good DPS pre-AQ  
---
Godly DPS post-AQ (Overshadowed badly by only mages abusing ignite)  
---
All demons useful in some way (Imp blood pact, succubus seduction, felhunter interrupt, infernal/doomguard great for trolling)  
---
Soulstones  
---
Healthstones  
---
Summoning  
---
Multiple raid spots open to Warlocks  
---
Not very gear dependent for leveling  
---
Easy multi-pulls  
---
"OH SHI-" buttons galore (Coil, howl, fear, healthstone, seduction, etc.)  
---
Banish is useful af (A lot of people forget this)  
---
PvP Gods (warlock pvp gear has disproportionately high stamina)   
---
Life tap (No mana problems)  
---
Multiple viable specs for PvP   
---
Multiple viable leveling specs  
---
Free mount at 40  
---
Somewhat discounted mount at 60  
---
Good/Excellent farmers  
---
Multiple Warlocks buff one another (Improved shadow bolt)  
---
Enslave demon is funny in some dungeons  
---
Cons:  
---
Soul Shards  
---
Shadow Priest debuff needed to help DPS (Shouldn't be an issue with 16 debuff slots)  
---
Handing out healthstones to people who literally don't use them is a pain in the ass  
---
Alliance players will struggle in world pvp due to WotF  
---
One button rotation in PvE (You literally spam shadow bolt in raids, might be allowed to keep corruption up depending on raid makeup)  
---
General ignorance about the class (Lots of people simply do not realize how much warlocks scale when AQ rolls around)
---
&gt; What are some classes that hard counters Warlock in 1v1? Will rogues and warriors plough through me? I 
---
None as the proper spec(s). Seriously. Rogues are your biggest threat because of the stuns. (Play an orc ;\] ) Warriors seem scary because of berserker rage but coil is not a fear... So I just horrify them through it and run away while my pet keeps them in combat to avoid getting charged. Once intercept and berserker rage are blown it is a matter of simply kiting away from the warrior while they slowly erode, doing your best to keep them in combat. Obviously an overly geared warrior might get a couple of lucky crits and kill you but this is the case with a few different classes. Long as you got your voidwalker up (Which in world pvp you usually will) you can just sacrifice and live through it. Keep in mind you can do this twice as SL due to fel domination. That is a lot of absorb. Warriors also have a pretty nasty deadzone at 6-8m where they cannot charge/intercept or auto attack you. If you can abuse this you will almost never lose to a warrior.
---
Hunters can be annoying if they drain your mana, but generally not an issue. If they get a frost trap off and reset the fight you may be in trouble. 
---
I have run siphon life/ruin, soul link, and conflag specs. They all have their own merits in pvp.
---
All in all, warlocks are gods of 1v1 and still very good in organized pvp.
---
You realize as soon as Dire Maul comes out it's going to be VC. An even higher proportion of players will be ready for DM vs. Still in westfall compared to classic.
---
Delete this right now.
---
im not a raid leader or a warlock but from my experience usually you assign Curse of Reck/Elements/Shadows and then other then those curses that one lock will use each youre pretty much going to shadowbolt spam and sometimes banish a target(Rank 1 PLZ)  AFAIK corruption/agony/immolate are never really used in 40 man content.
---
No.  
---
They will be stronger
---
I'm getting Lord of the Rings vibes from it.
---
Alright thanks for the feedback. I assume Ele/Resto is the most impactful spec for PvP for a shammy. 
---
Druid is intriguing tho, the heart of the wild specs I’ve seen seen interesting, and I’ve watched some Stormx, his  laser chicken build is pretty cool to watch.
---
Hi, /u/Wolfy04
---
I think my neck hurts just thinking about this
---
Hey, at least I can launch a Classic client and rewatch the Cinematic again. I spent like half hour just listening to login music. I didn't want to even turn on BfA client after that again.
---
Only with gear, i say you need BWL or AQ gear to actually shine as a warrior...
---
lv 30 means nothing, most classes suck until lv 41+
---
Unfortunately this ruins the economy of the TBC servers. Even if you only allow a character to be copied once, by passing around items and gold a group of friends can end up with tens or even hundreds of thousands of gold _each_.
---
literally how is this "lazy" ?
---
how do you know that you got both ? did you had beta before already ?
---
Yeah but i didnt even consider someone wants to play BFA :)
---
Yeah, I am thinking I will just roll on a PvE server instead. I’m remembering just how stressful life was until I rerolled a Druid and was able to just stealth everywhere.
---
Excellent. Thanks!
---
Every class has those types of quests. Warriors get stances, Shamans get totems, etc.  Think mage is the only one that doesn't get class abilities, or the ability to use their abilities (Shamans can train totems but can't use them until they do the quest and get the actual totem).
---
That doesn't make the advice given any worse, the solution to getting money to afford to play the game is not make the game not playable.
---
I didn't watch the video, but I think he used hamstring kiting : slow the mob with hamstring and only when your weapon is ready to hit you come back to hit the mob. The mob hits you 2 or 3 times less.
---
To be fair, that's mostly because the Whirlwind Axe is an insane weapon that can legit last until around level 50. The fact that it's possible to obtain at 30 is kinda an anomaly.
---
I noticed the layering talk has mostly died down afterof the first couple of days post-announcement. 
---
I would bet no one gives a shit after the game actually launches.
---
The problem with early druid healing is that resto talents just don’t move the needle almost at all. Considering you should always get 1 point in auto root, you’ll basically be level 25-30 before you really start improving your healing as a pure resto talent build.
---
You’re better off leveling feral but finding and keeping as much +int gear as you can get your claws on. Early dungeons don’t reward mana efficiency or plus heals, they reward sweet delicious mana pools followed by some mage juice.
---
I’d progress down the feral tree in the beginning and maybe once you get close to level 40 then reconsider as you’ll be able to do longer dungeons and use a bit more skill and ingenuity than what is available early on.
---
Should be fine.
---
There shouldn't be much of a difference between the Resto PvE and PvP specs, both are probably 35+ points deep in Resto. Nature's Grasp is probably the only difference and while it's a great skill, it's not utterly game breaking.
---
Maybe some of you are from my home town of blackcock and remember what we used to do to Argent Dawn every time our server crashed. All because of one little antagonistic forum post they received  the glorious Ironforge gnome moshpit &amp; gnome centipede, until they too had their server crashed. Many laughs were had, still not sorry either.
---
You don't need reputation to buy your own race's mounts.
---
armor, and superior defense gives you more chance to dodge / parry / block etc
---
I'm more hyped for it than logging into BfA again, so there's that.
---
&gt;Delete this propaganda.
---
[This documentary proves otherwise :p](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7jZGs-1CsLo)
---
Ok wait I also got this email and also don't have an invite on bnet. I'm just as confused, I'm subbed, it's to the only email account tied to blizzard of my 6+ accounts I check (don't judge), and it says the same thing. But no stress test option on bnet. Blizzard???
---
As far as I can tell VC was on a few servers but mainly eu because dire maul was already out when they got it. I never heard of VC till I played on a pserver in 2017. It’s really not hard. What crazy person doesn’t specify which side of dire maul they are running?
---
DM = Deadmines
---
DM E, W, N, T= Dire Maul
---
there will be some post about it nearing launch or post launch, I'm sure.
---
The bitterness aimed at streamers is getting better and better.
---
I would guess that the Beta realm will only be down for the 2 hours. Then both Beta and Stress servers will be up until the Stress server gets taken down the next day.
---
I played in vanilla and have been playing all of BFA. did not get a beta invite yet but I did just get a stress test invite
---
that must be why I got into the SC2 beta when I had an ancient shitbox and then never got invited to another one before BFA
---
A geared warrior is always to be feared. Other classes can beat them 1v1 pretty easily when they get equally geared and master their CC. Whereas the hunter has a deadzone in close range, the warrior has a deadzone outside of close range. You keep the warrior rooted, kited, stunned, slowed - you can take them out. 
---
A geared warrior with healer backup is a nightmare, so good luck.
---
having more people who are wrong doesn't make them all right
---
I have a feeling lots of guilds will be more laid back and realize you don't need a raid full of min/max'd characters to clear content. On private servers I had no issues with getting invites and ended up in a raiding guild clearing MC/ZG/BWL/AQ40 as a feral druid.
---
These guilds won't be cutting edge and getting world first clears, but I'd rather just have fun with a raid full of people who are playing the class/spec they want.
---
You'll have a spot.
---
I just don't get it. If people have been so excited to get into beta, then how have they not been paying attention to blue posts which then should have detailed to them exactly what was going to be happening with the stress tests?
---
I like the idea, and would follow that, but would leave that up to the individual if they want to.
---
You could like...not watch if it bothers you that badly.
---
I woke up to this email at 11pm last night and went from crazy excited to crazy disappointed. Literally the one night this week I won’t even be home, so even when they send out shitty stress test invites I can get in lmao.

Hell yea I also played Kil'Jaeden Alliance. I remember Avant Garde too!
---
Then you’re depending on someone.
---
Everybody with this issue including me had 2 ptr in their account. We fucked ourselves boys!
---
I'm 29 with a fiance and 9 month old boy, I think the world of them both but when I found out about Classic I knew there was going to be a "discussion" to be had. 
---
I have a full time Job and 4 days holiday left (after booking off other holidays throughout the year) so I was certain these needed to be used for Classic release. The main sell for me to play Classic is that my brother and I played back when we were 15/16 and its a huge nostalgia trip for us both, my brother has a really good job but no other commitments that prevent him playing so he is able to take 2 weeks off with no guilt... hence my problem.
---
After my brother starting the negotiations I finally stepped in and said my peace. To my surprise she wasn't too against the idea. Obviously after some possible issues were cleared up and some promises made (no 30th in Vegas and my soul) it was agreed. I have 3 days to play the release.
---
One of our main arguments was that I could move my PC to my bro's house so we could sit side by side like the good old days, so on the 26th I will be moving my PC down the road, grabbing some beers and waiting for Blizzard to announce Classic will be postponed a week fml.
---
Night elf. I think all allies should group up in menethil then swim to ratchet from theramore then descend on the horde in durotar! That’ll really stress the server.
---
I have never seen VC beeing used , it was always DM . Also never saw just DM for Dire Maul , and for a reason no one did the entire place and always wanted specific wing for a specific piece of gear .. w/e DM EAST , DM NORTH , DM WEST.
---
Untrue. There's such a thing as contextual clues, if you shift click someones name and they are lvl 18, they aren't asking to find a group for Dire Maul.
---
Yeah I know right? Not everyone here is a man.  My husband didn’t enjoy vanilla WOW, but I did, so most likely he will not play it.
---
Conversely, trash talk being ruined by by thin skinned individuals is something I dislike. It used to be fun banter, now it's impossible to even.jokingly insult someone without ending up with a comment like yours.
---
You could also hybrid without much issue. The raids are really not as tightly tuned as the modern day mythic ones are and with how much more skilled and knowledgeable players are, if you are a competent player you will do great in pve.
---
Apart from the actionbars (which have to be centered) I really like this concept!
---
Thanks! But all credit to Drhankeey for originally putting them together, I am just the messenger!   
---
Duplicates have been removed. Pesky singles/album releases. Thanks!
---
I was doing 40m content as offtank feral, definitely doable. My main was, and always has been, a druid so I say go with that! On the other hand, I am also having trouble deciding haha. Probably alt a warrior and main a druid.
---
Im not sure!  The wording from Blizzard is never as precise as it could be.
---
One of you should go herb/alch and one go tailor/enchanting. You'll be able to help each other. In my mind atleast AoE grinding as lock &amp; mage is close to perfect match. Think Kargoz has a few videos on the subject
---
The warrior pvp-experience will probably be very similar to what we're seeing on private servers.
---
Very weak in wpvp while leveling. 
---
Below average in solo wpvp at 60.
---
Very good in organised wpvp at 60.
---
Absolute beast in pre-mades.
---
I'm wondering what the level 5 meta is
---
I don't think you can go wrong with that.   
---
Everybody can pick up secondary professions.  Cooking and fishing will help you for regeneration purposes.  
---
Blacksmithing will give you the ability to craft some of your own gear if you please  
---
Mining will provide you with the necessary ressources for blacksmithing and something to sell at the Auction house for money.
---
If most people thought of it as fun and not a cesspool of e-shouting id agree, but youre on reddit, remember? Also, im no authority, im giving my *opinion*. From what ive seen, this "debate" does more harm than good *for most people*, due to the reason given earlier. I did not specify to who the "stfu" remark was aimed towards (and fair enough, ill grant you that one), but ill tell you now that its for the people who antagonize the opposition
---
A pragmatic addendum to my argument is that we still know so little about the game, and even less so about its future. Any answers we come up with now will have so little impact to the position most people have 2 years down the line either way
---
I honestly just want everyone to stop "shouting", and stop drumming up the "us vs them" narrate (ON BOTH SIDES)
---
This shit is the coolest! #nobeta, but I can't wait to get into the real game!
---
In vanilla a lot of people bought the Official Strategy Guide that listed all of the quests with recommended leveling routes.
---
imo Questie is not that different from having a guidebook.
---
Next you'll be polling how to pronounce "gif." :P
---
well to be fair, some people like me did not get any email and instead just saw it on the launcher
---
Not really no, not like it did at least, you can still do it to get onto some ledges and stuff but you can't climb buildings and mountains anymore
---
If you have a good set of healing gear it probably would be fine. Keep in mind that in a 5 man you are likely to have at least one other healer available (priest or Druid or even another shaman) so you can almost always take on the role of offhealer. Go get your hands bloody but keep your eye on your buddies mana bar.
---
You're more than welcome to join our guild if you plan on playing a pvp server!
---
Thanks mate massively appreciate that, I’m thinking of swapping out warlock for shadow priest, so shadow and frost mage
---
This is my similar story. Im working on building her a basic PC capable of playing casually with me now :)
---
This is a good video about which class to play in Classic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?reload=9&amp;v=3t-OsvFBiXE
---
To be honest, I have so many fond memories of Classic WoW and the excitement that came with the uniqueness of every class that it's hard to pick one.
---
I'm leaning towards Mage because they offer so much utility, damage, much needed food, buffs, and PORTALS.
---
You will always regret not making a Mage whenever you're not enjoying your current class. Because Portals.
---
We can only wait and see, i hope there is:p so i can make a troll mage to farm gold and lotuses
---
Lmfao! These groups are only for release night!
---
Absolutely not ! This is not Vanilla at all.
---
On my server it was VC. Maybe it will be a server thing
---
Totes McGoats.
---
They might say that, but I found it very hard to believe that people who actively report bugs and such don't get a higher chance of being invited into future beta's. We can already see this pattern with people who have "been in almost every beta since vanilla" etc.
---
They just don't want to admit it because people might just submit bugs for the dumbest shit and for no reasons because they think it'll get them into the beta or something. That, or people would go "this is unfair!" because people always complain.
---
Who the fuck looks for Dire Maul at level 15 - 22
---
Hahaha
---
none its not worth the actual download of the game for a lv 5 lol
---
I got mine recently, all it does is disconnect me, can't even see the realm list like some can
---
Defcamp ;)
---
I really enjoyed druid for all the reasons you mentioned but I also feel they are really hindered in a few ways. I feel the lack of a Rez is huge for a class that's supposed to be a healer. I think that's a huge minus for dungeons and wpvp. I do love alot about them otherwise. Tauren and undead are my favorite horde races so that's a plus as well.
---
They did call it a stress test...
---
I don't watch them at all, I just have watched them enough and followed the "scene" to know about whats going on and have an opinion on it. It's not like I'm going to talk shit about these guys without knowing how they are like.
---
The last bit I mentioned? ArcHud just takes your health and action/mana/rage bar and puts it in an arc or semicircle on one side of your character on the screen, and the enemy health and mana bar in another arc on the other side. Easier to see where things are at while looking right at your character. It wasn’t an especially popular add on that I know of, I don’t think I ever saw a screenshot where someone else happened to be using it. But coming from the X-Wing series of games which had something similar in the later games, I was used to it and loved it.
---
Not sure if it's the same thing you're thinking of. But HELP is written at the top of the mountain at Grim Batol in Wetlands. Someone in my chat asked me to check that out too.
---

---
for classic i want too play a class which i haven't tried before. which is either druid (boomkin) since i dont really enjoy stealth classes or walock. can someone tell me how good both of these classes are for both pve and pvp. and is farming shards on a lock really that much of a pain in the ass?
---
I mean its not rocket science, if a level 50+ person is looking for help running DM I'm pretty sure he's meaning dire maul. You and I are in the same mindset of why is this so hard to know. On my server it was DM until late bc or early wotlk then people started saying VC.
---
I love it!!
---
There is a specific button called "classic" that changes the settings to be pretty much spot on with the original. 
---
If you're using the new dynamic shadows (looks like that is the case with your SS) it changes the atmosphere of certain places quite a bit depending on the time of day. At first I disliked it because it looked different but now I think I actually prefer it in most places.
---
I actually am! I’ve had some experience playing on a big p server to 40 on a Druid but this time around I’m rolling either orc warrior or undead rogue :) I’d happily join your guild
---
This Boss hits like a wet noodle xD
---
I feel blessed. If you want to join our guild you're more than welcome, we'll be on a pvp realm. I can keep you updated the closer we get, just let me know!
---
Checking raider.io for recent Hogger kills.
---
Warriors are the most popular class but also arguably the strongest. Both as tank and fury dps they are top tier. But yes, it can be competitive getting a tank spot in 40 man raids but thats always been the case. 
---
1 tank per 5 people leveling up but then suddenly its something like 2 MTs and 2 basically dps OTs for 40 people.
---
Thats the thing tho, most new players roll hunter because its such a Faceroll class to level with
---
I've never played on a private server.
---
I did, however, get my face smashed in fighting elites all through vanilla and bc.
---
The bottom picture looks like the mangos client...not quite 'vanilla'.
---
The only crafted pre-raid bis epic that I am aware of is hide of the wild, which is actually BoE - so technically you could skip leatherworking all together I guess? Tbh a more experienced druid should chime in, I'm not 100% on your pre-raid BiS.
---
Fuck yeah!  More memes!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
Very true lol. We’ll see!
---
I'll look up the heart of the wild spec sounds interesting. I do love the burst potential of ele/resto I'll check that out as well! Thanks!
---
unless the mobs are elite or higher level, it really shouldn't be that big of an issue with a shield and heals.
---
You could try a steamlink. They're pretty cheap from Valve and they have a fairly stable framerate on their version of RDP. They definitely stream Steam games better than non steam games, but it's worth a shot for a low cost investment.
---
Yep my only one! 
---
UepYep my only obeone!
---
Does the girlfriend get a name in the morning?  Or does she have to earn it? :D
---
All this confirms is most people who voted didn't actually play vanilla
---
Frost mage
---
Nothing is given! YOU MUST EARN EVERYTHING!!! :P
---
Don't listen to this guy. Druids are super fun to level and can tank any 5 man content with ease. Of course they won't be #1 on raid meters but they bring tons of utility. Also, powershifting feral spec is capable of some pretty serious DPS.
---
&gt; TLDR: give me class that doesn’t have to respec and is top tier for pve/pvp
---
doesn't exist.
---
Sadly not.

"It’s also important to note that being invited for the Stress Test will not impact your standing for future closed beta invites."
---
Dunno if helping with stress test will affect, just for being invited doesn't affect for sure.
---
It was pretty hilarious with him opening the map for a brief moment and as he closed it they were all there in his face. I don't get the salt just because its a streamer
---
No problem.
---
The point is to improve launch, and that is worth it.
---
Same for me, i have never, ever heard DM being called VC until now.
---
It's definitely a thing, it's why it was ultimately nerfed then removed from the game.
---
Understand as an Enh Shaman, you have no defensive utility. Ranged will kite you, Rogues will stun lock you, you're extremely reliant on others for support. If you're okay with losing just about every 1v1 you're going to get into, it can be very fun in small group encounters.
---
Hm, but if you are on the beta stress test,doesn't that mean you'll also have a regular beta access after it?
---
https://old.reddit.com/r/classicwow/search?q=pve+and+pvp&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;sort=relevance&amp;t=all

I really think this was a server thing.  VC for me as well.
---
Too late. I have to get up for school in 5 in the morning and the test is in 1:00 in the night GMT+1 EU. Going now to sleep to play later but will try. Am hyped can´t say I am not hyped.
---
My server called it VC so that's what I'll say.
---
I don't disagree with your general statement, but this discussion is going to happen whether you like it or not, which is what this thread is for.
---
Reality or not, rose tinted glasses *is a thing*. Not everyone who wanted Vanilla had them on, but some definitely did. Their reasons for wanting to come back to the good old days were through a slightly different view point, but they still wanted to come back. The only difference between us and them was that we knew it was going to be easy and they thought it was going to go back to "hard" content. Many of those people wanted Nochanges too, but it's their rose tinted glasses experience that shaped their very opinion.
---
This thread tries to explore all of those opinions. You're entitled to your own, but trying to shut down a discussion isn't really going to work.
---
I think they are going to be even more powerful tbh.
---
&gt;Wow good times! Kris - Holy Paladin here :p I remember when you were prot
---
I guess the Blizzard App now secretly uploads your system specs. :P
---
This is what happens when people grow up with shows like CSI and law and order. 
---
Let me let you in of a cold hard truth. Eye witness testimony is factual evidence in US courts and people are convicted everyday based solely on witness testimony and no other evidence.
---
Can't speak much from personal experience however Balance Druid usually rates alongside Ret Paladin as the two worst specs in Classic when people discuss it. 
---
I played a Warlock from 2.4 onwards and never had too much difficulty with shards whilst levelling and as far as I'm aware that's no different in 1.12. Can't speak for endgame though
---
This entire thing is a bullshit marketing stunt to get a shit ton of people talking/hyped about getting into the beta so blizzard makes more money forcing all these people to re sub. Sadly its working, I personally know people subbing on multiple accounts just for a chance to get into the stress test/beta. Its really pathetic and blizzard is scummy for doing it, beta should be for everyone to test the game and help find bugs.
---
Shameless plug. (and no, i'm not OP)

I played Vanilla back in 2006. Only ever got to 60 like a month before TBC came out so never got to do end game which I'm super excited for. I think the furthest I got was Scholomance. You could call me a 'wrath baby'. Highest rank was 2200\~ in WotLK in rated 2s. Going to go for high ranks in pvp this time around. Feel free to drop me a follow OP.  
---
Does anyone know if you can stream private servers? Currently speed running my levels over there in prep for official release.
---
I think another wave got sent out, I just got in!
---
That sounds like a awesome idea! I wont be leveling alone much which is why I'm not afraid to go warrior ;p
---
I got the Stree Test Invite last night. I was pretty excited till I notced that the time for it was only two hours and overlapped with my commute home. I'll just wait till release, or an actual beta invite.
---
Warlocks are one of the best classes, and Boomkin is one of the worst specs in vanilla.
---
So, there's that
---
I still have my PC I built 8 years ago which I'm sure can play it. I recently built a new 1080ti rig so I can have us both set up if she goes for it.
---
Warriors are your best MT hands down. They are also one of the strongest dps in raids if you cant get a tank slot. They are also the most played class.
---
Paladins cannot tank really. The mana issues and lack of taunt kill them.
---
Feral can tank 5 mans (arguably better than warriors can). Ferals can also be OT's in raids. They cannot MT for progression.
---
MM Hunter PvP spec has like 95% of the DPS of the PvE variant. Surv hunter (viable with insane gear) uses essentially the same talents in both PvP and PvE.
---
SM/Ruin Warlock is fantastic in both PvP and PvE.
---
1/29/21 Druid is very good in PvP and good in PvE, can heal raids and fill all roles in 5 man dungeons with the same spec.
---
reminds me of my time in school where I was figuring out talent specs in my homework book rather than listening to what the teacher was saying...   
---
good times
---
I mean it does make sense, VC = VanCleef
---
Damn, I didn’t previously care about getting in the stress test. Now I want in on a level 1 raid on Hogger. Fuuuck.
---
This is the only stream I want to see. Someone set this up.
---
The shadow area in org where RFC is is so bright with the new settings
---
Because real life isnt an episode of CSI.
---
This , i have fond memories of a cerain duel with a warrior as a hunter. He was AQ/BWL gear and i was rank 6 pvp with some blues from dungeons. I won one and lost one and only lost cause he resisted my trap.  Solo you can handle them somehow even if outgeared , but if they have a healer ....
---
This sounds amazing! Can we see a pic of the 3man station when its done? Also are you guys NA or EU?
---
Does this mean it will be only available for a short time?
---
😀
---
True. Most people that have them had an army of people helping them get it. I was 34 or 35 before I finished that quest during BC. I alter a warrior back then. Paladin main since vanilla. Time for a change and I like tanking.
---
Boomkin (oomkin) is worse then feral for leveling. Its not viable in Raids. Not the best pvp spec. Would not recommend it.  
---
Warlocks are great in PVP, 1v1 kings. They are also brought to raids, they dont do that much damage early but they scale really well in the later raid tiers. Farming shards is not that big of a deal. If you have a decent guild people will show up themselves to raids, and you shouldnt have to summon.
---
I too want to hear about this. These dudes just casually name dropping underground boats as if that’s common knowledge...
---
Since it is the actual beta client couldn't everyone just go into the file and add the actual beta server in the file and it come up.... just curious
---
Human so I can kill hogger with everyone else. 
---
I will be playing horde for the actual release.
---
i believe you
---
No one in existence ever sees DM and legitimately thinks dire maul. You don’t just run “dire maul” you run a wing or a type of run. People who claim VC is the correct abbreviation are near sighted
---
100% a server thing, was always DM on my server
---
The crack within it makes it look like one of N'zoth's eyes, too.
---
I played on 3 different servers abd was the same, never heard about VC beeing a thing till i joined here on reddit.
---
I would like it if they adjusted the numbers to compensate the 1.12 itemisation, talents, classes, etc. But it's OK as it is, things might get gradually harder towards the higher levels, and then harder still as we progress through the raids.
---
It's obviously pronounced "gif"
---
Anyone who says it like "gif" can just go jump in a lake.
---
Was Ulduar a continent ?    
---
 And was kalimdor much smaller than eastern kingdom in wc3 ?    
---
can't find much about that "ulduar" island
---
But stress test, You can get level 5, might as well not bother honestly
---
EU&gt;NA or something
---
Whatever race my friends that didn’t get into the full beta are playing. I’m in the beta as a Human warrior tho.
---
Why add an extra step to the process when VC eliminates the guessing game? 
---
It’s superior and what my server (Dethecus) used in Vanilla.
---
You could just take 1 point in nature's grasp and still have a really good raiding spec.
---
Actually you can even get feral charge and be 1/11/39 and heal just fine
---
Hi, /u/FluffyMoomin
---
In the true classic spirit.
---
But I want the expansion AND to play vanilla sometimes. Why cant I just copy my character over? I only have so much free time.
---
I feel at odds with myself in a three way tug-o-war
---
* My first thought is Mage. They bring a lot to to the table in both PVP and PVE and are excellent when it comes to farming gold but they lack the depth of notable quest chains and items in the game.
---
They're just there to kick ass and chew bubblegum.

* Second being Priest which gives me access to one of the best healers in the game, Benedictus which I never got to experience as well as the monstrous Shadow spec which gave way to the term face melting. The downside being I don't look forward to having healing bars full of down ranked spells. I'm sure this is something I could get used to though.
---
* Last being the Warrior. They have access to an amazing array of weapons and armors, offer a slow burn play style where you can watch a juggernaut unravel before your eyes with each level and have three highly viable specs for PVE and PVP. The obvious downside is that Warriors are likely to be the most played class and I have to wonder how detrimental that could be for a server or even towards gearing.
---
I guess my primary concern is gold followed by dungeon/raid viability. I want to have access to the mounts as quickly as possible since that's more or less a top goal to work towards and offers a sense of prestige. 
---
Good thing I have 96 days to figure it out.
---
I think it depends on which server you played on. I hadn’t heard VC being used before I started to play on private servers. On my retail vanilla server it was always DM. Maybe it was because the server opened before Dire Maul was in the game.
---
I didn't come here to be personally attacked.
---
Dunno if it's about how you communicate; I still question whether you can just "define" a supposed vanilla end state nilly willy. If that ain't as easy as you think it is, it might be better (not easier) to solve the black box.
---
And while I've never worked with video game code, I'd still argue that, depending on the number of bandaid fixes, I'd rather figure out the black box. Especially if I'm going for longevity.
---
Regardless, neither of us is in a position to judge whether Blizzard made the right choice with their approach and we probably never will be.
---
Do you think it is possible to create addons in a private server and use them in classic?
---
And skullcrusher
---
20/0/31 aka ele resto spec is got tier when you get the gear for it. Basicly you are a strong healer with great offensive utility that can also 2 shot people with insane burst damage.
---
ACKSHUALLY!
---
Defcamp wrecking face as a priest
---
TD - The Deadmines
---
Im raiding hogger 100%
---
Blizzard have answered this. It's because the way characters spells work in BfA is much more complicated. Spells in Classic are very simple and place a far smaller load on the server.
---
1 AM -&gt; 26 hours straight -&gt; 5 AM the next day.
---
Holy cow, that would be something.
---
From what I have seen, druids can tank like 90% of bosses, and paladins are strong at tanking adds. Any of the tanks can tank dungeons, hell even shamans can tank dungeons if you don't mind focusing down mobs.
---
&gt;sible, just to be destroyed in PVP when Naxx gear comes out that I won’t have.
---
yeah, i think the imbalance of classic and needed dedication for r14 will put you off anyways. you want get anywhere near r14 if u dont invest 10h a day for \~3months
---
Grind Ret or Reck to 60, heal leveling dungeons as that spec, at 60 respec once to holy for 1g.
---
Cry yourself to sleep tonight as you level an alt hunter to farm money for your main.
---
Yes but you can continue playing to level 5 and on the stress test realm after the 2 hour window. Until Thursday. I don’t know when Thursday you have to stop but after Thursday you won’t be able to play unless you get a closed beta invite.
---
&gt; This thread tries to explore all of those opinions. You're entitled to your own, but trying to shut down a discussion isn't really going to work.
---
You’re the only one having the discussion, there’s nothing to shut down even if I wanted to, which I don’t.
---
You don't need it but you get a discount depending on how high your rep it. 20% off at exalted, I think. And you start off friendly with your own faction and neutral with others.
---
Go mining with that. You can choise to use or sell then later.
---
If you are rolling a priest. You can do lasher runs in Diremaul with holynova.
---
Okay brilliant :) I was torn between a warlock and a warrior, my first char in Vanilla was a Orc Warrior and then TBC came around and I made a Blood Elf Warlock. Both characters I have many memories with so I am definitely rolling 1 of the 2 classes for the sake of nostalgia!
---
My email was like 6 hours behind.
---
I remember doing this on my 29 twink back in the day. After watching people farm SMGY and get raids for the WW axe I was wondering if someone would be crazy enough to do the mastery quests for true BIS. Grats dude!
---
Still waiting for someone to bring Tank/Healer/3 Hunters composition and see how far can they push through dungeons. 
---
Asmon did half the library yesterday, but they had mage/warlock, and considering how caster hits is calculated, it's a chore. They can't outdps a mob that cast shield/heals itself.
---
I keep seeing this *now* but 15 years ago I don't recall any DM dead lines on any of the servers I played  OR forums.  Everyone keeps mentioning servers but even the forums called it VC in general.
---
Yeah it really depends on the spot and the time of day, some places look better and others look worse. Stormwind at dusk has these big dark brooding shadows which I really like, but other places look odd and too bright.
---
I suppose not, but I went through a zone in it's entirety w/o having to think, scour, search, google, nothing.  Just point A to point B with a GPS arrow overhead.  It's a bit much.  Having a quest list and using a coordinate add-on to do the same thing took a whole lot more effort.  In the end it's the same thing.
---
LFG in general chat and a meeting stone accomplishes the same thing as the LFD tool.  We all agree that's a bad idea though.  Questie also impacts social interaction.
---
I also said I knew my opinion wasn't a popular one, but I don't see it being much different than the other things we're all against for classic.
---
Someone hasn’t experienced accidentally pulling more than you mean to in Vanilla. 
---
You realize how easy it is to die right?
---
I think your expectations for the Classic community are wildly unrealistic if you can't handle someone being called a dumbass for acting stupid. If you genuinely can't handle this because you see it as "toxicity" and "bad culture" (????) then you have bigger social issues than what a streamer's saying in World of Warcraft
---
It isn't up to Blizzard to micromanage the community to accommodate anyone's excessively thin skin, this is just basic social interaction, it's on you if you can't cope with it
---
Certainly not top tier in either PvP or PvE, but this Warrior spec is sufficient for casual PvP, dungeons, and perhaps offtanking in a raid:
---
https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/warrior/BTzNz0DQATAD_BRA
---
If you ever wanted to get serious about either PvP or PvE though you would need to change.
---
I’m pretty sure Blizzard would not allow that and has some other access restrictions in place.
---
Can you see if Silithus is in its pre AQ state or just the later version. Thanks!
---
Add to that First Aid , and go weaponcrafting as BS , you can always sell Arcanite Reapers ...
---
Here's hoping! Haha.
---
I played from mid-TBC without a quest addon. IIRC that was before quest objectives were marked on the map. Worked fine for me. Though I do recall having a serious problem finding the ogre's picnic basket in the Hinterlands. You can play without the map I guess but I don't personally see having a map as breaking immersion.
---
my server called it VC before dire maul existed.  it's really not hard to understand how it came to be.  
---
wow was the first mmo for a ton of people and deadmines was the first instance for alliance players.  you do this whole questline about the defias that culminates in killing van cleef.  the quest says to bring van cleef's head so you look for group for van cleef, just like you did for hogger.  RFC and WC did not have a focus on one particular guy so it made sense that the actual instance became the abbreviation 100% of the time compared to the split decision for deadmines.
---
&gt; I find it to be increasingly weird they won't be specific about this and other servers.
---
They have been clear and very specific from the get go with RPPVP servers. They have stated on multipule occasions, flat out, that there will be none on launch.
---
How much more specific than a hard no do you want?
---
Sounds like you’d like retail.
---
My first impression of Druid was quite a disappointment. It’s the only class I never enjoyed. What can I do to improve my enjoyment playing Druid?
---
I feel like spelbatching made it easier for the servers to handle. So its a win/win for authenticity and server stabillity.
---
Lvl 1 hogger raid as soon as the server opens
---
so these new invites will be not connected to the first servers where all the streamers etc are playing lvl 30 chars?
---
Chuck Norris.
---
I can vouch has everything to do with spell usage.  Every night in raiding, the smooth gameplay turns into a slideshow when your raid starts AoEing a pack of trash mobs.
---
I am not offended by it, it's just not a professional way to stream by acting like you are 13 years old and just learned what insults are. Adults do not act that way. Their are some streamers that are really sincere, professional, and nice to others without acting like they have a massive epeen to prove constantly.
---
Also level scaling and ilvl scaling in pvp.
---
Im gonna get on for 5 minutes to see if i can connect alright then log haha nothing else to do but meme raid hogger or something
---
Hey guys!
---
I need help deciding between Holy priest and Holy paladin!
---
I played retail from MOP through Legion and quit early on in BFA. I mostly mained a Mistweaver and dabbled a little with priest, sham, and druid.
---
On retail i never really enjoyed anything other than Mistweaver. And i recognize that none of the healers in Classic are similar to Mstweaver.
---
So i am kind of in a dilemma, should i pick priest when i think i might not enjoy it or should i try paladin? (Im also concerned i might not enjoy palain's leveling style).
---
Tl;dr HPriest vs Hpaladin
---
My hope is that if I spend the 2 hours online during the stress test maybe they will give me the beta invite. I also just really want to be a part of the stress test so that I can enjoy the experience with everyone else. Looking forward to tonight, should be a good time.
---
I wonder if I have any photos from that time.
---
NA. I'm awhile out on completing the station. I can throw a pic when done. I have to customize heights for the wife, she's disabled.
---
so YOu can reach level 5 on stress test server? XD
---
Tempted to try this. My PC's a Q9450 quadcore on a P5Q deluxe mobo with 8gb 800mhz ddr2 - I slapped it together back in 2007 specifically to run WoW fast. It runs fallout 4 pretty decently though. 12 years strong and it's still seeing daily use as a media server, with wicked speed thanks to a simple SSD for primary OS. I'm gonna be real sad if it ever does fail... poor thing is left on practically 24/7.
---
Maybe they'll give me a shot just to see if my ol' beast could run the new WoW? Now I'd just have to find my old account info.
---
This. 
---
Kung Fu Panda was the rage when MoP came out. And the avatars were obviously designed after them. It was horrible to watch happen. People are probably right that the zone and content are good, but the class is garbage.
---
I mean I tend to agree but it isn’t impossible. Plenty of other companies juggle multiple games and produce regular content for them so it isn’t out of the question especially if they see an opportunity to increase profit
---
Starts at 1g
---
Thanks a lot for the input! Really detailed, I mean if you’ve not got that competitive edge it sounds like Druid is going to be a good class to play, I mean especially considering I am going to play as many BGs as possible chasing ranks, if I remember correctly you could pick which battleground you joined so if I’m pushing for ranks, surely flag carrying is going to be enjoyable and I can perfect it.
---
I'm going to argue for devils advocate here.
---
But this is a disingenuous statement to make.
---
They do want to play Vanilla, the difference is that their Vanilla experience was slightly different than yours due to whatever reason. Perhaps they were shitter and so the game was harder, or maybe as I said, the fact that it was a new MMO filled game where the majority was bad that shaped this.
---
They still experienced the same game as you, they still enjoy the community aspect, the longer levelling etc. The one difference is that in their mind, they remembered things being harder, and they'd like that to still be the case. You can argue that these people are "private server wannabes" or "bad retail players" as people like to state on this subreddit sometimes, but it's most likely people who were young and experienced Vanilla differently.
---
They want to play Vanilla, but their experience was slightly different when it came to mob difficulty.
---
So to answer the original question, if the values are 100% correct, would you be say you are happy with nochanges if the difficulty of the game being low regardless? That's really my question here, it's not really about what you think about the opposing opinions to your own, really.
---
Yes, this will be a special standalone stress test server AFAIK, it's currently offline and you can see it in the list if you launch the game.
---
That's your opinion.  If you like streamers you probably don't think they are that big a deal, but those of us who don't care for them do. 
---
It's easy to say "just don't roll on the servers with streamers", but that doesn't mean one can't transfer to your server, or that some new streamer takes off on your server.  
---
Live streaming is not something that was around in classic and we've seen where it can have detrimental effects to a server.  Some of us don't want to invest tons of time into a character/server and then have it ruined by some yahoo trying to make a buck.
---
I want a raptor as undead is this possible?
---
I'm sorry i realize i never answered your question. 
---
In my personal opinion i think playing without quest tracking addons or map addons will 100% increase the immersion of the game. These addons often lead to me not even caring what i'm supposed to be doing while leveling. Just click the quest accept follow the arrow, kill the things, return. 
---
While playing without it i need to know what happened. "Sir' these boars have a certain enzyme in there livers that will cure my wifes cancer, but i myself am much to weak to slay a boar. Can you retrieve 10 livers for my wife so i can spend the rest of my life with her. They are located Southwest near Old Man Placeholders Lodge...Hurry she doesn't have much time left!"
---
Now i'm thinking ohh fuck i have got to save this guys wife! Quickly to the boars! 
---
Sounds way more immersive if you ask me right?
---
I'm trying to think of which classes do well in both pve and pvp with the same spec. SM/Ruin Warlocks and Marks Hunters come to mind first. Is there anything else?
---
Why? If you want to stream then stream, don't need to ask the community for permission. Anyone watching will most likely gravitate towards popular streamers who will already be streaming it anyways
---
you called in a bomb threat?
---
but I installed WoW off of a disk...
---
It's not the same thing, but it is definitely similar. I didn't know about that one. I'm like 75% sure it was "HELP ME" and written in grass (as opposed to "HELP" in rock texture). I know for sure I did it from Orgrimmar bank.
---
Actually, I remember messing with some elf noobies in Darkshore by moving the swirling animation around. I got them to jump around and follow it. I think then I got the idea to head up toward Hyjal, so it should be on the left side. You'll know you're going the right way when the rocks have a ruddy texture, like Redridge.
---
Warlocks:
---
1. Cool class quests
---
2. Free lvl 40 mount
---
3. Much more manageable leveling experience
---
4. Able to 2v1 a lot of pvp fights
---
MM Hunter or Frost Mage.
---
If you knew the server address maybe not then you'd need a valid account key to log in
---
Actually, upvote, I had the same question and it is answered now thanks to you :)
---
It's based on the modern Client. So this is not old server info, but new info put there by Blizz.
---
The new landmasses are in fact not what ruind wow... 
---
The gameplay changes that came with each expansion ruind wow lets be very clear with that, I am talking about expanding on what is there! Not change!
---
You were about to downvote me into oblivion without understanding what i was sayn in the first place? The irony cause that is exactly the people who should get all the downvotes... I understand where you are coming from tho, we have all been burned by blizz lol
---
If they're posting in Westfall, how hard is it to understand..
---
Can’t you still skin a mob regardless of whether you tagged it?
---
Can't wait to give this a listen today!!!
---
He's off tanking a boss add then swapping to DPS and doing about the same as hunters instead of fuck all.
---
wall jumping/getting under SW / etc
---
Ele shamans are the gods of burst damage in premade PvP. If you want to delete someone in 2 global they’re your best bet.
---
Is it just me that’s thrown off at the human rogue in Elwin Forest with a map outside ironforge with a horde quest theme and horde mage spells? I am confusion.
---
Debuffs went from 8 to 16 in patch 1.7 (after BWL) which is what Classic will have for all phases.
---
Weirdness, that's good news. There seems to be a few problems with wands.
---
&gt; how much do the facials matter
---
Matters much to me, I wouldn't date someone without this trait ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
---
 Yeah, I think so too! I miss those simple days =/
---
I think it's important to point out that it's okay to just play a class that's lore and aesthetic appeals to you most on a personal level. I've always found those to be the most fulfilling to play. Every class has some role it can fill effectively. Don't get too caught up in trying to min/max your class selection because you'll psych yourself out of it again and again because some other class does something better specifically. I used to do this all the time and was constantly rerolling to the point where I never got much accomplished. Just play what you like the look and feel of and play it to the best of your ability.
---
The hype is real! https://youtu.be/KbXGxiYS6-g
---
DM, you are talking about Dire Maul?
---
stacked up on coke and red bull, let's goooooo.
---
If I told you, I wouldn't make nearly as much.
---
Me too thanks.
---
I thought we were commenting on the developers from the video and not the current devs like Ion. Yes I know Ion is a current dev but he's not one of the 3 in the video.
---
Thanks appreciate your help.
---
personally I thought the game was sweet but I just couldn't get more than 20 FPS. That's why I didn't play
---
Make reckoning and redoubt proc from crushing blows in addition to crits
---
Add the Mana back on block/dodge/parry to BoSanc
---
Give a taunt
---
Those three things wouldn't make them great by any stretch of the imagination, but it helps cover the major weaknesses of longevity, tank swapping, and if redoubt procced on crush they would have a window after each one where they couldn't be crushed again.
---
30ele, 21 resto crew for life.
---
It was a great spec - gave you enough utility to heal in raids, while maintaining Ele to let you melt faces in PvP or grind for gold.
---
&gt; There’s no discussion to be had here because that’s what the community has been asking for in the past decade.
---
I'd argue that's you trying to shut down the discussion, but maybe I read it incorrectly.
---
There are other people actually having this discussion in multiple places though, so I'm not the only one trying to have this discussion. There are other posts in this thread too, so that proves that I'm not the only one interested in talking about it.
---
Not to mention you chimed into the conversation yourself, which is cool. I'd say we've had a discussion.
---
Don’t have any links but if it’s the alpha I think he’s talking about (leaked F&amp;F build), there’s a ton of torrents and download site links scattered around for it. It should appear with fairly minimal googling.
---
I'm sure it would land you a Ban but it's pretty much how private servers were done. Download one file then add server name.
---
Indeed - 1 extra crit per 500 casts - now we're hitting harder!
---
&gt; your method of communication is obnoxious and condescending, not clever or interesting.
---
Posting
---
Doesn't make your post look good either. I thought you'd "get it" if I start with
---
&gt; I appreciate the capital scepticism from my fellow socialist.
---
I’m 38 and have no idea what streamers even do outside of somehow making a living off of games.  Implying I “like” them simply because I don’t think they have an appreciable impact on the game is quite the strawman and still doesn’t address the supposed issue at hand. You keep saying things like:  
---
&gt; we've seen where it can have detrimental effects to a server.
---
But you provide no context.  Where have they done this?  What have they done?  Etc.
---
&gt;Right lets immediately insult pservers for no reason
---
Like how you immediately insulted Blizzard for no reason?
---
Too bad the pet will die most of the time
---
&gt; like you said
---
But what if I get on and find and report a load of bugs. Wouldn’t they see value in me then to give me access to future ones?
---
I played US Frostmane/Frostwolf in Vanilla and it was VC long before Dire Maul came out (least alliance side).  Think it varies entirely by the server
---
The Classic launch is getting more scuffed everyday.
---
I don’t even have the game boxes anymore, a “friend” stole them from me years ago.
---
Enjoy your guide! :D
---
My question would rather be what is the bottleneck for a server to choke on 200 players on a same zone with relatively little calculations from spell interactions.  Is there a physical limitation that is hard to surpass no matter the improvements in proc speeds?
---
Just type out Deadmines to avoid any confusion whatsoever.
---
We hate streamers now.
---
I just hope all the major players don't burn out on the beta and actually all come back for release, with the same zeal. I want a fight too damnit!
---
You all realize that you're going to get your toon wiped right? And like 99% of you don't even want to test the game but play it. Like Beta testing is more than just playing. Its about trying all aspects of the game, making sure that everything working as intended....
---
[There's the Burning Steppes altar as well.](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Altar_of_Storms_(Burning_Steppes))
---
There is no "mangos client". Mangos is the server core. It's the original Blizzard WoW Vanilla 1.12.1 client.
---
The other posts are universally against your ideas... not the best example.
---
If you join a guild you can find plenty of people who will help you out, especially as a healer there's a lot of tit for tat
---
layer bad
---
I'd wager 25% of the players won't get there in the 2 hours just because the starting areas will be swamped.
---
No one recruited for Gahz'rilla or Herod.. you say the name of the dungeon.
---
Me too and I am at work during the stress test anyways so I cant even participant if i wanted too.
---
Yeah, it makes mouse control easy, and the drivers for it have some pretty fancy features like allowing you to create radial menus and such even when the game doesn't support it. It can be a bit rough around the edges sometimes and you have to configure it a fair bit to make it suit your tastes, but I think it's the best option there is for playing mouse+keyboard-focused games on a controller.
---
That said, I haven't personally used it for WoW so your mileage may vary. I'm sure people have done it though, so you may find some testimonials on Google.
---
Yeah I guess you're right. I wish I could check it out without a sub even for a little while, but really it's a good thing that they have enough interest already.
---
You're arguing that if they tune the numbers up higher than they ever were, that would be more "authentic." I think most people would definitely disagree with this
---
Regardless of your personal experience, it’s the polite and right thing to do. 
---
In vanilla, those items regardless of what you think of their worth are actually meaningful and are worth something to the average player.
---
That could be interesting though, no? Each expansion had a very different design philosophy, so you could add onto a TBC server some TBC-"like" content, some WOTLK-"like" content on those servers, and such. You'd just have to make it so that the new content wasn't so powerful that nobody had a reason to run lower level raids/dungeons anymore. THAT, I think, is where you'd start to piss off the player base, so it'd be a thin line that they'd have to walk, but they could do it because most of the developers on that team are from that era. 
---
Wouldn't have to do that for every expansion, though. Could probably just stop at WOTLK since there's pretty much nobody clamoring for Cata and beyond servers and even if they were, that content is still there. That's when they broke the world and redid the talent tree, so anybody wishing to run those expansions could simply shut off xp and just run that content ad infinitum if they so desired, which is not really possible with pre Cata content.
---
Does it include the lighting too? I'd be grateful is you (or someone) could create a screenshot in an Inn with the Classic settings.
---
I hope you get in, but that is hilarious.
---
yo how do u get to the stress test?
---
The tiring part was the amount of people who thought they were lightbulbs saying things like “Layering is just like phasing!!!” 
---
Like, no shit, we know.
---
Hard disagree just on the basis that this is a roleplaying game from the getgo. 
---
And it's not like roleplay is mutually exclusive with anything else.
---
Literally just take every single anything you ever type and type it as if your character were actually saying it. Or on voice. That's roleplaying, and it can be added as flavor to every single thing you do in the game. It can drive your character's route of progression, which zones and dungeons you visit, how you recruit for groups and guilds, which loot you seek, what class, spec, race you want to play. Etc.
---
You can do it while doing everything and anything else. It adds to it all. 
---
Roleplaying does not have to mean "sit in one location for half an hour JUST typing".
---
Yup same, I got the stress test email but no client. I guess the email was fake
---
Never expected to see Aunty Donna here. Anyways, can we talk about cum for a second?
---
Can confirm, xperl. Used them on vanilla and pservers
---
It's just 1, 5, 10 then 5 steps from there.
---
Each layer is going to have the population of an OG Vanilla server.  It'll be plenty busy out there, I would imagine.
---
I'm more curious what sort of server population will be required to turn off layering entirely - 3k?  5k?  I'm hoping that once the initial crush has happened and the "tourists" have started to slow down that Blizz will be aggressive in flipping the switch to "off" even if it means an overall server population of like 6,000+.  I'd imagine the natural spreading out of players after the first couple of weeks will handle the player density issues.
---
This is what Classic is all about!
---
I'm going to corpse camp any player I find who calls it VC, I'm not going to let this perversity grow on my nice new server.
---
I understand completely what the comment was saying and I never said that they meant to imply that all private server is accurate. I only pointing out that the comment contradicts the comment that I was replying to which was:
---
I played Troll Rogue in Vanilla. Not making the same mistake again. Orc for the win.
---
You'll need to grind out Darkspear reputation in Durotar and the Barrens etc in order to get to Exalted. It will likely take a while.
---
Was VC pretty much every character I ever rolled in Vanilla lol.
---
Eh just get to 5 imo. Will only take a few hours anyway so why not
---
Same. VC on Archimonde
---
Yes, I just love seeing these high ranking retail players being surprised and overwhelmed by low level content.
---
Holy shit someone who gets it!
---
Great find.
---
That's a hard question to answer. Was there anything in particular you didn't enjoy about them, or did the class as a whole just not sit well?
---
I enjoy the pace at which they level in the open world, kill a few mobs, shift out and heal, shift and get right back into the battlefield while your mana regens behind the scene. THat just feels good while leveling. But what over all do you dislike? Maybe you just don't like the feel.
---
I feel as though they pick up in the level 20s with cat form. 1-10 is pretty bad because of no shifting, and 10-20 is a little slow feeling since it's just bear smacks.
---

Pass the beta to someone else, give us others who want to test a chance.

Nah, i would rather recreate my Minimal UI.

---
Because in 3 instances someone posted something similar to the comment I originally responded to which was:
---
As a Vanilla horde player. I called it RFC
---
I got the email. Yesterday. Unfortunately I won't be home during that time lol. Oh well.
---
It is not it's own game, its a drop down select, the invite has instructions; unless you've read them and it still is not showing up.
---
BREAKING NEWS: Vanilla was harder
---
Crazy take.
---
You have the freedom of choice, but not the freedom of consequences. 
---
Hope you won't regret the decision you've made.
---
I probably played at least a dozen alliance characters on as many servers high enough to run deadmines and absolutely everyone called it VC lol
---
Like I said, new zones with no load screen is ok with me. New continent with load screen is anti vanilla.
---
I smell a bamboozle...
---
oh okay thanks
---
No offense or anything but this is not what you want when you have ultrawide.
---
You want your UI centered around the middle, the point of the sides for ultrawide is for peripheral vision, you dont want to be looking to the corners of your screen especially for ability cooldowns, that would be incredibly uncomfortable.
---
Look at Overwatch HUD for example on ultrawides, that's kind of what you want.
---
Thanks, but on the other side it means that Ele an resto will really rock PvP?
---
Got invited to the stress test, living in the uk means its at 11pm. I have an exam tomorrow...
---
I dont think you need a valid key. I think it works the same as the stress test and all the other betas I've been in. Just download the client that is given to you
---
Definitely going to main a gnome mage, but I’m torn on leveling spec and professions. 
---
I know frost tends to be favored for solo leveling, but I’m going to be leveling with a Ret friend. But frost is also kind of necessary for raising in the fire resist raids. So if I just go for frost can I cut down on respec cost? Or will the leveling build be so different from the raiding build that I have to respec either way? 
---
I’m tempted to take the classic tailor/enchant combo, but I’m wondering if it’s more advisable to go tailoring/herbalism while leveling to earn extra gold? I’m just concerned that it’ll be a pain to level enchanting from scratch later
---
The best class for this is mage.
---
Is it me or do all Europeans play female characters
---
I mean you can keep saying that, but it's just not accurate. SK is popular in casual guilds because it's low effort, I couldn't even name a single DKP guild while I can think of several I've seen on my servers using EPGP. I don't know where you're getting your numbers.
---
QUALITY MEME
---
I got the email last night around 10:30 est but no client appeared until midnight. 
---
I can vouch that there was a delay, but no clue how long it could be for others.
---
Pretty sure the shaman Far Sight is the same animation.
---
Same, we all said VC on Doomhammer.
---
Yeaaah. But to give everyone credit, although there were interviews with, say, Ion and others where it was described, it's unfair to just expect everyone to have watched every video like two hours after release. 
---
That said, there is this kind of underbelly to the sub, a sub-section (hoho) who need to whip out their hate/panic boners the moment an opportunity arises.
---
neat but as an ultrawide user i wouldn't be interested. blocked a fifth of the screen with ui goes against all the reasons i got an ultrawide in the first place - to see more of the game. the idea of a permanent huge quest box or any box at all on the side of my screen is very displeasing.
---
Hunter for sure
---
not only that but it kinda defeats the purpose of ultrawide since you want the ends visible for peripheral vision.
---
A lot of spouses are cool with hobbies up until the point that kids are in the picture. Then the name of the game changes and hobbies are *way* down the priority list, at least while the kids are young.
---
Yes! As a father or two young daughters, Gaston coming on to sing for the Hogger fight was great.
---
Not sure how you came to that conclusion. They seem to be saying not to outright dismiss pserver info (not that it is “completely accurate”). Obviously, we should rely on Blizzard’s reference client, above all. Is anyone saying we should trust pservers over Blizzard’s reference? We all want the same thing :)
---
Usually only a very small percentage of beta testers are completely random flags.
---
Most beta testers are either top pvp'ers, top raiders, community influencers, previous beta testers that provide good feedback, have specific computer specs, etc.
---
Mistwreaver healing was my favorite too. It felt so elegant.
---
Thanks. What was the reason for the long break between January 2006 and February 2007?
---
[https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blue\_Plz](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Blue_Plz)!
---
You can just go full feral dps/tank leveling spec and heal fine until lvl 50. https://classicdb.ch/?talent=#0zLVhoZxxMscrdtV this is what I usually go with
---
For both, but your access to some realm are limited.
---
Do u have a favorite healer in Classic?
---
Everyone including me has 2 ptr accounts, I think we fucked ourselves.
---
Does Eagle Eye normally show you mobs? If so, the dark portal is missing all the mobs near it, which might explain the level 30 cap.
---
i tried that, but i think because I have two PTR accounts (hit the create PTR button twice by accident) it's not showing up. everyone on the forums is reporting they got the invite but they have 2 PTRs and cannot see the stress test because of it
---
You don't need mining for engineering - instead of farming 100g of ore and using the mats, farm 100g of herbs and sell the mats to buy ore or spend the time grinding gold. My pserver priest had 300 engineering at lvl32 without lifting a mining pick.
---
&gt;So my theory is that what matters the most is the amount of $$$ you've spent on your Bnet account, cos that's the only thing I think I'd be on the high end of.
---
There is absolutely no correlation between money spent and beta tests.
---
No. No new content ever. Anything new at all or changed is anti-vanilla!
---
Every monday there is a LFG treat. Guilds advertise there. Maybe you will find a guild that fits your needs there. That is where I found my guild.
---
Imagine giving someone money for the chance to talk to them.
---
Lmao how do you infer that from what he said? There's tons of classes that are good at both.
---
there's a bug, anyone who has 2 PTR accounts will not see the stress test option
---
SO how do we fix this? I have the same thing
---
More usually people report getting the client available before an email. I have had the client for may hours, but still no mail.
---
I didn't even get a stress test invite.
---
/wrists
---
Raid leader and officers should have the authority to make people spec to whatever they think is good for the raid.
---
And who the fuck is looking for Deadmines at 40+?
---
I always just shift clicked the persons name to see their level. Told me everything I needed to know.
---
Isn’t the stress test only 2 hours long?
---
Yeah I haven't played any form of WoW since TBC so I'm not sure with how the current game is structured at all.
---
Those first 5 minutes are crucial.
---
You joke but I wouldn't be surprised in 3-4 days if one pops up.
---
Remember to do everything in moderation, even world of Warcraft!
---
It is like... really good in world pvp because Track humanoid goes with it
---
Didn't get into any expansions prior to cata. After that I've been in literally every beta and some alphas of WoW, Diablo 3, SC 2, Hots, HS and OW. I don't know why I first didn't get in and suddenly got invited to everything but so it goes. I haven't gotten invited to Classic beta though but did get the stress test invite.
---
How hard is it to hear an Ele/Resto Shammy? And would Orc or Tauren be better, I assume Orc, but warstomp is tempting.
---
Thoughts on Paladin vs Warrior for dungeons and BGs? I would do a mixed holy/ret build on the Paladin and for the warrior, prot for tanking and arms for BGs. Played Paladin in Vanilla and Prot Warrior in TBC and really enjoyed both of them.
---
It was actually pretty nice up until a few months ago.
---
I said "if" you like, didn't imply that you did.  
---
A little google search will point you to many issues streamers have caused, including but not limited to.... crashing servers, getting other players banned by having their minions all right click report, affecting the server economy, wrecking population of servers, etc, etc.  These all have happened and can happen again, I'd prefer to avoid all that drama.
---
Same. My husband will be playing, too, but I'll probably double his playtime.
---
Kinda funny how everyone assumes all WoW players are straight dudes.
---
Welcome to classic wow, where not everyone is self sufficient and must work together to get things done
---
There's no guessing game when Dire Maul is DM N/E/W/T and Deadmines is just DM.
---
Being top tier in PvE AND PvP WITHOUT needing a respec?
---
Really?
---
Did this resolve by the way?
---
Look at the email address that was sent from, then compare it with a real email from wow.
---
Yes, it switches to recreate the old lighting/shadows and looks pretty much identical. During the demo people were pointing out minor differences between the two (I think its impossible to be 100% identical with the new client) but you'd have to be hyperanalyzing the pictures side by side to tell the difference. I can't play right now so I can't provide any SSs though.
---
Fair enough, but I don’t think it’s fair to judge the entire pserver crowd based on the most extremist members. I’d be very surprised to hear that even they believed pserver info OVER the Blizz reference client, but maybe they accuse Blizz of lying?
---
he's correct that a lot people expected these dungeons to be way harder and were disappointed to see how easy they are, though
---
Frost and Fire leveling are both viable. Fire takes more effort to play well but it's manageable. Regardless of what you level in, you're going to want to respec before raiding.
---
Trade skills will be expensive to level either way, I'd do what you want and if it takes a bit extra farming so be it.
---
Lots of people with end PCs get beta invites all the time.  While it’s true that blizzard is going to look for diverse hardware, it’s not fair to say if I didn’t have a good PC I’d get beta invites.
---
Where's the other ring? you can't leave one slot open.
---
by the time i'm 60 my warrior will have such a good group rep i'll hardly need to look for one, they'll find me.
---
Don't forget Blizzard is a business. When people want to use your product but are unable to that is a major problem. Also dead servers and server mergers down the line are another problem. Both these problems can be mitigated by layering.
---
Believe me, you will still be in a "full" server and launch day will be nuts. But at least it will be mostly playable.
---
Actual vanilla launch was a shit-show but this launch is actually going to have *more* people trying to play from day 1. 
---
If you want Classic to succeed you should not be against layering. The amount of people that will think that long queue times and waiting in lines to tag targets is "fun" is minimal and this experience will be bad publicity and player retention. 
---
Layering is happening. Accept it.
---
Dunno, we have to ask Blizzard.
---
Rebel!
---
I hope your exam is not on Time Zones, it’s 12am BST in the UK ;)
---
I'm going to explode if it doesn't mean that T_T
---
It always baffled me as well. Though I understand people wanting to watch Beta streamers because they didn't get an invite and want to see what it's like. But people who watch streams of games they have access to or already own... is really freaking weird to me.
---
Maybe in a decade or so it will be a thing to watch streamers who are themselves watching streamers play - Like you watch a live stream of a dude sitting in a house watching a live stream of something.
---
If it’s so easy to find and so prevalent surely you could provide examples here to support your claim.  As you said you’ve “seen it” yourself so...
---
I work in IT, it's 100% a blizzard email.
---
Stop watching the streams! Ignore them, go about your self, do other stuff, and the 3 months will go by faster. Why watch a pot boil????
---
Yes. They are amazing. Ele has on demand burst, resto has the best group heals in the game, all coupled together with purge and totem utility.
---
Stuck between gnome mage vs gnome rogue. I’m PvP focused and have never played Alliance before but will be rolling this faction with friends so this faction PvP perspective is all new to me.
---
As for solo PvP fun and games, is mage and or rogue particularly scuffed with certain matchups? (Ie shaman &amp; orcs). 
---
Also, I haven’t been following the patch progression super closely but do rogues or mages have a certain gear advantage with the 1.12 itemization being available from start? Also considering how “early” we can start farming AQ level R10 gear.
---
It's not that bad, even as a paladin. When buffs are strong like they are in Classic, especially as a paladin, it feels good to buff people.
---
r/me2meirl
---
Silithus. Run to Silithus.
---
lol nope, I contacted support to remove my extra to be sure but nothing new.
---
The fact you're thinking it's my ideas means that you didn't really read the actual post in the first place, since I stated that my standpoint is that I'm completely fine either way but I wanted to see what people's opinions on it.
---
Two people follow my same standpoint, the others have stated that nochanges to them means completely nochanges. One person has stated that nochanges will mean the game itself will stagnate. Again, this really shows you haven't really read the posts.
---
Look, I'm happy to keep chatting with you. Please feel free to continue responding because I will do so in kind. But I feel as if your original post from the get go was based on because you thought I was asking for changes, and so you responded somewhat snarkily and defensively. You have however made your opinion known in those posts and answered the question I asked for. Now that we've gotten passed that, and that you've understood that I'm not advocating for changes, do we have anything more constructive to add to this discussion? I feel if it's just going to be a cycle of defensive, passive-aggressive jabs, is there any point?
---
I'm horde so I just ignored the entire instance
---
It's 8.1 in beta, it's been confirmed on multiple streams.
---
It's simple - they just use the live engine (same files), there's no separate engine for Classic, they tweak things around for the vanilla feeling (ie: lower draw distance, more fog etc).
---
Will be a bit far to reach the sided bar and click my abilities after clicking to select my target!
---
why would s starving man eat crumbs ?
---
Doesn't exist anymore. They probably have added a clause in the ToS/EULA to allow them to just scan and download that info from all users.
---
This thread:
---
&gt; Nobody is arguing that private server data is accurate.
---
The comment I linked:
---
&gt;There has been a decades long, community driven effort to use actual Classic videos as evidence for getting proper damage values.
---
Also DM East jump runs
---
Yeah that’s not a one shot
---
&gt; I feel like spelbatching made it easier for the servers to handle.
---
Pretty sure that's exactly why spellbatching existed.
---
It will go up in approx 7 hours.
---
Test hasnt started lol.
---
&gt; Then again, you can't really expect much in a village with about 4000 people.
---
My parents got fiber a couple of years back, they live on the outskirts of a Swedish village of ~3000. And their neighbourhood was among the last in the town to get fiber as well, think they started rolling it out some time between 2000 and 2010.
---
It most certainly did.
---
I ran that damn dungeon probably 100 times trying to get my kara key.
---
I needed a better group in hindsight.  :(
---
how long ago did to you get the email? I got the email and then got the client download option roughly 3-4 hours later
---
That’s not a source
---
I plan on playing a priest and healing at 60 for raiding should I roll troll or undead? The professions I was gonna go with was herbalism and alchemy. Would you recommend that profession?
---
VC FOREVER THIS IS THE HILL THAT I DIE ON
---
I’m not trying to lump them all in a box, I’m just talking from my experience. Honestly to me it seems they were making complaints without actually having valid evidence of their own. I heard something about people only taking like 24 damage to elites in BFD but I haven’t seen anything on they besides here-say
---
you were all wrong
---
It's nothing like phasing actually but a lot of people don't know the difference between phasing, sharding, and CRZ.
---
Existed during Legion (what the client is based on). There are no more PvP or RP-PvP servers on Retail. Just Normal and RP, and they now all have the option of entering War Mode in-game.
---
&gt; Shoutout to everyone who actually plans on spending hours on the stress test 
---
Shoutout to everyone who will spend the next 3 months on the beta just to do it all over again.
---
Was thinking of playing warlock or hunter but now that you reminded me of all the hassle after you die, I'm leaning more towards hunter.
---
People pay to talk to streamers? That's crazy
---
Oh shit, that explains it lol.
---
Closer to 9 since its PDT.
---
a server list would be very specific.
---
Hello all!
---
I am pretty sure I'm going to play Warrior on Horde side.
---
Two questions:
---
1.  If I plan on tanking how important is the Tauren health racial?  Would it be bad to go a different race as far as finding a guild or groups that will take me as a tank?
---
2.  Is Blacksmithing my only option for professions if my focus is PvE?
---
&gt;has always been a shortage of tanks for dungeons and an overabundance of tanks for raids. This has been a problem throughout all of WoW's history and will probably never change.
---
i thought there were 5ish tanks in raid?
---
It's been a good 10 hours now.
---
Are you shitting me?!
---
I'm planning on rolling a NE priest, leveling to cap and then heading for Hogger.
---
Yep can confirm. Archimonde over here too
---
Sounds really dumb. Let's do it.
---
&gt; end PCs
---
Wildstar died because leveling was boring and the attunment process was awful. That's it.
---
AH before epic mount, I bought my epic mount when I hit 2k gold - 20% profit is relatively easy so you can either get 20% profit on your 1100g or have a mount and get 20% profit on your 100g.
---
In classic I never played the healer. But to me shaman healing always seemed the coolest and chain heal has such a cool visual. I did play resto shammy in TBC when it started and it wasn't too far off classic wow shammy. Just the earth sheild. So I would say look into resto, they also have a sick pvp/PvE spec that owns in pvp.
---
Don't forget macros
---
There was, but not in the way there is now.  It came a little later, but a big thing is that resilience didn't exist yet.
---
I'll take your word for it. :) Thanks.
---
I don’t get why Horde are so obsessed with raiding Hogger. Far to big a run to bother with at lvl 1.
---
&gt; I'm saying the comment you linked didn't mean to say that all p server data is correct and the guy that you linked it too didn't mean to say that all p server data is wrong
---
I never implied either of those things.
---
There is a literal contradiction:
---
its one access - also sharing accounts is against ToS btw ( i mean in wow it doesnt really matter much i guess ) but still .
---
Man, it'd be dope if they could somehow incentivize World PvP like this and scrap Battlegrounds entirely.
---
if i cant even get invited to a stress test what hope do i have to get into beta?
---
Apparently there’s a bug, if you have 2 PTR accounts the stress test won’t show up
---
&gt; I may outpace one or both of them and then feel alone in the world.
---
That's why you make one character for leveling with them, and one for solo!
---
I get 180-190KB/s.
---
The internet here is so bad, I'm installing a 4G box just for me. The rest of the family can fight over the 1.8Mbit we get over ADSL.
---
Nah I know. Kinda dumb. Their both my account I just let her play on one every now and then ;P
---
Brand new meme. I’m surprised no one has posted this yet.
---
&gt; Get trough the leveling process only using cloth armor and a staff as your weapon. 
---
As a warrior?
---
Modern wow - as in BfA geared characters would be a slideshow if we'd have say 200 players on the screen and the game settings on max. DX12 mode has a ton of optimizations for efficiently drawing multiple polygons on the screen, so the impact will be less in DX12 rendering mode, where multi-threading is also present. But the sharding (apart from the obvious server itself processing power) is tuned for the DX11 mode, single-threaded engine.
---
Perhaps (not sure anyone could ever test this) the modern engine in DX11 mode on a last generation hgih-end pc would display 500 players on the screen at 3 fps, while in DX12 mode at 8 fps (extreme examples here, for the sake of illustration).
---
"If you don't want to wait in a queue then play retail" is pretty shitty reasoning. I want to actually play classic, not spend the hour or two I usually get each day waiting in queue and then get to actually play for only like 15 minutes per day during the first week or two.
---
Agreed, shadow doesn't touch the dps of regular dps.
---
Ya, it's fun, and in pvp do what you want...but I had to always heal.  And even in pvp I had to go back healing most of the time.
---
I think I got to do shadow once in Kara? Shrug
---
You could still shift click a name to invite someone well before right click invite.
---
I would submit a support ticket if I were you. Or did you already?
---
Agree. I did a couple LFR in MoP when I resubbed, never read any Raid Pannel for strats, sometimes ran around just for fun during boss fights to see what the place looked like (in SoO notably iirc), and I was definitely not the only one doing so ; we never wiped. Literally never. I won't even talk about LFG, which is braindead easy. 
---
I remember that when the Warlock Green Fire quest came out in MoP even some Mythic+ players stormed forums asking for nerfs because they couldn't pass the final stage and kill Kanrethad. It seems that some of them weren't specially good, and just went through Mythic content by wiping with their guild until they learnt boss mechanics by heart. And average players are definitely worse. As you said, I'm sure the skill cap is that much higher nowadays - even though people who continuously played for years to MMOs are certainly better now than back when they started.
---
&gt;tfw the term quel'thalas is older than you
---
You're finally awake
---
The leveling just wasn't very fun.
---
Everything felt way too streamlined and expected. When I got an upgrade it never really felt like I got an upgrade.
---
I draw a lot of similarities to modern WoW in that regard.
---
So it had the relatively time-consuming/difficulty of leveling that vanilla WoW had, but without the feeling of actually gaining power and progressing.
---
What autoshot addon is that?
---
I have 2 PTRs and it shows.
---
I don’t mind putting in the dedication to get r14. But my understanding is Naxx gear is better than r14 gear, and since I refuse to raid, I would always be at a disadvantage.
---
you have to open a ticket, but the turnaround time is 24h...after the stress test will be over. only hope is to have blizz fix it on their end before test starts
---
Lmao and you're a salty ass private server bitch
---
Random Q: how the fuck do you get rid of that WOW1 trial account under live?
---
I have it too, can't get rid of it.
---
All good choices. I would ask what role is your favorite? That should be easy to narrow it down. 
---
But to be fair Mages own in every aspect of the game even socially or financially. Insane class.
---
Guess I should reiphrase, I love the idea of not knowing anything. But everything's already figured out so rather than taking time experimenting, and learning things, I know exactly where to find any info I need, I know what classes to play or not play for what content I might want etc. It's just a matter of googling something rather than learning since the info already out there.
---
I have a work, otherwise I would have probably tried this :D
---
do you mind taking a screenshot? i'd like to send it to blizz CS
---
I don't believe it. My memory of vanilla is perfect and no one can tell me it isn't!
---
I am blizzards son and you dont get to play classic. Congratulations :)
---
Ret paladin from classic, pallypower made it fairly simple. 1 paladin handles kings, 1 handles might, 1 handles wisdom. I was regulated to wisdom, used pallypower, and stay away from combat. They didnt want our autoattacks.
---
Dungeons.  Healers always can find groups.
---
&gt;The fact you're thinking it's my ideas means that you didn't really read the actual post in the first place
---
&gt; Two people follow my same standpoint, the others have stated that nochanges to them means completely nochanges.
---
So which is it?  Either it’s not your ideas or it is.  Can’t have it both ways.  Look, Classic WoW wouldn’t be Classic WoW if it was WoW but different.  It’s that simple.
---
One can only hope
---
With all of these classes the big thing is to grab Enchanting ASAP. The time to level difference between having a wand and not is absolutely massive.
---
If you are a tailor - 58 linen will get you enough skill and mats to make at least 1 lesser magic wand
---
Grind out a few extra humanoid mobs while questing in Trisfal and you'll have the cloth before you know it. Just keep in mind Linen wont drop from mobs under level 5. Minimum level for the first wand is 5, which is fine as you can't grab professions before then anyway. Aim to have the cloth before you get to Brill (I used pumpkin area and farm). 
---
Again, I cannot stress enough how much easier and faster this will make your start, doubly so if you are going double caster. Plus you can sell the wands to other casters, ez pz
---
aka spaghetti code
---
There are classes like that in classic...
---
Make a gold and item limit.. simple. It would still destroy the vanilla servers communities, though.
---
&gt;it is. Berserker Stance makes him take 10% more, which means he's taking 20% more damage since Battle Stance would be neutral and Defensive would be -10%.  
---
Technically it'd be 22.22% more damage.
---
Yeah we said VC on Malfurion-US
---
Warlock has so many rpg elements to the class quests. And you can even make a sacrifice summoning of a rogue demon to kill lowbies.
---
wtf else is there to do with a lvl 5 cap
---
Yes, i did refer to warriors after all ...
---
There was a PvP guild on my server who INTENTIONALLY ABUSED phasing/sharding. They memorized the phase points and would PvP there, and any time they needed to heal or separate groups, they would head through a phasing zone to recover/pick off.
---
Not the only cheesy tactic they did. They weren't very good PvPers, and had to use this and many other methods to be 'effective'.
---
Not really though, back in actual vanilla days nobody knew anything, finding answers to your questions was much harder and actually experiencing the game in it's raw form was natural, I'll undoubtedly know exactly what to do as long as I spend enough time reading. I'll know not to play ELE shaman because they suck, things like these I'll miss.
---
No. But I still hope.
---
That is right, it doesn't effect your chances for any future beta tests

ROGUE

&gt;Probably because even in the comment you linked the guy doesn't imply they have everything correct, and is basically implying they've got a fair share of it correct?
---
Never said it did
---
&gt;I don't think you can get even the most religious p-server zealots to defend every armor value/spawnrate/etc, m8
---
Never implied this
---
&gt;You quoting "Everyone already knew private server data was wrong, was there ever a question of this?" is a blatant strawman, because this guy could also be saying what your linked comment is saying. "A lot is wrong, we all know this, but a lot is also right"
---
Not a stawman because the quote is literally word for word, the original op did not leave anything to interpretation.
---
&gt;you're just fishing really hard
---
The irony, you fished a lot harder for your points.
---
Oddly, I got my invite yesterday but am still awaiting the e-mail. Someone else made a post about having 2 PTR accounts being the issue, contact support maybe?
---
Alternatively, no other class can reliably do a combat rez (discounting jumper cables) which is incredibly valuable for clutch situations. Also, Acorns dont cost THAT much.
---
WOW! It's even drawn by Thrall himself
---
In a 1v1 I feel that hunters can womp warriors pretty good. If you throw in healers it's the other way around.
---
I think blizzard should just implement things as they were. Bugs and all. That would get the full feel of vanilla
---
You are correct. Up to 8 for 4horseman.
---
Dude you can level to like 225 fishing in orgrimmar
---
Hey, this subreddit made [A list of everything](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/wiki/whatweknow) you need to know! ;)
---
Why is that different than a regular expansion launch?
---
I agree it is a polite thing to do. But I definitely don’t think it is the norm. 
---
The point that I am trying to bring out is that people shouldn’t expect from others to roll before opening a chest, whereas people should expect from others to not ninja loot a boss drop.
---
From Durotar?
---
I'm just hoping it doesn't *hurt* our chances of getting in.
---
Try to find and report as many bugs as possible to up your chances I guess

Was there an option in classic? No. Therefore will there be an option to magically see the horde/alliance balance? No.

Being a grown up in others minds is to be a utility and slave and not have fun. If you have fun and isnt doing something productive you get shamed into the hamster wheel that is society again. I might be a man child to others but atleast I am happy and the masses are not. 
---
Stop looking down on yourself for having fun. You only have one life, dont let anyone take that away from you.

Did you check how placement is in a non widescreen lower resolution?

Ishiggy diggy Doo buckaroo
---
these are getting pretty tiring tbh, tons of threads every day where people want to be able to do everything with literally 0 tradeoffs. It goes against the very principles of classic for that to be possible.
---
DMines.
---
Do you need an active sub to get beta access?
---
Interesting to read some of the comments there
---
It's updated. I don't remember where in the config files I saw it but in the beta files there's a file that pulls your hardware specs. It's in retail as well.
---
Blue dark portal? REPORT
---
Try actually completely logging out of the bnet client and back in. I was able to see it in the drop down after I did that.
---
Just keep in mind you move extremely slow while stealth in classic. They buffed it significantly in one of the expacs
---
False
---
Purely for your comp priest would be better. Also easier to get into groups having a healer and a dps. Warlock+priest is a killer duo. Shadow priests boost shadow damage on a target. Any healer + warlock is a super strong leveling combo. A warlock would essentially have infinite mana.

---
The Reason is, you have 2 PTR Licences. They said a few times, having 2 PTR will disallow any Beta Partcipient? (sorry for the word lol)  
---
You have to remove a PTR Licence by Support.
---
And that is likely one of the reasons either ended up being used for the entire thing.  It was a tough instance back then for people learning the game.  Boat wipes were a pain and people always just up and left
---
I’ve been told by many people that 30/0/21 is capable of healing even in raids, so I’d imagine lighter content should be ok? But then again im unsure because you miss a lot of good single target healing that comes from deep resto
---
Ah, was about to mention that, we used role leader back in vanilla
---
its true that some people would say VC but really any time ur running dire maul, u specify the cardinal too, so there was never any confusion
---
You said tons. 
---
I can maybe think of Hunters or Frost mages in the early stages of the game, but neither of them is considered top tier PvE after BWL since most mages start going fire from AQ onward.
---
It will run on a potato
---
The thing is.. vanillas different. Everyone will still be running MC during Naxx for Thunderfury and Hand of Rag,  and there might still not even be people ready for Naxx by then. You dont have to worry about catch-up dungeoms, because if there going to be any of that its going to be like 10 Naxx geared people selling spots to MC and BWL carries
---
Could be 8am For OCE players :P on a work day.. :'\[
---
Not necessarily. Classic is basically tick-based, and with a very low tick rate at that. I'm not sure exactly how retail works, but they have definitely made spells/buffs/whatever more "accurate", which takes a lot of processing power.
---
So you are going to pick a class based on a raid that won't be available for months after launch?
---
The servers were small enough that if you had a shit reputation word got around.  There's only gonna be a handful of top guilds on each server, and all it takes is one person from that guild in the group you ninja from for you to have your reputation ruined.
---
Ehhh a blue actually said stress test participation doesn’t affect chance of getting into beta later
---
Even if you have a ban on your account previously, you can still get beta. Shit, I did.
---
Notice the difference between “Private server data is accurate” and “Private server data was based on the best available information.” This commenter is  perhaps overconfident about the accuracy of pserver research, but what they are saying is factual (although “decades” shouldn’t be plural). Are you saying there wasn’t an effort to create Blizzlike pservers?
---
&gt; TLDR; What exactly does #nochanges mean to you? Did it stem from your previous experiences during Vanilla, or based off of you wanting the base client to hold the exact same values?
---
&gt; If the experience is more important to what you remembered during Vanilla, then would you be turned off by your expectations being misremembered and Vanilla being a much more easier game than what you remember?
---
&gt; If the sanctity of vanilla design is more important to you despite the mobs being weaker than you remember, would you be willing to have blizzard up the difficulty of the mobs, despite it not being the correct values?
---
&gt; Also, this isn't where I want to discuss if the values are correct or not. This is to discuss, that IF the values are exactly as they were in Vanilla, what would your standing be?
---
&gt; **I just want to preface, that I personally neither care if the values of elite mobs are under-tuned or not. I will still enjoy Classic and will play the hell out of it.**
---
Bolded part is my standpoint in this. Two other individuals agreed with this standpoint. It's not having it both ways, it was stating that I don't mind, but I asked what other peoples opinions were. I'm sorry this seems to have made you defensive for whatever reason, but it never was meant as an attack on Classic WoW.
---
&gt; Look, Classic WoW wouldn’t be Classic WoW if it was WoW but different. It’s that simple.
---
I agree. But other people have stated and complained that they're disappointed that it is going to be easier than they remembered. To them, *it's not the WoW they remember playing.* Yes, it's not grounded in reality, but their experience is still valid.
---
That's not simple as simple as it sounds. What you're describing already exists for retail character transfers, and there has always been ways around it.
---
F-ing smurfs ... Damn
---
I &lt;3 this soooo much!  Fishing is the key to leveling cooking, and keeping your pets fed if you use a cat :)
---
No aoe heals in a vanilla paladin
---
We said VC in Kalecgos
---
I have seen some, the majority of people I’ve seen personally are more upset they got invited but don’t see the client download option. I got invited , I would go in and help test if I’m able to, but the last few times I looked it wasn’t there to download. I’m not worried about it, even a beta invite I’m not completely concerned about .
---
I would mess around for a bit on beta... test things. but couldn’t imagine leveling to 30 and then doing it again. I’m not a streamer who games for a living, so my time played is a little more important to me since it’s not as often.
---

---
Seems crystal clear to me. I'm not trying to be an asshole, but false hope is just going to lead to the inevitable letdown / disappointment. There isn't going to be an RPPVP server on launch.
---
I will absolutely be twinking. It's one of the components of the game that I love the most. I will have a 60 that I will raid with and pvp with, but I definitely want to be part of the twinking community as well. I've done 19s 29s 49s and 59s, maybe i'll try out 39s this time :)
---
:( thanks
---
So, no changes depending on the system specs right?
---
Ich hatte eines, habs anfang diesen monats beendet, habe noch gametime für 13 tage, habs nochmal aktiviert aber es ist trdm nur ein stress test. Vllt kommt es in ein paar tagen.
---
username checks out.
---
Oh I can use google but you need to support your argument with facts and examples. It’s not on your audience to do that work for you.  As such I’ll concede you managed to provide a link to a Google search.  That’s something but it’s hardly a link to empirical evidence of entire servers being decimated by streamers actions.  You proved, in 2011, they could momentarily cause a server to crash.
---
WoW itself is forbidden to play via Streaming. Because you can just Remote Bot. They forbid in-house Streaming and general Game Streaming back in Legion I think.
---
Yes...maybe. Warlocks do pretty competitive damage. At least, they do enough to warrant bringing. However debuff limits are a thing, and I don't recall raiding with more than perhaps 2 warlocks, 3 if the guild was desperate to fill a spot.
---
Since they've also reintroduced spell batching with lower tic rates there's much less going on in terms of updating/syncing
---
says its removed?
---
Oh really? That's kinda rad, did you separate rdps and mdps, or was it just dps?
---
You can put shard bags in your bank slots and dump shards onto them very easily. Then swap the bags out.
---
Im confused.  Mine explicitly said in the title that its just for the stress test...?
---
&gt;Many Whelps, Handle It ______! Join the World of Warcraft Classic Stress Test May 22
---
Depends on the dungeon. Usually 2 or 3. More in AQ40/Naxx
---
How ping intensive is raiding as a restro druid? (I know all classes want low ping but some manage better then others). I'm kind of looking at a healing class on the alliance side.
---
I'm playing from overseas so like 200ish ping. 
---
Also is getting into raids fairly managable as a restro druid? I know the meta-builds only run 3 or druids but the class population seems low to compensate for that. (most discussions on getting into raids as a druid seem centered on bear tanking or cat/moonkin dps)
---
It doesn't do that in retail either unless you have your beacon on someone. Pallys especially in vanilla lack aoe healing but have strong single target. Go shaman, priest or druid if you want for healing
---
I wouldnt be surprised if you could run it on a raspberry pi.
---
Classic requirements will be more similar to retail than original vanilla but should be less demanding than BFA.
---
You can test it by downloading retail and see how it runs on your laptop, if it's decent, Classic will be very good.
---
No need to sub, you can use a starter account that's free up to level 20 (no time limit).
---
Yeah man you right, nowhere in mmorpg does it saying anything about role playing...oh wait...
---
Your love for both your family and this game absolutely shines through here. Thank you for posting. This was a joy to read.
---
King’s honor, friend. I hope to meet you and your family in Azeroth.
---
One could argue the title insinuates the answer. But I also always called it DM
---
You cant use dots in raids so they are reduced to basically shadowbolt spam, but they do good damage and have decent utility. They will have raid spots.
---
What is this mystery balance spec you’re talking about? Moonglow/NS?
---
Do you want to join the winning team or join a team and win?
---
It is.
---
Yea they explained it that old spells only have 2 or 3 additional spell effects whereas the new spell tables had all sorts of additional spell effects and auras
---
I got this as well. Naturally I’ll be at work for the two hours it’s running.
---
I'm confused.  Mine says "Beta and Stress Test" however when I log in, it only shows stress test server.  Does that mean I in fact do not have the normal Beta access?  Does anyone else's say this?
---
My poor cat.
---
fwiw i used to just have one PTR account.  Now when i log into bnet (from a browser) and look at my game subs i actually have 2 PTR accounts.  WoW5 was added when i got into the stress test.
---
I got an email and drop down for the stress test.   [https://imgur.com/a/EAIbTcz](https://imgur.com/a/EAIbTcz)
---
Not sure how a GM would interpret it, but I [asked](https://i.imgur.com/xqrdMAr.jpg) a developer of Parsec (a game streaming software) on their discord and apparently Blizzard only care about where the game is run, as they can very easily detect the virtual machine running on the cloud servers and will ban regardless of the remote software being used. Hosting from your own computer using [Parsec](https://blog.parsecgaming.com/blizzards-cloud-gaming-mistake-30c615b4c126) seems to be totally okay.
---
Its highly likely we'll have cross realm BGs anyways, so honestly who gives a fuck. The PvP community will already be hemorrhaging out, arena's would be a baindaid to sanctioned pvp, and debately kill what world pvp there -might- be left.
---
Yeah man. Once we hit BWL, I got fat and my relationships crumbled. When Naxx killed my guild I should have quit but was sucked in until LK. I'm still on the fence if I want to come back to classic. I'll either risk losing important things due to the severe time impact, or I'll be an MC pugger after a 3 month level process, but keep my life unchanged.
---
Yes,I believe you do. Even just for the Stress Test.
---
&gt; Yes, it's not grounded in reality, but their experience is still valid.
---
No, it’s not.  We’re not going to play the “my experience is valid” game with WoW Classic.  This isn’t a political issue and we’re not discussing trans-rights or racial disparity etc.  There’s no differing experiences.  Classic is what WoW was.  Full stop.  The fact that they have faulty memories is not an issue that should inform game design.
---
I'm from Europe, but I've been to Chicago.... xD
---
I’m not sure when you started playing hunter, but their mechanics are quite different at 60 (stand still/stutter step, dead zone, no disengage or trap launcher, no traps in combat, etc.) Consider NE if you really like stealth. You can’t move around, but it’s still great for a class like hunters to defend a base or flag. Hunter’s DPS is lower but they still perform well in PvP.  **Based on your interests, I really see you playing a rogue or hunter.**
---
Here are the better races for those classes in PvP:
---
- alliance rogue: dwarf (stoneskin), gnome (escape artist)
---
- alliance hunter: dwarf (stoneskin), NE (shadowmeld)
---
- horde rogue: orc (hardiness), undead (wotf)
---
- horde hunter: orc (hardiness),  Tauren (aoe stun)
---
Professions: Definitely engineering and any other you want. However, mining will help obtain the mats for engineering.
---
Sure they’re good at both. But nothing in classic is going to be TOP TIER without respeccing. 21 point talents are too pivotal in PvE and PvP depending.
---
Thank you! I certainly will look into it if i go horde.
---
Huh, link works for me. Well here's a copy paste of my post:
---
&gt;So blizzy said the Stress Test will be a PvP server but the 1-5 start areas will be sanctuaries. It's obvious they wanna give us the option of having a level 5 WAR. So I was thinking about where in the name of thrall's pixels we would do that when both factions are capped at level 5.  
---
&gt;The bridge between Stranglethorn Vale and Duskwood. It's the only place I can think of that both factions can somewhateasily get to, without having to worry about animals eating us alive during the fight. Horde will have a tougher time for sure getting there, but if anyone has a better idea lemme know and i'll edit the post. Remember, zones like Durotar, The Barrens, Westfall, and Elwynn are a faction owned place and the friendly faction won't be PvP automatically.  
---
&gt;TL;DR: If you wanna World PvP during the Stress Test, head to the bridge between Stranglethorn Vale and Duskwood!
---
You wanted proof you got proof, now that's not good enough because it happened in 2011.  Keep moving the goalposts.  What i've said is true, whether you want to believe it or not, I really don't care.
---
Help me bros.. what do I do...

---
Yeah no tks
---
!RemindMe 7 days
---
Warlock - Make a pet attack macro and **use it**. Your pet should always be moving to attack, or already attacking. Target and move them to the next mob while you finish the one you've started, then repeat. 
---
Mage - Focus on making your mana last as long as possible. The lock can Lifetap, but if you go oom, its time to drink. 
---
(Extra) Spriest - WAND WAND WAND WAND
---
Zones - Start of in trisfal and do all the quests there, you'll leave at level 12. Head down to Silverpine and do all the quests you can (duoing you should be around 15-16) until you get to Fenris Isle. Then go to the Barrens unless you want to grind. If you do grind, do the Gnolls on Fenris, as they drop wool and the debuff (agi) won't effect you. If you do this, you'll be able to avoid the worst of the barrens quests (like the Zhevra hooves)
---
Builds wont really matter too much, just remember that leveling in Vanilla\\Classic is a marathon, not a sprint. Look for talents that will either a) reduce combat time b) reduce recovery time or c) reduce time to travel
---
The only real suggestion is, for the lock, immediately make corruption instant cast. 
---
Hope this helps and feel free to DM me if you have any more questions
---
Hi, /u/dubhudz
---
Yeah but they're natural sprinters "sorry had to say it"
---
Classic will be 110% successful but for the wrong reasons. I've just been apart of the Nostalrius scene for a long time, I've seen the struggle the community has gone through to get Blizzard to want to bring back vanilla realms. What you just said is what I feared the most "Blizzard is a business". They are thinking about their company first before bringing back vanilla wow, and that is why this isn't going to satisfy the private server players. 
---
I detect this reddit section is full of players who haven't played since 2006ish or people from retail looking to play a harder WoW, which isn't blizzard's main target. I'm sure Blizzard wants to eliminate private servers and well, classic wow is 110% not going to do that the way things are currently looking.
---
pog!
---
ok, so i meant if you had 2 PTRs BEFORE you got the invite, the stress test won't show up. if you have 2 PTRs total, yes one of the PTRs is the actual beta invite.
---
np, i once one shotted a mage that was sitting (all crit) because of a windfury proc. ! it was crazy since the guy was pretty well gear too.
---
On my server it was DM until Dire Maul came out. Then some of the players called it VC and others still called it DM. We never had a solid consensus, but it was pretty easy to figure out what people meant in context.
---
We can thank retail for this new mindset.
---
So, if you want more than that is a "busy" area, you need to upgrade.
---
I didn’t say it wasn’t valid.  I said it was proof that it happened, on a very small scale, once in 2011.  A server crash once 8 years ago is hardly cause for widespread panic and terror.

---
I'm at work, so I can't really deep dive answer all your questions.
---
But I will say that you 100% will supplement your pvp with raid gear. Before PvP rank armour is released, you have no choice. Even post-release, raid armour is BIS for most classes even in PvP, and it's even worse with some weapons vs pvp weapons.
---
And all of that is assuming you even have equal opportunity at both. You will not. By your own admission you'll be casually playing, so it's unlikely you'll hit ranks necessary to get even a single epic pvp item. You'll have blues at best, or you'll raid. Really no inbetween =X
---
The main period they want you to log in for is 2 hours, however the Stress Test will be up for 24 hours total.

---
If I got beta access I would play. My reasoning is because I plan on rushing 1-60 as fast as possible, so becoming re-familiar with the 1-30 grind would be beneficial. You'll know the quests that might not be worth doing, or you'll learn something like you should have bought that white dagger upgrade from the weapon vendor when you had the level requirement, and not waited until 2 levels after. The little stuff like that will save you so much time when classic is released because there will be a lot of people. So you might waste an hour trying to finish a quest, but the guy who played the beta (or vanilla private server) will have known to not bother with that quest, and now hes an hour ahead of you, and you're still stuck in the mob of people trying to do the same quests and hes home free to quest with little competition. Thats just how I look at it.
---
Wasn't the argument about the dungeon elite trash and not the bosses? The screenshot and comparison was done with a boss.
---
Contacted support and had the PTRs removed. My region option is now gone. I will check throughout the day and update if beta/stress appears.
---
On a side note, since there were no beta emails sent out wouldn't it have been possible some of us had beta access the entire time but the 2 PTR bug prevented the option?
---
Point still stands
---
Thanks for that! The excitement in many posts is tangible. It's awesome seeing the vanilla community is back. That was half the fun!
---
Well met!
---
Vanilla player here.  I knew it as VC too.  I can't remember if it was *always* that way though, but it's definitely the abbreviation that resonates more strongly with me, whereas DM is Dire Maul.
---
Dude hunter ammo/quiver is actually awesome. Whenever you leave town you load up on plenty of arrows. Some food and water for yourself and special food for your pet. Maybe you need to run to the cheese store in stormwind. You literally prep for your trips it's cool rpg. 
---
Besides this 60 hunter was my first 60 back in the early patches. This class is so much fun with a high skill ceiling. PvP owns. Lay traps on the high traffic roads and kill your prey of the opposing faction. Your pet is much closer to you since it has a happy meter and you teach it skills as well as feed it. It's a different feel and it's amazing. You are also the best kiter in the game and will be used to kite trash and bosses in raids. 
---
I played mostly pvp though with some raids sprinkled in. It's an amazing class and you can't go wrong with it.
---
yes.
---
I’m curious, as someone who is going to be maining Druid in classic - how necessary is engineering for PvP as a HotW spec or feral Druid spec? Part of me really yearns for herbalism alchemy but I feel like everyone constantly talks about how strong engineering items are in pvp. I just don’t know how much that applies to druids or not given we can’t use items in shapeshifted forms.
---
Cursed text
---
Yes because I won't get it to 60 until months after launch.
---
come on man, its reddit. you think i read past the Blizzard entertainment sender and many whelps left side? but yeah looking back mine says the same
---
I have to agree here. For as much shit as streamers have gotten on this sub, many (though not all) of them have set a really good example when it comes to testing and reporting bugs
---
I highly doubt it hurts your chances either way. 
---
I imagine this stress test is to closely monitor how layering will behave on a named server with a ton of load. 
---
If everything goes well I’m hoping they start to increase the number of waves/people per wave given successful stress tests. That’s just a hope though.  If that’s true (could very well not be) I would assume stress testers could be up on the list for beta invites since I know there are quite a few people on this sub without a stress test invite. 
---
Just my theory.
---
However I'm sure they have an internal flag somewhere to check if you logged in during the test. Might have ramifications for future beta invite waves.
---
Cool - yeah northern STV might be a good bet.   
---
Is Ashenvale contested? That could be a good one maybe?
---
no, you aren't invited to the "real" beta just because you got stress test
---
I got the stress test downloaded it and I was so happy. Then I find out you can only play for a day even though server is Greyed out and can’t level past 5. Fuck that not even worth my time.
---
Short answer yes. Long answer...not really.
---
There's some key talent differences as a frost mage when Pvping and Pveing. You can absolutely PvE with your PvP talents. Dungeons are fine, and even raiding...but more dedicated pve mages will do noticeably better.
---
It's the same but they will be on different servers.
---
They should also stagger random people with download freezes for that true patch day experience of trying to log in and only half of the raid team has downloaded the updated client.
---
Never heard it called anything but dm until I started playing on a private server, started 2.5 months after eu release
---
I assumed it was an American thing
---
Minnesotan transplanted to Kansas here but Id join you
---
It was always VC on Burning Blade.
---
Vanilla player.  We called it VC on my server.
---
Make a guild, call it "DM not VC", ensures quality people. Congrats on Scarab Lord.
---
Is the stress test invite only as well? Or ever1 can get in?
---
I don't see how that would happen. Inflation in TBC increased the value of gold by like 10x. 100g in BC was worth 10 in vanilla, sort of. No one would earn enough gold in vanilla to be a tycoon in launch bc.
---
Unpopular opinion:
---
Probably rolling on a streamer server. I figure the server population will remain healthy through the entire iteration of Classic. I'll either join the streamers guild or whatever other random guild is there.
---
It's random. I started playing in December of 2004 and stopped in Fall 2007. Just re-subbed in early May. I feel bad for the others that have actually played for 10+ years that haven't had a shot.
---
Oh look it’s an Asmongold fan.
---
A geared warrior kills everything in its path.
---
But a skilled rogue avoids the warrior and kills everyone else.  Unless the warrior is holding the flag.
---
I'm really struggling to figure out what I want to play, especially now that I'm in beta. My main focus in classic is going to be social/casual playing with friends.  I probably won't do any sort of organized raiding, except for maybe a pug here and there, and will probably be more about PvP and smaller group content (5/10 mans, world bosses, world pvp, BGs when released)
---
I initially thought I was going to be a Druid, jack of all trades (I'm a severe altoholic), however I realized that after playing one (never touched it in vanilla - was rogue through TBC and started Druid in WotLK) that I really was not a fan of having to manually shift in and out of forms.  I don't know if it just feels clunky, or I just am too used to auto-shifting based on spell cast, but it really turned me off from the class.  I think(?) this could be resolved with some in-depth macros, but I don't know for sure. FWIW I was considering both the deep feral cat/bear or HotW specs.  I also have come to find that Druids are fairly niche in pvp, and I'm not sure I want to be relegated to FC in WSG, or straight up passed on for other BGs.
---
After moving from Druid, I figured I'd try Shaman, since it's still got some hybrid options, and I don't dislike healing/ranged dps (would probably be going 30/0/21).  I think my issue with Shaman is there's just so much going on, and I really dislike how fast they blow through mana.  I'm older now and just not as dexterous I used to be.  A class like Shaman where I'm constantly having to play both offensively and defensively seems overwhelming.  I'm not sure how well I'd do with Shaman, as I'm more used to very mobile classes.  I love the idea of enhance, as I've always had an affinity towards melee, but alas Enhance is fairly meme level, and probably won't allow me to do much group content efficiently.
---
Moving on from hybrid classes, I started thinking of the pure classes.  I've mained a hunter for a few expansions, and always loved the playstyle, from Cata onwards (I would live in cata as a hunter if possible, with the serpent sting multishot spread).  After playing in beta I realized how different Hunter is from live.  What was probably my favorite playstyle (only competing with Fury warrior) is completely different in classic.  I really love the Hunter ethos and ranger playstyle, but I absolutely hate that classic hunters can hardly do anything while moving.  Auto-shot is the biggest DPS ability and you have to stand still for it to fire, Aimed is the second most useful ability, and it's a ridiculous long cast time.  I was hoping BM would be a more viable spec, but it seems like if you're not MM you're just a waste of space.

Similar to hunter, I tried Warlock.  I'm leaning Warlock at this point just because I honestly feel more mobile with that character than with the hunter.  I know it's hard to tell right now because the beta only goes to level 30, but I feel like overall they are similar in playstyle in vanilla, and locks just have a way easier time doing stuff (I don't honestly care about 1v1 pvp).
---
Never played Mage or Priest, don't really have a big interest in them as I like fast-paced gameplay with survivability.  The more I say those things though the more Mage sounds like it's right up my alley.  I just know there's going to be so many Mages.
---
Rogue I played in a hardcore (top 100ish) progression guild in Vanilla/TBC.  I just don't really feel like rogue suits me anymore.  I remember feeling like I was getting carpal tunnel when I used to play combat rogue in raids, and I just don't know if I have the energy for that anymore.
---
Lastly Warrior.  I really want to enjoy warrior, but I'm apprehensive with all the stance dancing, not to mention as a father and full-time employee, I just don't have the ability to play reliably, which means I'm not sure I'll be one when other people are on.  This is what led me to look at the more survivable/solo classes.  Fury is fun though, I've played it in many expansions, and loved the playstyle.  I also enjoy tanking, but hate that there's almost no sustainability for a warrior outside of groups.
---
Sorry for wall of text, this has been a fairly agonizing process.  I know you should play what you want, or what you think is fun, but I also have it ingrained in me to be as efficient as possible when doing stuff.  I'd rather not be gimping myself or falling behind/struggling because my class/spec just isn't good.  Just for reference, I've played every expansion, and have had max level characters of every class except Mage and Priest.  I'm familiar with all the different classes and their playstyles (from Wrath/Cata forward), so using earlier iterations of a spec as a frame of reference would also be helpful for figuring out which class may fit me in classic.
---
What I'd like is a fast-paced gameplay, without too many things to manage (resources, buffs/debuffs).  Melee is my preferred only because I like to be as mobile as possible while DPSing.  I enjoy both healing and tanking, but don't really like only being able to choose one or the other (would prefer at least one dps spec).
---
When it comes to naming conventions, this is untrue.
---
Update: [https://imgur.com/E4ey4Fo](https://imgur.com/E4ey4Fo)
---
Exactly.  I think for quite a while I didn't even realize the dungeon was called "Deadmines" - I just knew it ended with Van Cleef.
---
No its nonsensical because no other dungeon is referred to by its last bosses initials.
---
Mage: make foods and drinks for 40 ppl in raids
---
Warlock: Summon 35 ppl in raids. Also don't forget to bring bags of Soulstone
---
Always been vc on Proudmoore
---
Not even a stress test invite.  Had a sub throughout the entirety of vanilla, but that don't matter to activizzard
---
Yep, and I'm assuming it will go relatively smoothly, even on launch day. They really haven't had a bad launch since WoD. BfA had some minor issues but nothing too bad after like 4-5 hours post launch. I'm sure they will get classic right as well.
---
But I hit level 10...
---
Another question: I'll be mostly playing casually (except for some short periods os hardcore gaming), do I have to worry about my class choice ?
---
Seriously, down voted for telling someone they made me laugh? I subreddit is so bad.
---
I have legit never ever heard someone say VC until some streamers started talking about it
---
Did I say that? A new continent is anti vanilla.
---
Hi, /u/chs724
---
I got an email from them saying I could participate in the stress test today, but they haven’t added it to my launcher yet!!!  Arrrrrgh!!!
---
I got an email at 9:13 pm CDT last night, so emails are def going out
---
I wouldn't call that specific at all, and we still lack a long overdue serverlist.
---
Will this be an alliance or horde guild?
---
I actually got beta access yesterday. Was a fun few hours. Definately gonna play more in the coming weeks.
---
It's not that at all, private servers are accurate in this regard and I used widescreen there with the original castbar placement. It's just wrong.
---
Fake. Playing with updated graphics is not real vanilla!!
---
The client itself and its „portal“ settings are the same between beta and stress test. Which realms you can log into is decided by what the account you are logging into is flagged for.
---
If you are in the beta you will have access to beta-pve, beta-pvp and stress test realms. If you are only invited for the stress test you will only see the stress test realm. And if your account isn’t flagged at all you will get the „No realms available“ error message.
---
Nah. 40 man is pushing it. Not only that, I wouldn't want to be forced to work with those that have been rivals for that long. Knowing the dipshits that would wipe raids for "funsies" within the guild, I wouldn't want to even see what happens with attempted mergers.
---
https://youtu.be/3j5t5BESlsI 
---
This dude goes into a lot of detail about mages
---
But is designed to look like that. Take a look at Runescape (at least OSRS) or any old CRPG/isometric RPG. Or strategy games like Anno.  
---
This is no UI for raiders, its for people who like the RPG touch
---
Right but legion had those realms. Blizz didn't add this in, that's just what was there before the swap to N and RP only
---
I feel like people saying 'it depends what server you are on' are just trying to create enough vagueness to justify their own bias.
---
it wasn't even a 'per server' thing imo, it was a personal choice. I was on Thunderlord and the large majority of people said VC, but I used to say DM back then because I was a noob and had no idea there was even a whole other dungeon called Dire Maul abbreviated the same. until people whispered me and let me know.
---
We’re playing 1.12. You can’t enter a raid when a boss is engaged and everyone enters combat on pull.
---
The correct answer is :  
---
\- Logically, it should be called DM  
---
\- But if you played Vanilla or Pserver, you know it's called VC  
---
And that's pretty much it, you cant do anything about it, it is what it is.
---
Does anyone have a source for it being the same portal (config.wtf). I haven't seena nyone with beta actually check.
---
Only valid input here
---
You don't need to have a guessing game at launch, tho. There is only one DM.
---
Imo, a new player can look at the map and see "deadmines" and figure out what DM is. Calling it VC is more confusing and not necessary.
---
By the time Dire Maul comes out, most people will be well past Deadmines.
---
" Like are we going to just have to randomly pick a server and pray our faction is doing well without having an option to swap? "
---
That's pretty much how it worked back in the day.
---
What? Feral druid was fine at all stages in wotlk. Completed everything with a feral druid and was doing good. Actually I have played wotlk with 7 different toons and it felt quite balanced and definitely all content was doable on all of them without isses
---
Put Han in a permanent loot position as he slides across the screen and have Chewie rubberbanding all over the map and it would be accurate ;)
---
It is uglier than the ultra wide addon
---
imagine not having beta access LMAO
---
Yeah I remember being the designated rezzer during onyxia, it was ridiculous lol. It almost certainly won't be in classic though, it was changed well before 1.12.
---
Played day 1 on Durotan and it was always VC.
---
VC on Frostmane was Vicious Cycle, the guild (at least on Horde, because that guild would destroy everyone in the field)
---
isn't current stormwind really stormwind 2.0 after the first one was destroyed by the first horde? guessing stonewind keep was replaced when stormwind was rebuilt by the brotherhood
---
For Alliance the I would say priests are interesting. Paladin is good but boring and druids are high skill but have limited hots.
---
Hopefully i live longer than he did.
---
Lol, Kalimdor to EK...
---
Seems your thought on what is truly valuable about Classic is warped, friend.
---
This is exactly why i want to avoid streamers.
---
Can you post that link here?
---
I was always herb/mining on my holy priest. I obviously didn't kill things as quick as dps, but I never had a problem farming.
---
Even the frost mage spec is very different in pvp vs pve.
---
what option in support did you choose? every one for live chat is grayed out to me
---
Why would Chinese gold farmers cry
---
So is a new zone.
---
You struggled with shattered halls? never had issues tanking that back in tbc on my paladin. I did feel like the ramparts mobs were hitting like tracks before the nerfs came in.
---
I think that's what I'm gonna do as well.
---
lvl 1 gurubashi arena last man standing
---
Be you to it. I've been in the lake this whole time.
---
Not banable, as things like this were often done in Vanilla, as long as you aren't exploiting glitches any way.
---
WoW Classic is only WoW Classic if it’s as close to the original source as possible.   Full stop.  Any changes would make it an entirely different game.  The whole point to this is to give us back the game we had before they, wait for it, CHANGED IT.
---
what's even funnier is you aren't going to get anywhere in the game at the rate of 2 hours a day. So again, the problem is Blizzard is thinking about people like You first, why? Because you'll pay them 15 dollars a month while hardly playing the game.
---
Now that the world will be covered in dwarf priests(it wasn't in vanilla) I predict locks will want to be alliance.
---
Good shamans will wreck you as a mage, grounding totem, 5-6 sec CD on earth shock, and purge really hurt you in the match up. However Mage is a strong pick all around. 
---
Rogues are exceptional in most 1v1's and sometimes 1v2's but usually get wrecked in the mess of zerg group pvp.
---
Get rock hard in the black more ass.
---
I've been with mine almost the same length. I've slowly been preparing her since it's been announced that for the first week, she can't expect much from me. She's supportive of my interests, but let's be honest, classic wow is a different level.

Based on straw polls rp-pvp is quite a bit more desired than just standard rpm realms. I'll post the poll if I can find it again
---
three locks is a must for the three curses
---
I seriously doubt Blizzard is going to forgo the paid faction swap or realm transfers. They even had free faction swaps for servers with too lopsided a population.
---
Nice try.
---
Picture or didnt happen :-)
---
Wow I accidentally created a 2nd a few days ago and now this fuck shit happens
---
Mages are great for AoE farming. Basically from lvl 25 onwards you just pull 5+ mobs, Frost Nova them and Blizzard them to death. It looks really cool. In raids you'll be mostly spamming Frostbolt.
---
Basically warlock = dots and mage = slow them and kill them
---
wholesome names

Korgath called it VC
---
Paladins only have 3 heals and they are all single target. Heal, flash heal and holy shock. Paladins are usually tank Healers because they have 0 mana issues.

Except, of course, which instance the guy actually meant, because Dire Maul is three instances. "LFG DM" makes zero sense if you mean Dire Maul.

There was also a bug with emails going out well in advance of the function appearing in the launcher. Got the email last night, opened the launcher this morning and it was there.

Asking to have a few servers set aside that are streamer free is "widespread panic and terror"?  For someone who doesn't care about streamers you certainly are fond of using hyperbole to defend them.

I'll leave you with this parting google search on the house.  Might be more people than you realize who don't want to play with streamers.

I'm pretty confident the cap is only level 30 for now. I think it will go to 60 at least a month before launch.

&gt; should actually read as "Nobody is arguing that private server data is perfect"
---
But it literally doesn't read like that. I am not super into having an argument about what you "think" they said, it's completely pointless. I was just basing my comments on what was LITERALLY written.
---
it was a bitch on release, we got a group of 3 of us that could do it without fail and got about 90% of our guild at the time attuned to kara by continually running it when one of the officers was just saying we needed to recruit people what were already attuned rather than help people get attuned, needless to say that guild got as far as clearing to curator before falling apart with myself and a few others leaving to join a better guild that actually helped its members
---
What? i dont think they were that hard? Most heroics were fine with except few who were shortly nerfed a bit.
---
Private servers? Or are you that confident in your memory from 15 years ago, that you're talking about "absolutely everyone"?
---
And well, as you can see, more than 2/3 people who voted on this poll say you're in the minority, so I sincerely doubt that "absolutely everyone" on "at least a dozen servers" called it VC.
---
I'm wondering too if you were using a wand when the mobs dies.(Your wand getting the killing blow)  There was a number of reports that this was happening. What class have you been playing? I'm curious if its class based because I know priests have a talent that buffs wands, perhaps its the talent interaction.
---
Pull mob, start running, prevent mob from leashing, continue all the way to Stormwind.
---
Those are the two old continents? Anything in there means no extra load times outside of those two only
---
I'm pretty sure I'm going to roll mage, but I'm having trouble figuring out professions. What are your guys' thoughts on doing tailoring and enchanting and then swapping tailoring for engineering (with a mining alt) if I end up doing pvp later on? Can't fully commit to making a decision on class because my friends all want to play Horde and I kind of wanted to play Pally, but oh well. Other than pally I'm interested in lock, but I just made a 60 lock on a PS, and I want to give something new a chance, so mage seems like the best fit for me. Is it feasible for a casual to get two lvl 60's and enjoy endgame content every now and again or should I just focus on one character?
---
I watched a youtube video about using a controller in WoW just the other day, [here is the link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-32RCVtbNjY), hopefully it is useful.
---
The tl;dr is that it is fine for general play, but probably inferior to a mouse and keyboard when it comes to hardcore pvp or pve. With that said, most of Vanilla raiding isn't that intensive, it's mostly having the right gear and knowing what to do. So depending on what class you plan to play I could see you being able to use a controller setup like the video at least most of the way into AQ, maybe even through the whole game.
---
Unless you're a hunter :) then everyone's gear is also your gear
---
and just one their hit boxes.
---
The people excited for beta probably aren't the type that will "burn out" after playing at lvl 30 for a month
---
Yeah, sorry about that. I'm in the US.
---
I've heard these mobs were hard to deal with. Are they really that bad?
---
Forget getting Thunderfury....you may not even get a raid slot my friend.
---
They will be very popular, and basically the only raid viable tank. Untill 4H Naxx fight you will almost never need more than 2 tanks. That's 2....in a raid of 40.
---
Your scenario of being mad at guild A and having options lined up to swap is very unrealistic.
---
Hemo sword spec 21/3/27
---
No, wait, sit down. Imagine if it was...  
---
... a 200-man raid.  
---
=o
---
96*
---
My favorite is Tipsout who flat out claimed that leveling would take 30% longer due to mobs being so much harder.
---
wdym what state on the beta? The beta is patch 1.12 from vanilla wow
---
On the bliz launcher there's a realm select above the "play" button, and if you're in you can switch from BFA to beta/stress test 
---
But there was eventually an email
---
This won't be like any launch previously. The initial release may have been big, but the game was relatively unknown. Expansion releases are also a bad compare because they added sharding and changed mob tag rules...etc. pserver launches probably the closest, but those didnt use layering which this will have. 
---
I expect frustration tagging mobs, but not to the extent of pserver due to layering. I think these stress tests will really tell the story though. Which is why I'm excited to have been included. If it's super annoying, I will be going to sleep around launch time and waking up 6 hrs later to start when tryhards have moved on and everyone else has gone to sleep.
---
7est right?
---
no it's not, and it's a million times more functional.
---
that would be great for banks, but probably not
---
It will be slow going but... say you make a good group of friends and you run dungeons alot it may not be so bad
---
I can never move the map from it's normal corner, just messes with my brain. Which is too bad because I like your balanced approach.
---
No worries and congrats on your purchase! :)
---
Okay, I understand that. 
---
But there has to be a reason that you prefer the base design choice over retail, right? I'm asking you what that is. There has to be a basis for your argument, I'm just curious about what game design choice that is and what you consider would change the sanctity of that game design choice if they were to buff the mobs damage.
---
You don't come to have a resounding statement like "NO CHANGES FULL STOP" without an underlying reason as to why. I'm not arguing against you, I just want to know why.
---
It's like saying "I like this book" and I ask you why you like it and you tell me "Because I like this book." Doesn't really work.
---
Alliance side on my server we did.  I think part of that was also because it was a pain in the ass to get over there and get a group going to we usually did the whole thing or nothing.  As for VC, I said in another comment that a LOT of groups wiped at the boat to the point where people left.  So, you were almost always LFM VC.  I think it just kinda stuck
---
Challenge accepted see there there bud!
---
I bought mine already but went to snag another and it says its currently unavailable still lol. Wonder if it sold out instantly
---
Warriors are insanely gear dependent though. I don't recall warriors ever topping the damage meters without being so insanely geared that it was just a given.
---
Top slots are generally controlled by rogues and mages, from what I recall. Warrior dps was passable, and not a wasted raid slot, but by no means worth writing home about.
---
Warrior will be more useful for both bgs and dungeons than a hybrid ret/holy paladin
---
Orc shoulders. 'Nuff said

ok thanks !

Frost mage needs different talents to compete in PVP and PVE.

It sounds like no one will be able to help you on this one lol. You have so many preexisting conditions you want met  you got to figure it out on your own.
---
Kaplan oversee separate classic timeline with brand new content plz
---
You realize a layer is going to have the same population as a 2004 vanilla server, right?
---
It’s like a math problem from the 90’s. Love it
---
Accurate in reference to data literally means perfect, correct in all forms...
---
Back in vanilla not everyone had interrupts and those fireballs did hit like a train.
---
Was VC on US Daggerspine, I never thought of it as distinguishing from DM tbeing the purpose though. I thought it was cause people generally first encounter the dungeon at all is when going for VanCleef's head, and the quest text doesn't really say Deadmines in it. 
---
       
---
Just like when you say LFG Hogger or Vagash.
---
Horde or Alliance? I have a group of my own RL friends that will be playing, although more like half of us did play back in Vanilla. Maybe a group merger is in order?    :)
---
I think theyre counting down to when we get to save names
---
It says both but if you go in and it only shows you the Stress Test server then that's the only one you have access to.
---
He's giving heals
---
I’m in the Beta and am not a streamer and am not a 2004 account (but I did play Vanilla 2005/2006) on the account I currently use. 
---
I do renew my wow sub in 6 month intervals and a friend of mine that has only been playing for this expansion got a Beta invite, and he also renews in 6 month intervals. Who knows...my guess is it’s RNG.
---
We had 5 of us in quest greens.
---
Got our ASS HANDED TO US. But looking back on it.  The time we spent in there made our little group stick together as friends for all of BC and WOTLK. Those moments are why pre cata wow was so damn enjoyable and why I can't wait to get back into classic.
---
yeah but to learn the wand recipe you need 75 enchanting. good luck with that part lol
---
Enjoy it man. My wife and I play wow and other Blizzard games for years and we can’t for our son (almost 8) to start playing with us.
---
You get 26 hours to play.  Based on start and end time:   4:00 PST to 6 pm PTS next day.    
---
Only level 5.
---
No one ever wrote VC in my server. Even post Diremaul patch.
---
That does seem like a thing. Thanks :)
---
Resto is great for raiding, but the other specs are really fun in PVP. Elemental has mana issues which is why it isn’t good for prolonged fights like raid bosses.
---
I literally lol'd. Thanks for pointing that out 😂
---
Yes my fellow paladins were annoyed with me in wrath because I would never download pally power.
---
I thought my character names would be very secure. I've never had any issue using them, but when I logged into a thing we don't talk about around these parts, about a third of them were taken.
---
Gonna have to make sure I have some back ups.
---
To my understanding VC was mainly an American thing.
---

Also here. Exact same
---
Gonna make a paladin to duel or a warlock
---
priest is the most OP at that low a level if i remember correctly
---
Sharding just completely murders wpvp on modern WoW. My friends and I used to lead huge city attacks and would literally never see another player of the opposite faction... And no, it isn't because our server was horribly unbalanced Alliance/Horde wise, I think we were like 60/40.
---
Dragonblight 2004. VC here too.
---
Nelf Druid and running to Elwyn
---
Not going to get anywhere by what metric? Are you trying to say that people who don't focus on getting to 60 as fast as possible don't deserve to play the game? Vanilla isn't about that for most people.
---
&gt;So again, the problem is Blizzard is thinking about people like You first, why? Because you'll pay them 15 dollars a month while hardly playing the game.
---
Yes, Blizzard is making sure that their paying customers can play the game that they're paying for. It's weird that you would act like that's somehow a bad thing.
---
If you go warlock.  Go horde.  Alliance against all the will of the forsaken racials is a pain.
---
I made it. It doesn't have any customization options but if you'd like I can upload it and put up a download link. It's just for classic beta currently.
---
Have to wait til I get home
---
On forums like mmochamp I have only seen NA players call it VC
---
WTB mirror, can't watch at work =(
---
I remember back in the day the best healer in my guild was a Druid. Would frequently top the healing charts and overall just a solid player. I was a priest in vanilla and I tried so hard to out heal him lol. 
---
That being said just do want you want. The min/maxers will make up 1% of classic wow. I will main Druid for classic wow and I’m not worried in the least bit of finding a raid spot as restro. 
---
Each class has its pros and cons. At the end of the day WoW is a game and it’s meant to be fun. Will my Druid be a stat machine? Probably not. Will there be some guilds that don’t want me because of my class? Maybe so. But will this 30 year old boomer have the time of his life playing a class he enjoys? Absolutely!
---
A blizzard employee said that? Where?
---
Those that confused them weren't the ones running Dire Maul, they were us nubbies trying to get into those groups. I remember learning it as VC for that reason
---
Nice
---
I want to join the one with faster battleground queues. Waiting 13 minutes for a WSG still hurts me. However, close enough that world ganking isn't out of hand. Being on the low end of a 40/60 is about the limit.
---
we did something similar but ended up doing naked lvl 1 boxing championships
---
Stress test is max level 5 for 26 hours.
---
Yeah I hit the link instantly as I got the email and it said it was unavailable already
---
from what ive heard cats and moonkin are not a thing in raids. seems like raiding as a druid you are only a healer
---
That’s absolutely what someone would say if they liked a book.  You don’t always need a definable reason to like something.
---
Since there's no dual spec, how expensive/feasible is respeccing often? Say I wanna play a shaman, that will heal and raids but whenever I want to do some PvP or anything I'd respec into ele, is that something I can do on a daily basis without having to grind for gold?
---
I've been really wanting to play shaman but if respeccing is a big deal money-wise and I can't use any specs for both pve and pvp, that's kind of a red flag for me.
---
Warlocks are awesome! Everyone loves having a warlock in their group/raid. Warlocks have fantastic utility in their ability to summon people and soulstone the healer. You definitely will have no problem getting a place in raids as dps. I have no idea why you would have heard their dps isn't that great, because warlocks have great dps.
---
As a paladin. I will destroy anybody in terms of healing.
---
That seems like a good age to start out. He will be older all too fast. That's awesome you and the wife have that time. Had a wife/ husband duo in vanilla guild. They were awesome.
---
I played on 3 servers all said DM for deadmines. It seems vc was an NA thing.
---
Classic design philosophy, not classic design. 
---
This is what we want.
---
...
---
Except for the druids. They got "balanced" way too fucking hard in TBC, lol.
---
yep and when i saw it the server was down and has been down ;.;
---
I Had this in Legion Beta and I am FaniIly &amp; Friends so I am aware of this issure.
---
Hunters are world pvp beasts and great all around if you're casual. Hunters are the fastest levelers. Warlocks are third fastest levelers and still good in world pvp, top tier.
---
Just think of the next three months as the install process.
---
low level dungeons sure, higher end content?
---
maybe... if you have skills and a good group
---
I wouldn't recommend it
---
The BC Reckoning has nothing to do with crit
---
Nobody says lfg DM when going to Dire Maul. It's DM W, N, E or Tribute.
---
Lower level dungeons shadow can heal just fine, but as you get higher up you would need to respec.
---
Fantastic
---
If you mean dungeons while leveling,  yes it will be perfectly viable. If you mean at max level, it would be pretty tough
---

So they didn’t say that anywhere? I haven’t seen any blue post saying that with a lot of people thinking the same thing.
---
&gt;(RP reasons)
---
spec 51 in OwO
---
Doesn't it say 'Deadmines' right under your minimap?
---
Blizzard found a good compromise.
---
Fuck off.
---
&gt;I’m just old and don’t have the patience to deal with guilds, specific raid times, etc. I just want to play solo and small dungeons and raids that can be done with quick pick ups.
---
r14 isnt possible that way, its like 10 hours raiding a day.
---
I played vanilla on Eitrigg-US and it was called VC
---
I played a paladin classic thru Wrath. played like 2 months of each expansion after that up to WoD.
---
I think I'm going to do it again. Maybe I'll finally get that damn judgement set.
---
Fuck that, horde raid on hogger.
---
Fair enough.  I've honestly given up finding "the perfect class," I just want to get a better idea I guess of which checks the most boxes, and then go over the pro/cons and see how they line up.
---
For instance:
---
Hunter or Shaman may be what I want, but I hate the sound of guns/xbows which are the best weapons at max, and Shamans have the most required keybinds in the game.
---
If they are the exact same in every aspect besides those things, I would probably play Hunter since it's easier to get over the gun/xbow thing compared to trying to manage 40+ buttons. 
---
That's a really weak example, since I know practically none of the classes are able to be compared side by side like that, but that was at least my hope in posting today.
---
I played a Warrior throughout Classic, TBC and a large portion of Wrath. SH was a nightmare to tank as a Warrior. I'd sometimes even respec to Arms to get our Pally tank to run it instead.
---
What other way do you suggest I view people playing the classic beta?
---
Certainly not impossible, but I think each respec costs more and more capping out at 50g per respec.
---
Played lock in vanilla till naxx and had alot of fun while playing it, but the most boring part was the SS farming before raid. Was quite powerful in pvp, even with pve specc. Was solofarming elites alot (4 months) just for one recipie, and did it with a breeze, and learned so much while doing it. Warlocks seems like a meh choice, but when you master the lock and even got good gear, the fun is off the roof. Class quests are interesting part and you get free mount and cheaper epic mount.
---
Whut?
---
Man, all you Chicago people. Does it still count if we plan on moving out of the city limits within a year? Is there a webpage or discord to organize us? PvP server?
---
I'm not super familiar with OSRS but I'm pretty sure ur talking about a 4:3 aspect ratio game on a 16:9 monitor or something where there are reasons/restrictions of why it makes sense that OSRS is that way.
---
However when ur on a 32" 21:9 aspect ratio monitor, whether its an "RPG touch" or not, your neck WILL be killing having to glance over to track cooldowns and such.
---
I guess you can say its a subjective taste and its not my place to judge, but I still think its an objectively worse experience for ultrawide if you did that rather than leaving the sides clear for peripherals, it greatly adds to immersion.
---
Having a blast so far!
---
Who did ever call it VC and what is it even supposed to mean? 😂
---
Just contact Support. No need to believe me lol. I Had 2 PTRs in all Accounts 1x PTR 1x old Beta I instantly got invited after removing one. As I said, had Same issue in Legion and the Internal Account Team fixed it for me.
---
Survival Hunters were only really viable once you were basically full T6/Sunwell loot. You needed an insanely high amount of agility in order to justify going surv over BM. Endgame endgame.
---
Black Morass did suck. I recall the hourglass trinket was too good not to farm for, though. I always loved Hyjal, but my brother was a tankadin and it was just enjoyable seeing him have so much fun, lol.
---
I mean, this is just plain false. There's always a reason that you like or dislike something. Though sometimes it's subconscious. But there are defining reasons which make you like and dislike things.
---
So why do you like Classic WoW? Is it just because you just do? There has to be a reason as to what game design aspect you like about it or dislike about it.
---
Narrative narrative narrative.
---
You are one of those deranged fanatics who spend hours on the internet defending a billion dollar company from having to work a bit harder. Just amazing.
---
Our token ret paladin at the time was only invited to buff Blessing of Kings and to stay out of combat so he could resurrect people.
---
The one mob that I love going up against as rogue. Kick and gouge normally only ever lets her get one fireball off
---
VanCleef. The big boss of the dungeon.
---
&gt; They just copy all characters at the time they launch and then there is no system for abuse.
---
1. Have friends vendor all of their items and give you all of the gold they have.
---
2. You and friends log onto a VPN and started logging into your accounts. Blizzard will auto-lock the account due to suspicious activity, but can be unlocked via an email.
---
3. Access your email and authorize the account unlock.
---
4. Log in and delete your characters (except character A with all of the gold).
---
5. Day or two after launch, have friends sign in normally - oh noes!!!1 my stuff has been hax0r! 
---
6. Blizzard does a complete character restore from a version prior to the items being deleted. The $12/hr customer service rep isn't going to investigate too far into it. A cursory glance will show that foreign IPs signed into the account, but really only a seriously dedicated person is going to start sifting through logs looking to see where things went. The rest of the CSRs (who are currently unhappy with Blizzard anyway after the major layoffs) will just authorize a complete restore with all items and gold.
---
7. Profit. Your character now has however much gold and your friends all have their gold/items back. You can split the profits between everyone.
---
I’m seeing other people having it removed and nothing new. I think this is a different issue. People with 1 ptr got the email with nothing in lunched as well.
---
i agree tbh, the style is quite nice. someone else put it best but if i want to see real life i can just go outside, show me something that isn't right outside my window in video games
---
Feelsbadman
---
I was VC on icecrown as early as the first week after launch
---
That orc ran all the way to Deathknell? Respect
---
it's quite expensive, but doable. you could also be a healer for pvp with a premade?
---
Etrigg xfer here, it was DM
---
It sounds like mage and rogue would be right up your alley unless you want to heal pretty much full time in which case you will want druid.
---
#NotMyDeadmines
---
I'm with you
---
And 2 levels higher. And the priest was already at 60%
---
Raids are limited to 40 players...
---
I want:
---
Phase 2 (DM, world bosses) in 1 month.
---
Phase 3 (BWL) in 3 months.
---
Phase 4 (ZG &amp; Green Dragons) in 6 months.
---
Phase 5 (AQ) in 9 months.
---
Phase 6 (Naxx) in 12 months.
---
TBC in 18 months.
---
I think the only thing weird about this video is just being able to cast it on shadowed mountains far away.  I think it might be because of the longer viewing distance in classic compared to original vanilla?  I remember chaining eagle eye but it was always shorter jumps, couldn't really click on mountains on the other side of the zone.  But my memory could be bad, as usual.
---
When I played in Vanilla we called it VC after the boss VanCleef
---
Same here, this is my first time hearing about this...
---
Everyone following asmongold and esfand for hogger raid. Should be fun.
---
That's very true. Lighting is also a factor, I feel. I'm one of the few that do not appreciate the famous darker nights. I'd like to see what's happening on my screen, I don't want to sit here and squint lol
---
yes, for 1-60. not for late game.
---
Haha, that sounds great! When the time draws near, message me on here!
---
No one ever wrote VC in my server. Even post Diremaul patch
---
&gt;from 4–6pm PDT
---
&gt;most of the players will get to level 5 in a few hours
---
I'm not going to say it's going to take all 2 hours to get to level 5, but competing with the mass amount of players on the stress test will add some time to it.
---
And to be honest, low level dueling, raiding hogger at level 5, and having an RP kumbaya around a campfire doesn't sound like my idea of enjoying classic
---
Hey, thanks for projecting how you feel about things. Do you know any good streamers tho?
---
That could be mean two things.
---
Why did you think this thread would work
---
Ursin checking in, VC on there too
---
I'm going to say Holy Pally. However, it looks like you're looking for a dps toon.
---
Won't be banned for it. We did this all the time in vanilla. It's smart play, if you can actually make it profitable.
---
Cmorebutts
---
From the classic heavy weights movie.
---
"LFG DM East"
---
My man, I'm like -200k karma on this account haha. 
---
I just genuinely found that part interesting. You seem to want to have it both ways "competitive" but against people in the same "boat" as you. And as someone who has helped lead a 2 day a week guild on retail for 6 years it's possible to do on any server(population excluded), just because we don't compare ourselves to the method or limits of the world doesn't mean we aren't pumped up to compete against those other 2 day a week guilds we know about.
---
Hope that makes sense, I didn't mean my post to sound so snarky, I was just using your herbage.
---
wow
---
As someone who leveled to low-40’s as a sword and board pally (although not that exact spec), it will be slower going. But if you’re doing it for reasons and will enjoy the ride all the same, then go for it. When I was out questing, it was an extremely survivable spec. There wasn’t much around my level that I couldn’t solo, given time. And tanking should be fine in dungeons and what-not, especially as you seem to be targeting that in your spec choices.
---
RP server then? What region?
---
Incorrect. In vanilla when i played. It was DM. 
---
It was a single dungeon and people ran it that way.
---
Then you had DMT (hey bro you ever try DMT) for tribute.
---
It doesn’t matter if you live outside the city limits. There no site or anything. We are all friends since like 1996. We will have a discord when it gets closer. And yea we want to do a pvp server
---
Mage 100%
---
You played on Burning Blade EU?
---
Yeah, they have been good to watch so far, but the number of streamers who seem to match their quality of chill and informative seems to be limited. I was just wondering if people knew any no-name streamers or people who get less views that are similar.
---
If anything it's more confusing. My first thought is it's just misspelled "Wailing Caverns" when I see VC. Since if I'm looking to run DM, I'm not interested in WC so it passes me by just like people looking for other dungeons I'm not looking to run.
---
Dire Maul is stated with wing / type of run and so it doesn't mix up with DM as badly.
---
All other instances are abbreviated from their name, not the name of the last boss. Who would look for a group for WM(Whitemane), when SM Cath is so clear?
---
DM is objectively superior, just alone because its abbreviation is consistent with all other instances.
---
MAGA
---
Not really. While each class may be gear dependent to varying degrees, any of them can be played casually.
---
It might be (more) suggested to play a class that is capable of both leveling quickly and farming self-suffiently if playtime is limited...but again that's just a suggestion, and by no means a requirement for enjoyment.
---
does it trigger a loading screen now because of sharding?
---
For the alliance
---
You'll get mced and why would you do it anyway?  It's literally the easiest thing to get to make the trinkets or arcana.
---
Huzzah
---
Will there be pools when Classic releases? They were not in the game for about a year after release. Maybe longer.
---
VC is full NA.
---
I have never seen it on EU serv, and everyone using it is NA.
---
It's probably tied to the backpack.
---
Not for raids
---
Who is their target market then? I'm pretty sure the number of re-subs is going to make it obvious to them that the game appeals to people that dont play retail.
---
What is your concern going forward? (besides the layering issue)
---
We’ve always played alliance so we are going to continue that. Thanks though!

so removing the PTRs doesn't solve the problem. it appears when the flagging process was occurring, it saw the two PTR accounts and assumed one of them was the stress test, so it skipped the flagging process entirely. this is because the stress/beta shows up as a PTR account. The only hope is that Blizzard can fix it before it goes live
---
All spelled out in the email they sent you.
---
Priest (if they can get a wand) and shaman.
---
Shaman have a ranged attack, an interrupt that does damage, melee damage reduction totem, a nice little weapon buff, and a heal.
---
Priests will just melt anyone with a wand and dot and they can heal as well.
---
Sorry, he is by far the worst.
---
My optimism is my biggest weakness.
---
Shit, you're right, let me hop on classic beta. Why watch it when I can play it?
---
We need another lvl 1 higher raid.
---
I'd like to point out that classicdb uses data from private servers, not from actual vanilla wow!
---
Thanks for your opinion, have a great day.
---
I’m actually really proud of the OP of that thread. He’s doing his best to make sure Classic is as accurate as possible and admitted his research was wrong when confronted with better evidence. Meanwhile here...
---
&gt;PRIVATE SERVERS ARE WRONG
---
I’m sure both threads are helpful.
---
You sir are a gentleman and a scholar... I was bummed I hadn't got one before.. just ordered mine.
---
Fucking x-perl and titan bar... we sure did have some terrible addons back then :D
---
My memory of being a 5/8 T2 druid with [Blessed Qiraji Augur Staff](https://classic.wowhead.com/item=21275/blessed-qiraji-augur-staff) was out healing a Grand Marshall Retribution Paladin's damage with only a rejuvenate... In caster form. I think we were just fine as a healer!
---
Haha wow hey I live in Eden Prairie suburb of Minneapolis. You’re not alone!
---
But doesn't it run on the same client as BfA? This is not the Legion client but the 8.1 BfA client and BfA doesn't have PvP and RpPvP servers.
---
Americans because apparently they often mistook Deadmines for Diremaul.
---
Somehow..
---
only real ones start in tirisfal glades
---
classic supports addon options just fine, at least for the ones I'm using on Classic Beta now
---
I remember something like this too, the very first one.
---
Do elaborate :o
---
Collective willpower of many of us sorting by new. Want something that's more discussion and less memes.
---
Their fireballs hit for 150 damage which is in the 3 to 4hit range
---
It’d be very interested to see an alliance version of this. I’d snatch it up, for sure! I don’t play on ultrawide but I’d be interested in using this, I like the compact nature of it.
---
Thanks, just got one because of you!
---
Played rogue through vanilla and BC, but then switched to priest main early BC and for the rest of that expac. I'm leaning rogue, but priest feels so much more useful.
---
Isn’t it just 2 hours??
---
Why are we still here?  Just to suffer?
---
I don't think it was 10x, I think it was more like 3x to be honest. Epic ground mounts in Vanilla could be obtained by a dedicated person (or someone just really lucky with BOE drops) in a few days of resource farming. Epic flying usually took the average person a month. I remember going into WotLK seeing a significant amount of people never getting epic flying.
---
There is random upgrade system, stuff you get can randomly get upgraded in quality. So blues become epics.
---
From what I know the quest was for Van cleffs head so Ali would look for help getting the head hence VC
---
It should be easy but I consider myself more of a "jack of all trades" player and am comfortable with playing any given roll. I will say that I never want to just be *someone* in a sea of players and often do what I can to make a name for myself especially now that Classic will bring back the server community.
---
I feel as though that would be easier by rolling either healer or tank since they'll be the least played roles and therefore are more sought after than the mountain of DPS.
---
I would also consider Holy Paladin in place of Holy Priest if I were to roll Alliance and this would allow me access to a capable five man tank spec too.
---
Stress test is a server test. They want a lot of players. People with unusual hardware getting in is just because they want a varied set of hardware to gather data from. 
---
You can very well have a good computer and not get in. :)
---
The Problem is, If Blizzard remove a PTE it still exist. It Takes a bit, before it get deleted propperly.
---
Nothing User can do. But yeah, I got in with 7 of my 13 Accounts so dunno. But I removed PTR in day 1 cuz I knew of this Error.
---
But I wait for real invites now.
---
Why you 'stress testers' gotta flex on us that didn't get anything ;(
---
Did not get an email
---
wasent there a command to lower the spell details on aoe abilitys?
---
already gone but i snagged one as I was refreshing page :) thought it was a fluke but order went through!
---
Lmao vanilla try hard. Its easy
---
DM on Bleeding Hollow, horde.
---
It's already showing sold out. I got mine on [Walmart.com](https://Walmart.com) last night, they were up for a little bit before they sold out there too.
---
Good play on the counterspell
---
asmon is overgeared for all the content he's doing. He has almost as much armor as some lvl 35-39 warriors had in vanilla.
---
Wow this got you so upset you went straight to the "kid" insult first post. Breaking records today.
---
I just hope they resolve this soon. I don’t have to work today and am really looking forward to playing. Even if it is just for a few hours.
---
Fair one
---
Listen if you want to be real hipster you will say DM because Dire Maul didn't exist (before 1.3?). 
---
But for real, I never remember anyone calling it VC on the servers I played on back then.
---
Hm that is considerably different than I remember. By BWL i remember most our warriors doing top tier dps.
---
Well shit, guess im going to delete this.  That was really fast :/
---
oh man... to add to that, i had a good friend, a rogue named Malumbra, who told me one day he was gonna be off for a week going on a road trip on his new motorcycle.  He never came back online.  Its been over 5 years.
---
Gosh that would be fantastic. Old forums were the best place for entertainment, intrigue, and drama.
---
I hope so. I got a squelch for racism last year when I never even talked about race or made racial slurs. I was making fun of orcs and I guess Blizzard is a little sensitive to their plight.
---
xDDDDDDD
---
Sharding has absolutely nothing to do with peoples FPS, it's there to spread server load.
---
Nobody ever says LFG DM for dire maul, it’s always accompanied by a wing name. If we start calling dungeons by their final boss then what are we?
---
LFG R
---
LFG N
---
Blizzard please just implement Guild banks
---
Without them it’s doable but at a significant cost to the officers who run it
---
The only plausible argument I’ve heard against this is people having single player mega banks with a fake guild - solvable by placing minimum number of players in guild to have guild bank active (and if guildies quit then have access paused)
---
/flexxxxx
---
I’ve played a Protection paladin since TBC. I have very little memories of Vanilla as I was fairly young. I heard that tanking as prot pally is basically a no go for raids in Vanilla. So if I enjoy tanking should I just roll warrior? 
---
How rough is solo leveling as a Prot Warrior?
---
I though that was a strawhat on him
---
Lvl half heals half dps, you don't need all you talents in heals
---
Because literally everyone knows who Van Cleef is. The intro Human cinematic even references him. He’s a huge character in the game. 
---
If you’re sitting in Westfall and you mistake VC for WC, I promise the problem is greater than the abbreviation. 
---
You’re posting the best case scenario for Dire Maul, assuming the poster outlines the wing/type of run it will be, and the worst case scenario for VC, “I assume they meant something on a totally different continent.”
---
I don’t think you know what Objectively means. 
---
What makes VC “Objectively” superior is that it doesn’t share an abbreviation with Dire Maul regardless of assuming the poster outlines the type of run. And the WC mix up is really just a personal problem with reading tbh.
---
Tauren warriors can't rock phase one gear as fluently as orcs but anything after that tauren warriors will look way better in all gear imo. Especially the blue and epic PvP sets.
---
I think you are onto something here! This guy is clearly trying to destroy the economic state of wowclassic and be advantageous in pvp. He probably is with the Alliance!
---
*shits in the popcorn*
---
Yes, Hunters, and yes her pet will have taunt on in every dungeon as is tradition.
---
What you're saying is true, but I had to downvote you because while you acknowledge it's impossible to please everyone because we all want different things, you act like there is an overwhelming desire for vanilla OSRS. It's not a super prevalent opinion. Many people want it, but not nearly enough.
---
Aaah I didn’t get invited ;-;
---
Or maybe weren't American..
---
Can confirm, I'm EU and I've never heard anyone call it VC until today
---
The level 5 wand is a trainer recipe for 10 enchanting. You can **actually** learn and craft it at level 5. But you'd need a few greens and/or mats to enchant your way to skill 10.
---
I love your art so much!! Keep it up :D
---
It was a sad day
---
I love you both
---
Pretend I am not poor though ;)
---
&gt;obvious choice
---
Thank you, straight from your mouth 😀
---
Why?
---
Pretty sure they don't stack sadly
---
you will have to aoe a lot to farm... and without a taunt it could be interesting in a dungeon ....
---
I leveled as a holy priest on a pvp server, it is slow.. and you will be one shot by rogues. 
---
If ya enjoy doing things the hard way leveling as holy is the way.
---
&gt; a bit on the crazy side
---
Just keep repeating that to yourself.
---
RemindMe! 3 months
---
Ill likely be on a rogue named Troglodyte!  Either way we need to make this happen! xD
---
Doubt they fix if this Stress Test :-(
---
Shard farming isn't bad. My personal gripe with shards is the bag space it uses. It's really annoying filling 2 bags worth of shards to a raid.
---
Same reason I don't like hunter.
---
They ruined my good time of being able to kite everyone to death as a hunter in the 19 &amp; 29 bracket. But eh, worse things have happened.
---
 Check out 90% of the streamers playing it on Twitch.
---
I don't have an active sub but I've been invited to the stress test
---
I see where you’re coming from but these streamers wouldn’t have any viewers if they didn’t act like 13 year olds. That’s the type of entertainment their viewers love. Most of the chill, normal guys don’t have any viewers because that’s not entertaining. I’d say 95% of the top streamers on twitch don’t act “professionally” because that’s not what gets views
---
LFG dates and raid times
---
Don’t you put that on me Ricky Bobby!
---
True that true that.  I’m actually going to roll PvP server this time around and am somewhat apprehensive, due to your first point.  It certainly can dictate how you play.  Hopefully it’ll be worth it in the end though!
---
Holy shit this meme is legendary! I am still laughing out loud watching it or even thinking about it, people at work looking at me funny cause i cant tell them why, they wouldnt understand
---
&gt; New zones in old continent = no additional load screen
---
I don't really understand this, either. How is someone questing in the Wetlands *not separate* from someone else running around Un'Goro?
---
Bigger chance.
---
When I lvl a warrior I do a fury/prot mix so I can kill stuff alone while also being able to do dungeons
---
If you’re a content creator and you get bans on your account, they blacklist from inviting you to future events. Happened to Preach until they said they’d remove it from his record.
---
I’ve never heard it called DM in my life, I played retail vanilla for 1.5 years and TBC, that’s weird.
---
Yup, after reading the comments it definitely seems like an American, not server thing.
---
Well only a few hours left
---
Remember Raiding CVs across expansion? i might have my old one somewhere ....
---
They’re not going to sit around hand picking thousands of accounts to bring back for their beta. Also, if we knew that was the case people would submit a ton of garbage bug reports and add a lot of noise to their system.
---
Yep , only money alone was instant across your own chars. Items and other people was 1+h
---
I submitted a ticket and just got off the phone with a Blizzard employee. They are well aware of that conspiracy and confirmed with me that the 2nd PTR account is absolutely not related. I am in the camp of people who got an email but no opt-in on my client. All we can do is be patient.
---
Don’t forget all the poor orphans! My husband and I both play, we’re counting on the dogs to be able to cook and clean for the kids. That should work, right?
---
In what way is druids numbers inferior to all the other classes?
---
Healing touch R4 is more mana efficient (Healing per mana) than both shamans and priests equivalent, all of which are incredibly outclasses by paladins flash of light.
---
That is taking the spell data from wowhead classic and assuming you have all talents that affect it (so the +10% heals, the -10% mana reductions etc).
---
I came to complain about my 2005 account not having beta access maybe because I haven't been subbed to the new expansion until now? Did I come to the right place?
---
Wow this is beautiful. Is this Boston? Congrats on your IRL BiS
---
mages are annoying but cant train you, warlocks can chain fear you into adds
---
My only consideration would be to pick up the intellect instead of the streamers for the extra mana, but it looks like it’ll work out. 
---
I have been thinking about a similar build, but it ignores consecrate for improved ret Aura. Not sure exactly how I’ll go, because consecrate is so good for aoe.
---
Bonechewer US was VC
---
Sorry son, daddy's got kobolds to kill
---
Yep, it is referred to as Stormwind in the game though.
---
Pfft that's assuming I won't be a firemage SHOOTING FIREBALLS INTO PPL'S FACESSSSSSS

3. DM (I'm American)

Addon authors are talking on stream about building addons, discussing the 8.1 APIs that are there in beta currently - it was discussed on Joana's stream too, he's working on releasing the leveling guide for Classic. When Classic will launch in august, most likely it will be on the 8.2 codebase.
---
Depends on the healer. Druids are the easiest and pally is arguably the hardest.
---
But with a bit of tweaking you can become VERY efficient with mana and dps on any healer.
---
Shammies can auto attack with wind fury or flame tongue on a 2h staff and mana efficient attacks.
---
Priest can wand and dot 
---
Pally similar to shammy, just auto attack and conserve mana
---
Druids are easy because you can dmg without using mana, but you still can heal yourself and run away when in danger.
---
Nice view
---
Same here. I’ve only ever been invited to the SC2 beta, and I barely played SC2. It was a junk laptop too. I think they look for a certain array of specs in the user base to fulfill...I don’t think being a paying customer or loyal at that makes a difference—their pool of potential beta testers is so massive that you’re just the unlucky 95% of players who don’t get into betas
---
80 man highly unlikely
---
Nope, everyone needs to use the same style of models and since its Classic, obviously we're using Classic models
---
Phony

Bazinga
---
isnt there an addon that does a /who on everyone in the server then compiles the statistics?
---
No. 26 hours.   Just go read the Blizzard page about it.
---
Le bringing up sexuality in a place where it is never mentioned has arrived.
---
Not a content creator whatsoever, so maybe I got lucky or maybe my ban wasn't severe enough to warrant a blacklist, I have no idea.
---
Same here. Didn't know people called DM VC until today, and when I see it, it seems as mistyped WC...
---
It was one of the original US servers. I rerolled years ago when it was starting to die.
---
Vurtne, is that u?
---
Elaborate on what? There is no correlation between money spent on a Bnet account and beta invites. Full stop.
---
you dum dum, he just typed it out
---
As a Vanilla Lock I wish someone had told my guild that lol!
---
Hi, /u/Thebestguyever11
---
Yep. Stonewind is Stormwind, this was just a mistake they made with the manual (maybe changed names in game, but didn't have time to change the manual or vice versa). It is called Stormwind in the game.
---
The few moments I watched we was working on his ww axe. During the world pvp you could watch the manchild erupt. When he was winning, hes laughing and having a time, when hes losing hes nearly ready to alt + f4. Probably appeals to the younger audience tho. If that's a personality hes created then I don't understand it.
---
I figured there would be an automated system that could track the amount of bugs you reports. 🤷🏾‍♂️
---
rogue - can stealth ... is that a thing yet?  
---
priest smite is pretty strong early game too i believe
---
Selection bias. This sub has a strong “dm is the right name” circlejerk, so people who say dm care a lot more and are more likely to vote. 
---
Pretty sure that VC was more common in NA and DM was more common in EU. For what it’s worth, I played on Silver Hand, Azgalor, and Auchinduon (fresh BC server) and never saw it called DM until after cata launched.
---
I kind of think it’s going to depend on what your end game is and what your server is like. WoW Vanilla guilds were a lot more varied. For example, PvP twink guilds existed at certain levels (like 19 or 29). PvP guilds in general were a lot more common. 
---
Chat will be spammed with recruitment messages. Initially, players that hit 60 first are going to pool together so they can try and down raid content.  
---
I also think if you end up on a streaming server, it could impact that way the server functions. If it’s a really popular streamer, there might be a huge faction imbalance and this could impact the number of guilds. 
---
Also, what happens if that streamer slows it down and jumps to another game. Will the server fall apart when the hype and streamer are gone?  
---
Overall though, guild recruitment is going to be a lot more in your face then it currently is in retail.
---
Level fury you can still tank dungeons while doing so. Respec at 60.
---
Druids can be very effective healers and there is a spot for them in every raid in Vanilla. The argument people make is that in a purely theoretical sense where gear &amp; skill are identical to Priests &amp; Shamans, they will not top the healing meters. However, in actual raids the differences are less clear cut. I don't think anyone (besides a top-tier progression guild aiming for server firsts) will be gimping themselves by bringing a Druid healer, if they believe that they're doing something wrong.
---
Na, I transferred there the day it opened and played through all of vanilla and most bc on the server, it was VC.
---
1.12 itemization has a huge impact on deadmines and SFK I agree.
---
at lvl 5 though?
---
Hi, /u/Aeronquezzs
---
I think part of the nostalgia for classic was learning classes by playing them. An authentic experience would be choosing a class that sounds fun to you, within the framework of how you want to experience the game (open world PVP, battleground PVP, RP, raiding, all of the above...).
---
Some of the challenging aspects of the classes back then either made you rage reroll or form a deep bond with your character. I experienced the latter with my Night Elf druid. My connection to her was severed when they upgraded character models. She's a Tauren now!
---
I know this doesn't answer your question. Rather, it's a suggestion to embrace the unknown as part of the authentic classic WoW experience.
---
Yeah I got mine a few hours after the thing showed up on my drop down.
---
Honestly? I dont remember. I think it was separated though
---
apparently not, there is a blue post somewhere
---
It just works!
---
Ye but it's not that cpu intensive anymore in multi-threaded mode. It still, ofcourse, relies on the max frequency of the single core where it runs the main thread. In any case, running Classic in the modern engine with a modern pc = very high fps even in very crowded areas.
---
TILL THE BLOOD DRIES IN YOUR EYES!
---
That would still work in retail then.  That's not a unique situation towards what we are talking about.  That's just exploiting a flaw in Blizzard's account restore system and social engineering.  You could say the same about getting access to a person's bank or credit card account.
---
Someone got my details for my Ubisoft account once.  They sent a message to the Uplay help and said, "hey I don't have access to the email anymore since me and my brother... blah blah... can you please change it?"  I sent them a follow up message after changing the password saying "DO NOT CHANGE THE DETAILS.  I GOT HACKED THIS WASN'T ME."  Two weeks later I FINALLY heard back from the Ubi employee who said, "Sure! We can help you change the email on the account.  What is the new email you would like attached to the account?"  
---
TL;DR: Most CSRs are dumb as a doorknob.
---
In this patch we have Greater Blessings which bless the class you cast it on all with the same Blessing. So if you greater blessing of wisdom mages, all mages get it. They also last 15 minutes instead of 5, so it's a huge QoL buff for Paladins in raiding. There was also PallyPower mod back in Vanilla which made organizing and tracking blessings very easy, imagine we'll have something similar at release.
---
Didnt notice until it ended..
---
I bet it’s nice to have this many friends irl PepeHands Especially that play WoW? I’ve had maybe two acquaintances that play WoW, ever. You’re lucky.
---
It has to do with fps too. It also has to do with server load in terms of processing. It also has to do with spawns (it's not healthy for the gameplay to have 100 players competing for the same mobs).
---
My hardware is complete garbage so I always get in.
---
Better yet, don't put points in the healing tree at all because those talents are worthless while leveling and you can heal every instance fine in any spec.
---
omg it showed not available first...
---
Im feeling bad :-)
---
Thx!
---
Alone they aren't that bad. They have some high damage but are fairly easy to kill.
---
The issue is that there are like 20 of them packed in Moonbrook and you frequently get additional pulls. Plus being ranged makes it hard to pull them safely or to escape from them.
---
Imagine being an adult with a job and disposable income you can blow on whatever you want after having paid your bills, taxes and set some aside.  
---
Hard to imagine for a female elf playing no life neet.
---
Piggybacking onto the QA thread:
---
Are fishing pools going to be in the game at launch?
---
Yep, and originally Duskwood was just a part of Elwynn Forest, and that section is now referred to as "Brightwood" (in the past) in current canon.
---
Getting a slight advantage 1-5 would put you slightly ahead for 5-10 and 10-15 etc then if you kept it up you'd be clearing populated places before the hordes of people got there
---
I'm not saying the stress test is the best place to practice speed but that 1-5 zone on launch day is going to be packed so being Uber familiar with it is definitely not a bad thing . Also, it helps blizz prepare for launch day so there are as few hitches as possible on release.
---
Not trying to convince you of anything, just playing some devil's advocate.
---
O0 no sir your not the boss of me. I'm up voting and you can't stop me... Showed him.
---
Ouch that hurts :(
---
Definitely rogue. If you like the braindead DH playstyle on retail, you'll like braindead sinister strike spam on classic.
---
Hey thanks for the offer but I’m already in a guild on a PvE server alliance side. 
---
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/carebears/images/9/9d/Lalb.png/revision/latest?cb=20161109202051
---
Blasphemy!
---
It will be online tonight starting at 4 PM PDT. During 4-6 PM PDT they will be doing server announcements etc and thats when they want everyone one. The Stress server will stay open until 4 PM PDT Thursday night. So 24 hour access.
---
Definitely. You don’t have any to be a hardcore raider. There is nothing wrong with being in the guild for help. And the cool thing is we can go out and get a beer. I’ve been wanting to go to 3 Floyd’s for a while now.
---
Probably for the best lol it's a headache overall
---
I didn't start until TBC, but others are saying that the quest for VC's head that took you into Deadmines didn't mention that it was in a dungeon, so when people started LFG they would type LFG VC like you would if you were LFG Hogger.
---
Imagine trying to rationalize buying gold with your real life money in a 15 years old MMO. 
---
If you don't see something wrong here you are irredeemable.
---
Dire Maul came out later. Anyone who says VC is an inbred.
---
"Removed gold from the economy."
---
Except that the economy isn't fixed in WoW.  Every single gold came from a mob, quest, or vendor somewhere.  It's not like you took trillions of dollars and burned them.  No one is else is affected by how much gold you have unless you used it to buy up the entire AH and inflate literally everything, which is probably against the ToS.
---
Considering it's not an option to select...not sure how that is confusing.
---
I played a resto druid back in 2006-ish vanilla for most of the entry raids like MC, ZG, and a little BWL and I've also played private servers as well.  
---
Druids (myself included) often topped the meters as well with very low overhealing.  I think that was a function of HoTS vs. castable heals and how the meters recorded. Paladins/Priests/Shamans always had way more overhealing.  Also very well timed Swiftmends typically padded the healing meters as well.  So I would say Druids are very good healers and can be used just as effectively in PvE, but that's how as a Druid you could top the charts pretty easily (and that may have been the case for you as well).
---
I do think a lot of it has to do with the information at the time (or lack thereof) and the experience of the players in the guild.  I think from raw healing potential, Priests are still #1, but Druids certainly held their own in PvE healing (especially if you used your Innervate on yourself...)
---
Just my experience anyway.
---
Mythic is a harder action game. Vanilla is more repetitive and grindy and requires more farming. Thus you can't say which one is "easier". Not saying anything too fancy :)
---
Tons of people
---
But idk how many are lfg VC in a major city
---
&gt; How does that even start?
---
Could be from people not having the goal of "do a dungeon" but rather "finish this quest in my log that asks me to kill this 'Van Cleef' dude."
---
Ha, and waste precious energy I could otherwise use to spam Frostbolt? I think not. 
---
That’s not minmaxing 😤

Shamans are quite good in the regard of respeccing, if im not mistaken there is a spec which allows you to raid heal comfortably, and still have powerful ranged dps for BGs/WPvP/Dualing/Grinding you name it.
---
It's just a mix of the resto and ele tree
---
You got 2 options. Rogue or druid. Maybe fury warrior if you can patiently wait for gear.
---
If you say VC.  You have something wrong with you.
---
I mean pretty much all classes are brain dead currently in retail.
---
:'(

---
Doubt anyone cares about the free stuff, it's beta.
---
In the very early stages of the game many people like myself who had never played and MMO before had no concept of what an instanced dungeon was, so it went by the quest that was given to kill VanCleef, and it stuck on those particular servers.
---
Tried this on private servers, was disappointed that it didn't work
---
Just sent a text asking to move a date tonight after seeing a stress test invite in my inbox
---
itshappening.gif
---
My neck beard would climb off my face to assail random Blizzard employees. Honestly it would be beyond even my control.
---
What do you mean? How do they expect me to play this stress test without having recount and dbm at the least. I cant even use bagnon to have a clean bag setup. Fuckin smh. /s
---
I appreciate your enthusiasm for sarcasm, but to become a master you mustn't use /s.
---
*I'm a human being, and this action was performed manually.*
---
not even close. 
---
But good on him nonetheless.
---
You spawn with lightning bolt and healing wave. Rockbiter at 2 (technically you can train it at 1)
---
Level 4: Stoneskin totem and Earth Shock. (Earth Shock interrupts)
---
Hots from different druids will overwrite each other
---
1. Get to raid entrance.
---
2. Log off.
---
3. Go for an IRL walk and eat some food.
---
4. Come back 5 minutes before raid starts.
---
5. Profit.

From the official strategy guide published in Nov 2004, "VC" can be used interchangeably with "Deadmines". So the VC abbreviation definitely existed prior to Dire Maul's existence.
---
I leveled as shadow in Vanilla and could heal all dungeons up to sunken temple without issue. Then i started to notice that my manareg wasnt enough anymore and i changed Talents.
---
Combat rogue or fury warrior.
---
&gt;  Current difficulty takes the challenge away completely, it’s a 100% faceroll.
---
I don't know. On the one hand I enjoy challenging content, on the other, it would also be satisfying to see the ultra smug elitism from some of these people who talk about how hard the game used to be take a hit. 
---
But we all know they'd just mental gymnastics it away and say Blizzard nerfed it..
---
This is likely at the Residences at Riverbend Chicago.
---
Yeah you can track herbs with it as well. Handy for sniping Black Lotus spawns.
---
Yes it means you got in
---
It’s not open yet. Read your email.
---
They do at least on N****Dale.  I had a pally I was leveling and tanked with ret aura, thorns, and fire shield all on me and all procing.  It was nuts, like 50 damage per hit at level 30.
---
Every class will be strong with gear in vanilla, something ppl miss
---
Hi, /u/ConfuzzleThrowPillow
---
You’re right. 
---
I think it’s more because he said he wanted to experience the game in an honest way, and that fell to the wayside pretty quickly.
---
I feel like this should be on the side bar. Best way to get more use.
---
Okay well best of luck to you guys! If you ever change your mind, my offer still stands :)
---
nUh Uh, ThAt’S tOlDaGoR fRoM bFa
---
I will be streaming, but will do my best. really I just think they want to see volume in an area for this test. Not sure what else we can do really, level 5 cap and all.  But if theres something you want me to try by all means message me
---
&gt;mainly eu because dire maul was already out when they got it. 
---
Exactly. Why would NA ppl ever randomly reffer to DM as VC when Dire Maul didn't even exist. Its product of confused Europeans who cant shift-click for context lol.
---
Its definitely not Vanilla-only players.
---
I played from Vanilla on and off but in the EU, when I emigrated that account was abandoned and not linked to my new one.
---
My current US region account was only created \~Cata, and since then I've played on and off, with a 5-6 year break during WoD/Legion, only came back a week after BfA dropped.
---
So it can literally be anyone. 
---
(Only a 2-hour test up to level 5 tho, so wont see any talents or even get a hunter pet. I'll do it anyway, just to help them test load on their servers, tho they will still melt on release day )
---
And Dire Maul was often DiM, not just DM
---
Lul. This a troll? Warlock is a bit more intense than huntards I'd say.
---
Aegwynn 2005. Also VC.
---
It really doesn’t matter since at level 5 all classes will just be auto attacking and using their 1 ability.
---
And healthstones! ;)
---
Do you happen to have a couple of links readily available? Would love to see some hunter stuff.
---
A toaster.
---
From what I can recall of my mage days there was only 1 spec for the longest time, frost. Not because it was the "best" but because everything was immune to fire. I dont know what patch they changed that but eventually you could use fire in MC and BWL. Then you get to AQ and Naxx and need the power of fire.
---
I might go mage again because I know and like the class but there might be a lot of them. Then again if you're good you might stand out from the rest.
---
I still have a few months to figure it out. I thought about going priest or paladin but I'm not sure how I feel about healing. Was healing a little looser and minor mistakes wouldn't get everyone killed? That's what I'm most worried about.
---
Then again I will miss my portals and mage food... that made my life so easy.
---
Same thing is written on some of the mountains in The Barrens as well. 13 year old me was pretty stoked when I found that.
---
VC... only a damn ogre could name it that
---
rallying cry of the dragonslayer
---
you'll still be able to play on the stress test server until thursday
---
After playing a NElf Warrior Tank in Vanilla myself and the missus agreed to do a complete 180 and play Classic on horde. If we were Alliance my class of choice would have been easy -Priest- however as we are playing Horde I now have the option of playing a Shaman as well.
---
Solo leveling won't be an issue as I'll be playing together with her, I like both's tier sets and have previously play a Vanilla Shaman and Priest to the mid level bracket so mostly its around end game party participation (as healer) etc. So aside from that are there any compelling reasons to play Shaman vs Priest?
---
Do you know if hots will stack in Classic? Meaning more than 1 rejuv or renew on a tank in raids
---
In  [current year] people try a lot harder to snipe the healing meters, and since druids do not have a “flash” heal, they get sniped extremely hard. If no snipers, or of snipers are oom, or if raid is taking huge damage, the druids are good healers.  
---
In pvp a Druid has more important things to do than heal, such as flag running, and anchoring bases. And they also have neither a dispell or a purge which does not make them a good fit to healbot a big Zerg.
---
They have the commendation officers in the cities so my best guess is that Silithus is in the post-AQ state but the door is closed.
---
It's you.
---
Yep. Amaziballs.
---
Ah very nice. Cool spot
---
Destromath was VC as well
---
does beta/classic have the restriction on names where you cant have the same letter 3 times in a row? 
---
its like that on pserver but i didnt know if it was a live thing too
---
&gt;says DH  
---
no, not really. Especially compared to DH
---
Hunter, Fury warrior, and rogue are probably vanillas most complex end game rotations. Everyone else essentially spams 1 button, so for endgame pick anyone but those 3.
---
however while leveling warlock can be pretty keyboard intense. Your typical rotation would be
---
Send VW, Corruption, Agony, tab target, Corruption, Agony, Wand/Drain
---
You could also use immolate if you want, some people condemn its use.
---
But around 6-7 buttons per pull is pretty high for most classes.
---
If you really want to hit the fewest buttons. I'd suggest resto druid, as healing touch has a 3.5 second cast and its the only spell you will likely end up using.
---
I  never liked that  the made the entire world Azeroth.  I liked it better when Azeroth was the name of the southern human kingdom in the eastern continent.
---
What is the precise 20/31/0 spec you're talking about?
---
Isn't that something that will be looked down upon by your raid (for not having ideal heal spec) and for pvp (for not having ideal ele pvp spec)?
---
If people respect classes going for these hybrid specs, I'd be all for it.
---
honestly, same? like i like darker nights but not super dark, i remember trying to use the inky black potion (a thing on current that's supposed to make super dark nights) and going... well. now i can't see shit. i have made a huge mistake.
---
and i generally do prefer brighter colors and i respect warcraft's commitment to that, even if that gets it called childish and immature and ugly by people who love realistic mmos with approximately 2.5 colors
---
i think this is a good time to post this
---
http://www.joeydevilla.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2006/06/the_dangers_of_wow.jpg
---
Paladins can tank all non raid content in game and are particularly great for Stratholme and Scholomance,
---
for raid tanking yeah thats a big nope for prot pally.
---
Get wand spec and spirit tap. Wear spirit/stam and spellpower/shadow gear. Until 40 your spec is immaterial a smite priest will do similar xp/hr to a mindflay priest (though I’d argue mindflay is a bit better with access to silence).
---
On beta, my mindflay ticks for 25 and my smites hit for around 80-100. As shadow you’ll open MB &gt; pain &gt; flay till melee &gt; wand. As holy you’ll holy fire &gt; pain &gt; smite till melee &gt; MB &gt; wand 
---
I dunno why you’d be 1 shot by a rogue any more frequently as a sub 40 holy spec priest vs a sub 40 shadow, up to 40, holy and disc have move damage mitigation talents, just having the spell pushback resistance from holy is huge early levels and PvP in general. No one wants their 1.5s flash heal taking 3s.
---
Not using world chat
---
gear wise? No, probably not but they could have collected up Int pieces to be ready for healing as an enhancement shaman, or whatever that a vanilla wow player wouldn't have. Healers at that level with no other MMO experience were probably healing for the first time so there's a ton of variability in skill level. Add in healing abilities and their various ranks that people leveling up either intentionally didn't buy or didn't have the money for and there's a potentially significant gap in what their abilities do.
---
No, stress test only, my dropdown in the launcher shows the same, but if you only got the stress test email yesterday then its stress-test only, if you're in the beta you would have gotten it before
---
13 mins isn’t long but doubtful you’ll be waiting at all. Regardless, this being classic there is always something you should be doing in between ques.
---
I'm curious if we will even get them because it seems like it's from a 3rd party, maybe not
---
God damn casuals
---
Thats such an entitled opinion. Period.
---
Not at all, in vanilla you can't inspect someones spec so it's not as strict as you'd think, i mean that is if you aren't in a hardcore guild, i'm not sure what a hardcore guild would ask of you but even so i'm almost certain a shaman doesn't have to go deep resto to be super effective.
---
It’s DM there’s no question about it. You don’t name a dungeon after the end boss of it. Lol wtf
---
I played horde all my life and will be rolling alliance for classic!
---
Do you even BC?
---
This is just another nail in the coffin for how stupid VC is
---
Dire maul was always east, west or whatever. Nobody said "LFG DM" to mean diremaul, ever. It was specified.
---
THE PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN
---
I've played on 6+ EU servers through the years and not once have I seen it called VC. I did start to see it once I tried international private servers though.
---
Powershifting ferals are fun, really enjoy them.
---
Thank you friend. The timing of this post gave me hope as inwoke. Lo and behold: a stress test invite. Ill be right there with you, captain!!!! We going gnomes??
---
Reverse of that imo, spirit then wand. But it really doesn’t matter, point is your first 10 points should go to those
---
reading is hard
---
All the current Retail realms have forums. I would expect no difference for Classic.
---
anyone else not seeing the download in their client? got the email invite but cant download even after restarting/relogging
---
I got into the stress test but don't have an email...
---
Lfg Closure
---
Herb + engineering is an underrated combo.  A few dreamfoil gathers has more value than 10 rich thorium veins.
---
Screenshots are a thing.
---
Read your email and any of the thousand posts on this. No. You're just in the stress test, no Beta
---
&gt;world chat 
---
Looool
---
I got suspended once in Classic for telling someone to "quit being an asshole" when he was being a dick to someone in the world chat. Received a whisper from a gm mid Uldaman run on my Warlock later saying I was going to be removed from the game and i barely had time to read it before I was kicked. Felt bad for my group because it looked like i just randomly bailed lol. Was only like a few hour suspension but I never get invited to things (except stress test now). Wonder if that flagged my account.
---
DM - Deadmines.
---
DM North, East, West - Dire Maul.
---
Naming specific people certainly doesn't help. By no means do I think you were witch-hunting, but we've approved posts along the lines of "How do you think streamers will influence Classic?"
---
So, broad questions are fine, but we try to avoid any content that focuses more on a streamer than on their content (as, at that point, it's more about a person and less about Classic).
---
There's a blue post that says more than the people ever will: https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brqzge/the_plot_thickens/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
How are these people so dumb
---
Min/maxing seems to be the standard on retail. Where people are downloading 3rd party programs to simulate their potential BiS gear. For Vanilla min/maxing is much easier to do.
---
We will see more of it, not less.
---
Maybe the masses are happy with not being a man child?  Weird flex identified.
---
they dont have shield till 6, but they do have fear
---
this guy's a god :O
---
I feel like it would cost more than overtime money 😅(for the first 1-2months for sure) 
---
And besides that fact it's no fun buying gold. You end up not appreciating it and don't enjoy it.
---
Im saying they are the same... What people have been saying is that private servers had like 2x damage. But it really does not
---
Been checking my email all day in work actually, I haven't had anything through. Other posts I've saw about the Stress Test seem to just say Stress Test: WoW Classic and not have the Beta &amp; infront.
---
But thanks for clearing it up.
---
They changed the name of the beta client because it's the same one that's used for both. If you have access to the beta you'll see the beta server. The stress test server won't be up for another 6 hours
---
I see your point.
---
The right side of the screen is elements like map, skills, inventory. I cant say whats it like to play on an ultra wide, but I see the purpose of this addon (recreating the RPG-feel in some way)
---
Can you help me understand the purpose of linking that in response to someone saying "no one thinks this", with zero further elaboration, if not to say "yes they do"?
---
You got it, I was literally just correcting the original poster who said:
---
IE: There are plenty of people that were saying that private server data was accurate.
---
Once you out level Westfall, you don't stay there bruh.
---
Prople may be at the AH, training, etc. Or a 60 may offer to carry.
---
I'm NA and have played since 1.12 before BC and never heard it called VC til this thread. I have played on at least 5 different servers between vanilla and WOTLK as well.
---
We should replace LFG Hogger with LFG Southwest Elwynn Forest.
---
Hi, /u/crnipajo
---
I might be a warlock lol. The name would still be Profark though. Hit me up a few days before!

Sorry to break the news to you, but creating and joining chats is a thing, and a lot of people do it.

Healing touch has the same cast time as both heal (the most mana efficient priest ST spell) and healing wave (the most mana efficient shaman ST spell). Flash of light from paladin is both faster and more efficient by a mile so nothing really competes with it.
---
Except Dire Maul had nothing to do with Deadmines being called VC.
---
Source: https://web.archive.org/web/20050518092536/http://www.thottbot.com:80/?i=5664  was called vc before dire maul even came out
---
Ok Privie go back to Nostralomos
---
Other people saying Combat Rogue and Fury Warrior are spot on. Leveling the warrior dual wield isn't exactly optimal but it's serviceable if you know what weapons to get from dungeons and quest rewards (RFK quest sword + thrash blade and you'll cruise for a long time, quite a few decent early dungeon drops).
---
Both classes at max are cleave machines that are constantly hitting/critting. you'll see a lot of numbers when blade flurry/sweeping strikes + whirlwind get pressed, it's a good time.
---
 You still can most easily find a group by popping into Westfall.
---
Ashenvale is iffy because of all the mobs, the reason why I like that bridge is there's no NPCs around that spot. Panthers are a little to the south and wolves are to the north, but nothing is right there at that bridge. Although that being said, Ashenvale has a lot of very safe roads, especially near Maestra's Post, BUT that won't be easy to get to as Horde.
---
If you're only seeing the stress test realm in your realmlist, sorry friendo, you've only got stress test access.
---
On vanilla Skullcrusher and Bloodscalp it was only ever DM.
---
I look forward to seeing how this progresses. Good luck!    
---
What sort of inputs are required for this to run? I wonder if it could be paired with a genetic algorithm, so it could iterate on talent builds (or gear, but that seems like even more work).
---
It's also offline the rest of the time. Unless it starts 1am this evening.
---
oh i only played that as a pally and thought it was really simple. Really enjoyed doing speed runs on it ^^
---
You can't be an adult right
---
A friend and I might be interested
---
MODS PLS!
---
Post naxx should be a 20 man raid, it’ll have catch up gear for naxx, being between aq40 and naxx in difficulty. In addition to general good loot, there will be a host of prot Paladin, ret paladin, feral Druid, balance Druid, enhance sham, else sham, spriest gear to help make those spec more viable. Shadow/mp5 gear, nature damage, arcane damage, hit on spell power mail and leather, etc. 
---
Just tune karazhan for 20 t2.5 level 60s and itemize the loot for the above.
---
I really do think it depends what server you were on. I've played on several EU servers for over 14 years and not once have I seen it abbreviated as VC.
---
Once I started to play on private servers (which are international), I saw VC starting to pop up. We even had the discussion internally in our guild, and pretty much every single EU guy would say DM, and every NA guy would say VC.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brqzge/the_plot_thickens/?utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_source=share
---
the same types who only runs Catherdal, GY, Lib only
---
Baron and tribute are a couple of bad examples, but VC is probably post Dire maul, whatever people recall. It just doesn't make a lot of sense for it to have happened before.
---
You can't tell from the client dropdown. You can only tell from your realm list. If you only see an Offline Stress Test realm - then you're in the stress test not the beta.
---
I've never been into it and haven't noticed any on the Beta.
---
If Blizzard announces an RP-PVP server, I might consider it though. Not for any RP reasons, but to avoid the types of players that definitely wouldn't play on an RP server. Namely streamers.
---
This ain’t viet cong guys.
---
Aight that's fucked *cries in retail*
---
Its VC. DM is for Dire Maul
---
I like to think saying "VC" implies success in clearing the dungeon.
---
Like saying "Emp Run" for "we will kill the Emperor in BRD!
---
I loved the waves, so cool.
---
Right in dem feels.
---
this is something ive still not decided on
---
i played warlock vanilla and loved it but wrath i started healing and liked that even more than dps.
---
i also always wanted to play mage but never got one to 60 vanilla
---
so atm im thinking mage, lock or paladin , i also played alliance vanilla but am consider8ng horde if i dont go paladin
---
so far im leaning towards paladin but if i go paladin ill prob want a mage to grind on anyway 
---
i think i may go mage first get maybe mc gear then at some point transition to paladin healer when i get the chance 
---
this way ill have a decent alt mage to farm on and the paladin healer i know ill 3njoy
---
Diremaul at lvl 20 sign me up.
---
Bunch of retail scrubs getting confused
---
If you just got that either last night or today, I think that means you're just in the stress test. If you're in the beta you can log in right now. If it's just the stress test it won't show any active realms
---
Live nodes still won't show up on the minimap.
---
i'd take imp HoJ and divine int for sure.
---
If you check the comments you'll notice that everyone calling it VC is from US
---
Well you spent the time to write that comment, so apparently a few of us
---
Of course!
---
It’d be interesting for sure, but I’d be concerned with the thinning of resources and possible disparity in the quality of the additional content.
---
As for the progression of the new content, it could be mainly horizontal with only minor verticality. I know many don’t/didn’t like the idea of tier sets being used to “fix” specs, but it could be used as a means to make some of the... (for lack of a better term) “lesser” specs more viable or appealing to play. I know this idea was pitched in regards to how to handle new content for lvl 60 stuff, instead of a patch that’d change the fundamentals of a class/spec. Help try to preserve the spirit of Classic a bit.
---
I lost a girlfriend to wow in 2004.  Wonder if I lose a wife in 2019
---
Someone knows ? I got the same thing.
---
Vanilla design paradigms and limitations with Burning Crusade level of refinement in and fantasy in new content built in the old world. 
---
Sounds like heaven to me.
---
On stream that is...
---
Pvping without /follow sure sounds like fun huh
---
Its easy to shift click the level of theplayer who is looking for a DM group to figure out which one they mean
---
For me, I lose interest around level 13 or 14. Idk why but it’s a real problem
---
Just that whatever u were saying makes no sense
---
They seem to be using VC to refer to the boss in this case though if you read most of it.
---
What are you talking about? It's not "gif", and it's definitely not "gif", it's "gif".
---
It really does seem like that if you scroll through this thread. We talked about it in my guild on (n)dale as well and every EU guy would say DM and every NA guy said VC
---
What's the shortcut for Gnomergan?
---
lvl 60
---
We very often ran strat with 3 two hand warriors and 2 shamans. One on main healing duty and the other on extra healing/more totem focus/dpsish. It was possible, not sure where people get their info from that elites instakilled on shield tanks.
---
i checked my e-mail adress and i have no e-mali from Blizzard but i have the beta stress acces on my launcher
---
This is not true. I submitted a ticket and spoke to a Blizzard employee who assured me that they are reading the forums and saw this theory and that it is not at all related. She said they are still working on the issue but having multiple PTR accounts is not to blame. Unfortunately, being patient until they release more information is all we can do at this time (I am in the same camp as you, OP). Also, I received my callback from Blizzard support in about 2 minutes, so if you have doubts feel free to submit a ticket.
---
Make sure your signed up for the WoW Classic beta it is a different sign up that WoW beta
---
Just mirrior :-)
---
&gt; Not at all, in vanilla you can't inspect someones spec 
---
That's all I needed to hear, mr. raid leader will never know.
---
I'm taking a full week off with my brother. Gf is moving back to her mothers for a week...
---
Yea i had the BFA beta and i got both e-mail and launcher client
---
Yeah... that works great for about 5 seconds
---
Should have horde option too because they never do it
---
Hi, /u/Flakeybrut
---
Please check your dm's , i've sent you a message :)
---
This! u/Strobber7
---
how was it originally though? I thought it was 10% per mob
---
Exactly!
---
remember to grind the azshara rep thing for mc too
---
Most people here tend to hate on them and say they’re bad for the game
---
Intravenous feeding is the real way to go for dedicated players.
---
False, Eagle Eye can just be casted.
---
Be my guest
---
If you plan to play on a pvp server you’ll want all the head start you can get
---
Then maybe it was both =), I remember VC long before Vicious Cycle was so prominent
---
It's the blood scythe I want, I'll have no other way of getting it.
---
I used to be flagged "friend of blizzard employee" or something like that, NEVER got a beta in my life...
---
Did beta test appear on the launcher?
---
... Go watch your movie dude.
---
I don’t think there has been a word about this officially, but I’m 99% sure this will not be the case. Starter accounts won’t have access to classic at all imo.
---
Really? That's odd.
---
TLDR: Warrior, H Priest, Mage, or Warlock?
---
I'm planning on playing with a friend who wants to give classic a try, but doesn't think he will keep playing after a month or so. He was planning on being a paladin so I was thinking about being a warrior. I'm very interested in tanking, but I'm worried about the poor leveling experience if my friend decides he doesn't like the game and stops. I also generally like playing wanted, but less popular classes and all the polls show that warriors are going to be the most popular pick. So I'm also concerned that I wouldn't actually get to tank end game content.
---
So I was also thinking of leveling a priest by myself and only using my warrior to play with my friend. I would probably level as shadow and try to heal dungeons as it looks like going all in on tank or heals isn't needed until 60. And at 60 switching to a full time healer.
---
I really like being able to quickly find a group quickly. But I was also considering going either mage or warlock for dps. I'm interested in both PvE and PvP although I'm pretty casual at both. I doubt I'd have much ability to do PvP as a tank, and healing in PvP isn't as fun for me as actually getting kills. I also think being a healer or tank would make doing solo content out in the world more tedious. 
---
In retail I would level one of each to see what I liked, but since leveling in classic takes quite a while I'm thinking of committing to one (or maybe two) early on.
---
I'm calling it VC and you can't stop me
---
Lots of rice huh?
---
Vegetables with dip is always a winner in my book. Endless possibilities!
---
It’s all about whether the hunter has CD’s. If he has no scatter shot it’s goodbye. Or in BG’s if I get a cleanse it’s goodbye. Once you get in there gave and they have nothing left to get away with it’s over.

I'm fairly certain Blizzard did NOT pick me, lol.

That's a let down.

Thanks anyway man.

Sounds like a warriors wet dream.

P.s im going warrior
---
When talking about the quest, it's Van Cleef
---
When talking about the dungeon, it's Deadmines.
---
When talking about the quest after you complete it, it's Deadcleef
---
And when talking about the dungeon when you power level a lowbie through it, it's Van Mines.
---
Yea I see what you're saying.  But I play real time vinalla pserver for practice, made another rogue last night and did 1-10 just for fun. No point of me logging into the stress test tonight because not only do I already have 1-5 down for the race/class im going to be playing, but I can just watch the streams tonight while im leveling on pserver. The stress test isn't supposed to be fun, people just get delusional when they see "Beta &amp; Stress Test" and think "OmGG BEtaA WE MADE IT BOYS! THisS AbouT To BE so FUn!!" But dont realize it has nothing to do with the full beta, they are simply a lab rat surrounded by hundreds of other lab rats all competing for resources and mobs in a very small area.
---
mines and stockades were some of my favourites
---
dm is just such a strange long 5man there is something strange about it like its almost lile a mini raid there are all these different theme areas
---
you do the mine area then there is the middle part which is a bit different and the ship area which is totally different again
---
it also feels like a massive distance you travel and like a weapon drop in there makes leveling so much easier if you get lucky.
---
i prob just like it because its the first instance i guess but there is something about it , it just feels so different to any other dungeon
---
Blizz blue balled so many people with this. lmao
---
Burning blade was VC
---
Substitute with potatoe or pasta or just do veggies and no carbs, Totally up to you
---
hmmmm 
---
well I might see how it goes
---
im sure ill have one of every class leveling lol
---
Stabby level faster bro you're falling behind.
---
My initial play through way back when, minimal addons like titan bar and maybe DBM (or equivalent) Was a great time, i plan to do something similar again.
---
If you can’t type out a 200 word essay by the time frostbolt is finished casting you need to work on your son
---
What is the term for the male equivalent of a widow? I thought it was widow too?
---
Was about to type out my cooking plans and advice but it’s a really really easy thing to do or look up elsewhere. 
---
Might go and ask in a cooking subreddit what classes are the best for farming in vanilla?
---
That being said, bulk cook stews/casseroles and you only have to cook every few days 
---
There, I contributed.
---
What's the debate really? Regardless of how the abbreviations came to be:
---
* If you refer to the Deadmines as "VC", it's maybe confusing the first time you hear it and then unambiguous forever after.
---
* If you refer to Dire Maul with a cardinal direction (e.g. "DM North"), it is always unambiguous.
---
* If you refer to either of them as "DM", it's always ambiguous without more context.
---
Of course there would always be referring to both instances as "DM" because it's not a rule, it's just an efficiency that most of the playerbase adopted.
---
Thanks, I hate it.
---
The point that the original OP was making is completely irrelevant, so I am not sure why you felt the need to address it. I was only comparing the person you responded to with the specific comment I linked.  
---
The person you responded to:
---
\#MakeAzerothGreatAgain
---
fucking yikes lol
---
Depends on the class. For Druid I don't think you get a real feel for what it can do until your mid 30's. 1-10 is just wrath/MF spam. 10-20 is bear spam. 
---
At 20 you get cat form, but its not that great until 32 I think. By around then you have enough versatility in your forms that you can get a good picture of what its all about.
---
Other classes are simpler to just know if its for you sooner. I knew Warlock was a fun class for me before I was level 10.
---
Honestly I think it's hard to say. Imo you're better off researching the classes and finding gameplay and discussions about their level 60 gameplay.
---
The reason I say this is a lot of classes have "fun breakpoints." For example, getting mortal strike on warrior, or the massive power spike on enhancement shaman when you get corpsemaker + windfury.
---
That said, there is some validity to just playing through on your own. Personally, my vanilla beta character was a mage, which I enjoyed. On release I rolled a hunter on release but wasn't a huge fan of the playstyle. Re-rolled a rogue and never looked back
---
Enhancement yikes!
---
I just meant for horde DM isn't really worth the time or effort... This sub should be called wowoverreactions lmao
---
Good for you 👍
---
Generate? other than research I don't think so. Someone may have already compliled one, though or maybe you can get a bunch of exampled from here.
---
Many a nightmare of a mage poly casually strolling into another group of enemies in strat/scholomance...
---
I understand why you would say that but...
---
The players that will be ahead of the curve will probably not want to fall behind while ganking lower level players.
---
The only real disadvantage I see (if you can only get one week off) is the auction house sniping on week one.
---
It's just the stress test. Btw, asked every few minutes.
---
this was awesome lol
---
I know it still works in retail, but nobody gives a shit about trying to cheat the retail system that way since gold and items don't mean anything anymore. There's barely any semblance of an economy.
---
But in Vanilla/TBC/Wrath it was totally different. We'd "dupe" big BOP drops on the semi-regular to double up things quickly. 
---
When the first Staff of the Shadow Flame dropped from Nef, we did the normal DKP stuff and then looted it to the wrong person. People in raid-chat would type normal stuff "LOL", "HAHAHA WRONG PERSON IDIOT" "IT GOES TO X NOT Y LOLOL" and then submit a ticket asking for it to be given back to X. 
---
A GM would message Y to confirm they were indeed giving it up, and then they'd "take" it from them, ask you to relog (to save your character and verify it was deleted), and then it was done. BUT, if you had Y delete the item from his bags first before the GM messaged him, then the GM would just confirm you no longer had the item and just create a new item to give to player X. Player Y would then message a GM a few days later saying he deleted it on accident and needed it restored. Since there was no record of player Y submitting a ticket for anything, that GM would just say "Oh we're sorry you did that! Here you go!" and restore the item. They never saw that an item was "taken" by another GM.
---
I dont understand how many people seem to have married someone without sharing the same interests
---
my wife is gona be playin classic with me day 1, the only concern between us is finding enough friends to join us!
---
pshoo, we ran full 5 shaman groups all the time. I think we cleared every 5 man dungeon in vanilla.
---
I spent a month or two farming epic flying just so I would have it to chase people down in world PvP and next to no one else had it. Honestly was something that felt really good to have because of it.
---
I mean we always have PvP, but dungeons are just a big yawn fest. I’m going out and betting that only Eranikus in ST will be hard because he’s 55 and people tend to do it at 48. That includes the big dragon packs before him.
---
Dude, none of that shit matters, nor is it comparable, for the vast majority discord will be used for voice chat like the programs I mentioned were for vanilla. 
---
But I will say discord is a great compromise. You can make your little community with like minded people that dont want classic but still want to play it for some reason. And I can ignore it. An add-on changes the game.
---
https://i.imgur.com/Zq0iBJK.jpg
---
Joke about naming convention based on target of quest versus location of quest. Makes perfect sense, imo.
---
I did this for ages, each toon i got to about 20. and then i just chose one to level up to 60 and leveled something else up periodically
---
Is being a priest going to basically be "Dwarf or GTFO"?
---
I told her it's either classic or crack, so pick your poison.
---
But I'm really ill 
---
*Fake cough*
---
i feel like alot of info in the video is abit off ... getting spirit tap is good in shadow for leveling but nothing else up until 40 when you respec for shadow form - theres some holy talents which buff your smite/holy fire (searing light, divine fury, holy spec). Inner focus too is a much better pickup than rank 1 mindflay.  
---
mind flay is pretty useless until lvl 36 when you rank it up, wands just do more damage before then and improve SW:P isnt worth it since mobs just die before then anyway.
---
Depends how much layering spreads the load of people out. The last few expansion launches have been pretty smooth for the most part outside of the first hour or so. If layer spreads players out it won't be that bad. I wouldn't delay a whole week to avoid 1-2 busy hours and then be behind everyone (if you cared about keeping up with the initial wave of levelers).
---
It depends on what you value more. To me, being in-line with everyone in that first week is more important to me than having increased productivity as a result of fewer people at the lower levels in the following week. 
---
I actually have quite a bit of fun in the initial zerg, even if it can be cancer at times.
---
he asked how they're so dumb, not how many of them are dumb.
---
The guy was just giving his opinion on the dungeon, not sure how it was an overreaction?
---
I don't think they've said anything but almost certainly not.
---
Wut?
---
Yeah I was hoping there was a database that would let me apply appropriate filters to get the result.
---
well part of why im considering going healer from the start is to make friends, the social aspect is so much bigger in Classic and perhaps being a healer will help
---
plus I like healing lol 
---
maybe im just lazy....
---
"hey mr warrior.... you go do the killing, heres a few buffs and heals, now do my bidding!"
---
Yeah even the best pservers aren't perfect  in terms of replicating wow.
---
I mean blizz can't even do it perfectly and they have the legit 1.12 reference client 
---
Not trynna be that guy , I play pservers too, but they aren't the same. They're similar but it just isn't identical.
---
None of the greens they sell are unique to that vendor.
---
How much do you usually make at once?
---
Planning on playing an orc shaman. Was going to go skinning/LW but seems like a lot of people think LW isn’t very good? Haven’t played consistently since Wotlk would appreciate some advice
---
 The hardest choices require the strongest wills.
---
&gt;not moving for a full day PLUS eating like shit doesn't seem like a good idea.
---
Jokes on you, I've been training my body for this for years.
---
This needs to be a pinned post:
---
Whatever you enjoy playing will be the most fun. Dont make it a job. Dont worry about damage meters. Dont worry about leveling speed. Play what you enjoy.
---
Now if the only way you can have fun id by crushing others in damage or something...then you might as well play fury warrior or frost mage.
---
Yeah I know the feeling
---
Shouldn’t even be a question. No one yells in chat for a full 3 part dire maul group. It’s DM:E, DM:W, or DM:N like you said
---
It was called VC on the Oceanic server starting with T (don't recall its name).
---
Stress test accounts are stress test only
---
You're legitimately clueless if you think Vurtne is at the level of previously professional players.
---
You convinced me.  :)
---
Let's be real here, the real reason is because blizz jumped the gun with armour and weapom design since vanilla. I transmog my gear in retail to try to look like those vanilla sets because I don't want to look like something straight out of final fantasy or another animesque game
---
Wooo! I made it in the stress test!
---
You might be able to make seraching for them a bit easier by looking for vendors that sell unique patterns too, they tend to sell both or neither.
---
Bleeding Hollow - VC as well
---
As far as I understand it will be a lot more hectic than retail launch. Each layer will have like 2.5k-3k players still.
---
All we learned from this poll is that 72% of people on this sub are wrong.
---
Just found this podcast and I've been loving it. The "Ask Kevin" series is by far my favorite. Can't wait to listen about each class as its really helping to decide which one to main.
---
i guess what i meant to say is how well do ret pallys perform at this patch.. i started playing during TBC and i know id always get shit for playing ret from people lol
---
Our warriors definitely weren't. It wasn't until AQ that we saw some of them geared enough to compete. We had some top tier rogue/mages too though.
---
But by AQ you then begin seeing other breakout classes like Warlock begin to shine, too. Honestly by early Naxx you're pretty set with any option between rogue/mage/war/warlock. Not hunter though. I was a hunter, it was a sad time.
---
Just give pally a taunt, boom
---
Seeing as the comments from [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brpjqy/correct_deadmines_abbreviation_finally_confirmed/) seem to imply that abbreviations are tied to player's geographical position, I've decided to actually prove that theory. Please don't hesitate to vote, I'm curious to see the results!
---
gnome is good. getting out of slows is very nice. better for raiding too. ud is a meme i think
---
Do you hate Stuns or fears more
---
You will be in for the stress-test, not for the beta. So happy hunting till lvl 5.
---
It isn't bad at all considering it has a two minute CD and fear will be working properly on classic servers, unlike private servers that did not increase your run away speed by the correct value. Fear &gt;will of the forsaken &gt;guesswhatfear.
---
As an old school player, I always referred to Deadmines as VC, even before Dire Maul was released. Different servers and communities probably called it differently though so who gives a shit.
---
You like pressing buttons are more of a passive kibna guy?
---
This has been the case for years.
---
Burning Legion was VC.
---
Vanilla ice cream vanilla cupcakes vanilla milkshake vanilla almond milk Vanilla Coke and vanilla meringue
---
Yep. Can confirm. DM is Dire Maul.
---
I really can't think of a reason not to. I mean, they can easily afford one extra server per region.
---
Most core abilities you have by 20-24
---
Zepp from Brill to Org. Run down through Durotar's Eastern flank and through Ratchet, down into Dustwallow Marsh and catch the boat to Menethil Harbor (Wetlands). Then proceed to Dun Morogh through Loch Modan.
---
Be advised you will be dying a lot and corpse-teleporting to catch the boat.
---
[full disclosure : I started about a year into TBC]
---
I'm 66% persuaded that I will switch from playing Horde to Alliance this time around. I'll also be picking a class I've not played at max level before.
---
What I liked about playing Horde (orcs, trolls and tauren) was Durotar and the Barrens. The area felt like the frontier. We were pushing into the unknown. Forging a new future.
---
The Alliance (and undead) areas felt more like rebuilding areas devastated by war. I actually switched to Alliance for BfA and I'd like to see how those areas play, since I never did them before the Cataclysm.
---
Oh yea I know, im just leveling on a pserver thats as close as it gets to classic because I dont have a beta invite. If I get a beta invite I would switch over and start doing 1-30's on there for sure. But the 1-5 stress test is useless to me, I would need the full beta.
---
Same happened to me: I didn’t have retail installed, had to install it before the option to dl Stress test client became available.
---
I'm assuming this is something they'll be testing themselves. Layering may not even be turned on initially, if at all in this test.
---
Why would level scaling be an issue for server? I mean sure, it has an effect, but pretty marginal i would say.
---
If you're playing now, you're on Beta, cause stress doesn't open for another 6 hours.
---
First time on this sub cause I'm a vanilla player coming back and just got interested.  This is probably true, and a nice sentiment, but when the masses of gen pop come in to try wow classic they aren'g going to give AF about your private servers and all the work you did.  I appreciate it, but let's have realistic expectations shall we?
---
Yeah right? Was pretty shocked to see people comment like that, just wanted to have a nice conversation and some clarity, but whatever, people will always be dicks :)
---
Be sure to report any bugs you spot.
---
Anyone know what the markers repressent?
---
But the guy you first replied was talking about retail, not about classic. I was just answering the question you were asking from him.
---
.. no tackle*
---
I don't agree with that assessment at all. I've mapped out my vacation &amp; it'd be a week off + the following Monday being labor day in the U.S. (which I happen to have off work). So I'd likely have at least a ~day advantage.
---
Deciding mage or hunter.. or something else?
---
In vanilla I played an undead mage up to mid 40s in tanaris and badlands and then quit since the family pc was so bad.  I also played an alliance rogue that I enjoyed.
---
I’m wondering if I just want to roll mage again since I never “finished it.”  Hunter I think would just be fun in general and I never played that class really much.
---
Play style would be more casual since I work now, but I want to do endgame raiding and I’m less interested in pvp although I’m sure I will do some.  I really like the idea of killing multiple mobs at once with aoe attack’s in order to farm gold etc.
---
As far as skills idk if I should do herb gathering and potion making (on mage) or skinning and leather (on hunter) or just herb collecting and mining to farm mats and make money as I progress.
---
What are people’s thoughts on this or based on the play style maybe I would enjoy something else?  I plan to play horde.
---
Shut up, you’re not even EU, you’re EA - Eurasia!
---
Seriously, though, why the hell is Europe and Asia separate continents? If it’s because of the Ural mountain range splitting them, then why isn’t Asia divided into north and south because of Himalayas?
---
Go watch your movie.. u paid for it. Enjoy that and go back to classic after. Classic beta will still be here.
---
Started playing in TBC on Anachronos-EU, so don't know if I get a vote, but I've never heard of VC
---
Same here mate, also EU. However dozens of people in the other thread call it VC and they seem to be from US.
---
I feel like melee and stuns are more of a threat, which is why I'm leaning Orc.
---
Vanish has never given a rogue invulnerability.
---
Gnomer is the shortest I've ever heard
---
I see where you're going with this. But does WotF break stuns?
---
DM (I'm NA)
---
DM (I'm EU)
---
VC (I'm retarded)
---
&gt;Are you saying there wasn’t an effort to create Blizzlike pservers?
---
I never once implied this, I am not sure how you came up with it.
---
&gt;This commenter is perhaps overconfident about the accuracy of pserver research
---
&gt;Nobody is arguing that private server data is accurate.
---
Is the comment you responded to.
---
Do you see the contradiction yet? The person I responded to claimed no one was arguing that private server data is accurate. The comment I linked literally argues that it is accurate. The extent of it's accuracy is irrelevant.
---
Some people really need an other to feel bigger than.
---
You're going to want to level a Shaman as enhancement. Leveling as elemental would be like leveling a druid as Balance
---
If I'm low level, DM = Deadmines. If I'm level capped, DM = Dire Maul and you'll have to spell out Deadmines.
---
Context is important. Also, while everyone is low level, Dire Maul won't even be out so it is a non-issue for some time.
---
If this post gets to the top, mages will be even more popular than they already are.
---
In original classic wow, there was no sharding or layering. So yes, anywhere you went you could see other players because they weren't in a seperate instance or whatever.
---
Why do they fall behind though? You just mention that they do never why.
---
There is no reason why they should fall behind since they have same or slightly higher coefficients than both priests and shamans, their set bonuses are not worse, so i fail to see how they would fall behind. Especially with mouseover macros being a thing in classic since you can use omen of clarity for lots of mana savings.

OP I raided in Vanilla as a HPaladin with 4H on farm.
---
At high levels, Druids were fine healers that could keep up with anyone else. I used to go neck-and-neck with Druids for the top spot on meters.
---
The main thing is that their efficacy falls off as the raid’s gear gets better and better, unless guilds explicitly start bringing fewer healers. Druid HoTs get wasted when healsniping becomes easier and more common, since players can dish out high-throughput, high-mana, 1.5s heals without risking going OOM due to consumables and T3 gear. Also, there’s usually less healing needed as guilds get better at fights, since they’re not making mistakes, have better survivability, and are quicker to pop a healthstone. Even in fights well suited to RDruids like Hiegan, damage taken goes down as people get better at dancing, and those flash heals while moving are easier to slip in.
---
This is one of the instances where meters promote bad behavior, and why I always preferred healing in smaller raids and dungeons.
---
Is it possible to get the raptor at lvl 40? Is there a guide?
---
NA checking in, 7 servers I played on called it VC during live vanilla.
---
What are the odds?
---
Apparently, because of VanCleef - which is bizzare to me because no other dungeon has ever been abbreviated as its final boss' name to my knowledge.
---
Here's a tip if you want to roll on a PvP server as Warrior. Go Arms, and take herbalism/alchemy. Once you're 35 go and learn how to make Free Action Potions. You can now world pvp in peace.
---
I have meat tubes that funnel pepperoni into my house and directly into my mouth.
---
Being there on launch day is more about the experience than anything else to me
---
Anyone else remember everyone running through the portal? 
---
But of efficiency you are totally right, spawns are slow and being there day one means fighting over mobs and whatnot
---
ig you level when the game releases just dungeon and level as the same build you wont have the currency to respec a lot
---
im not sure if druid or shaman can just heal in their leveling build but i know some healers can
---
either way there should be fuckloads of groups so just group as dps if you need to
---
Account created in 2013. Got invited to the stress test. Never had a max level character, ever.

I really like how you think. That seems like the perfect solution AND  it’s educational
---
Just don't die 4head. But seriously, it helps in the case of a scrappy fight where you barely get through with 1-4 alive. In a wipe who cares, they just don't have the option of being lazy anymore
---
Nice work!
---
Isn't there a zeppelin going from Brill to STV?
---
I really enjoyed your post honestly, it reminded me of a friend.
---
Had to repartition disk hard drive unit -.-
---
There are some “insta 60” Pservers that you can make a character and buy pre raid Bis gear and jump right into a BG to test out the class.
---
Undead rogue named Stabbbymcstab. This guy Classics.
---
Van cleef.
---
Blue posters have been wrong before
---
People mentioning their server, keep in mind the faction you played and possibly the faction dominance of that server.
---
Horde have no quest to kill Vancleef, so wouldn’t reasonably conceive of the name VC.
---
Alliance do have a quest for him, so through whatever logic could result in the name VC being concluded.
---
I played horde originally, on a horde dominant server. It was always DM.  When I made an alliance toon on another server (due to pvp server faction restriction), the name VC was predominantly used (some used both).
---
Ohhh, I see what you did there.
---
I have Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic, does that mean normal beta too?
---
DM is Dire Maul.
---
Exactly, this guy knows his stuff!
---
Rip
---
Fishing pools are in on beta.
---
Well shit, awesome. I never got any email about it, just checked my launcher last night out of boredom. Figured I didn't have it day 1, I wasn't gonna get it, and figured that was the stress test. Which is good because the starting zone was pretty empty for a stress test.
---
Bruh, how do you abbreviated Dire Maul then...?
---
I'll be honest, I'd probably buy from them. I don't have as much time as I'd like these days and it would definitely boost my play.
---
No I wanna do all three RIGHT NOW or I jump
---
I also have a Hunter and Rogue in live. None of them are complicated.
---
Priest or Mage?
---
I have mained a priest for many years now and I love the priest aesthetic (benediction especially) in classic. I love healing and being very helpful for a group but Ive heard healing in classic is very very boring which is a big turnoff seeing as if I played a priest I would probably only raid. Is healing in classic as boring as people say?
---
I’ve never mained a mage and they seem to be very fun and very powerful in classic while also being beneficial to parties via portals and food/water. But will I have difficulty getting into groups because there are going to be so many people playing mage?
---
Whichever I choose to main I’ll have the other as an alt, but I wanted to get a good baring on what I main. Thank you in advance!
---
Where do you think pservers got their data from bruh?
---
Don’t spriest, ret and ele have their own AQ sets?
---
DM =/= Deadmines
---
Yes I do but screenshots are not a daily part of my day. Why is everyone surprised that some people don't spend their day taking screenshots of their games?
---
Traitorous scum.
---
I loved my undead shadow priest healer - still do! - and had a lot of fun with her in battlegrounds.
---
I like the fact you have access to Stress Test and are subscribed but don't own BFA.
---
Good copypasta
---
Damn it I tried to hide it.
---
jk, have fun my guy
---
thanks!
---
Late 20's cat form starts performing. 22 you get shred, 24 you get rake, 26 you can use dash on cooldown, the 27 you have 5/5 furor. I don't know if front shredding will be a thing though.
---
Solid gatekeeping boys.
---
Vurtne was good when people didn't know not to keyboard turn.
---
TIL other people like aunty Donna :)
---
Whats the least gear reliant class which can do well at endgame world pvp? Probably going to cap out at dungeon gear, maybe very few mc and zg pieces and lower rank pvp gear.
---
Yeah this was the biggest obvious difference when I played pservers. I remembered vc being killable with a group of ~18s with a bit of struggle, but even at lv 20 average in the pserver we were surviving by the skin of our teeth if we didn't bug the fight.
---
Story time - the reason everyone called it VC is because you got a quest to kill "Van Cleef". Just starting out - no one really knew what the instance was called, but there was clearly a named mob named "VC" that was easily recognized by the quest in your log. People were just LFG to complete "VC" and the name stuck as not only referring to the object of the quest but as short hand for the entire instance. The introduction of Dire Maul only sealed the deal.
---
Yeah that's a bit worrisome considering in Dalaran people don't fight so there's not the load of all the effects BUT don't despair yet.
---
If you have Windows 10 I suggest searching for a guide on how to disable/limit Cortana, that alone is a huge boost to performance.
---
If you have older versions I think you can still find guides on how to improve performance for games, search for that specifically.
---
It's worth to try IMO since you said you don't have a chance to upgrade.
---
Worry about yourself.
---
For sure, much the same reason im thinking to make a rank as my main. I have slowly been gathering people on discord over time to make a guild as classic hits.
---
Honestly I look forward to these every time I come to this subreddit... pure greatness.
---
No, WotF only breaks Fear/Charm/Sleep.
---
Do I need game time/subscription to play during the stress test?
---
I don't even understand how it's a problem. If someone didn't state what DM wing they wanted, surely /who only to see they're level 50 or w/e would give it away a bit.
---
Too busy asking if you could, not if you should, eh?
---
who?
---
Yeah but don't you have to press a whole bunch of other buttons at the same time depending on what you want it to do? Sometimes it will capture the whole screen, sometimes just a window.
---
Chips and guac
---
lots of water + some more 'stimulating' drink like coffee or iced tea
---
Sandwiches
---
Microwavable stuff either leftovers or HOT POCKETS
---
Don't neglect your health everyone
---
Both have benefits. Ultimately, it should come down to aesthetics.
---
Why so toxic...
---
Yeah, If someone was lfg for VC in chat i’d have no idea what they meant and probably ignore it. I’ve played a long time and have only ever seen it called DM.
---
i un subbed from him ages ago like way back he seemed to be ok but everything became a huge drama and negativity is contagious.
---
i got out when he started having to deal with haters all the time and yeah back then he did seem to becoming pretty unstable.
---
whats his deal nowdays whats he crying about atm?
---
Isnt this the same guy with the clip where he got 2 shotted by a ret with seal of command?
---
I tested several naga mice and decided they are just too small for me.  If you're having the "Claw" grip you might want to look outside of razer.  I can't speak to MOBA mice but I've had a more comfortable grip with corsair and logitech products.
---
Orc. More damage from pets. Stun Resist.
---
I understand that. I just don't think it is fair to judge people if they don't roll for a chest similar to how you judge people that ninja loot. 
---
There is a high chance that you will be playing with someone who has never seen this in practice and will open a chest without rolling, not because she has ill intentions but because she doesn't think it is a big deal.
---
In the case if there was mining or herbalism node in the instance would you roll for the node? It is the fairest option just like rolling for a chest, but who actually does that? 
---
I am making the comparison here because I think that the value the stuff you get from a chest is not a big deal just like the stuff you get from mining or herbalism node.
---
Don't get me wrong, I do not think the person who opens the chest is entitled to the loot. That being said, I would not think someone is an asshole if they open a chest without rolling for it.
---
Why fishing?
---
It was VC on Bleeding Hollow. VC never made sense to me.
---
DM makes sense looking at history. Dire Maul wasn't even a concept when people started running Deadmines, so there was no reason to differentiate between the two at the time.
---
Just like how in EU they call a battle res a "CR" for combat res. For me "CR" means "current rating," but this wasn't a thing until MoP when arena teams were removed and everything became crossrealm.
---
I just write out "Deadmines."
---
I’m from US and never heard it called VC until recently. And yes I did also play in vanilla even though saying that has become such a meme now.
---
If you're talking about for the Stress Test, pretty sure they said PVP would be off &amp; starting zones will be sanctuaries.
---
You will get a stress test already when baby is up all night teething. 😉
---
Yes. If you're in for the stress test that's all you get, no guaranteed beta afterwards.
---
People aren't going to be out of the starting zones for weeks...
---
:)
---
Haha your classic play time is fucked
---
Gg
---
If you are doing pve you need ideally need to stay tailoring because the ag hit gear is bis until naxx.  Engr is totally worth getting so I would suggest dropping enchanting.  Go tailoring/mining and horde ore until you have enough to drop mining and level engr.
---
Congratulations though
---
You are such a faggot
---
How many threads like this are going to pop up before the stress test today I wonder...
---
If you only were invited within the past ~24 hours then it is specifically for the stress test. You don't get closed beta access afterwards.
---
Only for the stress and only to lvl 5. It’s like letting you lick the spoon while the streamers eat cake.
---
24 liquid breads and ordering pizza.
---
Yes I've actually have that fear too... Honestly just having lots of dialogue with sane people is how to balance your own mental, to get an objective perspective. Hope he doesn't just ban all who don't agree but try to have a balanced conversation. He already have an audience but there needs to be not so confrontational discussion but rather dialogue... 
---
Really would be good I think if he would talk to a proffessional but that's up to him ofc.
---
Just hope it doesn't go too far. :(
---
80man, 200man?
---
How about THE ENTIRE SERVER
---
no more gaming for you daddy
---
I got one too but the client is not available on my [battle.net](https://battle.net) app.
---
I didn’t die on my OG Paladin until STV.
---
You will eventually ;)
---
I started playing at 1.12 my server (NA: Bleeding Hollow) called it VC
---
How do you show them your specs?
---
you should have edited 2/3 of the rambling out. When I watch a video with poor speaking fluidity I end up skipping through the video to get to the point of interest. Stay focused on the topic and try to have a more organized production value.
---
I guess that depends on your definition of easy.
---
Personally I think it's pretty clear cut vanilla is much easier, because grinding and pot farming isn't difficult.
---
But if you consider grinding gold prior to raid part of the 'difficulty' of raiding then what you say is true :)
---
Personally I prefer to speak of the difficulty of the raid content itself, rather than raiding as a whole - as this would also include things such as recruitment / guild management etc.
---
Extra calculations per player adds up. (naive oversimplification inc) In classic, a spell hits and just does combat math, but in retail, a spell hits and has to run scaling math, then combat math. Also in retail their spell batch windows are way smaller, so calculations must run more often on the server for combat.
---
I love watching guys like Venruki play Classic and learning everything. They might not know everything quite yet, but they're so mechanically good it's really exciting to watch :D
---
More productive in terms of total exp gained? Sure.  But there is something to be said for the amount of fun that results from all of the hype and general excitement coming to its great crescendo on launch day that can’t ever again be replicated.
---
depends on the spec  
---
if you play BM hunter, then yea  
---
MM is so and so (I play it), Surv can get pretty complex depending on talents (the bomb build)  
---
Outlaw is braindead (pretty much unchanged from classic combat rog, sub is rather complex and punishing mistakes, not sure about ass)
---
I have these sealed microwave bags of lentil chili from coscto. And other packaged foods as well
---
Get costco membership
---
Probably should run naked as you'll have no way to repair your gear once you reach your destination. You'll need that extra armor from grey/white gear for PVP!
---
Have two if these, one shit the bed, other works fine. You could probably get the g600 for 1/2 the price and tbh it's more reliable but a bigger mouse.  Naga feels better to me but not very reliable. I can't tell you how many times I've had to replace razer mice. Logitech has always been rock solid. Idk up to you
---
He got $5k in donations last night when he streamed for 2 hours, lol.

His salt levels are unbelievable, he's so mad that the streamers took his spotlight.

I would do it the other way around if I were you so that your main character is geared and ready for MC launch
---
Demo spec Orc would be fun for pve too
---
I could explain everything that goes wrong with our net politics but I think it would take more than the 10,000 characters reddit posts can have.
---
The two large parties have firmly put "better internet" in the category of things they will always pay lip service to but never do anything about, along with climate change, more money for education and expansion of the railways.
---
Our infrastructure is so hilariously bad, "people from small city complaining about bad internet" is a TV genre.
---
I'll have a few months of sweet uninterrupted months before the due date at least!
---
I've never once touched a private server. I'm very confident on my memory of this.
---
Ehhh its not stupid as you explain yourself.
---
&gt;The difference will be negligible thanks!
---
It would be stupid to hamstring yourself into only 1 thing
---
Shaman way more fun.
---
I will make my Main to save the name, and then level a toon to lvl 5 and learn enchanting so I can disenchant items I collect on my main for extra gold or mats for enchants.
---
Multibox and play both characters at the same time. It's more or less like the other person is playing but you can both enjoy the game of choice primarily and then hop over for when 2 people are actually needed.
---
What about hunters lol
---
the issue is I think like half of the 6 piece bonus for the classes are god awful.
---
Leveling a rogue as swords vs daggers. Will be leveling with a friend somewhat, and aiming for dungeons when possible.
---
Hopefully it's as good as I'm hoping lol. A good wow friend of mine was aussie. Is NA and EU fully separate?
---
I played the first few weeks and it was called DM. I leveled a character a couple months later and people would spam LFG VC is westfall and I had no idea what they were talking about.
---
Aren't you the guy who got beat by the best ret pally in the world McConnellret?
---
Yes just know that your main would hit lvl 60 ~480 hours played after you create your first character
---
When does the stress test begin?
---
Agreed. The only thing I got from this poll is that there are 716 wrong people
---
I'm having the same debate myself... I feel like the orc racials are just a little better, but I like the undead caster look better and would much prefer starting in Tristfall.
---
Not actively but gathermate can show you were the nodes are. And add a macro to that.

Hi, /u/m45onPC

I demand Classic WoW CDs!!! Need that feeling of switching them out during install to really capture the true Vanilla WoW experience.

niiice
---
wow ok. Appreciate this very much!
---
Thanks that’s so helpful! Plus priests get the talents for wands right?
---
Not Darnassus
---
yeah, as stupid as it sounds, it really is annoying lol.  I definitely took xmog for granted, since I always transmogged my weapon to a bow.
---
"Sorry if I’m confusing folks but it’s pretty different situation than normal. If you got invited to the stress test you will only be able to play on the stress test."
---
That sweet sweet HoJ SoCrit.
---
Farm on your main i plan on doibg skinning mining ans getting BS at some point
---
You could chain it since launch, got patched later
---
I prefer the the Corsair scimitar ~$50
---
Made it. https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brr692/ultimate_deadmines_abbreviation_poll/
---
It's perfect, while you take care of him during the nights, you will raid hahaha
---
Its an option, but personally I plan on raiding immediately. I'm going full big dick NEET on this one. So I'm going to take my Druid to 60 via in the week or so.
---
My plan is to get a farming alt very early on and park him in an Inn and consume his rested XP in my off-time.
---
Didn't he later in duels win you though? ;)
---
no idea who called it DM.  On lightbringer Alliance it was called VC.  
---
VC Runs were life back then for us lowly rogues looking for the full set
---
That's literally no different from sharding other than they're giving people time to hit 60 before competition for mobs comes into play. 90% of tourists wouldn't make it to 20 anyways, they're just keeping servers divided while leveling. They want to make classic more like retail. It's the only way to make sense of this choice.
---
That’s so helpful really appreciate your response thank you
---
He can stay up with the baby...
---
and play classic lol
---
Just got into the Stress test but they add a new account for testing.
---
Nooooo! I will be at work till 5PDT, server shuts down at 6PDT, by the time I get home and get on it’ll be 5:30PDT - half an hour of playtime, but more importantly, no one will be doing lvl 1 Hogger anymore 😕
---
Yeah, that's my primary reasoning for leaning Shaman right now.  I would really like to be able to switch it up/change of pace, and the pure classes - while good at what they do - might get boring to me quickly.  Vanilla is very anti-alt friendly with how rigorous the leveling process is, and how much is tied to your character in terms of rep/attunements/pvp rank, so I'd really like to try and stick to one class for a majority of the game.
---
Yeah I agree with you on that one.
---
Whatever my wife make me lol.
---
6 hours
---
Mail can sit for 30 days. Just make yout alt and log in. When you are questing on your main you might get frustrated with a quest or gank. Go to your alt then and get him to 5 (or play in general)
---
I rerolled to a shadow priest in bc and I remember that mindflay binding was meant to actually reduce dps because you used the full channel is that the same in vanilla? Minor detail just curious. Nice video dude glad to see C9 having a presence in vanilla already! Never heard of you before but followed your socials gl!
---
depends on your wife....

Hey congrats! I haven't gotten an invite at all yet :(

is this some kind of ddlg meme
---
its open til thursday. they're just heavily monitoring it during the two hour window.
---
Alright
---
Most players take about 240 hours played to hit 60(10 days /played)
---
Exactly. By today's standards he was decidedly mediocre. Which is still pretty great, considering that he was like, 15 years ahead of the curve.
---
Funny how by the end of this endeavour he'll still be saying "give me something for the pain and let me die".
---
Just made her a character on a PServer 😏
---
I'm sure you could ticket and ask cs to get the beta off your launcher.
---
Can you claim hardcore before you actually form the guild and do anything "hardcore"
---
Uh, so can we get a raid going for hogger tonight?
---
It will sharpen and scale the image at the cost of performance
---
Bonus unused guest pass code for one of you lucky fellas out there
---
Well it'll increase it by double if it's still 200%. Double shit is still shit usually though but if you're using the newer graphics it's not so bad.
---
Level 16
---
Good chat man I like your frame of mind
---
I'd rather have more warriors, but having too many hunters isn't as bad as having too many druids.
---
Ret Paladin 
---
people may laugh or disagree but you can throw some justice at them and make them see the light!
---
These private server people are fucking weird.
---
Warrior checking in..  I feel your pain (maintank and active pvp er)
---
Nice, now make one for the fetus, they have rights too!
---
From my experience as a priest, having a dot (to prevent Vanish) levels the playing field a ton.
---
I, for one, am excited for the 40 man hogger raid! Will go human priest for that very reason.
---
i forget the exact number but i believe vanilla servers had around 2.5k-3k players with no shards.
---
if you said meet you in booty bay the friend would be there no need to group or anything.
---
now there was a fuckload of servers as you can imagine with millions of players and a few thousand online on each server.
---
there was also free transfers most of the time to and from either full servers or ones that needed more players (or mew servers?)
---
i forget but i remember most of the time having a free transfer available
---
for probally a number of reasons blizzard now wants to have a handfull of servers. resources and mobs just cant really support 8k+ players on one server 
---
tbh im not sure how the servers will function after they turn layering off if there is way more than 5k players per server , blizz is taking a gamble that fuckloads of players will quit before phase 2.
---
plenty of players will quit but i dont think enough to leave 3k ish players per server
---
I thought that was your original account key for a minute, I was gonna say broooo
---
Sadly never became a thing, though we do see their corpses every so often
---
Mike - Paladin
---
Jamie - Hunter
---
Andrew - Druid
---
David - Warrior
---
Bryce - Mage?
---
Got a few more that are undecided yet. Gona be a ton of fun getting the boys together.
---
But this is very importantant! If you called it DM/VC you never even played vanilla! /s
---
I don't know anything about rogue leveling now, and what might have been theorycrafted over the years on private servers, but when I mained my rogue in actual vanilla, combat was the most efficient leveling spec hands down.  Sub was ok, but because of positioning requirements it was a pain.  Ass I didn't feel came online until they brought in Mutilate which was TBC I think?
---
But yeah, being able to just run up SS, Evis or SnD move to next mob made for pretty streamlined leveling.  The only downsides is obviously having to face tank mobs, so you had to bandage/eat regularly.  You were still able to bypass a lot via stealth though, and pop blade flurry whenever you grabbed an extra mob on accident.
---
Isn’t MC available when the servers go live?
---
I think it was more the fact he 2v1d them.
---
The idea of this mouse is cool, but only if you play multiple different kinds of games and you only want to own one mouse.
---
I own a Deathadder for my non-MMO needs, and a Scimitar for my MMO needs.

I loved the original Naga. I had one until  2016 when it finally died on me. I bought the Naga Chroma and it just didn't feel right, something was wrong about the button placements.
---
wtf ? sharding will be in classic ?
---
&gt; with that blink and GCD usage
---
Multi R1 mage checking in ladies and gentleman. Watch this specimen carefully as he pulls off godlike plays like blinking a charge better than the 5000 other mages do ...
---
Deadmines is DM.  Dire Maul always gets the direction added to it.
---
Never played vanila, started in MOP, also in brazil, also got invited for stress test.
---
people like these donating on bad behaviours are such enablers for self destruction and negativity.
---
Ask anybody who has leveled a healing class. You can heal any dungeon with zero problems without dropping a single point in a healing tree.
---
In a fantasy game, they're one in the same.
---
What are you going to do, level 5 cap.. ?
---
Thanks for the feedback. Yeah I heard Fury Warrior is just inevitable carpal tunnel.
---
Is Warlock rotation simpler at end game, and only intensive during leveling?
---
I'll look into a restro druid as well.
---
Appreciate it.
---
I'm making a mental note to avoid his server come launch as an Alliance. Too much likely death lol.
---
Relax.
---
But it's not exactly the same as it used to be and that's bad. Because it's better for the game to have all these pitfalls it had when the server technology was limited and boohoo to anyone playing on a dead server. That too is part of the "experience".
---
WOOP WOOP THATS THE SOUND OF THE POLICE
---
Always confirmed, the VC nubs just wanna be unique.
---
I'll be on "night watch".
---
"Don't worry, honey. You get your sleep. I'll stay up in case the baby wakes."
---
VC on Malorne for Alliance. It definitely is on a server-by-server basis.
---
LF 2 mages for LVN pst pls be attuned juiced potted and already out gear the instance.
---
He's factoring in the first character which would be 240 hours per toon. You're not hitting 60 in 80 hours.
---
No the only person I distinctly remember was  a guy named Jastaris. The only reason I remember that was because it was so close to my name Jastis. I was in and ran a website for a small guild named shadow something back in the day. I wish I could remember the correct name.
---
Can and doing it well/efficiently is different, you also don’t always have a premier tank. Talenting for 1 situation vs a multitude is stupid.
---
I'm right there with you man! The leveling experience and wpvp with the boys is going to be soooo dope!
---
Mages are seriously broken in vanilla
---
Why did the warrior run away after the second ice block?
---
Dont know if this was EU only, but our GM's tended to RP.. like... HARDCORE. and if you didn't RP back, they would get "RP" MAD and pretend to not understand you :D funny as hell tbh. Miss those times ;D
---
Where did I insult blizzard?
---
I always like the content but your voice just seems really loud. I fight between having to turn up the podcast when your guests are talking and down when you’re talking.
---
Oooh! Book marking for future reference. Thanks!
---
Those launches have been pretty smooth, but the player experience has been smoother largely because of sharding and quests designed to make it smoother (scenarios, phased content, etc).
---
Classic is going to have....what, 4 starting zones total?  Technically BfA had 6, plus the shards and stuff i mentioned above.
---
Layering should help, but that still means a possibility of 3k people per shard, so a busier starting area could still have 1k players.
---
yeah, I fully didn't expect to get in to any tests for classic but I've been checking everyday anyway. I can prove I don't have sub with screenshots of my account details if anyone wants it. 
---
I was subbed until a month ago, maybe there was a cut off point?
---
These mad lads killied Doan in SM Library yesterday: https://www.twitch.tv/videos/427884435?t=03h57m07s
---
20billion and 1 post :)
---
This is my dilemma tbh.  I love fast-paced melee classes, but in classic you're only options are basically fury war or rogue.  Fury is fun, but I hate the lack of survivability w/ warrior.  Rogue I just played for way to long and want a break.  
---
I'm leaning towards shaman, but enhance back then is not enhance now, so I'm a bit apprehensive (not to mention it's just not that great).
---
Thats the interesting part of paladin tanks in classic isnt it, no taunt to make up for errors in threat management or bad teammates.
---
Blessing of Protection is one emergency one
---
No idea, but try 'grim total annihilation'
---
DM on my server emeral dream EU
---
Hi, /u/MasterGun95
---
Hi, /u/ChasewayTV
---
Does it make sense to pick a class depending on professions? I want to go full Herb/Alch and rogue seems nice because I can sneak past mobs in dungeons or some caves to pick herbs. I was already dead set on Rogue but now I'm trying to look into healing and Paladin piques my interest. However, the lack of damage as holy makes me wonder if I can defend my self against large pulls and players roaming for plants as well.
---
Sure. If I went that route, I'd probably wear a 1H + shield until I was able to pick up Seal of Command. Kill speed with a 1H + Seal of Righteousness isn't that much slower than a 2H + SoR. In exchange, you take much less damage, meaning less downtime. You will want to have a decent 1H + shield if you're tanking anyway.
---
They do, not a whole lot but there are enough.
---
I like to roleplay being a shield wielder paladin, but i dont care about optimizing talents. Im not a hardcore RPer
---
Thanks! I'm excited!
---
lol again
---
plebs who counted' figure out how to load up p servers pretending they know anyting about the game
---
Or even like it
---
hahahah
---
Thats the intent, i ll have an active guild!
---
He's a blue, not omniscient. I'll take the hard evidence that it was indeed a thing. VC was frequently used before Dire Maul came out. I even remember being confused by it, but then just going with it.
---
Congrats man, You'll still find some time to play plus the intangible benefits are awesome, see you in the stresstest :D
---
Wow, he is really good at playing a mage. The ice block to avoid more damage from the warriors surprise attack, into a frost nova to regain control and then into a counterspell  was awesome.
---
Good answer
---
As an old school player I have never seen anyone refer to Deadmines as VC and this whole argument confuses me
---
trusting coreiel about anything LMFAO
---
i hope her and scyle are living a nice life together
---
stockades is awful imo, but to each their own
---
&gt;Do you think Blizzard isn’t aware of how their own game works?  
---
&gt;Is a silly argument because time after time they prove they don't.
---
i'm not saying the guy is bad in way. But calling him Vurtne 2.0 is rediculous lol. But i got the fanbois on my arse now, so w/e. cba.
---
ain't that the truth
---
I was spawned at a temple high up north above marshals refuge in un’goro crater in an area inaccessible to players once. It looked like a maker’s early mention or a GM thing still not sure what that was about
---
Haha nahhh bro, I'm stupid but I'm not That stupid.
---
LFM Vailing Kaverns
---
not really. For example, Blizzard was too busy asking if they could include flying mounts, never asked themselves if it benefits the health of the game.
---
Loads of addons are bad for the game, but not bad enough to be explicitly banned by blizz.
---
If people want to use them, great. enjoy your scroll wheel macro that plays the game for you. But I log on to think while I press my buttons. Else, I can just go watch Two and a Half Men or whatever normies watch these days.
---
A TAUREN HORDE NED. ON AN OPEN FIELD
---
Depends heavily on when you want to raid. It takes a while to level 2 characters and to get gear on the main, and farm gold on the gold char, do you really want to sacrifice all those raid clears for that?
---
If yes, then sure level the one that seems to make the most sense to start with for you.
---
I was sleeping and worked all night :(
---
I‘m curious what you‘ll say once you see someone who‘s good with mages.
---
Yup - the only time gap I see would be bugs and honor ranks.
---
Which is great to focus on a tank set before pvp becomes a daily grind.
---
Silly question, do you get notified via EMAIL or does it just... appear in your bnet? I'm thinking to my self if there is a possibly you can miss being invited somehow.
---
That's a good point but I'm sure people with the free time will be happy to just stand and RP in Goldshire or something.
---
Arms interrupt is... shield bash.  Hehehehehe.
---
Is Swiftyjr a libertarian?
---
Uhhh, you're all wrong. It only goes up to 25. I played on private servers for 3 years and NEVER saw a respec cost of 50. You retail nubs can't remember anything
---
Not true. Your experience doesn't dictate others. I've always used VC and played on a Vanilla server where everyone used VC.
---
Food prep? Seriously?
---
How about you just eat like you would normally and be cool with that?
---
Villages/camps. Look close. It's kinda blurry but the letter references who lives there. O for orcs, G for goblins, H for human, etc.
---
Link to clip?
---
It wasn’t just any ret though. It was Highlord Esfand, Protector of the realm, savior of all things good and holy.
---
That’s the point, we have 2 continents. If they add new zones in those 2 that is fine.
---
Adding a THIRD continent would be horrible and is anti vanilla. If you don’t understand this then you likely never played vanilla.
---
I started the new season after not playing since release week. Kept me busy over the weekend but already kinda tired of it.
---
Wow great pics
---
Engineering is (sadly) a must have if you are doing pvp and want to win
---
Get 50 people together and murder hogger
---
He was being hyperbolic and having fun, you're taking it too serious
---
shots fired
---
Yeah iirc this is what I ended up doing, but I do remember trying out daggers at least to open with ambush or cheap shot/backstab.
---
Women and girls on the internet is a lie.
---
Thank you! See you on tonight!
---
I don't think he gives a shit about anything tbh, you are looking into it to hard just like everyone else tries to live vicariously through their favorite streamer and is emotionally invested in them. The only unhealthy thing I see is you.
---
not to mention a simple shift-click (which you'll probably be doing regardless) of the person's name will let you know which it likely is
---
Well can't do fire in BWL or MC, right? But other than that I plan to , frostbolting a trillion times isn't very fun.
---
Believe it or not, some people play for fun more than their mix max , and their guilds are ok with that! :) Yay classic
---
30 more people and you can start wiping in MC.
---
But leveling with friends will be fun!
---
I got in to the stress test and still couldn’t play it
---
They fall behind because they rely on R4 healing touch for efficiency and are still too slow. That's fine early on, not when the entire raid starts taking damage at a faster rate.
---
Priests have fast heals, efficient heals, group heals, and their gear pool is massive, and almost everything that drops for priests is amazing and they scale better for it. Shaman have fast heals, efficient heals, and group heals, Paladins are gods, obviously. Druids have 1 good spell that keeps getting better too, but it's still slow, and they have regrowth that is the worst efficacy of them all, and rejuvs. They can occasionally pop a big NS for an emergency heal.
---
Kel'Thuzad has just hit everyone in the raid with some frostbolts. Please hold your breath while the druids spend 30 seconds healing everyone back up. Oh, well, at least it's mana efficient.
---
Meanwhile, the priests have recovered the raid in a quarter of the time with a quarter of the casts. The shamans have done the same, at a less efficient rate than the priests.
---
Even if we pretend 'they have the same or slightly higher coefficients' they still don't offer everything else the other healers do. Every other class scales with raid encounters. Druids do not. Damage gets bigger and faster, druids stay slow.
---
Delet dis 🔪
---
Depends how hard you go. If you play 24-30 hours on launch(to get a head start) then 12-14 hours everyday afterwards which you would be able to on a "sick week" then you will have almost zero players in your areas and you can level freely at maximum efficiency. If you wait 2 weeks and do that, then at some point you will meet a big zerg of players for 10-15 levels that you will have a very hard time getting through.
---
But on the other hand if you are leveling more  slowly, then you won't catch up to that zerg before it's spread out anyway.
---
Found the "licks [Boots of Orgrimmar]" player

O:

orc all day every day
---
I wonder now if pets will be viable through entire raids due to pathing problems being fixed. If so could drastically change the dps output
---
Yep lol. Can't post it but the two most popular sites are overwelmed with offers. However bot many people want to sell it. Since it means your bnet.
---
Get your politics out of my MMO turbo dweeb
---
It is why I like Venruki stream, he acts very professional and still has a popular stream. He is not constantly insulting people, he just calls his plays and has fun.
---
Actually, when it's Blizzard HQ (California) working hours it's European evening.  The stress test is happening at the very end of their working day (4pm-6pm PDT)
---
Blizzard can't explicitly ban an addon. They can either limit the API so that no addons can reproduce the effect (example: AVR, which drew things on the world to make raids easier) or they can make the use of the addon a violation of the ToS (example: Babelfish, which allows cross-faction communication)
---
But whos gonna eat my ass?
---
3 weeks required vacation to nolife it on release sounds like a hardcore guild, no? what else in classic could be hardcore other than time investment?  
---
i love that guild recruitment is slowly starting! Wish you guys all the best!
---
you can save the name, though you'd have to sub 2 weeks early if you aren't so it's kind of hit/miss
---
Except that I did back in 05 and have spent 3+ years on vanilla pservers.
---
Forget the 2 continent thing, how is somebody in STV *not separate* from someone in EPL? There's not a remote fucking chance of them interacting, portal / loading screen or no. I don't know why you're so hung up on this, but it's stupid. I'm not asking for new continents btw, I just think that how strident you've been about this issue is retarded. Like Ok, here is your hill, dude. LOL.
---
Wasn't invited to either. ;(
---
The fact he used engineering items puts him in the top tier of players still
---
I thought you are a developer?  [https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br3suu/all\_abilities\_by\_class/eodihlx/](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/br3suu/all_abilities_by_class/eodihlx/) 
---
You are definitely not one or one that has no clue. Casting spells are not allowed by AddOns since a long time.
---
I know?
---
But when you shift click or /who a level 17 you know he’s not coming to your fire maul run.
---
not on emerald dream EU, never heard VC there
---
Jokes on all the people who claim it's to have less confusion then.
---
I'm a big fan of sub leveling but you need a macro to swap weapons after ambush for Hemo or SS.  
---
Sword combat is prob the most straightforward.
---
Why would you say he’s mediocre? I hate the pserver baby mentality that nobody knew how to play and if they were good it’s just a fluke.
---
This. Run DM tribute runs and take the shit no one wants at the end
---
You can spend 30 mins cooking and get 4 days worth of healthy meals with some baked chicken and your spice/marinade of choice, steamed veggies (broccoli is healthy, tasty, and easy) or boiled (boiled carrots take longer but have a nice sweetness and also healthy) and your starch of choice (I find the small couscous tasty and it's super easy to make, but pasta and rice are also good choices.
---
Other dinner ideas too include various one pot pasta dishes, which are things you typically make in a 12 inch skillet with top and put a variety of ingredients in, plus various liquidy ingredients to cook the pasta. These can also be made in 30 easy minutes and last you nearly all week for dinner.
---
Crockpot as well makes some really tasty but decently healthy dinners. Lately I've done a Cuban pork shoulder recipe in the crockpot that makes an absolute ton of food (~4-5 lbs of meat uncooked) with minimal prep time and 8 hours on low in the crockpot. Then sides of your choice (sides are easy).
---
Also find some good cereal and that's a great snack. Honey Nut Cheerios is a good one that's decently healthy but has a nice sweetness if you're trying to avoid unhealthy cravings. I've also gotten back into Special K recently after not eating it for years and am actually loving it. Adding some banana to cereal if you want something more is so good as well.
---
Which leads me to fruit! Great, easy snack and so many to choose from that are easy to eat and keep in the kitchen for a week - banana, orange, apple, grapes, take your pick. I love grapes especially because you can eat just a handful when you "feel" like eating but aren't necessarily hungry enough for a real snack or meal - this tends to satisfy that sort of otherwise unhealthy urge. Helps you to avoid grabbing chips or something. 
---
Also yogurt I personally love as that's also a great, healthy, super easy to eat snack with a variety of types and flavors for anyone.
---
Lunch again lots of easy choices - salads and sandwiches are easy to prep as well, and easy to eat. You can easily buy enough ingredients to eat that for a week.
---
I would stay away from snacks like chips because they won't fill you up very well. So you'll be unsatisfied and fat which is a bad combo. And drink a lot of water because aside from keeping you hydrated, it keeps hunger at bay. Often the body thinks it's hungry when it's thirsty, so if you drink enough you'll get better at knowing when you're actually hungry.
---
If you think about it doesn't make the slightest bit of sense calling it "VC" since Dead Mines is the first dungeon to "claim" DM as abbreviation.  
---
If people are really confused about this one could shorten the Dire Mauls to DM N/E/W (for their respective wings).  
---
But even then a quick check of the level of the person calling the LFM/LFG brings forth what is asked for.
---
you obviously have no idea who venruki is
---
ive been playing with this idea but yeah it may be best to level the farmer second
---
like you shouldnt need insane quantities of gold
---
you need flasks for raids and enchants when you get gear.
---
any shit farming character should be able to make enough to cover enchants and potions for the first month. other than that you just need the mount which may be a bit of a pain if you dont have a good source for gold.
---
i think if you can be bothered herbalism / alcemy would be a good pick on a bad farmer , that is if you have the time to pick herbs
---
making flasks removes the biggest ongoing cost of your character flasks but there will prob be a fuckload of people farming the herbs you want so it may nkt be viable at all
---
In a way it does answer my question. I’ve had in the back of my mind that I’m probably over thinking a lot and should just do w/e I want as long as I’m having fun.
---
Priest can farm Dire Maul lashers
---
Lag in large pvp battles on retail is a result of modifiers and a lower tick rate. Classic sends updates to the clients in batches, while modern wow attempts to continuously send updates (which is a problem given all of the modifiers that can exist).
---
The informed everyone that the servers would be offline until stress test time. Its your fault if you didnt know so dont get mad at blizz for your mistakes.
---
Good in duels l, that’s it
---
The stress test ends at 6. The servers are open until Thursday. Not sure of the exact end time.
---
Sword combat is prob the most straightforward and ppl say "best"
---
I can’t live without the Number pad on the mouse now.  I love my trinity - have owned two of them over the past 4 years or so.  I use a hard mousepad and it wears the pads on the trinity and ended up with some weird rubbing on the first mouse.  I also play all games with it and love it.
---
You can register wow as a non steam game in the steam client and play over in home streaming. I used to do this and it worked great as long as your home network is quality.
---
respectfully CS has a limited amount of data to go off of and cannot troubleshoot issues on their own. The max amount of PTR accounts you can have is 2. The stress test shows up as a PTR account. It tried to add this account and could not because the PTR accounts were already capped.

Checked somewhere else apparently everyone who got stress test has the same thing so I’d say it’s a generic display and we only have access to stress test.
---
As a healer, you should pick professions you ca. Make good gold on. Herb/alchemy is good as folk need pots. You can farm all the herbs you want if you spend time doing it.
---
I’m leveling a shammy for resto at 60, and have the same concern.
---
My main back in vanilla was a hunter where I could farm easily for 4-5hrs and make 500g. Can’t really do that on a shammy unless I got herb/alchemy, and make the pots &amp; elixers folk need for raiding.
---
Also fishing/cooking is a good gold maker too, as food buffs are great in vanilla, and highly sought after.
---
Nope. Not overly fussed though.
---
Great post! Some good ideas in here!
---
There may be a slight chance that some people retain their access after the test (or maybe this is just my wishful thinking).
---
&gt;not using /world
---
I was pretty cognizant of my over healing, and ran meters to watch that as well, most of us did in fact, we were competing for server firsts and generally everyone tried to do their part in efficiency of play.  Generally a pretty talented group of players.
---
You're kind of an idiot, aren't you?
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize buying gold with your real life money in a 15 years old MMO.
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize buying a fast-pass at an amusement park
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize Vegas gambling even though the odds are stacked heavily against you
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize betting on sporting events
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize buying drinks and popcorn at the movie theater even though it's grossly overpriced
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize buying top of the line computer parts even though they'll be obsolete within 2 years
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize buying cosmetics for video games like in Dota 2/LOL
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize buying Magic the Gathering/Hearthstone cards on the regular since every new expansion brings out more powerful cards
---
&gt; Imagine trying to rationalize buying soda/cigarettes even though it's bad for your health
---
You get the picture. People will spend money on things for the convenience or desire. If you're so one-dimensional that you can't comprehend why another person would want to spend their money for gold in a game like WoW - a game that literally sucks up huge portions of your time - then you're irredeemable.
---
DM meant Deadmines and Dire Maul, you just looked at the level of the requester to guess which, we worked for out groups back in the day, damn kids... :)
---
Because hes bad and doesn't know his class thats why.
---
*This is me planning my healer build going into Classic
---
My basic math is based on when I expect to obtain the spell and the Gold markers indicate that a talent is effecting the spell. I did not calculate all of the spells Minimum Healing Per Mana (MHPM) with their coefficients because they do not scale as well as Prayer of Healing, Renew, and Greater Heal.
---
Basic math = 
---
(Base Healing + (Healing increase from talents)) / (Mana cost - (Mana Reduction from talents))
---
Rank 10 with (50/200) HealPwr = with spell power coefficients.
---
((Base Healing + (Healing Power * Spell Coefficient)) + (Healing increase from talents)) / (Mana cost - (Mana Reduction from talents)
---
Coefficients obtained from https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/95abc8/list_of_spellcoefficients_1121/
---
Hahaha this sounds fun!
---
as ppl said, he was going for that charge stun since venruki had blink on cd, and nova up and ready.  also, not sure if he had enough rage to execute.
---
Going to work on confirming my leveling routes to level 5 for as many classes as possible
---
Found your favorite patch notes!    
---
-Equity for All: items that players loot will no longer be placed in bags. Instead the items will be mailed to your server loot council for them to distribute as they see the need.    
---
This includes gold, quest items and gear.   
---
-weapons have been removed from the game. Players are no longer able to attack enemy units, instead they are asks to use chat.   
---
-The AH has been removed. See your server Loot Council for any and all items you need. (Wait times may take up to 3 weeks)
---
This isn't debate club, no reason to argue semantics.
---
The only legit option is to play how you want.
---
What they didn’t tell you was that you can only have a max of 2 PTRs on your account.
---
Got 2? Try to add a 3rd. It will fail with the maxed out error.
---
It is 100% the issue with having 2 PTRs and the Stress Test being coded as a PTR — when the pass went around, it looked at any 2 PTR accounts and said “Whoops, can’t add a 3rd! SKIP!”
---
Only hope is that it logged the errors to make it easier for Blizzard to recode the PTR max to 3, temporarily, and then re-run the flagging event on the error’d accounts.
---
For Retail? Nah. I'd forgotten about the change.
---
AutoHotKey it is then.
---
Well, if he stays in block long enough to get out of combat, a charge is way more valuable, which is what he was going for probably
---
F for everyone who falls to these monsters...
---
When you take a boat to, let's say, ratchet to booty bay for example, you are momentarily teleported under the map before finally being teleported to your final destination.
---
All this usually happens during the loading screen but when the gates of aq were opened the servers were under too much pressure and only the first teleport happened and not the second, causing people to get stuck under the world and then dying.
---
They are. Not because they individually are hard, but because:
---
\- Ranged fireballs which hit like 20% of your total HP. Them being ranged makes it so that you have to run a lot from one mob to another.
---
\-They run away in fear to pull even more of them
---
\-They are deceivingly tightly packed together. Not as tightly as gnolls, but they are within chain aggro range of each other, eventhough they don't always seem to be.
---
So these mobs are less about you aggroing 10 of them and getting oneshot(Like Gnolls), and more about that fighting them is a never ending gauntlet of a few mobs at a time as they fear pull more as you are about to kill the previous one. Then you run out of mana and HP and you die as they keep on respawning.
---
Same, would love an update on the issue
---
ITT: people forgetting that individual servers could call it different things and neither side is wrong.
---
Because you can go from stv to epl with no load screen.
---
It matters when it comes to putting people in the world. A 3rd continent would split the player base 3 ways instead of 2.
---
Enhance back then was a lot of fun, but I wouldn't call it super fast paced as you are mostly using 2 handers and waiting for windfury procs. I'm in the same boat though, didn't really find a class that stuck until Monk was released.
---
1 DPS Naxx? You forgot to add /s somewhere

Since theres only 1 server, you think itll be slam pact and crowded a ever?

No. Any guild that is that hardcore that they demand dwarf priest are probably pretending.
---
Classic raids with modern skills are really just not that difficult. If you are a consistent body for raids and a decent player you will find a guild.
---
I did lv one in retail, I quit at lv 57 lol, it was mind numbing boring
---
The asnwer is Druid
---
yes it will show up as a PTR account. If you already had a PTR account, you'll see 2.
---
Best trolls ever!!! I was so pumped and disappointed all at once! Didn't know I could feel so conflicted.
---
I always though gnomeregam was the equivalent for the stupid alliance for WC
---
yeah i thought so , i actually want to level a paladin and do a lot of healing as i level so ill prob level with some points in holy 
---
never actually played vanilla paladin
---
What other dungeons or raids has the boss name as its abbreviation except for the obvious one like Onyxia's Lair?
---
Never once seen RFD being called Amnennar the Coldbringer or SFK for Argual.
---
Calling Deadmines for VC is smallbrain shit.

I do not care who he is.
---
I‘m just commenting on a video I just saw and that was basic playing.
---
It was far from bad, sure.
---
But the title said 2v1 which it is not, since they clearly didn‘t come at him at the same time.
---
The warrior already had only half a life pool when he joined + they both played it really bad.
---
There‘s no bad play from the mage in the video, but calling this the play of a God is like saying Donald Trump is great at presidenting.
---
I git invited to the stress test then when I got home and looked at my launch no stress test to download
---
Cant wait to meet a lot of you crazy people there again :)
---
Sitting in this:
---
Classic Stress Test is Full  
---
Position in queue: 245433  
---
Estimated time: 378 min
---
See you there!
---
I cant see any epics. Next
---
Tigole only did quests back in the Vanilla-era iirc.
---
ClassicalWarlock is my twitch name. I'll be streaming. I started vanilla 8/27/05 and I'm returning 8/27/19 Come say hi I'm rolling an UD lock and I'd be super happy to make some friends day 1. 
---
Might stream some state of decay 2 or sea of thieves or a co-op scary game with my fiance before it comes out. Should be getting my equipment in the mail from Amazon today or tomorrow. 
---
TLDR I am a newbie streamer vanilla veteran playing warlock
---
I know we are all kidding around but seriously this once, If he can play wow while the baby requires attention that is a skill I never learned in three attempts and he needs to share his secret.
---
I read in one of the posts that the test is 2 hours but the realm will be available for 24 hours.  We'll see how it goes.
---
Happy for you man, thats a big achievement!
---
Also gz on the kid.
---
When I got the VC quest, I didn't even know there were instanced dungeons. A lot of people were on the same boat. It just stuck. It never had anything to do with Dire Maul.
---
Honest answer
---
woulda been amazing
---
Hunters will always be needed for tranq shot, youre dps is very consistent and safe you dont have to threat manage due to Feign Death  wiping your aggro your traps are universal they can only be dropped out of combat (FD+trap for in combat re-CC and you can also FD+Drink for mana. If you are seen as a good hunter on your server you will have an easy time getting groups 
---
i played a hunter up through early Naxx never had to worry about groups or consumables they are a very safe class to play
---
At 60, I don't plan on raiding and rarely doing dungeons. What class can I gear up or do well with (just farming and tooling around the open world, some casual pvp) in crafted or pvp gear?
---
I'm torn between paladin, warrior, mage, maybe priest.
---
Some weird phasing/scaling tech is the last thing classic players want. they want one coherent gameworld with lots of similiar faces.  
---
the "transfer to new server to start BC in a few weeks"-option is the best one imo, although splitting the playerbase. Playerbase will always be split if theyre giving the opportunity to play what they want though...
---
4.5GB for 5 levels of fun LUL
---
I mean at this point there is no evidence to disprove either point. Besides my own anecdotal experience that is. 
---
My brother and his wife never once subbed for wow until this month. The stress test and beta.
---
he wasn't aware of how important auto attacks are in classic for pvp.
---
Greatwizard best vanilla mage but I’ll check this dude out
---
I like those odds
---
&gt;I do not know how to get him help, but I feel like he needs it before it gets too far.
---
Don't be Holden Caulfield.
---
Hunter and Mage
---
The best is to look in your account detail for game and subscription. If you have enabled the ptr realm you should see it listed there, if you have access to the beta there will be an extra ptr realm. I only have access to the stress test so I don't know if it looks different for the regular beta but all I see on my account is two identical entry for a PTR they even both says wow:legion, just one is for classic.     
---
To know whether you are on the regular beta you will have to log in with the client and see the available realms to you, if you only see 1 for pvp that is currently not available then you only have access to the stress test
---
I'm more talking about the majority or world pvp I see at lvl 60. Like time spent in game on toon at lvl 60. Say takes me 10 days played to level. Then later I have 100 days played total. So 90% has been at 60. Depending on where my time was spent, but I'd say most of it was spent in battle grounds and out in world farming mats for gold and mats for consumes.
---
You are right if you played on a certain pserver with 10k population. Once you hit lvl 30 it's like hitting a wall because all those zones are full of gankers.
---
Perhaps we can agree to disagree. The 10 or 15 times I got ganked while leveling is nothing compared to what I see at 60 in that time played. That is on a normal pop server 2-3k
---
Hmm. You're actually right. Probably will be sick on the first week then.
---
If your playing solo id go rogue, if you have friends to play with to 60 priest. Priest warlock is great team for leveling, warlock can dump all his mana into damage while priest heals life tap. I'll be leveling with 2 friends were doing rogue, holy pally, warlock
---
eh don't warriors shit all over everyone in late game dps?
---
First aid is an absolute for just about any class. Even healers. 
---
You won’t have any issue leveling it as you go either.
---
I just think comparing someone to Vurtne is a high bar. Not taking anything too serious honestly, just gave my opinion and got instantly slammed by multiple people.
---
carnitas
---
Dire Maul is FDM.
---
Because fuck Dire Maul.
---
For BGs, world pvp, or both? I was planning on playing with groups so mostly avoiding 1v1s is it still a must? Thanks for the advice
---
I was in the same boat but then i got into BFA beta....yay me...
---
&gt;  Buying mats that you know will increase in price 
---
what does that mean
---
have yet to be convinced that any one looking for a "DM" run means anything other than deadmines, what are you gonna do, run all 3 wings and both normal and tribute variant in the same lockout?
---
Just logged in and took some pictures of my undead priest. I created this character on release. :)
---

---
Anyone going "it was VC first" is a poser.
---
On Stormreaver US it was refereed to as DM till Diremaul came out, then it changed to VC. I think its more of an EU/US thing much like i have seen on Private servers EU players saying DD over DPS.
---
For example - LF2M DD Scholo
---
Guess who is working today...This guy.  I will miss the stress test. 
---
RIP
---
Warlock rotation at raids is....
---
- Curse of Elements once
---
- Shadowbolt until boss is dead
---
Blizz put out a list of the most dangerous creatures in vanilla. They were on the list with raid bosses.
---
Those Chinese knockoffs are pretty decent
---
Perhaps we can agree to disagree. The 10 or 15 times I got ganked while leveling is nothing compared to what I see at 60 in that time played. That is on a normal pop server 2-3k.
---
Ps. Sorry for calling you carebear
---
**seal of casino
---
warriors are better dps aren't they? I know they are through most of vanilla, but naxx I don't think mages overtake them (excluding mages that get ignite for parses or w.e)       
---
best levelers is arguable in the sense that you HAVE to be able to aoe farm to be the best leveler, which won't happen at launch and for a while after launch imo.        
---
I don't know about the gold farming part since it's going to depend on classic, but it's possible so I can't actually argue that either way.     
---
I can agree with the group pvp, and mobility for being able to quickly move around the world although you could always get a port from someone else. CC is dependent on which way you're going, if you want group vs single target, since I think for group mages obviously win out by being able to control everyone but that's more of the group pvp aspect.
---
Not during raids
---
Was not spirit of redemption crap. I vaguely remember the logic being that if the healer were wiping then the raid was very likely to wipe and there was little point to try to stay a few seconds more .
---
FYI shadow priest might have a hard time healing dungeons post lvl 50 or so
---
Inflation and materials needed for future expansions.
---
Don’t recall it was that easy for the droods, i know i had it way easier in TBC. Not sure when the 1.2.1 patch took place, is it after the stratholme nerf?
---
no problem though! If you are invited you can play in 5h 15min because that's when the stress test begins!
---
Good luck... I played Alliance from Vanilla to Wrath then switch when Cataclysm came out.
---
Interestingly enough that's where me level of enjoyment started decaying. 
---
Not because of being Horde but Cata and after just isn't the same game as vanilla through Wrath.
---
So here we are a couple months away from Classic and I have ZERO idea if I'm going to revisit Alliance (Rogue was first 60 but didn't know how to play, Paladin was second and finished Vanilla with a Warlock)
---
I'd like to commit to Horde because it would be "fresh eyes and a different experience" but I don't see myself choosing Orgrimmar over Stormwind for Vanilla.
---
they had 20+ years of improvements, they know what they doing, its all marketing scheme to get people believe they testing something...
---
I'm in :D
---
You call chips food? American?
---
I've always seen it called VC. On my realm everybody called it VC
---
The Syndicate Shadow Mages from Durnholde are pretty bad too, they use a curse of thorns that just tears appart melee.
---
 [https://classicdb.ch/?npc=2244#abilities](https://classicdb.ch/?npc=2244#abilities)
---
Yeah that sounds about right. When you first get VC quest you usually are around 16 or 17. Earliest is 15 sometimes. At 15 running to the entrance was a deathrun due to agroing EVERYTHING. You were told to stay as far back as possible inside the dungeon. You would agro things on top of the ship if you placed things wrong. 
---
VC is tough with a group of fresh 16-18's due to a few things. 1: time it takes to acquire gold to purchase skills. A lot of times you didn't have the new ranks at your level due to being a poor boy. 2: Gear from quests wasn't always the greatest, so you would go to the AH to buy better gear, which again causes 1.
---
I remember farming VC for Emberstone Staff all the way till 21. The higher level I got, the easier it became. A group of all 19's and 20's can steamroll VC in like 35-40 minutes easy. Asmon's 'world first' was over 1 hour on the youtube replay.
---
Two hand for sure because of the miss-hit chance of duel wielding.
---
The scenic route!! Is it August yet?
---
This. I’m putting béarnaise sauce in mine. You?
---
Man, this is bugging me.  We had a way of differentiating the DM wings, but we didn't call them by directional names as far as I can recall.  "Tribute" was one.  I can't remember what the others were...
---
It's not very interesting and the loot is ass but damn is it some nice XP from all the clustered mobs and like 6 dungeon quests
---
Just read that so a silver lining I suppose.
---
why don't we just call it DM:W since it's in westfall?
---
I will stay away from anything "hardcore". At least while leveling. I'm gonna do it slowly and enjoy it!
---
Is it only me or does somebody else instantly dislike any self promoted video which is only a bit longer than 10minutes for it to be even more monetized?
---
Its almost like sitting staring at a Que screen isn't an enjoyable experience. Its almost like you don't have to be a sweaty neet in order to "get anywhere" in vanilla. Its almost like everyone's "anywhere" is different. Some just want to adventure and enjoy the world getting to 60. Some want to race to 60 and hard core raid or pvp. Who are you to say if you can't invest an exorbitant amount of time and effort to do what you view as the "anywhere" in vanilla then they shouldn't play. No game should not have its difficulty artificially inflated by having to sit in a Que. Which is all that layering prevents.
---
Why? I can't imagine he's gotten worse over the years.
---
Ppl who never actually played vanilla
---
What the hell. VC. Jesus lol.
---
It's a snack
---
LFG DMweast
---
Its not about having fun, this inst a marketing beta, its for testing so WE get a smoother launch... Some people are too selfish to even help them selves.
---
No. Warriors shit on everyone's DPS in all stages, not just late game.
---
you don't have to run THAT far away for frost nova, and assuming nova is up that quickly after is kinda iffy
---
r/gatekeeping
---
IMMA CHARGIN UP MY FIREBALL!!!
---
   Don’t you do it, Jimmy!
---
Hahahah
---
I liked Stockade because it was short and sweet - minimal time investment.
---
Then again, I generally liked to level as quickly as possible, so longer, more time-consuming dungeons were not my thing.
---
I was calling it VC back in 2006....
---
New dad here (she’s 3 weeks old) night watch (to my surprise) is actually a thing for us. Girlfriend is typically pumping every 2 hours but at around 9-11pm depending on how tired she is, she goes to sleep for anywhere between 4-6 hours which is when I handle baby duties. Gf wakes up usually around 4am and that’s when I go to bed.
---
It has been surprising to me how much I am able to play at the moment. Every 2-3 hours the baby wakes up to either be changed/held/fed. We got a bottle warmer so when I see the baby getting fussy starting to wake up I put the bottle to warm, prepare the changing table for a diaper change and put my character in stealth somewhere (rogue/NE ftw?). Give the baby all her needs and either have her on a pillow on my lap or use our sling ring to swaddle her against me. It’s all worked wonders so far.
---
The Madras lentils, I get those too!
---
Hmmm. I'm not sure how it works and I wonder if my WINE settings get sent as my "OS". Like does it seriously look like I'm rocking WinXP with my gaming PC setup? 
---
I do live in the middle of nowhere though.
---
You forgot to photo shop in a heart on the last message.
---
Stress test starts May 22 4pm PDT and should run until May 23 6pm PDT
---
Bloody Pillagers
---
sounds like mage, although skill ceiling is unversally pretty low in classic vanilla imo.
---
Boom, hit him the face with a counter spell
---
Back in the days, Blizzard posted list with most deadly mobs and Defias Pillagers was number 1 causing most deaths in the game :)
---
Dont cut them so short, give us the reaction afterwards :(
---
In a group warrior/paladin have the most control
---
They have the best fuck you CD's
---
Casters have no control in group combat because there are cleanses....
---
Solo u can get away from a warrior. In group warrior has a shit ton of control....Hamstring can't be cleansed
---
I find your lack of spinach disturbing. Who needs chips when you can eat spinach leaves from a box?
---
P.S.- It doesn't take all that great, but it's surprisingly refreshing when you wash it down with water.
---
If I hear VC in classic imma slap a bitch.
---
DM referred to Deadmines.
---
VC specified that you had the quest to kill VanCleef.
---
Because it's the newbie dungeon it was common to have groups unable to finish, so the specification was for people confident they could kill VC.
---
Also because it's the newbie dungeon, that distinction got mixed up so some people referred to the dungeon in general as VC.
---
I read the title then felt all cold
---
just rewatched his stream and there was nothing unusual.
---
2h for the miss hit chance  
---
Fury until 30 (personally) so you get Sweeping Strikes with Arms and then can handle 2-3 mobs instead of only 1 at a time.
---
Just extra ethanol, I'm simplistic.
---
How does that explain the people (who I have seen multiple) posting in the forums with no PTR accounts that still don't have the download available within their client? I understand what your saying, but I guess I am more inclined to trust them than others may be. I'm not refuting that the corollary factor of the PTR accounts doesn't concern me (hence, why I submitted the ticket). Hopefully, it gets resolved.
---
Funny. I had this same talk with my boyfriend.
---
People always want more lol
---
All the people invited to stress test are disappointed while those of us invited to nothing are like wow we'd be lucky to even be in your position
---
Do you have 2 PTR accounts?
---
2 hours total playtime, limited to 5. Nobody is gonna lose sleep LUL
---
Did you mean 1pm HST?
---
C - L - E - A - N
---
you have 2 ptr account I bet
---
Yeah. It looks like they really do only care about you having an active sub.
---
True. Mages aren't even 2nd best, that would be Rogues. They're the best RDPS at some points and can get beaten by warlocks in later stages as well.
---
The rest is almost true though. They have awesome CC, are great at group PVP, but they certainly aren't the best leveling class, that's hunters.
---
Mage or Hunter for PvE, good CC and kite skills will make up for a lot of the potential mistakes your group might make in a dungeon.
---
Druids can single handedly carry BGs. Everyone knows they make, by far, the best flag carriers in WSG but they're great for holding points indefinitely in AB as well.
---
Interesting. Thanks for the input!
---
Yeah. I'm a greedy bastard.
---
I was obviously thinking only pure thoughts with that title lol
---
*M'leef*
---
&gt; Would make progression a cake walk these days! 
---
Youre implying every classic raid except MAYBE naxx isnt already a cake walk for experiences wow players?
---
🏅🥇🏆
---
Yeah I'll be playing in a group with a shaman and war. I'd have to go shadow for leveling, but the end goal would be PvP and raid healing. Rogue is just fun, but I feel like it's the more selfish choice.
---
Let's be serious.  You don't want a beta invite to actually test the game.  You're just part of this streamer worship culture and you want to play because they are.
---
I A resto druid comes to mind. They can change to bear form and charge for a quick stun, have a root, heal, and are generally extremely hard to control outside of fear. Not to mention they have fearie fire to prevent stealth, and a spammable instant cast to help with killing enemies.
---
Bruh one look at Benediction sealed my fate.
---
If my plan is to play holy pally at 60, should I level as holy to 60 or should I go try then change? I feel like changing after 60 what take a long time to gear but I could be wrong.
---
I'm not 100% positive but I am sure I used to lead UBRS (the small raid one) solo healing as a druid or I main healed the tank group.  
---
Druids are good healers its just different, you dont spam you just need to time it so you dont overheal.
---
only the real ones call it VC
---
You'll just have to wait until the inevitable TBC servers, I'm afraid. Paladin tanks were god-tier in TBC.
---
What about rogue for example?
---
They mentioned that after the stress test, another large wave of invites would go out for the beta. So don't give up hope yet. Get to lvl 75 fishing in the Stress test!
---
Must be a bug.  Keep refreshing it.
---
How dense are you? I would like to see you do a 2v1 under pressure and play perfect. Ofc he is supposed to stop the heal this is the dumbest comment I’ve read
---
Cause the stress test doesn't open for another 5 hours
---
He would be a shitty mage if he lost. He did go up against the 2 classes that he hardcore counters. That’s like a Pharah fighting a Junkrat and Symmetra 1v2 in Overwatch - the only impressive thing there would be if the Junkrat/Symmetra duo would beat the Pharah.
---
And the arena or? Guys lets go DMTNEWA
---
I plan on doing dungeons at first with friends and family. I could die in there and my wife is playing a warlock and will be soul stoning me.
---
What do you mean by that?
---
Well when you compare that to smashing 12345234524 it does seem pretty skillful!
---
Im sure you're the sickest mage ever, you are so cringe
---
Whoever you want.
---
You only have Stress Test access, not beta access. Stress test goes live at 4pm pacific, they want everyone to dogpile into that server all at the same time.
---
Not the best DPS endgame. Probably middle of the pack.
---
Decent gold farmers, don't know if they're the best. AoE grinding packs in DM is pretty effective.
---
No waaaaaaaay are they the best levelers. Hunters and Warlocks are both way better.
---
Decent at group PvP. Easy to shut down if you focus them.
---
Best CC? For PvE, it's arguable. For PvP, fear, frost shock, and rogues' entire kit.
---
Do city ports really count as mobility? That's more utility. Blink is pretty good, but druids have the best mobility.
---
I got the email but haven’t been able to check because I’m at work. Hoping it’s for real though.
---
What is a stress test if I may ask?
---
I never heared "VC", always DM.
---
I start playing with EU release on blackmoore.
---
Can't wait to see more stuff like this. The old "Alt F4" thing got so many people over the years.
---
You should definitely go mage. Hands down. Go a full 75% blizzard slow spec and you are an AV god. Polymorph/nova the tank as he runs in to pull the bosses in Stormpikes room, and you kill them. Another reason to go mage? Alliance has a huge advantage, ally warlocks vs Forsaken are sad.
---
Mage. I do it every time
---
This is why reading is important.
---
Hunters are arguably better at gold farming, and easily better at levelling. Aren't mages like fourth or fifth best in levelling behind Hunter, Warlock, Priest, and maybe shaman.
---
Ok, will do. Thanks mate.
---
And one day it will be out of beta 😉
---
I wish I hadn't read that
---
ohhhh okay thanks for clearing that up, I hope they stick with that.  
---
Man now its like what will we do long term during the stress test?  
---
And what about after? You think thell let stress test in as a wave to beta test? that would be pretty neat of them to do.
---
Does anyone else not recognize the word beta anymore after reading it so much?
---
Finally had a watch and really appreciate the work you’ve done. Showing rewards at the start of each quest is awesome, to show the value in running the dungeon and getting all the quests first! 
---
I haven’t seen your other videos, so don’t know if you separate them out or only do alliance quests for dungeons? Might be worth putting that at the start or in the title, and if you do make horde versions to put link to that version at then end. 
---
Showing a map of the cities where the quest givers are located could be useful, if the idea is that people could purely use your video without another resource to do all the quests. I find seeing on a map the easiest way to find something, as I don’t know the cities too well, especially Darnassus.
---
Keep up the good work, awesome video!
---
Classic!
---
I understand. I have seen many people on the forums who do not have the download showing on their client (having received the email) with no PTR accounts. I guess all I'm saying is that I was told opposite information from Blizzard from what is being said here. If I am naive to trust, then so be it. Hopefully it gets resolved. Cheers!
---
Nice to hear, cheers mate.
---
If you want to enjoy a game for yourself, don't read its respective subreddit - sad, but true.
---
It could possibly be that stone cairn in the centre of the lake above Eastvale Logging Camp?
---
As someone considering Warlock as my first character, it really depends on the environment you're planning on playing in.
---
In PvE, yes - Warlock rotation is very simple. PvP is where it becomes much more complex.
---
You should be hamstring kiting while leveling using 2 handers. You can go 2 hand fury but you'll end up respecing at 40 anyways for Mortal Strike. 
---
Hamstring kiting is pretty easy to get down. Download a swing timer, or even if you dont you can count it out in your head. Get a slow 2 hand weapon. Hit your mob, hamstring it then run away. With a 3.5 speed weapon count to 4, run back in and hit your mob then run back out. Make sure rend / hamstring stays up on the mob and just keep repeating. Youll take a lot less damage and be able to kill things a lot higher level. 
---
You only use heroic strike when you have a bunch of built up rage, but its usually not worth it. 
---
Dual wielding is awful for leveling just because you take so much damage and don't do nearly enough to counter that damage. 2 Hand fury is nice if the /sit command works to proc enrages, but I'm not 100% sure if thats going to work. I don't think it is, but that bug report may have said differently? I just dont know what the correct answer for the /sit macro.
---
Well, just master it and have an awesome time :)
---
Do you find yourself tanking? Still woth the 2-hander but keeping around a good 1-hander is still a good idea
---
Just go to Darnassus instead of theramore.  That flight time will give you time to cook and clean!
---
they are gonna test how many players it takes for stuff to start going wrong so they know what to fix
---
You can heal as a priest just fine, even if you're in Shadow spec. I wouldn't do it in raids, but even at level 60 you can heal 5mans with the proper gear. For specs, you want to go into Wand Specialization, Spirit Tap, and then go further into shadow from there. If you have any questions, hit me up.
---
&gt; not moving for a full day 
---
by 'day' you mean 'month', right?
---
lol, will do.
---
The fact that that comment is even upvoted that much blows my mind, it's not like interrupting a heal is revolutionary, despite it being in Classic.
---
It was never in vanilla iirc. Just a private server thing
---
OMG thank you so much for this!
---
Stupid enough to get a creditcard, not stupid enough to post your cdkey
---
I don't think hes trolling, he is just saying from what is displayed in the video its not super amazing. He literally said he wasn't bad, he just needs more sources to agree with that claim.
---
Posted this more as a troll and out of curiosity on how people would react to it , did not watch that video before so cheers for linking it. Knew about staffs before hand and spirit and hp5 gear at 60 for soloing and farming purposes.
---
Why are you yelling at me
---
Both. 600 hours later you're rolling in class.
---
A good laptop, giving up voice comms. for a few years, and playing solo or with other parents / grand parents who "get it" when you just suddenly stop mid adventure without warning and coming back 20 minutes later to say "sorry, baby puked all over me."
---
And then as they get older let them press the buttons, giving more responsibility over time.
---
.. Make sure it's a good laptop, because it will be the last one you buy for the next 5+ years!
---
Jesus Christ you’re  an idiot
---
You have access to the stress test for 2 hours later today. You do not have Beta access.
---
They want as many players logging in at the same time and in the same areas to "stress test" their server stability. It only lasts two hours and you can only level to 5.
---
But the Performance cost is cheaper than using AA in terms of gpu resources.
---
Why is everyone acting like it’s OUR job to make sure the servers run good? The official release date is the 27th, there’s no changing that, it’s BLIZZARD’s job to ensure their servers are running properly by that time, they are the ones getting paid millions, we as a matter of fact pay THEM $15/month. I got the stress test invite but won’t be participating. I paid $15 this month to worth WITH blizzard in the beta, not work FOR them in the stress test.
---
No thanks :) I like the way I discuss topics and I won't be jumpcutting videos at any point.
---
vc=newf@gs
---
Creating and activating multiple accounts to increase your chances of getting into the beta? /s
---
I didn't know they still sold the physical time cards tbh, so weird to see them.
---
What was that ? Played from Feb. 2005 and it does not ring a bell here. Care to explain a bit ?
---
That is super lame, and very very disappointing. I just read up and level 5 is the max level?! I opted for the beta test not for a dumb stress test
---
Oh ya I mean its for sure the best race to roll as alliance priest.
---
Yeep.
---
Thanks, though!
---
I really appreciate that feedback its extremely helpful and useful feedback =D. &lt;3. 
---
The Deadmines one was a little more detailed, but I felt like I kind of drug that guide out. I think the maps in the guides probably would be a little more useful but I know people get pissed off when youtubers make their videos 10+ minutes long so I was trying to keep it short. I think I'm going to start putting those back in there because of your feedback alone =).
---
I am a linux sys admin from 6am-4pm and a dad / husband at night, and then stream Wed - Saturday 8pm - 2 or 3AM Lol. (yes I run on like 2 hours of sleep some nights lol), so I haven't had time to do Horde dungeon quest guides but if these start to gain some traction I'm definitely going to make them even if its after classic launches. Maybe after I get through SM for Alliance I'll start on the early horde instances. 
---
Thank you again for taking the time to put in some amazingly useful feedback. I really really appreciate it =).
---
My first toon was Druid at launch. It was painful to level. Given they starting at patch 1.12 i think most classes are somewhat balanced.
---
Yes. Beta AND stress test. You just can't play the regular beta till the stress is done.
---
You won’t get invited unless you have an active sub.
---
Is the 10:17 duration coincidence then or are you planning for future monetization?
---
&gt; I'm sure Blizzard wants to eliminate private servers and well, classic wow is 110% not going to do that the way things are currently looking.
---
I'm hoping that private servers still exist once classic releases as it means we are less likely to have to deal with insufferable morons like yourself.
---
Jesus this is probably a good reminder that classic wasn't perfect. 
---
As nostalgic as we are, we should be open to making changes that will benefit the game (short of things turning it into retail). 
---
This is my personal opinion, but as long as Classic doesn't 1) homogenize classes 2) minimize player interactions 3) and decrease engagement with the game world, I will be content to play it for quite some time.
---
He did use it at about 18 seconds in, but it has a lengthy enough cooldown that it wasn't up again
---
Me and my ex broke up last august. While I was all in at first for all that sweet time to game, I was already feeling to be ready for something new again. Well until the release was announced that is, I'm gonna ride it out for another year.
---
Don't let the fine collectable condition of them fool you, they are very old
---
What if the drop menu says "Beta: Battle for Azeroth"? Wasn't in the BfA beta and got a new PTR account according to the website
---
Just shift-click the person's name calling for DM group. If they're in their level 20 area, then yeah they're calling for Deadmines.
---
You know how I know it's pronounced gif? Cause I have to type another word to say it's pronounced the other way
---
The entitlement is real.
---
The dank flank in Arathi was fun to watch.
---
Yeah he's still gonna go on and do his part, it's just he thought it was the real beta and the stress test
---
I’m American and it’s been DM since vanilla
---
drops from these voodoo piles inside the instance.  But they are surrounded by mobs.  Easiest way is to run it and roll on them when they drop.
---
Played as alliance on the Arthas server 06-07 it was VC.
---
Right? It's great out today though
---
There was even an early version of Black Morass that is in the Vanilla map files, but it's un-reachable from the game world.
---
I think it’s fair to say given the parent company involved here that serious evidence will be required to back that claim up. Full stop.
---
Exactly. I'm doing that atm. but i just cannot decide for a class that is both fun in PvE and PvP still sadly.
---
I'm really torn at the moment between basically all classes (except for rogue, priest or warlock). 
---
I'm planning on playing with my friends, who are playing the classes listed above. We don't plan on going super hardcore but more than likely we will end up doing some kind of end game casually (dungeons, raids, pvp, etc). 
---
With that in mind, I'm not sure which class to play as a "fill" for our group. As of right now, I'm more leaning towards shaman as I do think the class is both fun and needed. I could tank lower level dungeons as we level up, but shamans are also very much needed at the end game. 
---
That said, I still would think rolling as a warrior or druid will give us more flexibility at 60 since we would not need to worry about finding a tank for any 5 mans. However, I know that I would be pressed to be accepted in a raid environment. 
---
Even then, hunters are also in my scope as they are top tier wpvp as well as BG pvp; so I cannot rule them out either.
---
At this point, I'm just so torn between all that I need some outside opinions or perspective to see if that will allow me to clearly choose.
---
Anyone who still has an active account now that was active in vanilla with no shenanigans associated with it should get an invite to the closed beta.
---
Change my mind.
---
Here is a post from 2006 mentioning having to use a macro. Was the best evidence I could find. BC launched in early 2007 so this would be during vanilla. I'm like 95% certain you needed a macro for this as Eagle Eye was a toggle, if you tried to use it again it just turned off . The macro is a little more complex now than it was then but you still needed one.

I think a lot of people forget how toxic some people were in Vanilla. The forums were terrible and until LoL were considered one of the most toxic gaming forums.
---
I was expecting to see the elevators in UC and TB here  &lt;.&lt;
---
You do realize 4 of those 6 addons were actual vanilla addons, right?
---
The other 2 were addon-types that existed but weren't that exact addon by name.

according to the email the server is online for extra 5 hours.

You wont :) But that does not mean that we will not return to life and wreck the one who dared stand in our way in the first place.
---
No, it really isn't personal preference. You don't type in chat, "lfg cotton candy" but you are talking about molten core. The proof like I said is the name of the dungeon, It's The Deadmines, stay triggered.
---
Redo the poll:  
---
DM (played in Vanilla)
---
VC (played private server)
---
Try and get into the beta. That is the stress test. How stressed will you get?
---
I'd say
---
Hunter lock druid priest mage shaman rogue paladin warrior
---
Druids are definitely faster than either mage or shaman
---
Who the fuck calls it VH lol
---
Yeah I honestly don't know what to say to people that think interupting under pressure is some huge feat. Ofc at first it can be hard, but play for a while and it comes a second nature.
---
That says West Esterthemolester, you're fired again...
---
It's amazing, especially with sriracha
---
No it kinda didn’t.
---
New content makes old content obsolete, it has nothing to do with where that content is placed.
---
How relevant is Loch Modan to lvl 60s? Fucking tell me, retard.
---
Tuna out of a can?
---
Was VC on Tichondrius for as long as I could remember
---
I have a salty former coworker in that area. Still trying to convince him to get back into wow.
---
But for real actually hyped to be a part of the test tonight.
---
That's interesting because when I started playing wow in the end of 2005 I always saw people call it VC, I don't think I ever saw it called DM. Which admittedly did confuse me at first.
---
Dire Maul was DiM for our server
---
What's VC?
---
So? The effect will still proc and the server will still have to handle it
---
[Raider.io](https://Raider.io) is more than a gearscore checker though. It checks what instances and such you've run (and highest mythic for each dungeon), your time to completion, and other stats and then assigns you a score.  I don't know honestly how it would even work in vanilla.. only thing would be if you killed certain bosses but is there even a way to track that?
---
Im not really a fan of it on the modern game so I hope to not see it in classic.
---

If you want to keep mining/engineering then find a warrior buddy with enchanting and do DM East duo runs, it takes about 12m/run. The warrior needs to be 60 and preferably have a decent blue set. The healer can do it before 60 but not sure from what level, it's not about difficulty but about pulling extra mobs.
---
Disenchant blues and sell shards for 7g+-, sell the weapons. The occasional classbook can sell from 5 up to 150g. Quel'Serrar is your holy grail. There's a bunch of Rich Thorium veins.
---
tbh retail wow (battle for azeroth) is a completely different game than classic by now. way too many changes, it would be easier to list whats actually the same, not different.  
---
I have trouble explaining newer wow players why classic is a great game and not just an 'immature bfa'. In general its an MMORPG, not a semi-soloplayer lootpinata hamsterwheel :7
---
You must be confused on the difference between being in a closed beta test vs being in a 24 hour stress test.
---
Lets do the math, normally women discover they are pregnant around 8 weeks. So that means OP has 7 months before the baby comes (congrats btw). August 27th is just about 3 months away so that leaves about 4 months of vanilla wow grinding before your daddy duties kick in. Plenty of time I say. Good luck to you OP.
---
&gt; I just read up and level 5 is the max level?!
---
At least you finally read something
---
Don’t level as holy. Get consecration and then go prot or ret. I prefer prot. None of the gear you get while leveling will last long at 60 no matter what spec you are
---
thats enough time to get all the level 5s horde and alliance side to meet somewhere and clash right?  
---
Like getting all the Horde to gromgol and walking to Elwynn, to fight against the raids of Hogger, or whatever the alliance will be up to during that time
---
definitely not best DPS or leveling lol
---
warrior salt
---
Warrior vs mage in classic is such a massively lopsided matchup that it doesn't really matter what he did there, he was always going to die.
---
Every god damn day I am swapping class. It sucks that I won't have time to play a lot due to the fact that they release classic sooo late.
---
I really want to play shaman at first, then druid.. then hunter.. priest.. and now I'm back at Ele/Restro shaman.
---
Instance reset definitely was a thing. Was farming Uldaman back then.
---
Do you even know who vurtne is?
---
I was on Kalecgos for mostly the tail end of Vanilla, and all of BC so those may only be BC guilds. Still good to see a fellow Kalecgosian, a real shame what happened to our server population wise.
---
Hope I see you ingame when classic drops.
---
Depend on the class but I feel leveling to 30 then running some dungeons and BGs will give a good overall feel.
---
A class like Warlock I think you'd be able to get a good feel earlier while Shamans should really get to 30.
---
No and I don't want to be.
---
The stress test would be between midnight and 2am for you, not 6am.
---
Where are the "I'll keep playing retail" ?
---
I've played every expansion even when not too thrilled about them. I have every allied race unlocked in retail so I've played BfA a good amount, but I just have zero desire to login anymore since its gotten so bad. Can't wait for Classic.
---
He means 2005 retail Vs classic.
---
Not CMAA I believe.
---
By speccing as a healer, you are sacrificing your ability to effectively solo quest. By using a typical leveling spec, you are sacrificing nothing because you can both heal and quest effectively.
---
Druid were completely fine. Played one from day one of the game launching until MOP. I was consistently neck and neck with the other best healer in our guild and we were a top NA guild at the time.  
---
If you want to min/max only, and you are the type of person that only plays meta, druid is not going to be #1 at ALL times at anything it does during a raid. But people on this subreddit for some reason keep trying to make them out to be as if you're playing a level 25 character in level 60 content in terms of efficiency. However anyone saying druid is bad in PvP is an absolute clown lmao.
---
Everyone, thank fucking god.
---
I'd recommend Arms generally but you should go based off of the best available weapon to you, be it 2 1handers or a 2hander. I go into detail about warrior leveling in my guide if you want to check it out:

Its VC dammit - DM is Dire Maul - Played on Illidan 2005
---
And this is why I’m scared shitless to roll a warrior in classic
---
&gt; You have access to the stress test for 2 hours later today
---
Let's start one bro
---
Not surprised. Private servers usually ramp up the difficulty by impairing the players, like 0.5 x exp, shittier droprates, etc.
---
Who can pass up cannibalizing your opponent after you defeat them in PvP?
---
You must not have done any twinks then. I had to go in there if I wanted to make any leather twinks for PvP, which is where I spent the majority of my time in Vanilla. Twinking, that is, not in Deadmines....
---
I think if you wanted to do Resto and shit, WC was better, but Rogue for sure and probably Hunter/Feral was DM for twink gear. Plus the bandanna looked dope as fuck.
---
Lol it's vc. Dm is dire maul
---
Did the nodes and these piles with my hunter alone. Loved to try how many I can get. Feigh death is super fun to mess around with.
---
The stress test lasts for 2 hours.
---
Everything you listed is legal and only has consequences on the person doing it and no one else.
---
Gold farming/selling/buying has huge consequence on the ingame economy AND is against TOS. Buyers like that is also why you get gold spam in whispers every couple minutes on Private servers atm. It will likely be the same on classic.
---
Imagine trying to defend gold farming. Get out.
---
It works but you don't get teleported to the entrance anymore.
---
Coincidence.  If you look at my other stuff, there's stuff stuff that goes just under 10 min and decently past it.  If I could make money doing this that'd be awesome, but it seems the trouble to set up an account for that is no where near worth the 1 dollar a video I'd get... I'm just doin it as a creative outlet, man
---
Firetree, VC
---
[And yet again, everyone who says what server they're on says it was VC...](https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/awzxft/comment/ehr3hcy)

A schooner IS a sailboat, stupidhead.

But are duids viable tanks through all dungeons to 60? I thought they had trouble holding aggro?

I played a shitton of classic and I dont even know how he immuned that HoJ. Very impressive
---
I usually make something like stew or pasta sauce in advance so I don't have to worry about cooking for a while. And carrot cake.
---
its because its the same download / install as the actual beta ....
---
sup fellow arthas bro

If you're going to go into Inspiration you should really go a full 5/5 int Holy Specialization since Inspiration procs off of crits and Holy Spec gives you more crit.
---
Kala is also playing priest and streaming. Undead.
---
What? I called it VC all the time. Asia servers here.
---
Fuck... loot lag... I nearly forgot.
---
What makes Druids great in AB? Is it just the general survivability and slipperiness of the class to keep tagging moonfire on people attempting to cap a point?
---
because your not in the beta, you are in the stress test
---
Can you die on one continent and rez at ANY graveyard on another continent after a boat ride like you could in Vanilla?

Will a simple /logout or /quit also break being tied to rez at a particular graveyard?

Awesome dude! here's [my setup](https://i.imgur.com/fOk03B5.jpg) :P
---
Roseville checking in
---
Warriors top charts by the time they get pre-raid BiS, but fire mages catch up in Naxx and get close in AQ, with Rogues not far behind.
---
It was vc on Argent Dawn as well.
---
Would you say something like this would be a good way to go? https://classic.wowhead.com/talent-calc/paladin/AvAQATwEjzdw3A
---
That's not to bad I guess.
---
And I thought I was into this game
---
That's what we are were discussing. Why are you trying to change the subject?
---
A mage his lvl 30 first in the beta.  Once they get away from the pack, they can start AoE farming and pull ahead.  This will only be possible on launch week.  Joanna said it on stream as well, mages are the fastest levelers now.
---
The Beta could definitely use a few more players. Kinda hard to find People for Groupquests. If I wasn't playing a WL I would be kinda annoyed at that.
---
Always baffled me after years I had no idea there was an undead section to deadmines.
---
There IS a queue system in place. During the few minutes the servers were up yesterday, I saw a "You are &lt;1 in the queue" flash for a moment before getting in.
---
Same with you bud. Just started playing on a classic private server to get a feel for it before launch and I'm loving it. It's like a different game. Hyped.
---
No I‘m not, I‘m not good with mages.
---
Ok. That's good for you :)
---
Will you let the adults continue their discussion?
---
What is this Alliance trash? Get it out of my face.
---
Oh man that brings back so much. Can't wait for being clumped together waiting for the BG to start. There was always so much silly crap going on.
---
Am from EU, have considered the same
---
I am facing the same problem. Really thinking about staying up since it would be enough for me to get up around 07:20 and it's a pretty chill office job, I think nobody would notice me sleeping at my desk.
---
No you'll be fine.  You have a taunt and "heroic strike" type ability (maul) that does bonus threat.  Swipe is a great AOE threat tool.  Demo roar also causes some initial aggro to help keep them all focused on you.  Once you're being hit by all mobs you can maul / swipe very often and taunt when needed.  Feral rotation is different from warrior but it's still effective.
---
Been VC since 05. The only times i heard DM was occasional debate on new servers starting up. ie. people arguing to call it DM since no one will be in DM for at least a few weeks, these people would be pretty much immediately ostrasized for calling it DM though, with the classic "lol looking DM group in westfall" and such.
---
Frost mages shit on warriors, they have WAY TOO MUCH mobility and CC.
---
If you call it VC you probably also have your toiletpaper the wrong way around and fucking loved The Last Jedi and the latest GoT season.
---
I have 2 PTR accounts. What's it matter?
---
Jump run?
---
server's online for 26 hours.

They are asking for help, and ill gladly oblige since its in MY interest. Its mutual benefit.

Im sorry if i offended you, just wanted to legitimately ask if other people feel the same way over those 10:01-10:40 videos out there. i really liked your video, great content! :)

that settles it i guess

Oh, dont worry. They know.

Same. My guild wanted you to have your dungeon set before joining the MC group. No mention of BiS.

So there are a few people!! Everybody feel free to message me if you’d like to join the classic World of Warcraft discord  I made

Why not DM for DireMaul and dm for deadmines

Apparently there's a back-end limit of 2, so the flagging process appears to have skipped our accounts.

Hey brother! Wish for the life of me I could remember my guild name. Great group of people. Introduced me to teamspeak (now I feel old) and helped me grind through Scarlet Monastery before I went to college and could keep a balance. Great memories.
---
I main'ed a priest during Vanilla. You can heal without any real issue as shadow until the low 50s.
---
Once you start hitting mid 50s and above player skill, group composition (the more cc the better), and what instance your doing start to matter more.
---
Well, what I meant is, that most races do the "first aid" animation, when picking up stuff like that.
---
You are so triggered its hilarious, unpopular opinion really made you feel insignificant in real life? you should get on some medication loser.

5/5 for me

I always love going to DM as Horde. Its a nice adventure and you can have some nice PvP if you are lucky.

My little brother would watch me play WoW and I started pretending that fishing was the most fun thing to do. Eventually I relented and let him try fishing. Thanks for leveling fishing for me Dustin.

You're good, I can appreciate healthy skepticism :)

This being such a big question but the bigger question for me was what do you call the Strat wings?
---
On my server they were "Scarlet Strat" and "Baron run" but I also saw Live and Dead Strat as names.

Idk that i'd exactly say ill be playing classic and retail, but im also not sure that ill entirely quit retail.  Ill probably hop on here and there to see new content once im a few months in on Classic, but im planning on spending the vast majority of my time on Classic.
---
What does that have to do with the content of the video?
---
Are you guys new to Vanilla?
---
First time?
---
That‘s super basic and not the hardest, I‘m sure your Venruki guy will agree on that.
---
I actually went through a ton of the old NES games on an emulator to see the difference about 5 years ago. I beat a lot of games pretty easily. Mike Tyson can still suck it though and I dont want to hear shit about Battletoads. it was a fun experiment and put a lot of perspective on how much better I am now.
---
hey, can i be your buddy as well?

Love that video. One crit and he’d be down.

Says you who posted this rant and spends all day posting to pictures of women on the internet. Nothing says a lonely beta male more than the type of posting you do.
---
As a vampire I find your sarcastic tone offensive.
---
Many many people, in all my experience in vanilla, did I rarely get a full group standing in westfall alone. 
---
I'd start looking for folks in westfall, then move to stormwind and use general and looking for group.
---
I almost always finished the group out while in stormwind doing crafting or AHing.
---
is the quest not marked as a dungeon quest?
---
gz
---
he ice blocked it..
---
That was never possible.  To get inside the instance you have to zone in, and when you are zoned in you instantly get put at the entrance.  People just called it a VC run because back then a lot of low levels would go into deadmines to do a couple quests and never end up actually finishing the instance.
---
Pick the class based on the playstyle, not the gear.
---
&gt;most of the BIS lists i checked essentially seem to recfomend a lot of cloth and never shield offhands.
---
Sounds great, if that makes me a better paladin healer.
---
Server is open for 24 hours, but actual stress test happens for 2
---
We called it VC when we got the quest to kill VC. There wasnt a quest to clear out the Deadmines. We grouped for VC, the quest.
---
Go tank if you want to fill for your group.  Warrior or druid.
---
You are running your own repack. Don't tell me you confuse the client with the server. :)
---
Does layering benefit aoe mages?
---
Son of a...
---
It seems to me that they are referring to the boss considering you linked to an item specifically off of VC.

---
ctrl+f VC and then ctrl+f DM
---
The only reason i see for it is because of how much less obvious it is in classic than in retail.  True, csing a heal is like pvp 101, but to catch it while assessing a 2v1 wPvP situation without enemy castbars/arena addons or macros really clutched that fight for him.
---
Imo you should level gold char 2nd. You don't really need much gold early at 60 unless if you are dead set on having epic mount, the gold needs are spread out over time with consumes repairs and respecs.
---
I played back before teles to instances and When u had to actually to do the pre quests for the dungeon quests. 
---
I always referred to it as DM cause common sense says if a toon in the teens is LFG its for diremaul
---
I never once heard VC when at level for deadmines. From nov 2004 through 2006, on 3 different servers, I only ever remember people asking for deadmines as DM.
---
When folks asked for Dire Maul, it was DMeast, DM tribute etc.
---
Because the Mountain Dew in their veins tells them they are on the same tier as shit streamers because they are beta testing on the same servers as them.
---
They 100% did. This is a better way to visually display it to the community (and not a bad way to spot check the automated testing).
---
WARCRAFT COOKBOOK
---
You should check out the stickied thread about choosing classes
---
 Thinking about playing Warrior but was wondering about something my memory is hazy on. I know they’re gear dependent but how do they do in PvP in early phases? Like if you get pre raid PvP bis type gear and you’re facing off against other people in blues, are they decent? Or do you need to wait till bwl/later MC to pick up even if you’re ahead of the gearing curve, so to speak?
---
I'm all for calling it DT personally
---
Yeah. I imagine most people that try and stick to both will inevitably drop one. Or quit completely.
---
Haha, yeah - I thought it sounded funny so I ran with it.
---
Can confirm. Was also on Thunderlord, and everyone called it VC. It's weird to me that anyone calls it DM, but to each his own I suppose.
---
You fool you fell for one of the classic blunders.
---
you just make about 30 bolts from 60 cloth to get 30 tailoring
---
then make/learn linen robes which is a green craft
---
then disenchant all the robes which hopefully yields you 2 lesser essence
---
then you make the rod and then the wand bam
---
VC sounds like the russian version of wc, u know what i mean)))))))))))))))))))))))
---
I didn't get one, it just popped up in my launcher. Some people say they got an e-mail tho. Pretty random.
---
Why do people downvote posts like this?  I'm wondering the same.  Can't find it anywhere.
---
Calling it DM becomes a problem when Dire Maul is the current content.   Abbreviating Dead Mines to VC (Van Cleef) just simplifies it.
---
This sub is fuckin toxic jesus lol
---
I believe so, I would say yes, you need to be subbed
---
Yah I played all 3 in classic.  Leveled all 3 to 60, raided through naxx, and competed high level bgs and wpvp.  They all suck go mage or Warlock
---
Same but im not subbed to retail.

Coming up with this epic healing shield from BWL on the database. 17% drop rate from Vaelastrasz. I think we are the only shield bearing healers alliance side so should be no competition for it should it drop.
---
I played vanilla warrior and Hunter and honestly the big thing about classic is that there will always be someone that kills you. You can be the best geared warrior in all of WoW but a shadowmelded hunter that crits his aimed shot can kite you forever. 
---
Similarly the best hunter of all time can get hamstringed and cleaved into oblivion. 
---
If you are more group-oriented and lead from the front I'd recommend warrior. If you are more about yourself and your personal success then hunter is up your alley.
---
You right! They are only observing for those two hours. Thanks for correcting me!

I have 4-5 people from the burbs playing. All lower 30s as well.

Blizzard can go fuck themselves if they think I'm gonna waste my time helping them
---
So you’re saying interrupting a heal isn’t a good play.  Okay.
---
Not sure if satire
---
I feel like the hunter worries were never really an issue for me on either of the P-servers I played on. With the age of the game comes a lot more experience, and I think a number of hunters have become pretty good at the game.

Freeze trap cycling isn't all too hard. I bind freeze trap to the same key as my feign death with a macro so that if i want to insta-drop a freeze trap i just jam the key over and over to feign/instantly drop the trap. Works every time. The only thing to juggle is your FD cooldown at that point + a distracting shot to pull the mob
---
Argument: There are plenty of people that were saying that private server data was accurate. 
---
Proof: One Reddit comment quoted 3 times. 
---
Is this all you do? Try to quote selections of comments and take the “technically” route?
---
I will take this into consideration.
---
you're missing out man. Deadmines (DM) in vanilla wow with a bunch of noob 17's is 'The Goonies' in videogame form.
---
I figured as much, but it never hurts to make sure people get the info they need in case someone else finds this post they have a video explaining how it works. I honestly didn't know about it until a buddy of mine showed it to me, and my whole retail guild freaked out about me saying leveling with a staff and some spirit would go along way.
---
Illidan here, also called it VC
---
Lmaooooo you cheeky fox
---
You used to be able to type a bunch of spaces and then "[Guild][Player]: blah blah blah" to make it look like someone else was talking in chat too.  Had a lot of people fall for that
---
true, tensions are high good luck in the future
---
Crazy reading this. Everyone so old and mature with their food decisions. Lucky enough I’m young and uni student. So my snacks and food are going to be the biggest pile of diabetics and unhealthy shit just as it was for past two xpacs:)!
---
Imo people put too much stock in looking good while in a raid environment. You are there for like 6 hours a week tops, you can still have a baller pvp set outfit for anything else.
---
I wasn't aware you could use potions in bear form.
---
Playing a disc/holy spec will leave you hard casting and you will run out of mana at one point. Regeneration isn't the same was as you think it is. If you're hard casting 2+ spells per fight, you're going to have to drink. Smite actually sucks so hard, because you'll also have to shield yourself to reduce pushback, which costs even more. Running a smite spec isn't going to be better imo, and that's from my experience on beta.
---
At the end of the day, do whatever you want - it's Classic. You can make anything viable, but I'm just saying that I've found my spec to be insanely strong.
---
wtf does VC stands for?
---
I dont think people would care if it was just a couple posts here and there, but its literally fucking constant.  Its the same thing *over and over and over*.  Its flat out gotten old.
---
FWIW, i havent really been flaming those people, i mostly downvote, roll my eyes and move on...but it really is getting annoying seeing the posts every 20 minutes.
---
Yeah im pretty biased towards hunter  I've played the same hunter since vanilla. Hunters are probably the easiest class to farm qith as long as you keep your per happy and healthy you can grind quite easily and all it costs is time and mana 
---
I would recommend either herb/alchemy for consumables and making money or mining/engineering for crafting ammo.
---
Imagine ending that potential new 80 man raid. A set of stairs open up that lead to a new 120 man raid. That would be insane.
---
It's the play you should be making. Not interupting should be a bad play, not the norm.
---
Alliance? PVP?
---
This, it was always DM. People running Dire Maul would specify as DME etc.
---
&gt;Strat
---
This so much
---
On retail we always called it strat scarlet in vanilla, but playing private servers people always called it living or undead. Maybe it's an EU vs NA server thing?
---
Enchanting + 5 mans.
---
It isnt terribly hard to get a dps set out of pvp gear, dungeon blues, t1 run off. 
---
gathering professions. Playing the AH. 
---
Leveling a mage/hunter/lock/rogue alt for farming. 
---
If you are intending to raid 2 nights a week (maybe 3). That leaves you with 156-160 hours not in raids. Assume 16 hours for sleep and work per day. Thats 44 spare hours you could spend playing wow. 
---
Speccing into a dps spec and having a solid 3-4 hour farm can net you 200-300g. If you are dedicated in your farming you can easily respec and make up the difference in one session. If you have 4-5 days between raid week end and beginning youve got plenty of time--especially if WOW Classic is your "main" game. 
---
A combination works well too, for instance. I intend to have an alt with alchemy for transmutes as well as a gathering prof as added money while farming. 
---
Fishing is also a good non combat way to make money
---
You were downvoted but I think your prediction has come true.
---
What..?
---
Thanks, I have been thinking of doing something like this for my own healing classes! Do your MHPM calculations account for the down-ranking penalties that were implemented by 1.12?
---
What’s DireMaul then? You just call the wings?
---
Frost Mage @ 30  
---
Blink into group combat  
---
Frost Nova and root parts of their group
---
Cone of Cold and Slow other parts of their group
---
Cold Snap - Repeat Frost Nova &amp; Cone of Cold  
---
Ice Block to protect yourself while your group moves up to kill all those you have CC'ed  
---
This works best when the enemy is retreating, all the people you frost nova usually get left behind and can easily be taken out.
---
exactly i've always just called them all DM
---
It's all good, who wants to lose their job over something that will be reset in August. It's better to lose your job right before christmas anyway, everybody knows this
---
i actually forgot about that i remember a bunch of people wearing it so yeah it must have been a popular choice coming from the second boss
---
We are a good group of dudes. So anyone and everyone is welcome
---
Not going to mock people calling it VC, but Dire Maul won't be available at launch.  Deadmines will.  DM will be Deadmines at launch. DM E will be Dire Maul East. DMW for Dire Maul West and DMN for North.  Simple and easy differentiation. Never understood why people needed VC when anyone in Westfall or below the mid-20s saying "LFG DM" or "LFM DM" is obviously looking for a Deadmines group and anyone 40+ asking for DM is looking for Dire Maul.  
---
However, why worry about this until Phase Two?
---
I feel like you're talking about two different things. The class the most equates to a Carry and can make something a great experience rather than a terrible experience is warrior, both in pve and pvp. The difference between a good warrior and a bad warrior is a million miles apart.
---
However you seem to imply more of a trickster role, someone that can adapt and manipulate situations, not just punch the problem away. For that I'd say mage for pve and druid for pvp. Druid in pvp is just an endless bag of tricks, however a lot of it is sorta irrelevant for pve. Mage probably comes in at second place with their utility tool kit, and most of it is very relevant for both pve and pvp.
---
Whether it was or not (I think it is), it made me laugh.
---
Stat dependent - the better your gear, the better you perform. Just compare warrior pre-bis shoulders to the aq40 ones. 
---
Simple put against an equally equipped player, you are better of the better your gear.
---
I type "LFG Deadmines". Those extra 8 key presses save any bullshit chat.
---
I have the same predicament
---
part of me says go priest, part of me says remake my first guy
---
Yeah. Made some great vids back in the day. Hey played on my server, too. Sadly on the horde side, I was alliance. He was amazing for the time, about average by current standards.
---
as is said in every single thread about this, no one has ever just used DM to convey Dire Maul as there are wings associated with it.
---
Wtf man...
---
shapeshifting to avoid literally everything
---
That’s not an excuse for having to wear a dress.
---
“Attention Hunters: Please remove taunt from your Pet Action bar”
---
Ah. Perhaps it's the modern client with certain functionality rolled back as far as it can go?
---
Warriors really come into their own after they get plate at 40 and a decent weapon. Those first 30-40 levels are tough, though.
---
DM for Deadmines is never a problem. 
---
Dire Maul is DM:N for North, DM:E for East and DM:W for West and of course Tribute.
---
stop fucking gatekeeping lmfao
---
Goldshire Vendor sells all of the best items a lvl 5 can get.
---
Only till about level 50. For BRD and LBRS, it would get tough. You’d struggle with mana.
---
No way could you main heal raids as shadow.
---
Mostly saw it VC on my server(silver hand) I wonder is theres more to it(launch servers vs the servers spun up to meet demand)
---
I only remember because I was super confused at first ("what is vc??")
---
Wife confirms it was VC for her(she started a few month after me) but over time it shifted to DM.
---
This is the post we need! xD  
---
Lvl 5 Horde vs Alliance CLASH  
---
BiS = all the greens in the world that you amass during stress test  
---
maybe professions have some?  
---
Also I believe Silver will be useless so if you have players wanting to sell greens for silver buy that shit. Silver would be useless.
---
We always called them "strath live" and "strath dead"
---
Yeah, VC is 100% not the American abbreviation.  But way to be wrong and offensive at the same time!
---
Good. Now let this topic die.
---
These type of comments confuse me.
---
You forgot one Option: No, because I didn't opt in for beta/don't have active retail sub
---
Dire Maul South? Never hear of that one before.
---
I feel like it was one of those things that varied by server.  My original alliance PVE server did "Scarlet Strat" and my horde PVP server called them Live and Dead Strat.
---
It's the only way to stay rock hard
---
No he didnt?
---
I used the tool tips provided on Wowhead for my information. Do you have additional information I need to take into account for my data accuracy?
---
ya idk about that my guy mages kinda dumpster warriors pretty easily in classic (even bad mages)
---
this comment is just cringe
---
No reason to downvote someone for asking, I would have assumed Blizzard would have posted something to lay out some of the differences, guess not.  Also are you confusing difference with bug?
---
Bout to pillage dat booty
---
I liked it,  not too much rambling, I loved hearing the reasons behind things.
---
this made me cringe
---
the god play is not blinking charge. if you blink a charge as a mage, you're bad.
---
You know I started on Day 2 in the beta, and even then I was surprised at just how much stuff was on the AH already.  There were already tons of greens, wands, cloth, etc on there for pretty cheap.  Yeah you have that one who will post a green for 100g..  but you can get a lot of stuff for near vendor prices.  Wands on day 2 were about 15s and now they're down to about 10s for a lesser magic wand (level 5).  
---
I know people might not be speed leveling because they have the time with the level 30 cap but if even half the people who are posting will post (with the already low number of people on beta) then I think the AH will fill up pretty quick.. and it's selling too.. ive made about 1g so far just selling greens on the AH, and im only in my low 20s.
---
VC doesn’t make sense from both the newbie and the  elite perspective. 
---
If you’re a new player and you get a quest to go to the Deadmines and you see in general chat “LFM VC” you’re not going to assume that’s for you.
---
If you’re someone who’s played the game a lot and have a basic knowledge of the game then you’ll be able to know that a level 17 player isn’t going into Feralas. Also if you’re doing Dire Maul then you’re 99% going to only do one wing that you’re specifying. In the one scenario where you want to do all of Dire Maul than you’ll have to specify that because most people aren’t fucking crazy enough to do that for no reason. 
---
Also Dire Maul came out after Deqdmines
---
Both are right. Obviously it was called DM before Dire Maul and then a lot of people switched to VC, but still some called it DM, because who the hell in Westfall is trying to gather a group for Dire Maul.
---
Marketing to whom?  Please expound.  People that signed up for the Beta are probably pretty likely to try Classic anyway - sounds like preaching to the choir to me.  
---
Also, if it was try to get people to reactivate their subscriptions then it seems they would have sent targeted invites to players that didn’t have active subscriptions, but that doesn’t seem to be the case.
---
It's a meme.
---
Playing the game normally is a way of testing as well.
---
Make a post and link the video here , its usefull and most people dont know about regen gear and staffs actualy beeing viable.
---
Why do you think the US military budget is so high, duh. They have to pay for an extra 6 hours a day
---
Then the Chinese will step into the gap. And I'll support them
---
I dunno. If he is describing her just as, “a bit” then I’d go for it.
---
Shift click. Yes, clearly that level 19 warlock is looking to get a head start on his epic mount quest in Dire Maul.
---
There is a fishable item that is going to go for a shit ton of gold when ppl start hitting 50-60. I'm not going to tell any specific details about it but i have made hundreds of gold on p-servers upon their release with my "trick" :)
---
What do you mean ‘pserver baby’? I played from vanilla to MoP.
---
It's better if it's fresh but it will work from a can, just add a teaspoon of light mayo
---
Yeah well, looks like 716 people are wrong.
---
Yeah. imo, Blizzard could bring the "not viable" specs up to "suboptimal" without changing the feel of the game or the meta. That way, you wouldn't see progression guilds with paladin main tanks, but you might see casual raiding guilds where the paladin can be MT for AQ20.
---
Yeah each region is getting its own set of servers, I do have a US version I might sub at some point :)
---
a/s/l
---
Alliance and PVP
---
Congratulations! I hope it's all smoothe sailing for you and your family!
---
read it again, it tells you where to check for the beta :)
---
Source?
---
&gt; If you refer to either of them as "DM", it's always ambiguous without more context.
---
If you're standing in Westfall and there's an instance called Deadmines and someone says DM how is that ever ambiguous?
---
I agree. I've never seen anybody do all of Dire Maul in one go, but I suppose it's possible people do that. No reason to give that it's own term since it would be so rare.
---
Why would anyone need a bodyguard? Why would rogue be a good class for it? So many questions...
---
Thanks for making the game worse for everyone else in that case.
---
Lol. You think you're being clever and cheeky by saying ''so no more content'' and I answer by saying that no, we dont need more content. Imagine being that insecure about someone having an opposing opinion lmao
---
i dont own bfa
---
i honestly was going to level a character or something on my non bfa just for fun
---
but it turns out there is no one playing under max level so the dungeon and raid funder is non functional
---
i thought i may have been able to lfr 110 nope , or group finder level a character for fun nope
---
its certainly a dead game under level cap so the decision to not play was pretty easy
---
you lookin good in that dress there ma
---
I completely agree and told my wife something similar. I told her that if I ever seem far too invested or seem overly irritated when real life means I can't play that she needs to let me know asap. We also have a newborn girl that I don't want to neglect even for a moment, she shouldn't miss out on time with dad because we are pushing progression in BWL and the guild needs my windfury totem or whatever. I quit back when Cata launched and played a bit when WoD released, but luckily I wasn't nearly as invested as my first stretch so I am hoping that means I can manage my time much better now. Knowing that classic is going to be around for a while really eases things for me and makes me feel like I don't need to rush to the endgame like I did in the previous expansions I played. Even just slowly leveling a couple of characters to lvl 60 and doing some pvp might be enough for me. At best I might be able to do some dungeons or a ZG/AQ20 raid late at night when the wife/baby head to bed.
---
Thanks...and, what's à SNOO?
---
I just hope they give us the beta access just like they did with wow classic on blizzcon. Everyone had like timed gameplay but they removed it and people played for as long as the blizzcon classic was active.
---
While I know this is objectively true, I find I'm much more likely to have and use potions when I can make them myself.
---
Yup! Such a shame
---
Bro it’s vc
---
I am so happy for your replies mate. You are legit 1 in 100 to answer my posts about techincal problems like these and be serius about. So thanks! I am using Windows 7. :)
---
I saw these responses and very similar responses in this sub, Classic Discussion on WoW Forums, and in various streams. Some worse than those.
---
I'm not going to cite a reddit post. Get over yourself. The hatred has been going on and its most likely from the dedicated viewers of streamers.
---
For Arms your weapon plays a huge factor, good gear with a shit weapon equals shit damage. Not so much for Fury since bloodthirst damage is based off AP not weapon damage. This doesn't apply to mages for example, good gear with a shit weapon you can do just fine with skill.
---
Thanks! I think warlock will be a good fit for me!
---
Yes, warlock endgame is just shadow bolt, sometimes corruption if you go 
---
DS/Ruin
---
I don't have Beta, but one thing I've noticed while watching WoW Classic streams, is that the flightmaster taxi mounts don't bank or point up or down when flying. They're just always facing horizontal now, and it doesn't look natural. I think this problem has been in retail since Cataclysm (since the dev team are using the modern WoW engine for Classic).
---
No, that's completely wrong. Nozehn can you please screenshot the email?
---
\*Pays horde to gank you\*  
---
\*Saves you\*

I stream a lot (and will be streaming on launch) for Classic. I'm a small streamer though - like 5-10 viewers on avg.  
---
My main is gonna be Dwarf Priest!
---
So far, “everyone” that only had 1 PTR that has refreshed their client had the Stress Test show up. It was reported that the Blizzard Agent that runs in the background HAD TO BE RESTARTED for it to show correctly.
---
Those that either rebooted their computer, or changed their client from Standard to Beta and back, or cleared the processes in Task Manager — those people had the client show up.
---
The issue was two-fold: there was a delay where emails were going out faster than the flags, because it was getting held up by all the errors of the 2 PTR accounts. That’s why some people got emails first and then the client showed up later. It was able to “catch up” to that spot, if that makes sense.
---
The conversation going on over at Blizzard right now is:
---
1.	Do we have enough confirmed downloads of the Stress Test to effectively perform the Stress Test?
---
2.	If not, they need to find a solution and get those others flagged correctly...but then...
---
3.	Do those people have enough time to download the client for the test?
---
4.	Test begins in about 4.5 hrs. I would say if a solution isn’t out within the next 2 hours, then no, most people don’t have the time to download the client.
---
5.	The other discussion is: can they push the Stress Test 2-hour window to tomorrow? Only problem with that is they then alienate the other people that didn’t have 2 PTRs.
---
At this point, if I am Blizzard, you move forward with the Stress Test (if you have enough confirmed downloads) and then fix the 2 PTR problem later and then invite all of those people to the next Stress Test. It’s sucks, but this is beta and we have to expect those things. And I’m saying that as a 2 PTR account that got invited and can’t get in, lol.
---
And that’s completely fine, thank you for doing that, blizzard needs people like you. I can see how if you play BfA and already had a subscription you wouldn’t mind hopping into the stress test for an hour just to fuck around. But i paid $15 to renew my sub for a chance at the beta invite, i’m not interested in paying $15 to stress test for 24 hours. I’m having fun leveling on a pserver, which i can go past level 30 and thats more beneficial for me. But i genuinely want to play their official beta to level to 30 and find any potential glitches along the way, I’m willing to pay $15 for that, but not a 24 hour stress test.
---
Just play Horde and go to WC instead.
---
Yeah I was the same. Played bfa for a month or 2 after release then dropped it. Currently playing on a classic private server cause of the hype and addicted to it. Cant wait.
---
I just type out "Deadmines" because I got tired of the memes.
---
You'll probably end up supporting Blizzard more because you're gonna have to keep buying new accounts when you get banned.
---
That wouldn't really add up
---
Fucks me off when people ask for a group for “vancleef”. It’s DM for Deadmines because as the blue said ..... DIRE MAUL DIDN’T EXIST!
---
&gt; because most people aren’t fucking crazy enough to do that for no reason.
---
Spending an entire day in Dire Maul ...
---
In all seriousness my husband and I played a lot of wow when our daughter was first born. We didn’t have to leave the house for it and we could wear her in a carrier while we played. And yes my husband would sometimes hold her and play at night when she wouldn’t sleep. On a side note, I was looking at my achievements a few months ago and I apparently got AotC for Kil’Jaeden... I have absolutely no memory of that and in fact was under the impression that I hadn’t raided in Legion. That lack of sleep in the first few months does a number on you.
---
My goal is to play the entire 2 hour stress test. That's what my job is. If I find a bug, it's icing on the cake.
---
AFAIK there is no restriction on where you can go, just the level you can reach.
---
Who the hell wouldn’t call it dm u freaks
---
Lol anyone claiming this is definitely remembering wrong. Every instance in the game was abbreviated based on it's name, why would anyone have ever used the name of the last boss to refer to DM before Dire Maul was out...? That never happened, on any server.
---
For sure, who wants to go out and buy potions? It just feels bad.
---
Saint to those who don't deserve.
---
Mine literally says BETA &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic???? wtf is that BAITTTTTTTTT
---
How about you let people play how they want to play instead of pooping on how others enjoy the game?
---
Once done with fishing : do the same for some main professions !
---
Yep. This plus a standing (or convertible) desk will combine naps and groups beautifully. You can wear it while sitting, but the little one’s legs get bunched up, which might cause some fussing. I use one like this one:

---
Before you know it, you will even be able to do this when the kid’s awake. But don’t fret about the time before that - the little potatoes sleep quite a bit. You’ll be fine!
---
The best resource by far, however, will be a group of people who agree with how you prioritize your family and the game. This applies to people on both sides of the fence. Neither side enjoys playing with the other, in my experience. Like-minded people are a huge part of being able to enjoy group content in any online setting.
---
some people on this sub really need to go check out the kronos bug report tracker. there they can see years-old discussions on some of the most brain-meltingly mundane details of vanilla wow. people linking to 2006 vids, screenshots, old forum posts. bringing together all the possible information on the topic and trying to interpret and execute it with as much accuracy as possible. but nah:
---
"private servers are not blizzlike" is all that needs to be said!
---
“For the end of the World spell press AlT-F4”
---
Thanks, i think i will give it a go! :)
---
well if you can find someone to hire you i guess
---
I can agree on that, but someone who has been pvping for a while pays attention to stuff like that. Thats why people notice cooldown usage without the helper-addons as well.

That's what it says, I hope you don't mind that it's german.

There was something you had to check off on your account in order to even be eligible. Someone posted a link at one point.
---
&gt; I dont even know how he immuned that HoJ
---
He didn't immune anything, because the paladin never casted it. He just kept trying to heal.
---
I believe that there was a primitive form of [downranking penalty](https://wow.gamepedia.com/Downranking) in effect before the 2.0 patch was released. Practically speaking it probably will not affect too much, but "the more you know" and all that.
---
Its not completely wrong.
---
This is an example everyone of Reddit, of how someone can sound completely justified and "know how" but be completely wrong about what he is refuting.

I was just saying its possible to buy/use all potions while you cannot buy/use some of the engineering items that scale in PvP
---
&gt;and anyone ~~40+~~ 55+ asking for DM is looking for Dire Maul.
---
Me and a friend of mine went to Thunderbluff and watched fireworks on new years eve..
---
YES! Exactly, i just heard it on the stream so i was just curious, thanks for actually understanding :D
---
One! One failed jump! 
---
Two! Two failed jumps!
---
Ah ha ha!
---
Yeah I'd still give the edge to Prot Wars and Feral Druids if memory serves me correctly but no one would turn down a Prot Pally. Maybe I'm wrong I just remember that Paladins didn't have as much mitigation on hard hitting bosses.
---
And engineering is painful to level. I'm probably starting herb alc for money and making a switch much time later. Hopefully in time for the WSG and pvp trinket release.
---
Yes, there is a Disc talent (5pts) to improve wand damage. Depending on who you listen to, either it or Spirit Tap should be your first 5 points
---
Exactly, I said 'just' DM. You always label the wing associated with it, such as DM *East*
---
Well if you ever sub it, let me know!
---
The stress servers will be up for around 24 hours. The first 2 hours will be what Blizzard more closely monitors on these specific servers.

I got it removed today from customer support live chat.

Hi, /u/Denkomeister
---
If you think these streamers wont take free shit left and right from other players when the game launches. 
---
I have a great lakefront house to sell you in the Sahara desert.
---
the instance reset command was in game, but I am unsure if it ported you to the outside of the dungeon or your hearthstone location.
---
Terrible warrior, should have stayed next to block and just auto attack on block end for free kill.
---
Alright, thanks!
---
This applies to literally every single thing in the world.

Thanks for the post. Helped ease my worries. This will be the only game I’m playing so sounds like I’ll be perfectly fine to afford respecs. Someone else also pointed out I won’t need to go full Resto until later raids. So ideally I’ll get all the expensive stuff out of the way before I have to start paying for respecs.
---
Only one of those choices can have a cosmetic option of having no jaw. With that in mind, I feel like there's no choice at all
---
For BOSS'S yeah but for elite (NON boss) no it isnt
---
I won’t sub just to get into the beta so no.
---
BOUND by the iron will of the Lich King...
---
classic is hevily based on the retail client
---
Do yourself a favor and READ the email what it says. It's going to be available all through Thursday 23rd after the stress test is over.
---
"Once the stress test period is over, you’ll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23." 
---
 By the way you just did the same thing, contradicting yourself but oh well. Have a great rest of the day.
---
did the same thing today! just created a ticket, haven’t gotten a response yet.
---
Everyone showing their lack of vanilla credentials. It was universally VC in those days.
---
Nah, they are much better than hunters because hunters can’t AoE grind.
---
Faking the heal would be a good play.
---
I think a lot of people my age in europe learned english through games. How much time and dedication it takes? Idk about time but it takes zero dedication. You're not playing thinking that you need to learn english, it just happens because you are playing the game(s).
---
Tried that the other day, just checked again, with no luck unfortunately
---
This is not comparable in any way to Overwatch.
---
Thanks for your detailed reply, it's exactly what I was hoping for!
---
I don't like PvP all that much, so I usually just dabble every now and then. My choice won't be influenced by PvP performance :)
---
You've definitely nudged me a few steps closer to deciding on a druid! I haven't played a druid before wotlk so I have no idea how they worked before that point, so another point for being new and (hopefully) exciting.
---
I have 6 wow accounts linked to my battle.net account, 2 of those have been created during vanilla (one day one and the other a few months after release). I don't have an active sub on any of those 2 accounts. I have only one active sub on an account created during woltk, which I reactivated last week. All my accounts are EU. 
---
I had 150+ days played during vanilla, and I was part of the original closed beta. I started to play casually during bc, played the first part of woltk, didn't play cata, re subbed end of mop, played beginning of wod, beginning of legion, beginning of bfa. 
---
I just got an invite on classic beta.
---
Hope it help someone understand why he or she get or don't get into classic beta.
---
Relax. People called it VC before Dire Maul even came out. Mainly because VC meant a full clear.
---
It was VC on my server from day 1 of Vanilla (Burning Blade, alliance side).
---
There really is no right or wrong here.
---
I can't figure out how he immuned it either. I watched the video multiple times, and the only buff that falls off is Improved Mana Shield. So I would assume he must have been over his diminishing returns already?
---
VC. DM is Dire Maul
---
Neat! do you have pics of them on? :D
---
VC? What does that stand for even? I thought it was DM.
---
Hi, /u/Eeielen
---
&gt;you get a quest to go to the Deadmines 
---
You don't get a quest to go to the Deadmines, you get a quest to kill VanCleef. If your quest log says "Kill Edwin VanCleef and bring his head to Gryan Stoutmantle" and you see LFM DM, why would you think that's relevant? Even the previous quest that shows you where the dungeon is doesn't mention it by name.

yeah, no, if people are playing vanilla for "difficult content", they're going to be solely disappointed. you should be playing vanilla for the community, the fact that there's people outside, doing things in the world, about how the game itself forces you into the world, unlike the current retail version, allowing for more organic interactions.

If you have to end the title with a ?, It's not confirmed
---
As a vanilla rogue I made some badass saves. Usually always right behind the tanks in threat so if they die you can evasion tank or kite with sprint then vanish. Outside of raids you can sap, blind, and stun. Poisons bring slow and healing debuffs. Not to mention top end dps as well. Oh, lockpicking too.
---
Allright, so why not have a better time for EU players then? I'm glad they're testing things, that's great, but they literally said they'll be monitoring only those two hours. Why can't they be monitoring EU peak hours if they want as much people as possible. And it's not even Friday or something, it's literally a normal working week. Most of the people wake up tommorow to school/work. I seriously don't know what kind of traffic do they expect.
---
Cooldown period on layer switching, fixed the worst part.
---
DM is Phase 2.
---
It's mostly all in jest
---
Having said that, I will be ignoring anyone I see saying VC in game
---
You are gonna level with this specc? Seems pike masochism to me
---
Which potions require alchemy?
---
Your recollection sounds correct.
---
True but I would use pws in 5 man dungeons on a dps when they pulled aggro. I looked at it as healing in advance so I could essentially forget about that person while I continued to focus on the tank. Less efficient yes, but if they absorb all that damage, continue to take damage, and are not rescued by the tank then clearly someone who isn't the healer is doing something wrong. Either dps is not attacking proper target, tank is not holding threat, or the pull went very poorly. I'll try to keep them up, but I'm cleaning up someone else's mess while I juggle heals.
---
Why would being a healer matter in this regard?
---
That was TBC.
---
and actually yeah, shadow has a place in raids IF you heal. Most raids would rather take a healer who can put up Shadow Weaving over a dedicated Spriest, since you can instead bring another lock.
---
they just got printed gonna apply them when i get home.
---
A good way to increase your vocabulary is probably to watch a ton of movies/shows in spanish with english subtitles.
---
How do you set up so many streams like that? I’d also like to enjoy like 3 streams at once
---
Good luck to you if you think you’ll be beating any frost mage who is playing with at least 1 hand and isn’t blindfolded.
---
I always saw VC post dire maul
---
Whats the MCP?
---
Just say DM East/West etc and call Deadmines DM. Always found VC odd.
---
Seems fair enough. Any close matchup would come down to who can be bothered to farm it and has the cd up. Not exactly a fun way to determine an arena tournament final.
---
Right click their name and click “pop up window”
---
I don't think any do to be honest, so I ddint want to rule anything out/in based on that
---
VC = deadmines, DM = Dire Maul
---
and the guy inviting you should be nearby, so they cant just port you out whilst afking in stormwind/orgrimmar
---
Email says 1-8 CEST for me
---
It's more of an Oh Crap button as well as a self-defense thing when you're getting attacked.
---
Yeah that's what I thought, but the email I got didn't seem to back that up.
---
I'm in europe, so here the stresstest will be 5/23/2019 from 1AM to 3AM. so logically accordingly it should completely shut down at 3AM 5/24/2019. BUT in my mail it says, I'd be able to play on the server until 8AM
---
Being a rogue in general is a good way to earn some gold. You're not playing a rogue right if you dont pickpocket every mob you're able to pickpocket. Consistent pick pocketing brings in a lot of extra gold.
---
My guild used to make chats for each role. We had healer chat, tank chat, ranged and melee chats. It made communication a lot less cluttered on raid night. Also my server made a LFG chat that was often used to make groups.
---
No, people are remembering wrong. Why would DM have been the only instance in the game that people abbreviated using the final boss name?...
---
It may have been VC after Dire Maul came out but it surely wasn't before that, on any server, ever.

Might seem like a cash sink, but I play every expac whether it has been for like 2 to 4 months and quit, played the longest though back in bc and woltk. Vanilla too but I was too young to really know what I was doing. Raided in BC a little bit.
---
It’s VC.
---
Vanilla pvp is more about rocks paper scissors than it is about skill lul
---
Yeah, but a lot of people didn't use those so it seems "it wasn't in vanilla"
---
You would have to have at least some basis, probably. At least enough to ask people what stuff means when they use slang or stuff that's not in the dictionary. In OnlyBeat's story he said he had already taken some English lessons but he didn't pay attention that much.
---
I know nothing of streamers but everything I hear about this guy is negative. That said, he makes a fair point in terms of balance. Without time on everyone's side, this is highly limited. Balance should be preserved for sportsmanship, at least somewhat. Just my thought. I also don't know about this tournament so I'm just going off my stance from other games I've been in tournaments for.

---
Can't say I do, I was a kid back then, I fucked around with everything but leveling, so I only hit high 50'ies before TBC hit on my main. Had a few alts in mid-thirties though, haha.
---
I wish he were here to make classic wow videos :( r.i.p TB
---
really? what did it say in yours?
---
There were people spamming trade chat back in vanilla for any instance that includes deadmines. You would have 1 spamming in westfall and the other in a city.
---
\*laughs in horde\*
---
Why does he open with fireball into rank 1 frostbolt, why not just frostbolt.
---
IMO, get to 60 in your leveling spec. Then farm up 1000g while maxing your professions.
---
As a druid, your leveling spec should be feral. Feral can tank 5 mans at 60, so form your own 5 man groups, and bring priests as your healers. Youll get all the leather healing items by default. (If you are a shaman...just go straight to ele/resto, imo) 
---
Then once youve got a mount and are ready to get into raiding, swap specs into your mostly complete preraid resto gear. 
---
This assumes youre doing a more casual approach to the game. You know, the sane "ive got a job and a life" type people, the sorts of folks who die maybe 5 times 1-60 (not including pvp) but it still took them RL 2 months. 
---
If you're wanting to be closer to the Week 2 MC clear as opposed to the Week 12 MC clear, then youve gotta step up play time and probably your priorities--an epic mount isnt so important when you are trying to kill rag within 14 days of launch.

---
How?! Why would you go to a dungeon without the intention of doing a full clear?
---
I’m sorry but that doesn’t make any sense. I only ever saw people refer to DM as VC on private servers, never saw it back in the day.
---
It's fine. Realistically you won't get to pick and choose what raid gear to wear though. The bosses drop so little loot that you'll just have to settle for what ever you can get your hands on for a really long time.
---
Jesus dude, I can smell your neckbeard funk from here: calm down.
---
Shots fired
---
Damn, until this thread? You never played on a private server, I take it?
---
How do you make gold in Classic? Will class matter? Thinking UD priest or Orc Warrior or Troll Hunter.
---
VC on US Lightninghoof in vanilla as well. I heard it called DM as well, but VC was the one I saw the most, especially once DM was released.
---
That is good to know. Thanks, man!
---
That sucks.. any way to fix it?
---
Yep, that was my experience too. 
---
"LFM VC" meant you were currently on the quest for VanCleef in the same way that "LFM Hogger" meant you were on the quest for Hogger and wanted a team for that fight. "We're doing VC" meant you were in Deadmines because that's where VC happened to be, but VC never literally stood for Deadmines. That was DM.
---
"1sec, we're in the middle of DM" = halfway through Deadmines run, probably distracted by trash mobs
---
"1sec, we're in the middle of VC" = currently in the VC boss fight, run is almost over
---
I do remember seeing more and more (new?) people starting to refer to DM as VC because they started mixing up the acronyms, though.
---
Odd, blue post has, as of 9 hours ago:
---
&gt;The stress test will occur between 01:00 and 03:00 CEST (in the morning/night), which we realize isn’t exactly ideal for EU players and we’re sorry about that. You should still be able to play on the stress test realm after this short time frame though, up until Friday May 24 at 03:00 CEST (in the morning/night).
---
See, never let anyone tell you that just because something is popular that it's right.
---
hmmm not an idea im overly fond of I guess
---
Its obviously the least confusing. Someone is going to think you mean dire maul once it's released
---
Truth. 
---
My first 60 in Vanilla was a Gnome Warlock.  
---
I’ve played every class since and am running a Paladin in beta, but come the opening of the classic servers its back to Warlock country.
---
Casts Travel Form. 😁
---
To be honest "you get to level up to level 5 for 2 hours" isn't much of something to be jealous of.
---
I suspect someone at Blizz messed up the time zone conversion. Pacific Daylight Time is 9 hours behind MESZ. 6pm US PDT is 03:00 MESZ. But that MESZ time would be the morning of the 24th.
---
Even a bit I feel is still a double edged sword. A girl that's a bit on the crazy side could end up going full Misery on your ass if you string her along with your dick. On the other hand, some of the best sex I've ever had was with a crazy girl. Guess you gotta take the lows with the highs, right?
---
It was always called DM when I played Vanilla.
---
On Stormrage it changed to VC after DM launch.
---
Moooom!!! MORE HOT POCKETS!

Not really. I don’t watch streams at all, and the constant posts from people asking questions that could easily be answered by a quick search is astounding, I can easily see how it can be aggravating.

I was on Burning Blade, horde side and we called it DM. Mostly runs for the defias chest for 19 twinks, but we said DM, and then dire maul had the wing specified.
---
Deadmines: Full Clear.  Got it!
---
I actually asked Jeff Kaplan about these since he helped create Westfall! 
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/Overwatch/comments/9txd5c/blizzcon_2018_interview_with_jeff_kaplan_nicole/
---
&gt; ## Q: Who did you bribe to have Stranglethorn Vale not be in the WoW Classic Demo?
---
&gt; A (Jeff Kaplan): Well it’s even worse than that - I think it’s Westfall. Westfall was my first zone that I ever made. Me and Pat Nagle were the first two quest designers and we kinda flipped a coin and he took Elwynn Forest, which was the level 1-10 experience, and I had Westfall, which is the 10-20 experience, and I had such fun memories of it, but I’m like “Oh my god, so embarrassing”. It’s like if they had my highschool yearbook picture up, that’s what that WoW demo is like.
---
&gt; Q: It was definitely a trip down memory lane.
---
&gt; A (Jeff Kaplan): Oh did you play it?
---
&gt; Q: I did, I didn’t have a chance to get one-shot by a Defias Pillager yet but I’m sure when I get the chance...
---
&gt; A (Jeff Kaplan): It’s like the combo - not a lot of people realize that it’s combo. I think they were called “looters” - it was looters and pillagers that were the two spawns in Moonbrook and the looters looted you. They would throw a net on your feet and then the pillagers had a giant fireball and then you’d be like netted and you couldn’t get out of line of sight and at that level you didn’t have any interrupts.
---
&gt; Q: And people are paying and looking forward to do that all over again.
---
Thank you! Smooth sailing to you and yours as well!
---
Are these applicable for laptops?
---
No shit, Justin Beiber is still crap. I don't care how many albums he's sold.
---
Same client?
---
Yes it is, but this mage had 8% mana, no iceblocks, frost nova won't be up until the end of ice block.     
---
He would've definitely been able to win it.        
---
If he waits longer to move out, venruki has to sit in block assuming that hes in range (or warrior first aids giving him even better odds to win). So say warrior sits melee until almost end of ice block (assuming venruki stays in block waiting to get nova back up, since that would be LITERALLY THE ONLY WAY HE SURVIVES without the warrior doing what he did), then right before he runs out far enough to charge, or tries to bait the nova (but I think venruki is probably good enough to not fall for that).       
---
From that point warrior has a free charge, if not venruki COULD fireblast but then he's fully oom, evoing would gaurantee warrior gets on him (if warrior didn't first aid, it'd probably be close with how much mana ven would have), if warrior DOES get the charge off + no blink, I think ven's 100% dead with a melee -&gt; execute without being able to nova in time but that's just a guess.        
---
Unless I'm missing a step / something major, if the warrior played it correctly he wins it every time from that scenario
---
It’s almost like I said that in my post. I realized most people on classic were not the 30-40 year olds playing vanilla but the teens wishing to re-life their childhood games. I was talking to the guy above me that claimed most vanilla players were in their teens, wasn’t talking about this subbreddit or anything else.
---
Ayyyyyyyyyyy
---
/thread
---
Shhh, don't draw attention
---
For a warrior to win VS a mage he needs to be a gnome with engineering lol. Good luck trying to kill a good mage as a warrior without those 2.
---
That jump is super nerfed on retail. I'm a little afraid of it myself.
---
Fair enough. I find this use valid, but not good enough to take the 10% better bubble over more threat reduction.
---
VanCleef - the last boss is named Edwin VanCleef and some don't say DM so as to not confuse with Dire Maul
---
The stress test servers will be available untill 6pm 23rd, so for 26 hours in total. Not 2 hours.
---
That 2 hours are the hours blizzard will monitor the servers actively to see what's happening to them under heavy loads.
---
it should, they didn't nerf it till January 2006.
---
Pretty much as long as you stayed far enough away you didn't go into combat and could Rez people who could run back into the fight. Pretty much EQ zerg-style.
---
During the AQ patch, if memory serves, they changed it so you always get put into combat whenever any raid member is in combat while in an instance (or it might've been just raids).
---
Recruitment have started long ago some places. The Classic Guilds discord is one example.
---
Omg it's you!
---
some people started calling it vc (VanCleef) after dire maul came out.   
---
It'll always be DM to me.
---
Yeah probably is the reason but i still got my heart pumped up and shit then i launced and it was only stress test ;(
---
Class absolutely matters, for example as a mage you can AoE farm which is arguably the best way of earning gold.   
---
As a hunter you can solo tribute run in DM and kill mobs very efficiently in general.   
---
As a rogue you can pickpocket in instances which can earn you a lot of gold.  
---
If you roll a healer class you will most likely have to rely on professions.  
---
There is of course always the method of earning gold by playing the auction house if you want which is of course the method that people use who have the most gold in game but that's not exactly for everyone.
---
Second this.
---
True, but I feel that we need more dedicated testers to break systems and make sure things are working as intended.
---
Welcome Back!
---
If anything, they produce more aggro than warriors. They just seem to get hit harder (to me, at least) because they lack the mitigation (mainly dodge) while tanking dungeons while leveling. At 60, you're still amazing at 5man tanking and can even off tank AND heal in the same raid with a 0/30/21 spec!
---
Yes, this is all so true. Mages op. Warlocks bad. Don't play warlock, play mage 
---
/S in case it wasn't obvious
---
Why TF can't I know your wifes name?
---
100% this. I might not RP, but hell if I ever name my character something like that.
---
Well, that's comforting to know tbh. I'm pretty excited right now!
---
I only got to level 33 because I was a kid,but I do remember it being called VC, I dont know why. I also just called it VC (only because other people did).
---
smite does more damage than mind blast at early ranks - you end up casting whichever is highest rank.
---
hardcasting 2-3 spells at the start of a fight then wanding you will never run out of mana.
---
It should say "Beta / Stress Test: Classic Wow"
---
Twinking was a thing
---
Son of the Great Stallion, Ron Jeremy
---
&gt;If you’re a new player and you get a quest to go to the Deadmines and you see in general chat “LFM VC” you’re not going to assume that’s for you.
---
Except you'll eventually get a quest (if you are in that area) to kill Van Cleef. If you are a new player and you see "LFM DM" will you still know it's for you? Will you know what DM is? That it exists? No dungeon journal or anything. 
---
1) I think we have to give people credit, at least as far as curiosity. Someone is bound to ask "What is VC?" and 
---
2) Abbreviating a dungeon with the initials of the final boss isn't actually that insane if you consider that is normally the target of at least one dungeon quest that leads people to the dungeon in the first place.
---
Oooh,  okay, me and everyone at worked missed that
---
Same. If I wanna play an orc, I wanna see it mindlessly bashing skulls in his bloodstained heavy armor, not casting flashy spells in his fancy robes.
---
Sure, if you can convince someone to pay you
---
The stress test servers will be up for 26 hours :)
---
I was actually going to mention that quest in my comment. It says “Edwin VanCleef” I know VC means VanCleef because I did the dungeon and I know that. But if we’re assuming I’m dumb and new than I’m looking for a guy named Edwin. Plus the other quest you can get for DM specifically say Deadmine or talk about the mines in Moonbrook
---
I remember my first UBRS group as a fresh 60 wiping repeatedly on Drak. I think we replaced people leaving the group at least 5 times but we finally killed him at like 2 in the morning. Felt like beating the game :D
---
Druids are great for solo leveling and they are pretty decent AoE farmers if you know what you're doing. It also solves your raid spot issue as you can heal as well.
---
Why would playing a private server make a difference?
---
I played since 1.12 and Runetotem server always called it VC
---
paging /u/joshcorbo82
---
When I got my invite, I thought it was because a lot of people got in. Surprised to see I’m in a pretty low percentile. It’s a pretty decent representation of Vanilla tbh. I’m really enjoying it. Submitted a few bugs, but haven’t found all that many.
---
&gt;	It's way past the point they should've released launch server lists.
---
...why? We’re still months out.
---
Plate healing gear is mostly for pvp where surviving is more important than just how big your heals are. In a raiding environment you shouldn't be getting hit as a healer so there's not much point to the survivability so bis lists comprise of items that will increase your healing the most.

I hope you asked his permission before posting those photos. Jesus. 🤣

wahhhh, they are toxic, wahhhhh. promotes toxic behavior. wahhhhhhh. toxiccccccc. lol fucking loser.

Dont you dare bring reason and logic into this debate ya jerko!
---
engineering is the best profession period. It's the only prof that actually makes your class better and can't be replaced and keep the benefit from.
---
Tailoring sort of can but only for the Bloodvine set bonus and even that you eventually replace, Engineering can never be replaced.

Prolly 30ish. 30 is where most classes get a sweet quest or some nice abilities or talents. If youre not feeling a class by then you probably wont after that.

Level 5 max stress test? Sounds like a perfect excuse for some lvl 1 nude Running of the Gnomes and Running of the Cows.  If we are doing Vanilla, lets do vanilla right.  Bonus points for a hundred lvl 1 gnomes killing hogger afterwards.
---
There are 3 ranks *Face palm* that actually makes it comparable to Heal. Thanks I will include it and do the maths.
---
yes, i love seeing it in this subreddit though! :)
---
Wait till level 35 and free action potions.
---
Dear lord I hate this so much haha, I remember some dude whispered this to me and I totally panic and typed /afk to the chat I was so confused when I was out of the BG and thought that I typed it to late. This shit happened three times until I realised what is going on
---
I think I saw some post on the sub showing it's not a thing, but I can't search it right now.
---
This dude just wants people to take week 2 off instead of 1 so he can get ahead.
---
Did this guy ever play classic wow. Loved his chat telling him about the teleported after he’s in wetlands.
---
Don't worry, that's just the baby jump.
---
BFD is the one you should be afraid of.
---
Caster &gt; male UD. Meele &gt; female UD. Class not available for UD? &gt; Reroll. It's that easy
---
Yeah, but his point is:  Unless you get 60 that first week, you'll go back to playing normal hours when you go back to work and by the end of week 2 or 3 nolifers will have caught you or passed you already and you still won't be 60.

I’m vanilla i remember always asking LFG VC. On the PS I’ve played on people day DM
---
You guys he literally can't even right now
---
seems fair its too op
---
Its VC! That's what everyone called it back in vanilla times! I never remember seeing DM except on rare occasions!
---
Yeah I might take a day or two off to play like crazy. But I won’t be no lifeing for the majority of the game. I planned on leveling enhance until 40. Then going ele. I’m in no rush this games not going anywhere. I just wana make sure I can do everything I need to. I wana PvE and Resto is the only viable option. Plus PvE dps isn’t any more fun than healing. I want to pvp but I want to dps in PvP. Idc about having top tier gear for every phase. Just want to be able to stay relevant and have fun. Just worried respeccing costs will be a pain. However it doesn’t sound to bad.
---
Fireball hits harder, he frostbolts just go apply the slow after
---
Saw this and thought i was in both beta and stress test, baited like a boss
---
I just want to hurry up and get to level 23 before getting ganked :(
---
Not if people keep bringing it up..
---
Stormrage!
---
Fuck the Alliance! Roll Horde
---
I'll just say this; it's ridiculous that you need active sub for this beta, while it wasn't the case for any of the expansions. You would think that for classic you might one someone without an active sun as well. 
---
I admit I'm butthurt for not having beta invite, but still xD
---
They only made me do wis, might have been because I was undergeared lol
---
Counterspell warrior to get him into combat to block charge. Blink interception then kite him all day with rank 1 frost bolt easy game
---
Iirc it runs at 7.x client, i.e. a legion client
---
Yeah. They really are basicallly the top tier. I just remember Soul Shards being a major annoyance. But I can deal with it.
---
White hits are such a larger portion of your damage in vanilla though.
---
Hi, /u/flappy_lol
---
Engineering is a must for literally everything it is irreplacable. Level an alt for leatherworking, have skinning mining/herbalism on your main and spec one of the 2 to engi later on, 35alt to craft stuff.
---
failing it was so hard too and made you look like a dummy
---
You get quests that specifically tell you to go to Deadmines. In reality people are mostly smart enough to ask "What is DM/VC" sometime before they have to figure out this quest. But if they're learning the game and seeing all these "BFD and RFK and UBRS" eventually they'll learn that those are abbreviations for the name of the instance. So why would the first instance for most people not follow that rule? Why don't we call AA for Archmage Arugal?
---
you’re not alone brother. I’m sure it’ll get me again too
---
Some of these people streaming the beta really grind my gears.   
---
A lot of them dont even give 2 shits about WoW and don't even play MMOs. I get inviting people like Soda and Asmongold/etc but some of these guys..sheesh.
---
Couldn't only like 50 ppl join private channels in vanilla?
---
And if they're Undead wait for them to come back and kill 'em again!
---
There was no DM S as far as I know
---
i got invited to the stress test...
---
Yes, they are general guides applicable to every kind of system you have, directions on graphics may be a bit different from what you have but just search for how to do the same thing they're suggesting on your specific card and you'll be fine.
---
Hi, /u/Calypsosin
---
[ITwoPumpChumpI](https://www.reddit.com/user/ITwoPumpChumpI/), dont you worry! Server will be up rest of the 23rd  :)
---
Last night on Beta I asked for a group for VC in world chat and found an amazing helpful group who cleared the whole thing quickly with no wipes. 
---
If it works, what's the matter?
---
No, your favorite streamer won't hire you to bodyguard him, and noone else needs a 'body guard'.
---
/sigh
---
can't wait to meet you, make sure you go horde
---
Only when Bubble hearth is on CD
---
Yeah, it was and will always be VC.
---
Of course, this convo is mostly moot. Most people LFG for VC will be standing in Westfall. Why would you walk back to SW just to beg for level 18 players to accompany you back to Westfall, where the level 15-20 players already are?
---
Yeah if you're running Stocks for any reason other than raw exp farming then you're going to be unimpressed. Even in retail, it's one of the most efficient dungeons exp-wise.
---
All roguies and all huntards, IK why you rolled those classes, now eat shit.

From mine, sorry for the german one
---
It could be any of Daddar of &lt;Goon Squad&gt; from US Mal’Ganis.
---
Was some of the first level 60 rogue videos i saw.
---
Example: https://youtu.be/g8dwz4Ent2A
---
Alliance on Arthas and the vast majority called it VC. You would see the occasional player calling it DM but it was definitely a low %
---
Ultimately it doesn't matter. Call it what you want. Plenty of context clues to figure it out. If you are dealing with people who are not smart enough to figure it out you don't want to run VC with them anyway
---
Lolll that is ez pz to pull off on nost i was doing 1v4 all Time
---
yeah! [twitch.tv/stealinbread](https://twitch.tv/stealinbread)

I'll be doing speedruns and such until Classic launches, and I also got into the stress test so I'm streaming that tonight

This is wrong. So many people are wrong.

Absolutely.  No risk no reward.

Its still a thing even on retail right?

this guy is a retail multi rank 1 player, "wow that interrupt on holy light"... good 1v2 tho
---
emp run usually implies the quickest route possible to emp. so lava run usually
---
I want to say maybe if you remove it from your account management page after uninstall it might work. That said, I have 3 accounts, 1 ptr, and still have the classic demo installed (I'm never letting go!) and mine showed up, though it was 2 hours later.
---
The amount of people this appeals to will not be able to support the server. Streamers are making it work atm because they have no choice, but if given the choice most people will stick to the full experience.
---
lmao seen this happen so much, that and alt f4.  good times.
---
At first, I was the same, wishing  people would stfu about it. It's not a good solution though. All it does is introduce a potentially exploitable mechanic that does not solve the issues that initially prompted them to use phasing. The Layer limits are about 3000 people, which is about the same as Vanilla sever limits. This will do nothing to alleviate the mass amounts of people in the starting zones, which was their entire premise for using phasing in the first place.
---
Say what
---
really like the Hobbit-y vibe of this, like all the fantasy maps in ASOIAF are just lines and arrows and really scream 'the author wrote this.' The little illustrated features of these old school tolkien-inspired maps add so much.
---
For Alliance players the quest line that brings you into Deadmines for the first time is to get Edwin VanCleef's head, the first group I joined for Deadmines was in /s at the base of the tower after getting the quest from Gryan, where someone asked "Anyone else need VanCleef?".    
---
             
---
I have no idea why any Horde would call it VC though, totally makes sense to say DM for them.
---
are the greens above level 5?
---
Mage. No need to respec. Is the scariest PvP class IMO. Easy gold. Asked for specifically for runs. Rogue is obviously great 1v1 but different PvP and PvE specs and groups are always full on rogues. Water, food, portals to boot

&gt;without more context
---
and
---
&gt;standing in Westfall
---
If you know you're standing in Westfall, that's additional context.
---
Plus, while it may be extremely rare, it's not impossible for people to be looking for a Dire Maul group while in Westfall. Or what if you're on your level 60 in Westfall and someone you don't recognize asks in guild chat if anyone wants to run "DM"... You're still confident that's not ever ambiguous? (Only half joking.)
---
We called it VC because originally we got a quest to kill VC, didn't know it was in a dungeon and went off to form a group for VC like you would lfg for Hogger. That's how it was called VC on my server at least.
---
This whole debacle reminds of the DD vs DPS debate, it’s basically a hot pile of bullshit.
---
I got stress test invite only and I'm in the UK. Luckily I don't have to be up early tomorrow, woo. I expect I'll spend most of my time waiting in a queue or being disconnected though since it *is* a stress test. 
---
Still, levelling to 5 will take the better part of an hour and by then I'll be ready for bed, haha.
---
Gets punished for putting the time in. :/
---
Go with your first and last choice. :)
---
I want to go shadow priest so bad. I know they’re not great for raiding but I probably won’t be doing much of that anyways. They’re good in PvP which I see myself doing more of but I also don’t want to hinder myself getting into PUG raids every once in a while
---
&gt; Since the same client is used for both our stress test users and our normal beta users, the name in the Battle.net App has changed to “Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic .
---
Played all expansions as well. First time I quitted was Cataclysm, I only played Pandaria in the last 6 months of it's life.
---
Legion was the first time the game felt fun again, for what it was in that state. BFA I just leveled because I wanted to do one character to 120 for one last time.
---
Then I quitted again. The game just isnt what I fell in love with.
---
After playing the BlizzCon demo I knew it wasnt nostalgia, I had fun again in the version of the game that made me fell in love, a MMO and a RPG.
---
Classic is me coming back again.
---
Seeing mage videos is really pushing me toward the class. I was initially planning to play Shadow Priest, but outside of PvP as far as I know, groups are likely not going to take a Shadow Priest (feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, I started in TBC so I never actually experienced Vanilla). Mage just seems like a much safer option.
---
I call it VC but I'd take you anyways
---
iolwtf and Wedding have been playing vanilla pservers for like nearly a decade compared to Venruki's 3-4 days lul
---
Lol spinning a flag as a druid is the most hilarious fucking thing. Travel forming in and out of max range causes so much rage.
---
Alright. I Shall delete this.
---
Glad I could help! It is so rare that I ever have anything useful to say. =P
---
Read what
---
I feel ya, yeah same. I would love it.
---
Only place I can think of is the place associated with the Warlock mount quest.
---
Regarding the shadow priest I’ve heard the same. For me the other option was rogue. I’m a sucker for world pvp but will have a focus on pve.
---
I dont think it's possible to reach the skill level of this warrior in this clip.
---
Ya, it genuinely shows who did and didn't actually play back in Vanilla.
---
I played on Bleeding Hollow and Firetree at launch. On both servers it was *always* VC = Deadmines, DM = Diremaul. From Day 1 that's just what it was. VC happened before DM was even about.
---
I’ve never heard of Venruki tbh only started hearing about him 2 days ago on this sub.
---
Even when there was no Dire Maul, I always called it Van Cleef.  Because that's just what everyone looked for the group for.
---
Lmao exactly!
---
Yeah not taking anything away from that. Good 1v2. But expecting people to miss the only cast possible..
---
Tbf I think it takes longer to get from the alliance starting zones to org, than it takes to get the quest for orc/trolls to go to org
---
Thank you sir!
---
Ya lots of people that will play this will be playing for the endgame and holding them back would just kill the game at this point.
---
&gt; leather twinks
---
Does anyone know what the least played class(es) might have been, previously?
---
Since I have not accounted for so many thing, I am removing this and I will re-submit after I fix some things.
---
I'd say pretty ping intensive as restro druid apply hot fixes depending on the situation and you need to be flexible. A well timed battle rez can literally save the group, what sucks is if you are not the best geared druid in the group your HoT's get over ridden and they do not stack. I LOVE the druid class but it really doesn't shine til BC, end game raiding as drood is cool because there really aren't too many of you and if your gear drops you pretty much get it. But the downside is you're never going to be top heals or even close to top heals and HAVE to use your innervate on main healer.

Official Brady Strategy guide for World of Warcraft published in November of 2004.
---
&gt; VC Van Cleef - Boss of Deadmines instance in Westfall. Sometimes used interchangeably with "Deadmines." (ie. LFG VC is the same as LFG Deadmines.)
---
There is no entry at all for DM not for Dire Mail nor for it meaning Deadmines.
---
I'm throwing a LAN party on launch and I think you just listed out my menu...fucking brilliant.
---
Dragonblight EU, Hellscream EU and Kazzak EU all called it DM. It was even DM on EU side when cross realm came out, wasn't until cross region came out that i started to see VC predominantly from GER realms and then once i moved onto private server it was ALWAYS VC.
---
Honestly think this is an NA vs EU thing as i've said a few times now when this has come up, rather than a "for sure everyone who says DM didn't play vanilla" like people seem to think.
---
Yup. Used to be DMW, DME... or you know just check player level
---
Spoilers: Jessica
---
Caaaarrrrrrllllllllll
---
All the hate... i live for it.  Save your rage though.
---
Suramar was mostly VC too. I hated it, but that's how everyone else would LFG so I had to adapt.
---
But his name is Edwin.
---
not even stresstest. My freetime just feels like an empty void
---
Stress test servers will be up 26 hours. The test itself will last 2 hours which will be in the morning for EU. So you can go to work and play up to level 5 after work.
---
People tend to forget CS is off gcd and that it is so easy to use against a bad caster. 
---
But if the paladin was good and aware of the level of the mage he would have fakecasted it.
---
I got a used one about 2 months back on amazon.co.uk. cost me about 3 euro. The thing is in perfect condition
---
Hmm my accounts from 05 but I’m really hoping I do get a invite in the next wave.
---
He meant in DPS only, but with warriors they are by far the best in pvp with a pocket healer. They are just super easy to kite/CC in 1v1.
---
fuck blizzard
---
Go Engineering, or herbs/alchemy
---
For some reason I thought logs would take this into account for calcs and individually calc each mage's contribution to the ignite but that would probably be rough so that makes sense. Appreciate the info
---
That's where you kill your own faction.
---
It's purely unique to the position the deadmines dungeon is for alliance and when you come across it. 
---
My first time questing in Westfall late 2004, as someone who had never played an MMO before, I had no concept of what an instanced dungeon was so it was referred to by the quest. I'd guess this was the case for a lot of players at the time, and on some of the earlier servers it just stuck. 
---
Using the argument "none of the other dungeons are abbreviated that way, so why is this one" implies that all these noobs like me a couple months into their first MMO somehow were already aware of some established naming convention. 
---
Point being, it makes sense why people called it that.
---
"I don't get it, is Metroid's gun his hand?"

&gt; Install now and get ready to rush our test realm as soon as it opens at 4:00pm PDT Wednesday, May 22, until 6:00pm PDT . Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when World of Warcraft Classic launches August 27, 2019.
---
&gt; The World of Warcraft Classic Closed Beta realms will be down for the duration of the test. Once the stress test period is over, you’ll be able to continue playing on the stress test realm (up to level 5) until Thursday, May 23.
---
This is what my email says, so I've got no clue what you're talking about. Not to mention the Blue post from yesterday was pretty clear about it lasting from ~4pm PDT today until ~6pm PDT Thursday.
---
DM:T too
---
Sounds like you go shammy honestly. They have all the play styles besides the role of tank. You can get know for your heals and helping.
---
Shamans are always ele/resto spec in premades, pretty useful but mana issues.
---
Shaman is a high skill cap class, depending on how good you are and how good your enemies are premade meta turns into ridiculous autism.
---
Top tier shamans memorized the placements of their totems and move their character model so they spawn important totems, grounding tremor in particular, inside another totem so you cannot easily rightclick it.
---
Fun class, enhancement is nonexistent and no one will invite you as one (or give you gear for that matter).
---
It’s all just sniping though. The hps and hpm of druids is good. It’s just hard to land 2, 2.5, and 3 second casts when everybody is mana-dumping into flash heals. 
---
If you compare druids to paladins on saphiron (or “progression” kill of some other healing-intensive boss like ragnaros, or viscidous without the AOE strat, magmadar, etc) druids crush paladins, and priests only beat them from having 8/8 t2.
---
No beta or stress test. I have an active subscription as well. Confirmed really mad and salty.
---
Yeah can heal 60 5s as shadow but you’ll drink a lot. Not a big deal
---
LOL.
---
Ignorance must be bliss, friend.
---
&gt;Source in your reply or blocked. Full stop.
---
&gt;You made the claim.
---
Exactly what a moron would say. You can't even read.
---
Let me break this down in a way someone like you can understand. The burden of proof is and always will be on the party trying to prove existence. You do not need to prove something does not exist. Until there is hard evidence that there *is* a correlation then there is *no* correlation. 
---
There is absolutely no evidence of a correlation of spending money on a battle.net account and receiving a beta invite. Claiming otherwise with no evidence other than your feelings about "parent companies" is hilariously pathetic, asinine, and moronic. 
---
My only regret is I won't get to see the hissy fit you throw after this one. 
---
Life must be difficult for you.
---
Basically we do it because VC was likely one of the first dungeons people advertised for, someone probably based it on the quest objective (collect the head of Van Cleef), and then that just became the social norm on many servers. It's hard to change after that. 
---
Something to keep in mind is that instanced dungeons were a novel concept for people. So even veteran MMO players in the original beta would likely think of this as a group quest to kill a specific enemy, before they thought of it as "doing a dungeon." Enemies like this in, say Everquest, would have been in the open world. Even if that enemy is in a specific place in the open world, you wouldn't advertise as "LFM Cursed Woods." 
---
WoW eventually needed people to follow a different line of thinking with the new dungeon design, but I'm just speculating that "VC" came up because that transition had not happened right away.
---
Would be interesting to see if there's a difference between horde / alliance players. I always played horde and never heard anyone say VC until I made an alliance character.
---
Yeah, sounds good on paper, not gonna work in the real world because baby is in your lap and your trying to get them to sleep and operate a mouse and kb at the same time.
---
One guide I read said Hunters in DM would be the #1 way to get gold, like suggested to roll a hunter/mage then whatever else you want.
---
Apparently they're looking into it going by the response posted on forums.
---
see u on classic nerd ill be calling it VC even at 60
---
DME DMW DMN/tribute = Dire Maul
---
It was that easy. VC I've only found it on PS and it was confusing the hell out of me.
---
As an addendum to my earlier points, it let's the dps know to not freak out-especially when that bubble appears when the mob is in mid stride towards them. It let's them know that the healer is on top of the situation and that they have heals coming if that mob brings them down to 50%. If the dps aren't freaking out then the tank won't have to chase the stray mob all over the room and can focus on his job easier. This is all speculation of course, but I like to think I help maintain calm and order in pug 5 mans.
---
Druid is a solid pick based on your situation. Tank 5s to gear up and do some PvP to rank 8
---
You do understand that Venruki is a blizzcon champion? He’s not just some random streamer/shoutcaster. At one point he was quite literally the best mage in the world. Sure it wasn’t during vanilla, but it was at a time when classes were much more difficult to master than vanilla...
---
Thanks.
---
I could probably play one of those...; I'll have to research the classes more and see what suits my style most.
---
Or your spot should just be “reserved” on that layer for x time. That way you can’t just relog to switch layers.
---
Or how about a single hammer of justice?
---
To a certain extent.  You don't really see the old school 19, 29, 39, 49, brackets like you used to.  Now it's mostly 111 twinks to powerlevel people through dungeons due to the crazy gear scaling.
---
I used to twink back in the day, and when blizz introduced stopping xp, everyone thought it was the best thing ever, until we all realized that even on our battlegroup (rudimentary cross realm bgs) there just wasn't a large enough community to have any sort of good queue times, as you could only bg with people that had xp turned off like you.  I'm sure there are pocket communities out there, but it's not nearly as big as it used to be.
---
I'm actually going to level as balance druid. I know it's way worse, but with spell gear I can actually join lowbie dungeons to heal even though I'm not resto - and I just like the estethic of Moonkin form. 
---
My only goal in classic is to get the full Dreadmist set. I'm confident that I'm going to be the only Tauren Druid wearing it on the server! Whenever I leave moonkin form, heads will turn :)
---
Also...
---
ill be preparing a Hot Pocket, which is cooked in a dirty microwave, with a side of pepto.
---
IF YOU SAY “LFG VC” IM. NOT. TANKING. FOR. YOU. 😤
---
It's the entire world outside of Dire Maul
---
Your cringing made me cringe
---
We called it VC on shadowsong and black dragonflight. I hadn't thought about that this could vary based on server!!! It makes sense though because so many people are completely insistent on that it was VC or DM.
---
He ice blocked warrior intercept after the pally dies
---
Awesome!! I’ll message you when we make the discord server
---
Damn that’s a real shame, it was still alive when I left retail
---
Didn't mages have the nonsense bug of only 1 mage being able to roll ignite? that breaks any actual comparison. I'd guess that top entry raid is heavily stacked with mages
---
Still just to level 5 tho right?

Why is journeyman a rank before apprentice? Shouldn't it be the other way around?
---
Maybe merge?
---
You say this like you’re not awful at the game
---
Same case on Frostmane.
---
So it turns out if you hit the upvote multiple times it just toggles the vote on or off :(

It's a great idea but I think 30 or 40 is too low. How about 60 instead as a compromise?

What weird part of the internet uses DD?

38 I believe.
---
The Defias Pillagers are not relevant at that point anyway.
---
So you call it VC I'm guessing?
---
I once convinced a guild app in early WoW that alt+f4 did opened a quest helper tool.  He came back, said it just made him crash to desktop.  I said "Oh, that's a known bug, it happens once in a while, just try it again." Then he immediately did it again.  When he got back in game ,he /gquit.
---
We were a serious raiding guild I did us a service.
---
You mean running away from the mage just to turn around and run back wasn't optimal? These guys both looked like they didn't really want to pvp and hoped they could just run away.
---
Thanks for letting me know Kairain, I’ll look into it, it’s normally not a problem but volume discrepancy is something I try to keep an eye on. Cheers.
---
As a vanilla player it was always known as VC on my server. DM was always Dire Maul once that was released.
---
Also, dont worry, you'll get some time to play but you will most likely be soloing it for that first couple years. However, I find wow is perfect for dealing with the baby as you can pretty much drop it immediately and attend to them  when they wake. 
---
Its getting the energy to play thats really hard. I mean, really you only get a few minutes of free time to yourself, you are probably not going to login and play over trying to eat a real meal or zone out looking at the wallpaper.

It is both. It helps alleviate starting zones and helps with long term pop. While it doesn’t completely alleviate the starter zones. 3k people in 6 zones is vastly different than 5-7k, or 10k+ in the starter zones.
---
I’ve been around server launches during retail vanilla and while it was “bad”. Pserver launches are a whole different level comparatively.
---
I mained mage in vanilla.  Fire was a lot of fun levelling.  Frostbolt spamming in MC got pretty stale - though we got to manage sheeps throughout the majordomo? fight, and I think on the third boss or so we got to remove curses...  Easy class to level as with the unlimited free food/water and good ability to control your enemies.
---
Rogue I played a bit as well.  Cooldowns were longer than they are now, and you had to gouge first in order to backstab (I wouldn't bet on frontstabbing being a thing in Classic, but I don't know for sure).  But still, best utility and very popular for stealth.  Rogue is one of the slowest classes to level (not as slow as warr probably), but fun.
---
It was VC on gul'dan
---
Some zones will be darker than they are in BfA. Some zones will actually be brighter than they are in BfA because some Classic zones on BfA are darker than they were in Vanilla.
---
But what if you are trying to find a Dire Maul group in Westfall?
---
It being the first dungeon most people do makes it even worse to call it VC imo. I imagine a conversation going:
---
"What is VC?"
---
"It's an instanced dungeon that requires a group of 5 to complete because of the challenges within."
---
"Ah I see, so why is it called VC?"
---
"VC means VanCleef, who is the final boss of this particular instance"
---
"Ah I think I understand, so there are a bunch of dungeons in this game and to distinguish them from one another we use an abbreviation of the final bosses name?"
---
"No that's not right"
---
"What?"
---
"This is the only dungeon that follows that rule, all the other ones are abbreviated based on the name of the dungeon."
---
"So why isn't it just called DM for Deadmines?"
---
and than the classic argument starts
---
God the old BElf/HElf models were hideous.
---
Faster application of the slow
---
Want to play a healer in dungeons and raids but stillt ne able to farm and quest on my own. Was thinking about druid but the missing rezz is keeping me away from it.
---
And suggestions?
---
&gt; This is wrong, it was never about alleviating starting zones. If it was about that they wouldve gone with start zones sharding.
---
This is exactly what they said they were going to do before they announced layering and exactly for that reason.

&gt;We’re still looking at how we can best deliver an authentic Classic experience at launch, and in the weeks and months that follow - both in terms of gameplay and community. You won’t see phasing (which is tied to specific quests that don't exist in Classic) or cross-realm zones (which combine multiple realms together) in Classic. **However, realm sharding is one of the best tools we have to keep realms stable when hundreds of players are swarming the same initial few zones and killing the same few mobs (like they will be at the launch of Classic). To that end, we do believe that some form of sharding may be helpful, especially in those early days.** But we recognize that a cohesive world is critical to WoW Classic and are committed to bringing that to you.
---
&gt; Its all about a healthy server population after all the 'tourists' leave.
---
Layering in no way affects final server populations...
---
You can get argent dawn rep in the Plaguelands and in the dungeons associated with them. If you get exalted with AD you Naxx attunment is free.
---
Only one quest actually calls it The Deadmines from what I can see and that's "Underground Assault", which is gotten from a different zone and a new player wouldn't be likely to be doing that quest before Defias Brotherhood. Meanwhile "Red Silk Bandanas" refers to it as "VanCleef's secret hideout" and is a quest that would usually be done around the same time as Defias Brotherhood since they're from the same area.
---
That's what happens when you stop making any individualized items and everything just becomes a small item level increase. 
---
Hell, they don't even make individual armor sets for classes anymore. It's just a bland armor set for each armor type in each tier. It's ironic to me that people praise the retail art team so much when they've completely dropped the ball on arguably the most important part of art in the entire game: the armor sets. There have been less than 5 decent armor sets since Mists of Pandaria. About 5 years with terrible armor designs but nobody really seems to care cause they have transmog to fix the problem.
---
God bless Classic and it's simple yet great looking armor sets.
---
It'll be funny to see how quick some of you will get over this when you see "LF 1 DPS for VC and g2g"

I remember CoC being a not always hit anything spell.

1) This Blue gets it.
---
2) Dire Maul always had a direction.
---
&gt; How can you positively say something never happened on any server? Did you play on every single one?
---
Because people's memories get jumbled and they misplace and mis-remember things from many years ago very easily. The logic is very simple as to where referring to it as VC came from.
---
WoW was released. All instances were referred to as an abbreviation of their name. Dire Maul was released. Some hopelessly confused individuals noticed two instances would be abbreviated the same way so they started calling one VC.
---
It was never called VC before Dire Maul was released.
---
Interesting!  Is keeping the pet happy a pain in the ass or not really?

The point isn't about you being allowed to spend your money how you please, it's about how your actions plague the game and affect other players negatively. The point is you are so selfish that you can't even see that you are the reason people get spam whispered all day and they there are zero gathering nodes for real players. You are the reason the economy gets fucked and inflation happens so quickly.
---
Teach meeeeeeeeieieieie master :p
---
&gt;Why would you go to a dungeon without the intention of doing a full clear?  
---
Because some can take many many many hours. Some bosses had garbage drops.
---
I agree with everything you said but I would like to add some negatives that apply to BC and all later expansions.
---
BC essentially made a huge chunk of past content obsolete in an instant, there was no point in visiting old raids or many max level dungeons because they would get instantly replaced while leveling in Outlands.
---
Blizzard essentially abandoned one of the games strongest appeals at the time and still to this day. The world felt huge due to lack of loading screens and everything on the continent being connected. This of course would have been just about impossible to do with outland being in space and all. I think WoWs first expansion should have focused on fleshing out Azeroth more...there were lots of areas at the time that remained not accessible. And the fact that there was a loading screen between the plaguelands and the ghost lands was disappointing.
---
Probably just from the extra PTR alone. I have one email with the max accounts on it and a PTR account, beta still showed up.
---
Like I said, there are probably still active communities out there, but with how gear scaling works while leveling, and heirlooms, etc...  I'm just don't know if I'm that into it anymore.
---
I'll deff be looking to twink again in classic!
---
Man, if I could convince my wife that this is actually a good thing for the baby I would...but I have a feeling even suggesting this would be a bad decision for me.
---
Thanks very much. Mic is the same but on one call the gain was accidentally changed, I’ll look into any different sounds in this one and try and figure out what happened. Thanks for listening :)
---
I will if I don't get an invite. Not an '04 or '05 player but I did start in '06 a few months before BC launched, so I guess technically I can count myself as a vanilla player? Close enough at least, haha.
---
No suspensions or bans ever, not even a chat mute. Fingers crossed!
---
I can agree wholeheartedly with this
---
wanna be beta cucks the pair of you
---
Yes. I am certain that at no point in my life, the past, present, or future, will I ever be confused by anyone, in any context, who correctly refers to Deadmines as DM.
---
Im in, dont forget your big iron fishing pole!
---
This. I proposed a theory, which is just that, a theory.  
---
u/mikally you're claiming fact without proof, lol.  
---
fUlL sT0p.
---
Thanks I hate it... r/TIHI
---
They don't, it's just funny to think what a twinked out level 5 would even be
---
Its little known, but you dont have to take those jumps at all. If you go left instead of across the platforms, you can just scale the hill and jump over the top.
---
You’re welcome
---
The resemblance is uncanny.
---
Same experience for me. 
---
I had no idea what I was doing when I started this game. I got a quest to kill Van Cleef. Maybe it explained that it was in a dungeon called The Deadmines, idk, I can't remember, but I certainly missed that. (based on this feedback so did a lot of other people)
---
By the time I had received this quest I had made an in game friend so I asked him for help. He explained that it was in a dungeon (My response was "what is that" and he said "It's like a quest, but longer and you can't leave until it is done"
---
He then invited me to a group and posted LF3M VC in Westfall general chat. So I learned that this was a dungeon called VC based on that interaction.
---
Worth noting that I played on Arthas Alliance and I didn't start at release, it was sometime in 2005 so maybe dire maul had already released at that point?
---
sorry but its been VC since dire maul released
---
That proves that it wasn't VC from the beginning then. People were referring to a single boss/quest, not the instance itself. The instance itself was and always has been DM.
---
Good news for you CM just posted they will reflag everyone soon with the 2 ptrs and those that removed the extra one today!
---
Thanks! Are there any strange mage nuances I should be aware of beforehand? I.e. rogue with combo points not transferring, warrior is very gear dependant, etc.
---
Same on Thunderlord-US.
---
iot was the first intercept or charge that he iceblocked as well. Watched it now on the computer and honestly i dont see anything there blocking hoj though
---
People gettin fired up like it's worth an argument, and here I am still saying VC cause it gets me sweatier than STV.
---
He's won [Blizzcon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tS6oojD8Km4), which is like the Super Bowl of WoW tourneys.
---
I will never type VC in game
---
I got the mail 8 hrs later... And the launcher says beta&amp;stresstest.
---
Yes but it only makes sense to get a penalty while you're using two weapons, otherwise it would be completely OP (which is why fury scales insanely well at 60 with hit gear). Even taking the penalty into account, the damage output is perfectly viable for leveling.
---
This may sound dumb but deadmines is the main reason I'm thinking of rolling alliance. That place is just too nostalgic for me. Everything else is meh
---
&gt; How does that even start? What other dungeon in the game do you abbreviate as a bosses name?
---
The very first dungeon a player new to MMOs experiences and is called "VC." It's the fahrenheit of dungeon names, this is true, but that's what we grew up with and at this point some of us are sticking to it out of spite.
---
when 1 mage is doing really high damage, no other mage is they are extremely overrated as end game dpsers
---
Not spinning - that still works fine.  The button click stops working (I use 3d modelling software that requires an exessive number of middle clicks).
---
Shake your head a bit.
---
If you aren't raiding Druid blows Warrior out of the water. They have WAY more threat generation. In PvP you won't really be a dedicated healer. A PvP druid is typically some form of hybrid spec that takes from all 3 trees (theres like 7 depending on what kind of PvP you want to focus on), and in playstyle PvP druid doesn't fit into a clean role; it constantly jumps around and does a bit of everything.
---
What’s your meaningful contribution to anything on this planet?
---
Yeah, dude only got some multiglads and won blizzcon.
---
Not really a skilfull guy.
---
Not necessarily, for most of us it's the stress test only. If you log into the client and only see the stress test server this'll confirm it.
---
We'll probably be in future beta invite waves though.
---
I will be ignoring anyone I see in chat saying VC :P
---
level 60s looking to get some sweet Dire Maul loot.
---
So seeing all the comments I've come to the conclusion that horde players called it DM. Not all but a lot of alliance players called it VC (myself included) The reason for that might have to do with the quest you get to actually kill Van Cleef. As someone stated in an earlier reply, the instanced dungeon system was kinda a new thing in those days so for alliance players getting a quest to kill Van Cleef they would probably use LFG to kill Van Cleef which probably changed to LFG to kill VC and then to LFG VC as the server progressed. At least that's what I would imagine. I joined around ZG patch and it was already called VC on my server alliance side. Not sure about the horde but they have no reason to call it VC. In the end, who cares, you know what it means and so does everyone else. Get along.
---
Only priest I'd watch is Yolam.
---
While the horde gets level 5 and builds raids to storm Elwynn!
---
Status update, I think I have her agreeing to try a mage! I would love a pocket healer but I want her to enjoy wicked dps and it fits her style.
---
or just tribute
---
so even if i go to Gurubashi 5 hours after launch i'm gonna get ganked by a level 30? ruins all my fun!
---
Same problem here. Submitted a ticket to have my 2 ptr accounts removed. They're labeled for legion anyway since I don't have bfa.
---
Trick question, no one wants to run Gnomergan.
---
me and my buddy both got in. I attributed it to us having accounts from 2004
---
On a few servers full of weirdos, sure. I can agree some confused folks called it VC *after* Dire Maul was released. But it shows how hopelessly confused some people are that they think it was referred to as VC *before* Dire Maul was released.
---
&gt; broccoli is healthy, tasty, and easy
---
I eat it because it's green and I need it in my diet but that shit is disgusting and smells like farts.
---
Its widower. Male version of widow.
---
Mages can iceblock twice?
---
But that's *why* VC happened. That's the point.
---
Back in 2004/2005, most people playing WoW had never played an MMO before. They'd never done a dungeon before. They got a quest to go kill this VanCleef guy that mentioned nothing about The Deadmines. So they'd head to world chat with, "LFG VC". Over time, and with enough people doing this, the dungeon itself simply became associated with VC. Then, when Dire Maul was added, it stuck because two DMs was confusing.
---
It's just an interesting look at people and how different games were back then.
---
I'm now thinking it may be necessary to make a guild based solely on this fact
---
Yes. Practice dueling a lot. You have to be quick as a glass cannon. But be patient with yourself. You’re ALWAYS going to think “damn I should have _____”. That’s ok! Enjoy the ride and keep dueling.
---
&gt;men
---
Thank you! GL to you too! :D
---
Should have\*
---
VC was easily identifiable as a noob because you didn't have any idea the deadmines existed as an instance until you got that quest, speaking from my experience back then. 
---
Sure, the argument is for what it should be called now, but my defense comes from people personally telling me I am wrong that it was never called that back then. I'm just trying to shed light on why it was done that way, since there seems to be a lot of perception around here that there's no way it could have ever been done that way.
---
How about DM:VC to make everyone happy?
---
Retail player?
---
how does cone of cold work in classic?
---
watched on phone does jjst faceing the target pressing cone and turning away = hit , or does it just have a much larger aoe than is displayed a couple of the comes dont appear to hit them
---
Me too, someone made a post that you can level fishing to 75 at level 5 so that's gonna be my plan when I can eventually login
---
Horde player here. Horde members like to act that alliance is the easy way out... tbh, we’re just frightened by the Defias mages.
---
tribute was just used to refer to doing diremaul north a certain way , by not killing certain named in there you get more loot out of the tribute chest at the end.
---

I haven’t said that he ain’t skilled just never heard of him 😂. But on the other hand, more than the occasional wow pvp video on YouTube and the lurking here on reddit I’m totally disconnected about wow. Haven’t cared about the game since vanilla. But I’ll check this video out once I get back from work.
---
I am still on the same account I had day one and if I remember correctly I used it to also participate in the vanilla closed beta. I’ve also been subbed for all of BfA and off and on for every expansion. No beta. However my 2 friends that bought WoW Vanilla CE on day one both got in...
---
I wish you the best throughout your leveling and Classic WoW experience! :D GL!
---
Increasing damage values would not damage damage the authentic vanilla experience. 
---
"ABSOLUTELY NO CHANGE* fags are so annoying.
---
I didn’t even know addons were a thing until right before TBC when I saw a friend playing with quest helper, and thought he was going to get his account band for cheating. 
---
A day later I was leveling an alt with it
---
Forget it m8, 99% of this sub are trash, they will never understand.
---
Not during raids. Hunters have to actually time their shots with an auto shot timer and it can dynamically change based on buffs etc (rapid fire etc).   Pet management also comes into play a bit (moving it out of danger etc.) 
---
Warlock is literally just spam shadowbolt. 
---
Leveling up on the other hand...def lock is more involved for sure.
---
Ya I think people aren't differentiating between people referring specifically to one boss/the quest and the instance itself. I'm sure in reference to the quest some said VC, but if it was just a normal DM run I don't think it was VC.
---
Have you ever noticed that the “DM” community get super angry and aggressive about it and the “VC” community literally couldn’t give a fuck?
---
Right? Everyone is acting like they're too good for it.
---
I will take my tiny drop of nectar, thaaaaaaaankYOU.
---
Plus, I signed up for the Beta. Blizzard expects that means I actually want to test for them. I do. So I'm stoked to be part of the stress test.
---
every other dungeon is an abbreviation of the name of the dungeon, and only specific boss runs are named (eg emperor) so it's DM as far as i'm concerned
---
Greetings from Germany @all!
---
Common practice was to ask in different places if you already had a person or two in your group, especially if you had a hard time finding a healer or tank.
---
Going to be much much lower dps.
---
1, 5, 10, 15, ..., 50 (max)    
---
decay is 5g/month, minimum of 10g
---
It caps at 50g and goes down like 5g every month down to a minimum
---
I can provide proof but until then give me my worthless internet points.
---
Me too :)
---
sure
---
Ah, I love duels! My best memories are from outside orgrimmar. Thanks for the help
---
Same here ;)
---
Not going to farm 1000g for epic mount :D
---
Kill it? No
---
Fuck it up? Yes
---
I'm trying to convince the Mrs to play as well, actually. I'm not hopeful, but it's worth a shot.
---
I was on Kalecgos as well. I remember Jastaris, night elf rogue I think. I was in Devious Empire raiding MC back then. I believe Audacious was a horde guild? Validus was the premier alliance guild back then.
---
Im gonna go out and say they are probably just fine.
---
Warlock t3 legs have 116 armor. Tier 3 epic cloth 116 armor.
---
Green iron leggings level 26 required crafted mail boe have 176 armor.
---
So a warlock in t3 is probably gonna have less armor than a lvl 30 warrior in decent gear.
---
Well I was subbed all through vanilla but canceled it a month or two after tbc came out. Since then Ive only subbed for a month like every other expansion release to try it out. I got into the beta so I dunno that total money spent is really a factor.
---
&gt; Then, when Dire Maul was added, it stuck because two DMs was confusing.
---
This is why I'm not convinced by any of this, because the main claim to fame for this argument is that it's somehow confusing that there's two DMs. No one who's mentally capable of turning on a computer, figuring out how to create a WoW account, and leveling up, is also so mentally deficient that they would ever get legitimately confused by this.
---
Really depends on how you handle it I guess. Just dont neglect the fam and you're good. Make sure to take time to step away from the keyboard for them. It's an act of willpower for sure.
---
not having a res is a real bummer, but as far as questing/farming on your own, you're guuchi baby.
---
not to mention that while leveling you can go a really nasty feral/reto hybrid build that (when played right) is an absolute monster in open world pvp.
---
That's simply not how the internet people work.
---
&gt;It helps alleviate starting zones
---
No, it doesn't. The Layer limit is roughly the same as initial Vanilla wow Servers. It will be exactly like a Vanilla server on the day it opened. 
---
&gt; 3k people in 6 zones is vastly different than 5-7k, or 10k+ in the 6 starter zones. 
---
And those numbers never happened, therefore they are irrelevant. The only way that would matter is if they were going to make servers with limits that high, which is not the case from every indication. They are going to be using similar realm pop limits that they used in Vanilla.
---
&gt; I’ve been around server launches during retail vanilla and while it was “bad”. Pserver launches are a whole different level comparatively. 
---
With layer, it will be exactly like those launches, unless you are on the 'last' shard created, which would be the least populated one generally. Obviously the last one doesn't \*have\* to be the least populated depending on people logging out after the fact and whatnot.
---
My wife just got her access and I didn't... RIP
---
I understand why some people call it VC, but that doesn't mean they aren't wrong. The horde have a hard to miss quest line to go into RFC and kill Jergosh the Enforcer but no one calls it JE. If every other dungeon and raid in the entire game is called by the abbreviation of it's name than it doesn't make sense that this one should break that rule because some people saying the wrong thing. And I call it the wrong thing because if I said "LFG JE" I would be wrong
---
For couscous if anyone finds it boring you can use chicken stock instead of water and it is much better imo. Thought I hated couscous but that made a huge difference
---
Yep, I'm a much newer player than a lot of people in this sub but I'm still very excited for classic. 
---
I played like 2 weeks of Draenor and hated it and quit. Then played pretty much all of Legion and enjoyed it. Then played maybe 2 weeks of BFA and just stopped playing. Didn't hate it, but it didn't hold my attention. My friends and coworkers all played around Vanilla/TBC and they're getting me super hyped for it.
---
Exactly. 3 steps. 
---
However the classic beta is not in the drop down on the battle.net launcher.
---
Innos zum Gruße, Fremder!
---
Do you know who venruki is?
---
Dire maul has 3 different instances so just saying DM is stupid to do. DM = dead mines.  
---
Dire maul would be DM east or DM-e DM north DM-n or DM west or DM-w.
---
Also if you are running DM north and doing a tribute run you can just say tribute run.
---
If you just said DM intending to run diremaul there would be several follow up questions needed for each interested member.
---
Valve has stopped selling the hardware boxes for that. It's just a streaming software now.
---
i should start from WOW classic or try some older versions 
---
ATM WOW classic will be the oldest version of WOW
---
So it's the perfect begining !
---
Good memories this. I skimmed a bit but didn't see any names of what the other dungeons was used to be called. I think we did call them east and west just, on my server at least.
---
A paladin is better than both.
---
I'm 99% sure it's an NA thing I never even heard it being called VC until I started playing private servers. It was 100% DM on my vanilla server
---
1 am CET is morning?
---
For those at work.
---
“Hey all,
---
I’m still catching up on things, but it looks like a portion of folks who were invited into the Stress test were unable to get properly flagged because of multiple PTR licenses on their account.
---
We’re working with our Battle.net 1 team and they will be going through the list of recent invitees and remove the extra PTR account so they can reflag for Stress test participation. I don’t have an ETA but we hope to have this completed soon.”
---
really the decay was monthly... holy hell i guess i never did respec back in the day

meal prepping and planning is gonna be key for us. i spend a few hours every sunday doing meal prep for my breakfasts and lunches anyway so i'm just gonna do extra prep for dinner meals too. i've compiled a big list of easy meals and instapot recipes so we can have somewhat balanced meals with minimal effort.

also mtn dew lol

its been said to death that pservers were different

Hi, /u/oneheadedboy_
---
Inb4 he goes home and his computer is in the dumpster out back.
---
LMAO! Well if you don't like broccoli there are other green veggies you can eat. :) Beans and peas come to mind. You can even just have a small side salad with some nice dark green leafy greens. Some people like cooking their dark, leafy greens and that can be really tasty with the right flavors (kale, spinach) but I haven't played with that much so I don't know how hard that is to cook.
---
Get a DNA test. Congrats if it is yours. But it happens much more often than you would think.
---
it was VC from day 1 because people ran it to kill VC for the westfall captone quest.
---
yeh pala would have killed him easily if he used HoJ after the blink in (which was a bad move in mage vs pala)
---
I guess I should rephrase, I was more wondering why if he was specced frost why even cast a fireball at all.  Surely 2 frostbolts with frostbite/shatter talent support is more valuable then a higher damage fireball and a rank 1 frostbolt.
---
I'm just being picky because I'm not in the beta and desperate to play mage like this again
---
You can sit on a point in stealth, wait for ppl to try to cap it, moonfire and run away. If they chase you, kite them around forever, if they go back to the flag, moonfire them again. Never engage, only enrage.
---
not that many layers, not that easy to switch, not that many lotusses....

Be careful around here dude, the people in this reddit want to see streamers head on pikes

No taunt doesn't give you any threat, this is a common misconception.

Taunt places you at the top of the threat list of the mob for 4 seconds.
---
But once the 4s are over you get your real threat back.
---
So if you didn't generate enough threat in these 4s the mob will go back to the mage.
---
What is gold farming going to look like for me as a 31/0/20 shaman? Can I farm any mobs with this spec? not sure what professions I will run. I want engi for PvP but I don’t think I’ll grab that right away.
---
he was trying to run out of combat to charge again i think
---
If you are ready to accept the challenge and the grind of a old school style MMO game, go for it.
---
The whole lfg vc arguement is all about what actually happened.
---
In 2004-2006 on my server (lightnings blade US)    everyone called it VC.
---
480/3 is 160. Where is it mentioned he is getting 2 level 60s?
---
I was just pointing out that 60 cloth armor doesn’t mean much. As I pointed out t3 gives less armor than a lvl 26 mail piece.
---
I don't see the appeal of it, I bet most of the players with beta access are just being good sports and trying to contribute to bug fixing, but deep down they loathe level cap.
---
I mean, you'll still be able to get gear. The competition for leather till 40 isn't that bad
---
On Mal'Ganis US, it was VC.
---
Coldsnap
---
No, by paying blizzard for the sub you are contributing to enabling them to continue bad development practices. Its about time us addicts  start talking with our wallets as well
---
lol nub he was trying to get out of combat to charge back in l2p
---
For those at work
---
He’s from detheroc? Damn I feel like I’ve never heard of someone from that server since 2008. Fond memories there
---
I basically meant the most prestigeous thing to win in a single sport/game/whatever, but yeah.
---
And IIRC, on the horde side we always called deadmines for deadmines. Since the first time I was there I was sherpaed there by someone who already knew of it's location. 
---
Anyone who wanted to go Molten Core would have to be ready to spend a fair amount of time in DM.
---
VC never made sense.
---
My fiance is currently trying modern WoW with me and she loves her druid! Haha
---
28% of WoW players don't understand context clues.
---
Maybe your in both now? I got the email but don't see anything as available. Just bfa and my ptr
---
Hidden Enemies tells you to go into Ragefire Chasm though and you get to see the instance entrance. Nothing about the Defias Brotherhood questline indicates it's going to be a dungeon or that the dungeon is called Deadmines. You don't even see the entrance before you go there because the quest before VC stops outside the mine
---
He was more famous during TBC/LK era, but he climbed a ladder that very few wow PvPrs did.
---
I mean... winning a blizzcon arena tournament is not for everyone.
---
"Why did blizzard ban me? I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING" when they were really buying gold. I can't wait for those reddit posts after release
---
If there is a system to game, people will game the system. From Blizzard's perspective they'll get better data and feedback if your participation (or lack) in the stress test doesn't affect your chances.
---
To be fair, I'm only watching it so much so regularly because I can't play Classic Wow right now 
---
that said yeah, I'm glad so many people are hyped for it
---
Ever try one of them mice with hella buttons on the side?  Or is even just wiggling your right thumb a tendinitis trigger?
---
A sweeping attack that does your weapon damage plus 5 to the target and his nearest ally.
---
You are correct
---
dont play wow classic play the older version first
---
If you don't want to read or be a part of guild chat, why would you even want to stay in the guild at all?
---
It was a lot easier for Alliance to reach Drek
---
As a noob who in November 2004 had never played an MMO before, how would anyone already know this established naming convention? I didn't even know what an instanced dungeon was at the time I first got the quest. Many players were in the same position at that point. 
---
It's not right to assume every person had the exact same experience, you can't possibly say as a concrete fact that no one did it, ever. I'm not sure why you think that.
---
Watch [Preach gaming tanking RFC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0wj5W42GiUE).
---
I didn't know the guy but he gives great advices to wannabe classic tanks.
---
If you're wanting to do a Dire Maul run and you only put DM, I'm gonna just ignore you. You need to state which wing/run of dire maul you want to do. DM: N DM: T etc.
---
I don't think creation date matters for stress test. I started in 7.3 lol
---
does account creation date matter at all???
---
Well, they will 100% do it regardless. And, well, I understand but I work 50hrs a week so time is limited for me and my gf.
---
lol my friends are always like *"guys let's do DMT"* but they don't even play WoW what a bunch of jokers!
---
I dunno man. I feel like that's mocking nkoe and challenging shout you are thinking of
---
It wasn’t called that on my server. It’s ok if different people called it different things
---
No I'm not.
---
Looking for a healer with a spec where I can heal dungeons (and dare I say raids someday) but is still able to level and farm when I get to 60? (Shaman is ok but Paladins need not apply)
---
I'll have time for everything else but farming gold. Way too consuming.
---
Yep, having all the spells and access to all the talents are the "game mechanics" people miss  today. I saw in another stream people asking why Classic was better than the later versions and in terms of game play THESE are why.  Blizzard stripped these out because "casuals" didn't know how to use them. So we get his new pigeon holed class specs that are incredibly limiting to streamline the experience and dumb down the game.
---
I highly recommend anyone who wants to play a pvp mage go and study Vurtne. The guy was a Mage God. He was by far the best at using every tool available to him. You just can't do his stype of play anymore.
---
Pretty sure he knows that
---
Thanks XD, see you on the front lines, FOR THEALLIANCE
---
Priest has the most dedicated healing buttons in classic out of all the healers, so in that sense i would say theyre the most interesting. Mages are hlgh pop, but they have the demand to match. Mage is right at the top for which dps class you would most want in a group
---
I’m excited to just get in but only able to get to level 5 kind of sucks I wish they would at least go to 10 or 15.
---
God that was beautiful
---
I never thought I'd find new foods to update my diet with on the wowclassic sub, yet here I am writing a new grocery list.
---
What? What did I miss?
---
I'm on the same boat. And yet I'm always upset when I wake up, check my email and see nothing about getting an invite. I will, however, sub on 8/13 to find a server and snag my too name.
---
If you already have two ptr accounts listed, it won't show. If you're willing to have your ptr accounts deleted, submit a ticket to request that. Then it will show.
---
Guy, I'm just going to jump in here. I'm a Grand Marshal/Multi-Gladiator Mage from Vanilla. The only time I had problems with Warriors is when I was still learning to PvP and would use Blink on Charge and not on Intercept. 
---
At no point should a Frost Mage lose to any Warrior in a 1v1. You actually have to be retarded to lose the fight. You can kill them with Rank 1 Frostbolt spamming as an ultimate "Fuck you".
---
Juan Jeremy?
---
When did fury warriors become recognized as top DPS? I remember playing a dual-wielding fury warrior back in vanilla since launch, and people in raids would make fun of me for "thinking I was a rogue" despite topping damage meters every run. ;\_;
---
whats wrong with food prep? a lot of people have limited amounts of time so food prep helps maximize your play time.
---
Watches asmon and the classiccast
---
...retail babby...
---
chips make the keyboard and mouse messy, so i waste more time just wiping my hands after a chip, So for me thats a no. Unless u dnt care it gets dirty.
---
For me its fruits. Cut up with a fork. Watermelon, all kinds of berrys. etc. Something i can pick at.
---
But im sure sandwiches wrapped around easy to eat, Something in a bowl chicken rice chipotle style. 
---
I just hate using my hands/fingers for food and playing , Im sure you could see that lol.
---
hopefully that window has a decent view!
---
2 hour bis.
---
I've bought and played every expansion that released for WoW. Since Cataclysm, I've said that I'm not going to buy the next expansion which turns out, I did anyway. However, I've just "tested" them out with no real gametime put into them. 
---
WoW became kind of alienated to me over the years, I didn't keep up with game evolving and how it was played. So, I'm really happy it will return to the basics. A foundation I'm familiar with. I'm definitely coming back for Classic and I will be there to stay. Even if it's just for a couple of hours a week.
---
I doubt it outside of the PvP scene for casters, and even then there are better PvP classes.  Horde will likely have more of them. 
---
In PVE they have some solid utility and will be somewhat in demand, but as others have pointed out, they’re pretty much bottom of the barrel for DPS until very late endgame, which I think many folks will still not end up seeing. 
---
That said, I played a lock from Vanilla through TBC and loved every minute of it.  Every class in the game has its niche. 
---
I think we are going to be seeing a lot of rogues and warriors.
---
Are you high bro
---
The true Rogue way.
---
Like any other new game it will die in a few weeks and fornite will remain at the top. Most of the people watching are the people that don't have access to the beta yet too.
---
&gt; Will you let the adults continue their discussion?
---
So leave then? you sound like a child lmao
---
That’s dumb, petty, and toxic behavior we don’t need in  Classic
---
Too bad there is no such thing as a beta "key"...
---
It's gonna be very easy to switch. Put that delusion down. The guy who gets first to 60 on your server is gonna manage it.
---
And he's gonna use every layer in an extremely efficient manner. 
---
Then more are gonna level and stack obscene amounts of devilsaur. Tidal charm will be way easier to get than it should be. 
---
They've just basically amped up the rewards to being the first on your server to level to ridiculous degrees. SO mcuh so it's tempting to roll a hunter. Will cut down farm time in the long term the rewards are so good
---
You have no idea what you're talking about...Clearly
---
I don't know if you realize this, but getting and using a credit card responsibly is very good for your credit score.
---
If you pay it off every month, you never get any interest, and you're building your credit history. Most of them have cash back rewards, so they are basically paying you to use it.
---
Best Vanilla mage ever was Vurtne. It wasn't even close back in the day. Go check out his videos.
---
Yes the testing period will start at 1am CET and last 2 hours. You can do whatever and play up to 26 hours from 1 am CET. However, max level is set at 5.
---
Stress test according to email, BfA beta according to launcher...
---
It doesn't have to make sense. People called it both, so being someone with the mental capacity of at least a 6 year old, I quickly learned that I would see it written both ways and it didn't matter anymore. It's not even an issue. Everyone is way too fucking bored waiting for launch lol
---
I love watching this shit show transpire as a hordie completely unaffected by any of it
---
You're forgetting the big damage numbers off of an ambush crit! So satisfying. But yeah I'd say this is good insight and is making me think a sword/combat is the way to go.
---
Doesn't fireball apply a dot in vanilla?
---
Thanks for sharing the video. What’s the track you have playing over this?
---
wow those two were pretty bad, i need to start recording so i can get ez upvotes
---
Warlock probably uses demon armor buff which brings him to more-less low class leather armor values so he is capable of taking smaller hits at this lvl compared to warrior. Also if we factor soul link vs def stance he might be even more durable than lvl 30 tank.
---
Also 100% of the Horde, I dont play Alliance so DM is Dire Maul because I'm not going all the fucking way to Westfall. That DM vs VC is the pointless kind of arguments that keep me playing Horde, that and I've been personally tasked to keep an eye on Neeru Fireblade.
---
t. eceleb worshipper
---
What does VC stand for?
---
All I'm getting from this is that Alliance are dumb because when they first started playing the called a dungeon the wrong (It is wrong if you look at every other dungeon name) thing and they never bothered to change
---
My launcher says 'beta &amp; stress-test', could this mean im in the beta aswell? :O
---
How Can ppl use his key If he already used it? Sorry for being ignorent
---
When Will Blizzard ever listen??? Where is the bluepost responding to My purely anecdotal evidence? - Also, i am pretty sure the dollar was stronger back in 2004, than it is today - Will Blizzard ensure #nochanges for the subscription Price vis a vis the dollar rate?
---
Now you turn pvp on for yourself and you are phased into servers with others who have it on.
---
My account was created in 2010, I don't think that date matters
---
Shamans were the first class that was considered imba during vanilla.
---
I’d crawl through a desert with nothing but my fingernails and get jumped by a bunch of teenage thugs just to arrive at your house so I can rub your feet under your desk and pretend I’m experiencing the amount of fun you are above me 😩
---
Regrowth spec Druid has the highest healing output in the game with a sub GCD cast time - keep trying though.
---
Cold snap talent
---
what do you mean?
---
Fishing challenge
---
There will be no wow token in classic.
---
How ever I honestly don’t see a problem if they did have a classic token. People who want to buy gold are going to do it one way or another.
---
I thought everyone was joking around but the more I read these threads the more I realize people actually think this fucking matters.
---
Yes, but another part of my point is that once this was started, it became the norm for many people. This isn't one person, but many people, making it an understood acronym even for people who don't agree with it. 
---
And again I'm not necessarily talking about what most people would do. Just talking about how one person doing something one way the first time ever can dictate what is done later one. Even if something changes that \*should\* make it incorrect. DM would be one of the first, if not the first, dungeon that any testers encountered. If the first ones advertised it as killing VC, than that could explain why it took root. Once it took root, it doesn't necessarily become incorrect. People know what you are referring to when you say VC.
---
You might have a hard time getting into a raid, but if you have a guild that hosts said raid, it shouldn't be too hard (and you'll know ahead of time if you have too many of a class).  For groups... hopefully you've made a good impression with people you've grouped with before.  I find a lot of rogues and hunters would actually start the groups to avoid searching for one.
---
Ah forgot that, thanks.
---
Yes. Just check when above comment was posted for any future stress testers.
---
Nuke Hogger as a big ass group of 5ers thats gonna be my goal
---
Always called it DM. Calling it VC implies that he is the only boss the group is going to kill
---
If you're in school and they teach you a formula and than give you a bunch of examples of that formula you learn that formula. The way we shorten instances is a formula. VC doesn't follow that formula. If you're doing math and using 1 formula and 1 of the questions disregards it entirely you shouldn't say "Ah I see" you should say "Teacher this doesn't make any sense
---
yup, i messed that up, gonna fix that tonight
---
What about winning the blizzcon arena world tournament? Do you think that's a huge enough feat for a WoW player?
---
[Vurtne is complete trash compared to Wedding!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ai49kXg5Pvs), do me a favor and check his videos.
---
Never played WoW before but Iv'e played tanks and rogues in other MMO's. In fact every MMO I've played has been a different class and I'm a firm believer in "Variety is the spice of life". So I'm thinking about going Warlock in classic. I understand the need for Soul Shards and I like the idea of that added mechanic. 
---
I've picked and pull mobs for hundreds of hours in other MMO's so I'm looking to change up that playstyle. I don't have anyone I know that would want to play WoW with me, so I may end up using Demonology at first to level up a summons to help tank for me. 
---
Is there anything else I should look into for playing a Warlock?
---
Hi, /u/YouNeedTheTruthIRL
---
I hope all the people getting buttmad about this pointless debate also don't get upset when people pronounce "gif" differently.
---
Yes, but you don't need to be THAT far away, afaik you get out of pvp combat based on time from the last action, not distance. Charge itself only has an 8-10 yard minimum distance so he could have gone 1/2 as far and had the same result.
---
This was during BWL before AQ or Naxx. IIRC they were either second or first on the list with the other spot going to the second boss of BWL. 
---
Good times.
---
You can respect 16 y/o as players but want to skip their "your mother" joke war
---
Yup Validus was top for Alliance. I used to make bank selling Stonescale Eels to the guild leader of Validus, forget his name. I dont think anyone else ever fished them up. Anyone here from Knights Empyrean? We were like 3rd or 4th behind Validus and Reign.
---
No, the actual map that came with warcraft 3 is way closer to the WoW map. Kalimdor is wider than it is in wow, and northrend is narrower.
---
Sorry guys... looks like we aren't streamers so no Beta for us.
---
That geographical heat map is very interesting. Apparently, Scandinavia and Germany are the ones who are most excited for classic. Which is great for me, really.
---
Oof... That sucks.
---
Ironically, the people who believe blizzard can't be trusted with their own product are also the people who believe we will NEVER get post-naxx content.
---
I want to be very loud and visible that my very real dollars will go to PATCHING STUPID SHIT OUT OF CLASSIC (like prot paladins being a pointless and terrible spec) and DEVELOPMENT POST NAXX (as long as it follows the social/communal design philosophies of vanilla WoW)
---
YOU HEAR ME BLIZZ? I WILL PAY MONIES IF YOU MAKE MORE OF THE GOOD STUFF YOU ONCE MADE. NOT THE NONSENSE YOU MAKE NOW.
---
VanCleef I suppose
---
He should have taken out that warrior before the second dude even appeared.  Noob mage.
---
5 hours later....
---
Update: my wife figured out how to uninstall my computer from my computer.  It’s smashed in the trash out back.
---
Chocolate chip cookies in vanilla almond milk is literally sexual
---
Druids can be fun. Jack of all type deal and I'm wondering if she would like the ability to try different styles.
---
LOL @ all the tards a few days ago saying the only thing to call it is VC.
---
Classic is the oldest version of the game, they're re-releasing it. Everyone on this sub is going go be biased, but I'd start with classic at the beginning of the game.
---
tokens =/= Vanilla :) but yeah if you wanna keep up with retail wow you could still be able to farm the tokens in retail wow and buy it there and than play classic for it ... but thats literally meaning u need to play 2 games at once and its only 12 dollar/mo so i would suggest just buying the sub \^\^
---
This thought is what got us to retail WoW today tbh. If someone is going to win 12 Guru Arenas (only 1 every 3 hours so not easy to do) then they deserve the trinket imo. I don't see how thats unfair at all.
---
Lol im just gonna get on and immediately hop off to play season 17. Not much to do on this stress test except exist
---
Why can't it be both?
---
Everyone knows what VC stands for. Everyone knows what DM stands for (in Westfall the more).
---
I don't see any problem in this "argument".
---
I have a very clear memory of being a level 21 dwarf paladin, slowly making my way through Lagforge. After the second or third time falling into the pit after being frozen for a few minutes I saw a fellow adventurer advertising "LFM DM". Thought that sounded fun so I whispered him only to be told I'm not high enough level. This nice adventurer then educated me that DM meant Dire Maul and VC meant Deadmines. 
---
Thought it was strange at first until I looked in my handy guidebook and saw that it too showed VC for Deadmines. Since then I have and will always refer to it as VC. 
---
https://i.imgur.com/aIkoZuZ.png
---
How was I ever saying it isn't? I know venruki is one of the best mages, doesn't change the fact that everything he does isn't big plays.
---
Stop analyzing every detail of the play and just enjoy the world pvp hype I'd say!
---
I hope Fortnite will die soon
---
Agreed, the OP of this thread is in another thread telling me it is a concrete fact that no one ever called it VC in vanilla. Not even just debating what it should be called now, literally saying it didn't happen back then.
---
this meme is the final word. You can call it VC if you want. Its wrong, but people will know what you mean.
---
Like people who use "women" even when they mean to use "woman" -- its wrong but we still get the meaning. Oh and we know they are a little slower than the rest
---
not at all.
---
in character you wouldn't do stuff like camping the corpse of a ganker waiting for them to respawn. that's metagaming. in character they are "dead" and you move on. you don't "know" where the enemy will appear again.
---
I was got with Alt + F4 to remove enemy name plates... like 4 times, I thought my computer was just being stupid.
---
so youre saying it could hurt?
---
i played on Kirin Tor US and we called it DM. Dire Maul had it's wings specified, such as, "LFM for DM West" or "LFM DM Tribute Run", etc.
---
He’s trying to reset to get out of combat and charge again
---
We were discussing what kind of content we would like to see...
---
Again, there's nothing to indicate the quest is more involved than something like Hogger until you actually get to the end of the mine and see the real entrance. And hell, even if you knew it was a dungeon, you still are never told the name. So you'd still be typing "LFG VanCleef" which would get shortened to " LFG VC" and ignoring people looking for this "DM" thing you've never heard of
---
I was also wondering what class would be the strongest at level 5 based on the abilities they get.
---
Nothing that wont already be done on the streams, ya. The point is to use your current best theory on how to level and see how good it actually is. If necessary, change it for the next stress test.
---
Can our poles touch tips?
---
My druid on a pserver is 46 and I decided around lvl 30 I'm not playing a druid in classic. 
---
I'm still leveling it because its the character I'm playing together with my wife.
---
&gt;Never engage, only enrage. 
---
nice
---
i am so down for some epic lvl 5 wpvp
---
Account created 2007 and no beta invite 🤷🏻‍♂️ i hate blizzard
---
It'll last long enough to basically do everything you can as a level 5 I suppose
---
&gt;Yeah, sounds good on paper, not gonna work in the real world because baby is in your lap and your trying to get them to sleep and operate a mouse and kb at the same time.
---
What would I know eh!
---
I'm sorry it hasn't worked out for you, if you're speaking from personal experience. My experience raising three hordelings is clearly, and gratefully, different.
---
Would give gold but spent too much time having fun
---
how did he reset iceblock instantly? Idk anything about mages
---
If you weren't a ranged class and weren't pulling very safely you ended up with 3 of these mobs and if you charge over to deal with you get agro from 3 more defilers. Smh
---
I literally bake a casserole with 2lbs ground beef/sliced potatoes/corn and I eat it for a week straight smothered in Worcestershire Sauce.
---
Fortnite have partnership with NFL and now with Jordan, it will never die. They have new content every week.
---
I lol’d when he ran away from the 2nd ice block XD
---
This guy is arguing the same thing in another thread too. Not worth it. I tried making the same point to him.
---
Wtf are you even talking about? I know venruki is a good mage, I was just pointing out that interupting a heal isn't a huge play?
---
I remember not having an SSD at Uni, download speed was quite literally capped by hard drive disk write speed. Gods we pirated then.
---
Oh no...It's retarded :c
---
Not gonna lie. Scheduled a dinner at my place for tonight with some buddies a week ago.  Got Stress test access and bumped it to next week.
---
Both are acceptable and people who actually have a problem with it are just being dense. That said, when I see DM, I immediately think Dire Maul.  While Dire Maul was added later, it's maintained that abbreviation for 14 years now.  Hell, when people talk about DM'ing on twitter or whatever media I always think Dire Maul first thought.
---
Got it, got email about 15 hrs after it became available, can't participate for 90% of it due to overnight at work -_-'
---
This is fucked up, they really should have just let those people in or something.
---
Example : they put a paladin / shaman Naxx shield as bis for a warrior tank but there's a much better in Naxx for a warrior.
---

---
On the flip-side, it opens up your RP events to be griefed by gankers. Some RPers prefer controlling their environment as best they can, versus authenticity of the experience. It's not all about immersion, but about their ability to tell a story in-game with others.
---
And I don't think any RPers would have been motivated to PvP more because of a game system. At least not for roleplaying reasons.
---
That said, I wanted to RP and PvP so badly I rolled on a PvP server with several other RP guilds instead of joining a regular RP server.
---
Now is the perfect opportunity. 
---
Join the Hype train friend. 
---
Enjoy the content and makes lots of friends along the way.
---
Leveling shadow then and I will respec for the big boy dungeons. Looking at BRD first :O
---
so dont pay for the game, thus never playing it because we need to show blizzard not to do what? Make classic?
---
Pull Stitches to Northshire.
---
And if someone like Asmon switched to OSRS you wouldn't even find WoW from the twitch section rn, calm down.
---
The word stress is really emphasized this time.
---
I think a lot of players memories regarding the difficulty of Vanilla are a little muddied by the fact that for many at the time, it was their very first MMO, and because of that was very challenging.  
---
How many people in Vanilla leveled without buying every spell rank?  How many classes with an interrupt never bothered to use it until they found themselves in a raid situation that was critical for it?   I remember playing a warlock and choosing a really cool dagger because it had high strength for me to stab people with in westfall. 
---
Just think about how much easier it was to level an alt compared to your first tune, because you knew more and understood things a lot better.  Today we also have YouTube and wowhead and a billion other articles that breakdown stats and strategies unlike anything we ever had before. 
---
Combine all that with 15 years of WoW building off of the original, and I think it’s fair to say for people going back with all that knowledge and experience, it’s going to be a lot easier the next go round.
---
actually resubbing for classic would show exactly how many of us "addicts" actually appreciate a good game and wont shell out cash for a bad game. If blizz gets a huge influx of players for classic that would actually incentivize them to move back towards the older game mechanics cuz itd be a way to quantify what people are actually interested in.
---
gold were always obtainable in Wow Vanilla throw shadow network, and never helped anyone (beside buying the 100% mount). You might found some guilds that will takes you to their raid to loot in exchange of some gold, but your reputation will be done after that. 
---
On a local scale, you have to understand that everything is easily tracked. 
---
From the moment you have a recent purple on you, you should be able to justify how you got it when applying to a new guild.
---
You got invited in a Raid by a Guild and you ninja some loot ? Enjoy playing alone from now on.
---
If the first fruit you see is a banana and instead of calling it a banana you call it a "yellow" because the first time you saw it someone was explaining colors to you, it's fine because you don't know better. Eventually you'll stop calling them yellows and call them what they should be. You don't buckle down because the other members of your kindergarten call them Yellows now too, you realize it's incorrect and change it. I feel like it's the same thing with VC
---
How will they know if youve spent real world money though?
---
Damn hope they get to my ticket in time. This needs to be stickied.
---
The whole point is leveling a toon first for farming purposes
---
Damn dude you need to put atleast sonydigital stream up, thia guys is so hype
---
I personally will be playing a fury warrior but I know 100% that I will be tanking to acquire all of my loot. I will not bring any rogues to any dungeon that I need loot from until I have the pieces I need.
---
Yes.

It might depend on the ranks, for casters since you don't rank up at the same time fireball or frostbolt may do more damage depending on your level. In this case the highest rank of frostbolt available(at lvl 26) does 126-139 while the highest rank of fireball(at lvl 30) does 199-266 with an additional dot of 28 damage. It makes more sense to do the extra ~90 damage when the enemy is sheeped and cast time doesn't matter.
---
Prepare for Blizzard being massive trolls putting everyone in a queue on login to the Stress test realm.
---
Sure am :)
---
I remember it like this too. I didn't know about the macro back then and found it weird that the skills work differentlym
---
&gt;are the greens above level 5
---
 Yes, most are above level 5 actually.
---
You are such a faggot lmao.
---
Got a few minutes into it. Lots of quick cuts and 1 vs 1. Go watch some of Vurtne's videos. They are all long cuts and the guy had relatively terrible gear and was nearly always out numbered.  From a technical aspect and his usage of engineering. I still put my money on Vurtne.
---
Or people with alts that need it.
---
Hi, I'm an older fellow myself (by gaming standards) I started back in Vanilla when I was 22. I did the raid-leader thing, got burnt out and take it casual now.
---
I'm also looking forward to Classic in a couple months. I played a bit on private servers and it was very similar to the original it just lacks the population.
---
Unfortunately you and I wont see each other as I play in the U.S. but to answer your questions, yes you are not alone. Expect to see a lot of the old guard coming back to the game in August.
---
You are incorrect. I played from beta through wotlk. During a long period in vanilla it did just that. First Google hit was someone else speaking on this very topic.
---
https://us.battle.net/forums/en/wow/topic/20765636452

I want to have a character on the horde for PvP healing. I'm leaning towards druid. Seems like bear form would be good for dealing with warriors and rogues, but unsure about end game itemization. What is, in your opinion, the strongest PvP healer on horde? I'm least interested in Shaman, but willing to listen to arguments for them.
---
&gt;What the fuck blizzard? Are you guys really gonna fuck me over like this, you bitch?
---
Not the most diplomatic way of making your case.
---
It's a glitch, glitches happen, they're not directed at you.
---
That's true with most words but I'm not talking about words here I'm talking about abbreviations. ShadowFang Keep is shortened to SFK, just like Wailing Caverns is shortened to WC. Every single dungeon follows this pattern. DeadMines becomes DM and if you call it VC than you're simply not following that pattern for no other reason than "I didn't know better at the time and I never bothered to change it".
---
&gt; I have absolutely no memory of that and in fact was under the impression that I hadn’t raided in Legion. That lack of sleep in the first few months does a number on you.
---
100% can confirm; I have many achievements that match your experience. I think I sleep-walked my way through WotLK and MoP. Better than watching garbage on television though!
---
Probably some mix of poor agro control and mana management. It takes a lot of tabbing and smart dps to hold more than a couple mobs at a time.
---
Later dungeons at low gear levels might be more of a bother about cc and even then just to have a smoother time. I remember tanking scholo on my  fresh 60 arms warrior and things were only a tad bumpy with a paladin healer, until we hit rattlegore. Its kind of nice though, I was pretty worried about having to spend more than a couple hours in a dungeon.
---
I never said there was anything wrong with it. Just that they probably will anyway.
---
24 hour\*
---
This is the correct answer.
---
why are you posting a wotlk screenshot?
---
Its about getting ahead of the pack early on so that you arent fighting for quest mobs all the way to 60. If it takes you 3 hours to get to 5 because your strategy sucks, you will be in a world of pain, IMHO.
---
oh no! The horror!
---
As I said, no such mail had reached me at the time I created this post :)
---
Naw, McConnell is a Spergadin not a paladin.
---
Are they asking for a specific wing or looking for a group to clear all 3 in one go?  This is where the DM = Dire Maul comparison breaks down as many players might be looking for only one wing.
---
Sadly you have only stress test at the moment.
---
Well I have the exact opposite experience as you and /u/pEuAsTs5y - I played on NA (several servers) and had **never** seen or heard of the term 'VC' until I started playing on private servers with euros.
---
I played a Paladin all through launch through BC... and then due to their anemic DPS and destiny of healing raids, I re-rolled as a fire mage main with a combat rogue alt because I craved the damage.  That being said, my buddy was a highly successful PvP paladin.
---
"content"
---
Are you looking forward to your first raid, Rags?
---
Well Damn
---
I don't want to sound rude, but the guy I responded to wasn't 100% right. Like literally in my comment you can see Blizzard asking for as many players are possible during that period of time. That's what Blizzard said, you guys are assuming something they didn't even mention.
---
And this isn't low population stress test either. So many people got invite. And the servers will be packed anyway during EU peak time. So I'm just asking, why won't they be monitoring servers during that period of time, if they want as many people as possible? That's what stress test is for, right? I mean they have a closed beta for small testing anyway and I'm pretty sure there won't be more players on EU during 2 AM than they have in closed beta during peak times. So what data will they gather from it exactly?
---
Not really, you can buy gold from gold farmers, and even then most bis items are "bind when picked up" so in order to have the best gear you have to play a lot.
---
Nope and tbc was the first time I saw westfall too haha. I remember thinking "this looks like Kansas, how fucking boring"
---
It's really sad that shit stirrers like you exist talking about ABSOLUTE HATRED that doesn't exist. ROFL
---
I’ve been looking at the forums every 10 minutes all day. This came in between refreshes for me. Thanks.
---
A single quest that likely wouldn't be your introduction to the dungeon. The first time you go to the Deadmines will almost certainly be for the last Defias Brotherhood quest and Red Bandanas. The first only tells you to kill VanCleef and the latter tells you to go to VanCleef's hideout.
---
If i engage though,Can i?
---
No, you are wanting to add something that is in retail, which is not the point to recreating classic. We want to stay away from the stuff that has made retail what it is.
---
Its VC
---
Suck a weenie, creep!
---
Personally if I'm recruiting for a dungeon who's abbrev. would confuse it with other dungeons, I just literally say "Deadlines" or the actual dungeon name. It's like a few taps on a keyboard you lazy fucks.
---
Blizz CS just figured this out like less than an hour ago. Give it a bit.
---
Am I complaining? I'm just slightly disappointed that 1.12 Vanilla turns out to be even easier than people thought.
---
Corpsemaker in particular is a big deal too. IIRC that weapon was BIS for 20-29 battlegrounds. That weapon is absolutely monstrous.
---
If it’s really this big of a deal just type out “Deadmines” takes literally a second longer. Ffs, people would complain about money falling out of the sky if it happened.
---
How was it an opinion?
---
Use this www.wowclassicbis.com
---
Sure, but how would you know what a dungeon was let alone it's name?  Just getting into the Deadmines involves fighting through a shit ton of elites.  It just said kill Van Cleef in the Dead Mines, so people said VC.
---
Go to your room
---
wow except it absolutely was VC on tons of servers from the very beginning and you have many people telling you this from their own experience in 2004
---
All this while using flute at the gates to make everyone dance in any BG
---
Sorry, missed that. I think there will be matching/recruiting sites/Discords nearer to the release date.
---
&gt;I'm already anxious on the lack of sleep and high stress levels I'm about to be under.
---
It gets better. It may not seem it at times, but it gets better. Hang in there.
---
I found an 8 slot bag that was more rewarding than my cache this week :/
---
Good one, yeah on Bonechewer (ally) it was "UD Strath" or just simply "Living".
---
Yeah sure, but do you think i could get the beta later! :O
---
I just came back after a year off. I’m levelling my Shaman to 120 and then roll, I guess Shaman in classic. That’ll keep me busy.
---
It’s like the top 5 streamers of WoW don’t make up about 80% of the viewership...
---
If Ironfoe is 20% it's going to be broken **AS FUCK** for spell paladins, who will now be the #1 DPS in all raids, forever.
---
&gt; You said items can have the same stats but the epic is better.
---
I did?
---
Gigantes
---
Flatbread
---
Loads of Greek salad
---
Couscous
---
I am gonna eat damn well. 
---
Oh and a fuckton of chocolate.
---
Mine showed up like 2hrs after I got the email
---
Judgoæing by the poll, only Americans use VC, but not all Americans use VC.
---
"blizzard you bitch" hahaha
---
Well, it could be tried.
---
I don't care people watch streams it's also about the guildchat, the things being said, when playing on PS I found that I was either surrounded by very young players (nothing wrong with that) or by fully obsessed raiders that only went for min maxing, and that isn't what 90% of this game was about, I remember playing with sub optimal groups but due to synergy it always worked out fine.
---
You aren't comparing it to the same situation though. Basically if we lived in a world where the first people to find a Banana called it "yellow" before it had any other name, we might all actually be calling it Yellow, or it might be that way in at least several languages. Especially if word for it takes root before people establish a different naming schemes.
---
Does Zipf's law count
---
I even manually updated it.
---
And I created another PTR and it populated in the drop down just fine...
---
We are powerless over our addiction
---
Im thinking of starting a group and having meetings
---
Hi im Fred and im and Altoholic
---
Got a stress test invite, but cant participate, why does it have to be at 1 am this time a week.. wish I could give it away.
---
The only annoyance is when you have to farm them before raid time and you start summoning/healthstoning the raid. But, that's it; after that, you can get more shards as you kill trash.
---
Because, a lot of people don't sit and read blue posts and classic wow reddit all day waiting for a beta key lol they notify you by email when you get in.
---
Strange, I got a stress test e-mail and it also appeared in the launcher. BUT, now I got 2 PTR accounts... only had 1 before so what the heck.
---
The problem with this is that Dire Maul has directions. No one would EVER say "lfg for DM" if they are running dire maul. 
---
It would have always been LFG DM North/East/West.
---
Anyone who tells you otherwise is a forgetful twat.
---
People will be zoning in all day so i assume it would still work out to some degree. That being said if you took all the lvl 1 alliance away from questing that going to give the horde an advantage in getting to contested leveling zones first (STV,Shimmering flats, etc.) so those zones would have a higher horde pop than alliance making it harder to quest down the line. Which would be ironic.
---
VC on Firetree, Thunderhorn, Gul'Dan, Demon Soul and Auchindoun.
---
The only time anyone called it DM was when the server was new and they were usually mocked for LFG DM in Westfall at lvl 18.
---
That whole room he's in was a nightmare. I remember doing that fight so many times to get everyone attuned.
---
Yeah kind off triggering me ;D
---
Eh, rushed while at work. Not that I care just didn’t want to break any rules.
---
First, Twitch viewership =/= quality, otherwise Super Smash Bros games would be there at the top. But people don't watch Smash Bros much. They *play* it. Right now, most can't play Classic, so they must watch.
---
Second... eeeew take it away from that Fortnite thing, it may corrupt WoW!
---
Mine showed upend I still don't have a mail. Benn on for 12 hours or more.
---
If they decide to invite more people after the test.
---
I hope we get that insta lvl 60. I'd buy that day 1 for my lock and woyer.
---
We don’t know yet.
---
I will give it a try! Thank you!
---
Nevermind the reason I can't see it apparently is because I have two ptr realms and I need to have support delete them so I can see it.
---
I personally don't see a reason to remove it and I am pretty heavily in the #noChanges camp.
---
I used to fear it. Now I just embrace it. Restxp ftw.
---
Nice, can far sight do this too?
---
Been playing since Vanilla on retail and have heard it called both over the years. They both make since but if you call it VC it cannot be mistaken for Dire Maul.
---
hi fred
---
Thank you, this is something I was wondering about.  I've never owned a logitech but I know they have had a great reputation for their mice.  I will look into the g600, thanks.  I'm a little confused off the bat, why do the buttons start at "g9" instead of 1?
---
You are unbelievably dense.
---
Are the twitch names the same as mentioned?
---
if it's obvious, than it's correct. It's DM.
---
lmao this guy is toxic as hell.
---
That's why I tank :D
---
MF's, even in beta, /w me to see if I want to tank just because they /who warrior 20-23
---
Gotta have something
---
&gt; Will say most will put DMW DME DMN though.
---
That is the point I was trying to make.  Using wing designation, you use a 3 letter abbreviation for all of the Dire Maul runs and this leaves DM for Deadmines.
---
Thank you I may have to check logitech.
---
That's a terrible idea. My birthday is 8/27 so damn straight i am taking time off.
---
Jesus Christ.... What is it about betas that turn people into drooling vegetables incapable of reading and understanding time zones?
---
Just shift click the name. Chances are low a high level is looking for group for deadmines
---
All of it before WoW.
---
Maybe a stupid question but I only played alliance back in the day. He says: „when you hit lvl 10 and go to barens“. Is there no way to level in silver pine forest? I would love to play undead this time around but I rly don‘t like all the horde kalimdor stuff like barons
---
well there are already a ton of addons that work in the beta 
---
quest helpers... use um if you want its a personal choice
---
on my first guy I wont for the authentic experience but after on alts I I may
---
tbh you should fuck around and do irl shit so when classic comes out you can take a break from irl to no life.
---
I’m planning to get a group of warriors most likely, for https://classic.wowhead.com/item=4964/goblin-smasher?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2 BIS this weapon is OP for a lvl 5. We do have to take down a lvl 12 and you have to be a Tauren warrior. Also you can check out https://classicwow.live/guides/482/classic-wow-launch-strategy-weapon-progression-how-to-get-ahead-of-the-crowd?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ios_share_flow_optimization&amp;utm_term=control_2 for information on other classes, and their specializations along with BIS.  If your down to tag long and head to Elwynn or somewhere for WPVP and dueling, I’ll be recording/streaming the whole thing!! Just DM me or post here.
---
wow, the stress test numbers are surprising.
---
The demo client still was a legion client. As far as I've heard the beta is updated to BFA.
---
Q: Do you use contraception?
---
A: No, I have WoW installed.
---
No big problems, you mean right?  Not "now"?  Pretty cool mouse functionality..
---
On firetree, the dungeon was referred to as VC
---
Hey, you can totally go to Silverpine if you want! There are a bunch of leveling guides out there that use Silverpine in it, so feel free to skip the Barrens.
---
My first just turned 3 months old. A comfy chair and being able to play with one hand helps so much. That is, until she needs to eat...
---
Big true
---
We are stress testing it now! Part of the stress test was properly delivery the client to all the testers. Clearly it failed the stress test.
---
JFC you’re so obtuse it’s not even funny.
---
So do you call Asmongold senpai or does he call you it?
---
*nervous sweating*
---

---
Herbalism/Alchemy is starting to feel more realistically optimal than Mining/Engineering for PVP, as a healer.
---
It seems like it’d be too difficult to get the resources and money to level Engineering AND buy potions. Plus, being able to get temporary stat increases, instant self heals, and instant mana regeneration from potions seems more useful for a healer than DPS, since I’ll be going OOM from healing everyone I can and losing health quickly from being more targeted by the other faction.
---
If you don't use the 12 button mice (I find its too many buttons for me to realistically use) I'd recomment the G502.  It has 5-6 programmable buttons which is enough for me.
---
Ya, I have heard it is and it isn't. Idk man, haven't seen any vids from the beta that confirm either way.
---
Which is what I did. I'm not, well wasn't, playing retail but I had enough gold to pre-buy some game time back in October in anticipation of re-subbing for Classic.
---
My impression of razor is so terrible after having made this thread lol.  I have only owned one razor in my life though and it's only been a year and a half or so.
---
What is this thing with people thinking they're old at 30? Honest question, I'm 51, what should I say of myself, into-the-grave-already?
---
&gt; He can either sub multiple accounts 
---
You are telling me that this guy will pay for multiple accounts to: 1) Potentially have many of them end up in the same layers. 2) Potentially have layers go away entirely when they are no longer needed for his server. 
---
&gt; Ask guildies/friends 
---
Layer programming puts a preference on keeping those people in the same layer.
---
&gt; If you can group with people and it ensures you'll be in the same world. Abusing the system will be extremely easy. 
---
Unless those people \*are already in the same world.\* You have to pretty much keep trying with different people until you find someone who is on a different layer, and \*than\* hope that the layer has whatever you are trying to farm. A lot of effort for potentially no pay-off. 
---
&gt; I would have preferred server locked sharding. 
---
Layering \*is\* server locked, and sharding is \*way\* more aggressive in how many versions of a space it spins up. It would be way easier to exploit sharding. How much of this have you actually looked into?
---
Yeah but the stress test is only 24 hours and being a bartender my only free time to play it is gonna be late tonight when I get home from work. She’ll still be there in a couple days 😂
---
I mean, there are concrete references to "VC" being equivalent to "Deadmines" in the Nov 2004 official strategy guide:  [https://i.imgur.com/aIkoZuZ.png](https://i.imgur.com/aIkoZuZ.png)
---
To me, that implies that not only was it called VC before Dire Maul was released, but it was common to call it VC before the game even officially launched.
---
Imagine voluntarily paying entertainers directly rather than letting half a dozen middlemen take a massive cut.
---
Hey, sorry for hijacking, got the stress test invite, but in the drop down menu, it doesn't appear. anyone know what i could do?
---
I've added Talents to a sheet and added talents to the level brackets page.
---
lulz
---
What’s your IGN on beta? I can show you why you’re wrong, or even make a video proving it :)
---
Oh boy this subreddit is gonna be a hoot tonight
---
undead rogues are pathetic lowlives and should be corpse camped till they log off. Cant wait to do that again
---
Lmao most people have no idea who any of these goober streamers are. We aren't all teenagers.
---
I remember having to cast innervate to prove I had it back when that was a talent....
---
Interesting. Maybe it's all just super random :p

1. Initial costs: 1g

2. Cap: 50g

3. Decay: 5g per month

4. Minimum decayed cost: 15g
---
Idk warlocks.
---
Mage in general is pretty boring, you essentially have a 1 button rotation -- fire sometimes gets instant pyro but those are few and far between until you gear is insane (even then it's not super common) 
---
Hunter has aimed shot and a little minigame with weaving into autos (basically if you start a 3s aimed shot cast with 2s left before your next auto you "lose" 1 second of auto shot dps) so you play around maximizing your auto shot dps, unfortunately if theres only 16 debuff slots, you will not get to serpent sting in a raid, but you have *responsibilities* on a few fights (kiting general drakk, tranq shotting) which has nothing to do with your rotation, but is something to note
---
Is it really gatekeeping when you try to exclude •yourself• from a group?
---
No because they are taken into consideration the accounts made in Vanilla they are still subbed. I doubt any account made in BFA are getting into beta.
---
Except no.
---
ST for Sunken Temple. Yeah I know it's "Temple of Ata'Hakkar" but it's referred to in game by NPCs as the Sunken Temple as well because theres parts in the dungeon where you're location is "Sunken Temple"
---
OMG I need a push to talk button SO badly.  Thank you...I'm leaning more and more to the G600.  What's with the side button labels though?  It starts with G9 instead of something like G1, seems confusing to remember.
---
Havent played retail since July 2016. before then it was spotty month or two here and there usually after an expansion. Last real go at it was mid MoP.  
---
Gonna play the shit out of classic.
---
&gt; yeah, no, if people are playing vanilla for "difficult content", they're going to be solely disappointed
---
Go to the official forums Classic discussion board and check out the many thousands of posts that are focused solely on complaining that damage is too low because the game is not as hard as they remember. A lot of people are obsessed about their misremembered difficulty.
---
Yeah, I can only ever remember calling it tribute.
---
I haven't tested but 
---
1. should work 100%
---
2. should work because potions are off GCD
---
3. depends on tick/ms. Swapping trinkets and placing traps even if it's off the global it takes time because of MS and if you get a bad dot tick then you will get in combat.
---
That’s fine, I just want you to understand this is why the token ruins the current game.
---
Buy gold all you want but I imagine Blizzards gold-selling detection is probably much better now than it was 15 years ago and if that’s what my $15 a month is going towards than that’s well worth it.
---
Whats up with the numbers in the name.
---
i dont think so
---
ive not seen anyone mention getting in other than an eu and possibly na wave on monday
---
as other guy said prob after stress is done they inv more
---
I think the weekend nothing happened for obvious reasons and then starting Monday it was all hands for the Stress test. After Stress is over, there will likely be more down time with no invites and they may ramp back up next Monday (maybe Tuesday because of holiday)?
---
Yeah I’m talking about the second time, saying he never iceblocked hoj. He iceblocked warrior charge first, and then iceblocked the warrior intercept as the second
---
Regardless of your kids gender name it Omar, the savior of Classic.
---
Are you trying to roleplay a ghoul?
---
Thanks for this!
---
Lmao really this is why it wasn't working. I better get beta access if I can't play tonight. &gt;:(
---
More like 2 back to back 1v1s
---
I absolutely call it VC because that’s what people called it when I started playing. I started January 2006, so it was not a decision I was involved in. My stupid server had already decided and 12 year old me wasn’t about to say DM and look a fool.
---
Played WoW since Wrath of the Lich King. I loved the game and was attached almost immediately.  By the time Cataclysm came out, it felt like WoW had become 'my' game. But, I started getting frustrated with the game during Cataclysm and taking longer breaks than I normally would and this persisted through MoP and a little into WoD. I'm not sure what happened in WoD, but maybe I was being nostalgic about WoW and started getting addicted again. 
---
But Legion sort of changed everything. I was full-blown loving the game again. For the first time it felt like Blizzard was doing the best job they could and it truly felt like it. Honestly, I still love Legion. With BFA, it was frustrating during the first couple months because our power level was absolutely destroyed. But actually, 6 months later, now that you can get up to 370 ilevel easily, it's not even a problem anymore. All my characters feel on a similar power level as they did in Legion, so I can just go around killing everything fairly quickly while doing World Quests. This is fine, game feels good again for me. 
---
But, this past few months I've been trying to recreate Vanilla-Wrath like scenarios where I'd level with heirlooms and quest gear. Or, whatever. But obviously it's not the same. This last week I can barely play BFA at all because I only want to play Classic. So much of it reminds me of Wrath. I spent a year in Wrath without hitting max level. 90% of that time was spent in Vanilla zones which were unchanged since Vanilla, so Classic will still be nostalgic for me in a lot of ways. I had forgotten why I had become frustrated with the game during Cataclysm, and it was things like Looking For Group, LFG, all these things that made everything feel like it doesn't matter anymore. Watching people play Classic is exactly what I want for WoW right now. The moment Classic releases, I'm abandoning retail. But not forever, because I still love Retail. I will probably spend a couple months in Classic until I get bored (which is always the case. I can't play WoW for more than 2 months without becoming fatigued), and either take a break from WoW all together until I come back, or maybe play some Retail if some interesting new updates come out. 
---
Basically, I like the fact both of these games exist simultaneously. For someone like me who isn't biased or stubborn on hating Retail WoW, I will appreciate both of them. But will focus mainly on Classic for the next year probably.  If a big update hits Retail, I'll probably play it. Just do dailies which usually only take maybe an hour - no big deal.  I love World of Warcraft too much to just abandon the current game. The thought of just abandoning just sounds icky to me.
---
Bro you'd die to a panther mob in STV, sit the fuck down.
---
Energy drinks, some pasta stuff, sandwitches and pizza
---
Fake and gay.
---
That would be a big yes though
---
Take the thirsty broad up on her offer
---
Why would they update it to the BfA client?
---
EU says DPS.  DD is just another **games** abbr.
---
Just make sure you fix all equipment before classic releases. You know. The whole baby room, camera equipment, wardrobe, poop cleaning desk. The works. God speed brother.
---
Resto Shaman would only struggle if they weren't down ranking their heals.
---
Wow servers had a hard a hard cap of 4K. any one past 4K who wanted to log in hit a que.  
---
now layering is basically sub servers so when 4K people log on it caps the layer and creates a new layer and another 4k players are then in layer 2. Making it able to have more than 4K players on 1 server but still feel Vanilla like and when all the retail tourists leave  every one will be on the same layer. And when phase 2 is release layering will be disabled.
---
Sharding is the exact same technology but each ZONE is its own layer. In classic the entire server will be 1 layer so you won’t be zoning in and out when you enter a new area.
---
Good to hear.  Is it comfortable to press the buttons with your thumb?  Do you leave your thumb rested until you press a button?
---
#5 I believe
---
My plan is to make a human and try to make it to the Orc starting zone, just to confuse them
---
So, I asked a few days ago the same thing in another thread. What's an easy to learn healer class for noobs? Some told me paladin but I saw that they are very popular as well as shaman. Im little bit anxious that they will be too much of them.
---
Just give me the real beta and i'll be happy :3
---
Now that you mention Enchanting for wands, I’m starting to reconsider.
---
I’m split between Enchanting/Tailoring, Herbalism/Alchemy, and Mining/Engineering.
---
I’m planning on raiding and PVPing as much as possible and they all have strong benefits. Obvious Engineering is the best, if you can afford to go buy all that other shit, but it seems unrealistic to afford buying all of the things that other professions provide, while not being able to make much of a profit from Engineering.

&gt; they will be going through the list of recent invitees and remove the extra PTR account so they can reflag for Stress test participation.

Isn’t that exactly what they’re doing

Thats his roleplay name

Mountain Dew and Doritos. Can’t beat a classic combo even if it’s a meme.
---
Whoa that's just like how VC is actually called Deadmines but is referred to as VanCleef's hideout by NPCs
---
Yeah, and while iceblocking the charge, the hoj was immuned. If this what you meant then nvm xD
---
I'm going to lose to no-lifers regardless lol. I just want to have as much free time as possible as close to release as I can have. Its easier to manage being away from the game after you've just played it for a week straight.
---
In your situation week 2 definitely makes sense though--best of luck come launch!
---
Widescreen monitor support, more restricted addon functionality to prevent too much “cheat” automation, battle.net integration and friends list, adjustable graphics settings ranging from vanilla era to more modern although the models will still be the same; it’ll mainly do things like increase the ground clutter and have more enhanced lighting, shadows and draw distance. Instead of 12 patches like in vanilla, Blizzard will be rolling out the content in 6 phases. It’s pretty much going to be vanilla in its final, mature form pre-BC.
---
How is leveling as a rogue, when playing with 1-2 friends and which specc would you recommend?
---
No man, don't get me wrong I'm pushing 40 it's just a different playstyle and mentality from my experience on PS. I'm happy for you that you still want to get back into the vanilla game and hope to meet you there (if you're EU based ofc)
---
So if each server is having the same pop cap as vanilla how are we getting 3 layers of 3300? Oh wait they won’t have the same pop cap.
---
So it will alleviate starting zones.
---
It was always good to throw out some feelers in trade chat because every so often you would find somebody with an alt that needs to run it and log over.
---
For most of the years I’ve been playing (since mid-TBC), I’ve Maine’s a holy paladin. I never had much trouble doing well in PvP (battlegrounds, arena) or PvE (both dungeons and raids) and played all four pretty equally time-wise. I’ve also gotten every other class up to at least 60 at some point—except Warlock. 
---
So my question is, what’s life like as a warlock in BGs, arena, dungeons, and raids? Can I be pretty good at all four? Am I gonna be able to find raid spots and/or will I be competing for gear? Is my DPS viable? Pretty much all I know is that leveling is gonna be fun.

He/She likely a non-gamer troll.

Ermm, awkward. I am sure she'll let you share.

Probably why he asked for my bnet email.

I don‘t want to run guides. Just try to get the experience with no knowledge (: it just sounds like barons is the only way in the vid (:

Wonder how many people have redone there old wow accounts for classic.
---
I’m not a fan of fortnite at all, but you’re dumb as a rock if you think fortnite doesn’t have content. That game has put out more content than Blizzard has since Fornite’s release.

But RFC for vanilla horde is ragefire chasm

pretty sure that post said it won't reduce your chance for future closed beta invites. The post does not say at all that it would not increase your odds.

Yea but you can argue the other way around too. In the 1vx Vurtne Videos he was probably playing against some 13 year-old who knew absolutely nothing about pvp. People on private servers will certainly be more competent on average.

I think its a great idea, esspecially so you can enjoy content slower and have fun with the items you obtain from each dungeon

Oh okay. That’s awesome too. Silverpine is great, make no mistake about it. Thanks for the feedback

Yes it’s my favorite mmo mouse I have ever used and the thumb buttons are adjustable and can be moved forward or backward  depending on the length of your thumb.

With you there, my friend.

Looks like the reflags just went out, reopenyour launchers!

Wow you got so many people with this comment. Have an upvote, Sir.

Of course on private servers where it costs nothing to play you are going to run into a lot of kids. I don’t think you can really compare the two communities even though they are both WoW I would venture that their demographics are very different.

That's what random means.

I'm sure if you behave she'll let you play. :)

That may be THE selling feature for me tbh.  Thanks.

You mean VC?

Venruki was literally expecting it, he said so when he blinked in. He wanted to Iceblock the HoJ. I think the pala HoJd at the moment of the warrior charge, which got ice blocked. Not sure though.

PallyPower FUCKING YES
---
Do not lead this adventurer astray, you foul demon!
---
Yeah. My thought, if I went without it, was to have chat macro that said something like, “count to five before you attack the skull” should give me enough time to build threat through ret Aura and melee long with SoR.

I still might try doing without for the challenge and pick it up later if I find it too much of a pain.

This is the legacy of every IT guy ^

As an orc hunter I'd tame a pet from the area and give it an npc name and use eyes of the beast to trick new alliance players into attacking it and getting themselves put into pvp so I could gank them lol

Yes, I know, but its nice to just hover your mouse over an item without a number on it, that is my personal feeling.

Too bad it's probably going to be gated in the starter zones

It's just to level 5 dude.

Oh you the guy from the vid? I didn‘t realize! Thanks for the content and the guide on the wand! I was wondering how to get one at start :)
---
No one’s ever really gone...
---
Yeah, but the mage will never let the warrior five seconds for that. You'd have to expect the mage to be terrible for that to have a chance to work.
---
Mining or herbing (depending if you took engi or alchy) at the start, mixed wish fishing and cooking. Heal strat live runs and orbs round robin but make a deal with the tank that the first two go to each of you. Dps will still attend. Grab a couple stacks of mage waters and do Jump runs with a warrior if that’s available (DME). Ele can also grind mobs but it’s slower, satyrs you can kill in a single rotation but expect to drink every 5th or so.

Classic WoW is the old version just re-released because its much more rpg based than current WoW.

WoW  &gt;TBC  &gt;WOTLK &gt;CATA &gt;MOP &gt;WOD &gt;Legion &gt;BFA(current)

We are going back to the beginning so if you want to start at older content you will have to wait for WoW Classic as it is (pretty much) the exact same game as the one released in 2004.

The only question you have to ask yourself is..Alliance or Horde?
---
Also kind of gives you a little authority, too.

Some POS rogue tries to talk about how important he is? Bruh DPS are a dime a dozen, sit the fuck down.

But then you also get a big head and no one will want to play with you.

Isn't he playing/uploading clips on Youtube as Greatwizard?

Multiple things help. Watching videos, reading about them, and just playing them.

I lost interest in a mage at around 45 but the druid wass about 25, Hunter around 15, warrior 10.
---
But I almost gave up on my rogue till I watched some pvp videos and just got hooked. Became my main.

You can pick up shadow weaving without being a shadowpriest. All of the naxx guilds I've looked at seem to be bringing shadow weaving on one of their healers.
---
that’s what happened with me! I had 2 PTRs, requested they remove one, came home, it was gone, hour later the Stress Test showed up on my launcher.
---
Can confim that I yelled out as a noob "LFG Hidden Enemies!" and not RFC. Slowly it transitioned to RFC most likely because we as players grew, learned more then filtered our knowledge down when we made alts.
---
That being said this is a pretentious thread and this argument is nip picking as fuck. Who cares how it was called? If a player said either it would be understood.
---
Fucking loved xperl back in the day

It sounds more complicated technically to maintain the modern client *and* updated the Classic client by somehow importing those some changes into the Classic client and then adapting it to actually fit Classic WoW. Like you wouldn't want to import BfA client features or attributes that Classic WoW doesn't have.
---
It would actually make more sense to just consider the point from Legion client -&gt; Classic client using Legion client as a base and considering that a hard fork and treat them as two different pieces of software (because they are). The only thing you need to push in terms of updates to Classic along with BfA are Battle.net updates, and probably security and communicability updates.
---
If it’s your house it’s your WiFi so it’s your stress test.
---
Can you elaborate a bit on what PvP was like for a lock? It’s the only class I’ve pretty much never played.
---
Shamans and Warlocks have better than 50:50 matchups against Mages and Rogues/Hunters are pretty close to 50:50. Group PvP they are better, but they are not S tier at 1v1s or anything like you're saying.
---
That is awesome!
---
guess I put cet instead of cest.

but still a midnight stress test, fkin stupid
---
Honestly that's why i recovered it. For that small chance of a beta :D

Lol gotcha =) was just funny to me.

Thanks :)
---
I never lost the will to play not the enthusiasm, ofc things change with age and responsibilities but gaming is my favorite hobby so I always find the time for it.
---
I'm even more excited because I started to play at the end of TBC so I never experienced vanilla (never played on PS because I don't trust them) so this will be my chance.
---
I'm EU, hope to meet you too!
---
I feel like a small percentage of players actually bother searching to see if these topics have been discussed or debunked before on this subreddit. A lot of your "p2w" style posts have been addressed. Nothing new is happening that you think is going to be game breaking or very different from what Vanilla was.  
---
Please use the search bar, thank you.

You just reminded me that the first time I ran Deadmines was for a feral druid alt - 6 months or something after I started playing the game.

Ooops

They have trouble with healing classes like druid/priest as frost, but can burn them down as fire but then they lose to melee as fire usually.

Great.

I honestly wish Razer was more reliable. Ive owned, and I'm not exaggerating, over 10 Razer Nagas over the years starting with the original, the updated models, the chromas, chroma epic wireless Naga to now the Trinity and without fail, something goes wrong. Whether it's a button in the side that just stops working it multiple, to random glitching where mouse just stops to most recently the left mouse button not clicking. They are a headache. I've been buying them over and over because it's what I am use to and comfortable with but I wouldn't advise it if you are new to MMO mouses. Start at Logitech and if the g600 doesn't suit you, try other brands other than Razer. I want to love razer, but they just use really cheap parts and it always shows

Firetree-US here, also called it VC even before Dire Maul came out

Played in Vanilla. Started late (2006). It was called VC on Stonemaul US. Don’t see why it really matters though.

Modern Tick/accuracy rate is optimized for arenas
---
Vanilla Tick/accuracy rate is optimized for world pvp
---
It makes sense. I hated TBC the moment it came out in the pre-patch because of arenas. I was god-like in world pvp, mainly because I had the KT X-bow, believe it or not. But when I stepped in arenas I was completely useless because of Line of Sight issues around pillars. I quit a month into TBC, flying mounts, server transfers and ugly zone design ruined the game for me.
---
So, i dont play hunter much, but slow 2 hander warriors do the same thing wirh their rotation, where they try to weave abilities between white hits. I find it pretty engaging in the context of classic WoW.
---
Compared to live, dps "rotations" in classic are incredibly bare bones. One of the things i like most about warrior (and hunter to some extent) is that they have rotations that you can actually optimize instead of spamming frostbolt/shadowbolt until you go OOM.
---
Unfortunately boomkins are just that terrible. The only utility unique to boomkins is the aura, but boomkin damage is so low that you would be better off taking a mage in that spot. That said, druids are underplayed and innervate and bres are very nice to have in a raid enviroment.

Corpse hop to Blackrock mountain

You are just going to run out of mana. The buff you provide isn't much compared to the lost dps. You can probably still find groups, just not easily

Sure actually lets roll with what you're saying. In Europe there's a popular fruit that you can buy in most grocery marts, very common. In England they call them Pineapples, every other single country in Europe calls them Ananas. I'm sure if someone introduced Pineapples as Ananas to England when they first saw them they would call them Ananas like everyone else. But England saw the fruit and said "That's a pineapple" it makes sense why they call it that but most people already have a name for it. The only reason England doesn't change is because they're too stubborn to. It's the same thing happening here with VC
---
I really don’t get why this is such a heated argument. I didn’t play in Vanilla maybe that’s why? I will probably say DM because it makes the most sense but I will still play with people that say VC.
---
Good luck avoiding the banhammer. You're blind.

It would maybe get sense to get freshly unsubscribed people back on board.

Tired of seeing these posts. It has been asked before plenty of times and im sure will be asked alot in the next 3 months. 
---
Why do you need approval from others. 
---
If you haven't played and are curious about it. Give it a try. If you like it, Keep playing if not go back and play retail.
---
You won't lose anything if you play a game and don't really enjoy it. Wow classic is the earliest state, Doesn't mean you NEED to play that to play other versions. Cause pretty simple every expansion just dumps the past expansions in the garbage.

wrong in what way ? - something is wrong if you are taking over 18s (SW:P) to kill a single mob and need to talent imp.

mindblast r1 (lvl10) 39-44 , smite r3 (lvl14) 54-63 , mind blast r2 (lvl16) 72-79 , holy fire r1 (lvl20) 78-99.

mind flay r1 (lvl20) 75 over 3s
---
So, if Retail adds things that was previously "Vanilla exclusive", you don't want that?
---
No it's more like doing a world problem involving time, telling the class ,"Hey guys, I know t makes more sense but if your chicken-shit handwriting can't differentiate t from +, please use a different variable and just know it's time." 
---
If I was a literal robot who could not adapt my thinking whatsoever, then yeah that would be confusing. Hell, maybe it was confusing at first, but then if you're still confused after someone explains the reason, maybe WoW is a bit too advanced. Exceptions to general rules exist everywhere.
---
Nice - as I suspected you’re out of touch with the current meta and have no idea what you’re talking about besides repeating outdated information.

Btw - pretty hilarious that a Druid is expected to throw innervate to a priest but nobody brings that up as a negative about priest (that they need an ability provided by another class as a crutch to stay afloat in long fig

DM is Dire Maul, VC is Van Cleef run, get it right.
---
I love kiting everything at once on a high level character and the blood boil/flamestrike/etc everything at once. Something satisfying about that chorus of AAHUGHGHUGH.
---
I don't remember a limit.  Then again I was like 14. I don't remember a lot from 14 years ago
---
This is interesting because when wow first came everyone called it DM for deadmines. But when Dire Maul came out they started calling it Deadmines VC because of the final boss and DM for the raid DM
---
From every poll I've seen, more people want RPPvP than RP, and the modern game population distribution is barely relevant.
---
Any security changes or hardware changes will need for the backend to be updated anyway. Keeping it as the legion client will cause problems somewhere down the line when things change. Keeping them both the same will be less work than having to figure out how to get there in 4 years.
---
Solution, call it D for Deadmines, one word.  DM, Dire Maul two words.  Looking for more D.
---
&gt;in fact they don't refer to it as VanCleef's hideout ever they call it the Defias Hideout.
---
Red Silk Bandanas does, which I've already explained.

2. I named it wrong ... I ment shared cooldown for potions + feign death

[What add-ons can do has changed over the years and have become much more sophisticated as authors have gained years of experience and savvy. We’re not 100% on a concrete solution to what this means for WoW Classic yet, but one thing we know is that we’re not going to roll all the way back to the 1.12 add-on API. Doing so would open the way for nearly complete automation of combat decision making allowing for “bot” behavior that is counter to the core WoW gameplay experience. This is one thing we know we don’t want. On the other end of the spectrum, the modern API offers some additional functionality for creating social features that could also undermine the authentic classic experience. We’re still figuring out the details and looking for a good middle ground. We’ll be keeping a close eye on feedback from the community and add-on authors on where we should be setting those boundaries.](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/news/22646759/restoring-history-creating-wow-classic-panel-recap)

I mained Horde in retail vanilla. 
---
It was VC = Deadmines and DM = Dire Maul. That is because deadmines is very rare for horde to do, it's usually done by alts later in the games lifetime. Many players on horde back then didn't even know deadmines existed until later in the game after Dire Maul was out.

On alliance it was different.

Sure as a newbie I understand. But my problem isn't noobs who are calling it VC it's people who still call it that after playing the game for a decade. Surely you realize the instance is called Deadmines after you run it once and than you know what to call it after that

Avid Razer user and can say 100% that the G600 is a better more reliable product than the Trinity and Razer Naga for that matter. I've been buying Razer Nagas over the years since it's inception and they have only been headaches. G600 is the most reliable MMO mouse on the market and the cheapest!

4th option, the servers stays Classic and frozen in time. I am not a fan of erasing progress, especially if I never asked for it.
---
My choice: Classic stays as it is, no reset on existing servers but open up new fresh realms after a few years for those who want to start over.
---
I won't oppose TBC/WoTLK if Blizzard is up for it BUT only if they are on *separate* servers, it would split the playerbase IMO but it's possible some people not currently interested in Classic may come to TBC and/or WoTLK, the more the better.

Keep telling me that I never played during vanilla, I still have pictures of our WOW parties back from jr high.

Well, so the different calculations would each have their own time complexity (big O). The 'N' in Big O refers to the size of the input that goes into the calculation, in this case the number of players. We have no way of knowing what the time complexity for the level scaling algorithm is because we cant see the source code, but adding two algorithms together doesn't make O(n\^2).
---
This would be O(n) because the number of operations we do scales LINEARLY with our input (players). As in: we do a thing for each player.
---
`//pseudo code`
---
`for ($players as $player)  {` 
---
  `//do level scaling`
---
  `//do combat dmg`
---
`}`
---
This next example would be O(n\^2) because the number of operations we do scales QUADRATICALLY with our input. Notice that for each player, we (at worst case) will run this operation N\^2 times because of the nested loop. Doesn't actually matter what calculations we are doing, the point of Big O is to analyze the number of operations that will run as it relates to the size of our input.
---
`for ($horde as $h) {`
---
  `for ($alliance as $a) {`
---
`//do level scaling`
---
`//do combat dmg`
---
  `}`

Sorry for the long wall, I just like this stuff

WoW introduced a new Expansion and Classic is out soon. Those two games will provide a lifetime worth of content. 
---
What did fortnite introduce? A bunch of paid DLC costumes, guns and a map or two?
---
I wonder if it would be viable to have a mixture of True and Expansion. Maybe something like:
---
1) Start on a freshly cycled Vanilla server.
---
2) After (x) amount of time the server refreshes which deletes all characters, progress, etc.
---
3) You are given the option to move that character to the next expansion, TBC. 
---
IDK, just an idea. It would be pretty hard to implement, but it would be cool, imo.
---
imagine having brains

Got my invite this morning

can it hit people you are not facing if you are pretty close?

It's a sure way to find someone wanting to get carried just like a scrub asking for 1500 RIO on retail.

Fake text anyway
---
Merge the last two. Don’t have separate realms, fragmenting community is bad. Also make changes to TBC and WOTLK to keep in vanilla mindset (no flying, LFG, etc)
---
It was always called VC back in my day. I know im in the minority but I shall continue to call it VC.
---
Also those fuckers were pretty tightly grouped. GL killing 15 of those without pulling more than 1, and then goodbye interrupts.
---
This detection is not even working on retail. So dont expect too much ;)
---
Wtf are you talking about, it's an exception to the common naming rules. You don't get to chose what the naming rules are. The people calling something a certain name do. If I decide to call it VQ for Van Queef and it catches it, it's now an exception to the rule. I usually called it DM, but a lot of people called it VC - definitely not "a select few." It became an exception. That's why this argument even exists. If someone said VC in chat, everyone who wasn't completely new knew exactly what they were referring to.

So the gripe is that streamers are more competent at forming guilds able to make concerted efforts at controlling economies. Well, looks like it's time for you to put in some elbow grease like streamers and unify an equally powerful force to counter their influence.

All I hear in this complaint is that streamers are bad because they are a unifying force. Go unify your own force to counter instead of complaining.

Unique Classic is the best of both worlds options.

1) we get classic.  2) we get new content.  3) 15 years from now everybody will be hyped for Classic Classic.

option 1 and 2 both end up in a world where classic is a dead game that anybody can play whenever they want but nobody wants to.

If you want a good example of great content that could be added without splitting player-base, then Kharazan would be a perfect place. It already has a place and could be a new raid/dungeon hybrid like it was in TBC.
---
Sorry to break the meme train but what would you consider them to be? I would say they definitely qualify to be considered an Entertainer, if you can consider a radio host or talk show host to me Entertainer than a streamer should be no different.
---
Lots and lots of drinking for ele shams. They were not efficient at all.
---
If it was in Vanilla, then that is fine. Just because something is a core component of retail now means that it should be added later.
---
The whole point to classic is to go back to vanilla.... Away from stuff that has been introduced in retail... Why would they start adding stuff from retail to a consumer base that doesn't want it?
---
Pretty much me the last week or so every evening - except im playing on a private server because I don't have mfing beta :|
---
So youre saying Wildgrowth Spaulders from majordomo in MC has a higher item level than say Ternary Mantle (probably not spelled right) from Bug Trio in AQ40? since Wildgrowth has more +healing?
---
On every (German) server i played on, it was called dd.
---
There was a reason they were called Huntards. 
---
Many great hunters existed at the time, but a huge chunk of them were young kids that thought it would be cool to have a pet, and they were just terrible.
---
&gt; Although like i said I'm pretty good with /who. All depends on how easy it is to figure out who is on what layer and how many friends you have made on the server.
---
That's just it, it is not easy to do that. There is literally no indicators except for maybe having that person standing next to you, not in a party, and not seeing them. So those friends will have to pretty much be with you all the time to confirm what layer they are on. 
---
&gt;But as a grown man yea if I coudln't get that to work I'd probably sub just to save myself the time. Paying an extra 100 dollars for multiple accounts to decrease my farm time by a factor of 20 would be so worth lol. I already leveled the fastest, why not? Cancel them after layering ends
---
As a grown man, that's a pretty insane thought and I doubt there are enough of you to really do any real damage to anyone else's experience. Especially again, because you will not be very effective. 
---
&gt; He will be able to make such an impressive bank it will carry him through the whole expansion for what amounts to a few days of play time. He would create a bank at a speed that is unimaginable in both the original live Vanilla and p servers.
---
This is an insanely gross exaggeration of how many layers there will  be. Are you suggesting there will be that many *entire* servers worth of population once you hit 60 with multiple characters?
---
&gt; The positive to sharding is if they shard the zone, if he's alone in it there isn't gonna be 4 instances of Ungoro to farm. And they will be opening and closing much more quickly cuz it's based on zone not server pop. Much harder to control timers and map out
---
But sharding can continue to pop up for long after a crazy launch day, because people can congregate in zones all the time. If you want to spin up shards for your guild to farm, you just gotta bring your crazy little zerg guild to one zone and reap the benefits. It's a hell of a lot harder to constantly create a server's worth of people in order to generate a layer.
---
&gt;I'm gonna be able to farm lotus then just phase out if i'm outta combat if an enemy faction catch me. What kinda gameplay is that? lol
---
That's a problem on live because of A) Sharding is cross-server thus you have access to way more shards B) LFG interface makes joining a group  on another shard way faster and more reliable by 1000% of what it would be like to whisper someone who is actually on a different layer and get an invite to a new layer within the span of an actual gank.
---
But seriously, if you are gonna
---
A) Multi-box
---
B) Rush to these places before anyone else apparently
---
C) Spam *everyone* on your friends list for group invites every time you want to swap layers, than *hope* you end up on one of the few that are actually spun up (and honestly, how many people will want to be friend with that guy).
---
You go on ahead. I don't think anyone will care about the lone nutjob willing to go to extremes to marginally increase his farming potential.
---
Oh hey gurl.
---
Lmao you're an idiot
---
Dude, spinach is miserable in prep. I have one of those huge organic containers of it in my fridge at all times and prefer it fresh. Mainly make salads with it or cook with it but never freeze it, it's gets mushy and bland that way
---
I mean, calling it VC is objectively incorrect. There quite literally isn't a V or a C anywhere in 'Deadmines'.
---
Looks good but I can't get over how bad this much contrast is for your eyes
---
Is it random? Could imagine they chose accounts on different factors
---
For anyone with an alliance background, especially if u were NA in vanilla, it was always VC. People didn't say lfg DM if they meant deadmines, even more so after Dire Maul was released.
---
I'm sure there are variations.  I admit, yours flows better.
---
On a different note, the Xbox 360 is so bad it makes you turn 360 degrees and walk away.
---
We're in control of this one and have the power to make it logical though, so smart newbies can easily pick it up. I don't see the benefit to not doing that.
---
It's a minority who call it VC, I've literally never seen someone do a straw poll on what it's called and see VC get close to half of the votes let alone win. There's 2 groups of people. A majority, who is calling it DM which follows the rule of thumb for dungeon abbreviations, and the minority, who call it VC because they called it that when they started and never switched
---
Happy Cake Day u/Catm4n ! WOOOOOOO!!!!!!
---
What is the OSRS route? (I do know OSRS = Old Skool RuneScape)
---
Can comfirm Firetree was VC
---
Also -- id like to know when this poll was conducted.
---
EU peak time?  I learned that in the UK it was called DM by a majority, and I remember calling it VC when I played (as a US player).
---
That being said I know not all US players said ot that way, but my admittedly shaky memory would have me believe most of them did.
---
I love how everybody is trying so hard to come up with logical reasoning and proof as to why it "is" or "should be called DM or VC. Who the fuck cares? 
---
When it comes down to it, it was originally called DM. When Dire Maul came out, a lot of people and a lot of servers began calling it VC to distinguish between the two. At the same time, a lot of people and a lot of servers simply started indicating which part of Dire Maul (or the full thing) they were interested in. 
---
How are you all so stupid that you don't realize both existed and are fine? I fucking guarantee that 80% of you tards shouldn't even have a say in the conversation. 
---
I played on Gul'dan. I started in December of 2005. Nobody ever referred to Deadmines as DM. It was VC. That's just the way it was.
---
No arenas in classic wow...but yeah you can be good at all three, warlocks have kind of a slow start but scale insanely good. You can just spec 30/0/21 and never respec. That spec is good for both PVE and PvP
---
Played mage since 2007. I don't think it takes as much skill as other classes. CC and mobility gods especially in vanilla. If you are competent with those two tools you can kill most people easily.
---
You'll be able to play until the 23rd on the server after the stress test concludes.
---
There's an area message that says "sunken temple" when you walk into the dungeon, so I don't think you're right here.
---
If Classic WoW will be profitable everything is possible.
---
Actual god tier
---
Time to do the dishes and stuff
---
Squatty Potty BiS.
---
I just got mine
---
What an aspie post. Thanks for chiming in.
---
there are no BFA fan boys lol 
---
even the folks playing aren't psyched about it
---
Hmm I was Ally on Arthas and called it DM as well as people I played with. But I was a NE so maybe thats why
---
&gt; Stupid enough to get a creditcard
---
lolwut
---
Credit cards are a fantastic way to save money and manage cash flow.  Having one or more CCs and paying them off each month 100% of the time is smart.
---
They released the server as it was during 2007 and now it’s basically twice as big with years and years of tweaks that made it into a bigger success than its initial game and is one of the most active mmorpgs and communities in gaming.
---
Thanks! I thought about a 4th option which is basically just following the retail formula, where they would continue without keeping backups for a classic server, but that idea felt too unpopular for anyone.
---
First off, thank you for making this guide. It's very clear and concise. As a third party I would actually like to see a video showing this comparison as well if you are gauging interest. I feel a lot of the guides are more speculative and it would be cool to see a comparison from someone actually in beta. 
---
Keep up the good work man
---
Wtf so true
---
not sure about whether or not it was DM before dire maul, but BronzeBeard swore by VC, even ridiculing DM sayers
---
Hey! Just wanted to say that we got invited to the beta!! Only the stress testing though, so we're still hoping for an invitation to the actual beta
---
Okay so my example of a quest where in the quest text it refers to it as Deadmines doesn't work because "A single quest that likely wouldn't be your introduction to the dungeon." but now you're using the descriptive text in one other quest and all of the sudden it's a valid argument? All you're doing is proving my underlying point which is that calling it VC is straight up wrong and the only reason people call it that over DM is because you're too stubborn to change.
---
“Wow, they finally added a confirmation screen before you gquit now” this use to get so many people 😂😂
---
I played on shadowsong alliance at launch, and it was called DM by everyone that I ever knew or spoke with, or saw LFG in general
---
Not the best levelers, not the best gold farmers. Hunters take both of these.
---
I got a rock...
---
Horde did not suicide into him i guess? :D
---
Probably a result from when blizzard changed the xp-requirement for levels, was it cata? I don't remember.
---
You bring up a very valid point about hardware. 
---
I have a buddy who tells a story about how he’s computer was so bad, he would DC and fall into the ocean every time he got on a boat. He had to go to his friends house down the street and use his computer to change continents. 
---
We had a core raider who’s internet and computer were so bad that on the Thaddious fight in Naxx he had to play his mage alt and fire all the boss from the platform because he couldn’t do the polarity change.
---
“Rouge has pickpocketed you for 5s 25c Tee hee he!”
---
*Rogue misspelling was intentional, since most rogues can’t spell the class correctly!*
---
Got so many people back in the day...
---
Except in the place where it says what region the quest belongs in, it says deadmines.
---
I’ve been struggling to pick a class. There are a few things I like. 
---
I like classes which has some cool utility. For example mages having free potions and portals or shamans with their totems. I don’t really like just full on healing, just a DPS class with some neat little quirky utility spells. 
---
I also like cute little summons. Engineering profession battle chicken and robot dragonling for example sounds pretty cool. Then you have hunters and warlocks, with hunters being more desirable to me since you go out in the field to tame pets. I’m unsure if I can get a variety of pets and swap them out or if it’s just one at a time. 
---
Examples of classes I played in FFXIV are machinist and astrologian if you know anything about those jobs. 
---
Anyways I’m going to try some classes out in wow trial as I’ve never really played wow. Just wanting to know if anyone knows of classes with cool utility and maybe some summons and pets which I can get out in the field.
---
I'm assuming you have to be subscribed to get into any WoW betas, correct?
---
oh, i had a funny comment about some rage kiddy ranting about 'shit streamers', gotta attack me? what kind of insult is that? youre pathetic bro &lt;3
---
They're free entertainment. If you pay streamers anything you are pathetic lol.

I could've saved you some time bro.

So, you wont have the stuff to aoe farm until 50ish when you fill prot and get consecrate. I know a guy who leveled a paladin after the change, and he  aoe prot farmed 50-60, said it was fine. That said it's a long haul there, are you sure you don't want to just drop 1 point in seal of command before you go into holy or prot?
---
Still waiting here, CS stated that if you received the email you should be seeing it appear in your launcher. They are not sure when however.
---
The straw poll posted earlier had like 25% calling it VC. My point is completely flying over your head. 25% is not a vast minority. If 25% of the entire goddamn population decided to start calling Molten Core "The Hot Hot Zone" and it got to the point where people instantly recognized what was being mentioned, that's now an alternate naming convention. It's how words work. It's why Google is now a word in the official dictionary. You seem to be confused on how language works.
---
How do the top warriors have two 2-h weapons equipped?
---
Yeah, somewhere I have pictures of my son asleep in a bouncer on my desk next to me as I played WoW at release. Babies sleep a LOT. Plenty of good gaming time.
---
Also pictures of the kid a little bit older sitting on my lap and smashing my keyboard and getting me killed. LOL.
---
That arcane explosion sound will be triggering for Alliance in years to come
---
she was fan service in wc3 tho.  big tiddy midriff goth gf
---
Even before the classic announcement, I've always been legitimately impressed by the long lasting popularity of WoW on Twitch.
---
oh yes thank you for this!
---
I've played it, it's a shitty game with boring gameplay. I still don't understand how its popular, I give it 6-12 more months before it's dead. Classic will still be here though.
---
And what's wrong with that? If they understand what it is there is no problem. If both societies are aware of *both* meanings then there is particularly no problem.
---
Also, I get England is probably a fun one to pick on because of Brexit, but the french use the same word for "wheat" to refer to "corn."
---
While leveling a warrior this beta test i swear i got the same feeling of excitement looting a grey 2h axe that did like 5+ more damage than my starting area axe.
---
When is this happening? Can anyone get in? Do i need an active sub?
---
btw, no wedding on wcm. am a premium member. cant find yt channel. please link it if it exists
---
Thanks for the reply. Didn’t know there was no arena lol, that’s too bad. What do you mean by slow start and scaling? They’re pretty gear dependent in both pvp and pve?
---
this and "WoW was the first MMO" has made many a shitfest of a game quite enjoyable.
---
They've already confirmed you will be able to buy gold, weapons, and armor on launch
---
But I don't wanna kill Cookie...
---
Gamma is waaaaaaaay off on those left two monitors
---
&gt;I'm guessing he wanted to add multiple debuffs for the paladin to cleanse through, to force the blessing of freedom.
---
This is probably correct.
---
I really wish respec costs weren’t so high right now, but I’ll be leveling again to practice routes and I’ll get the clips from that to show exactly what I mean.
---
It's also gnomer. Always felt I had a more difficult time there for some reason, especially with the alarmo-bots.
---
EU or na?
---
But an uncontrolled environment is more realistic and immersive. There should be a spontaneous aspect to rp and if you go into a dangerous zone you should pack armor and weapons. That makes sense from both a gameplay as well as rp perspective.
---
No problem friend, gl on beta
---
You're right. Being able to play a stress test is definitely more important than any relationship with another human.....
---
WoW has its ups and downs as a streamed game. It doesn't really prove a point.
---
I can appreciate the idea behind the post, but yeah.
---
Expansions because it's super easy to implement(far easier than classic on its own, and having classic already means a lot of the work is already done),  and TBC, wrath fuck it even cata fans deserve to have their game recreated just as much as us vanilla fans do.
---
arcane intellect is useless on a rogue
---
The problem with Hunters is, they don't really scale well in the later raids. But still, if you're not a hardcore raider, Hunter is more than fine, keep in mind you're still an actual DPS class and not some meme spec. 
---
About that hard to master thing, the thing is it's basically one of the hardest classes play in terms of mechanics, yet even if you play it perfectly some classes will always outperform you.
---
However as I said, it's more than fine for some casual PvE. Also the best solo class, hands down. For farming stuff, you have pets to care about.
---
And in PvP of course they're one of the best classes. I'm still not decided if I'll go hunter or lock.
---
Nah, its more country specific here.
---
German players e.g. majorily use DD. Even in teamspeak(or similar) they are called "DehDehs"
---
I mean, personally it also makes more sense for me. Im looking for two Damage Dealers with damage as priority that do DPS. Im not looking for dps, which can be done by heal and tank too, but the person that does dps as its primary goal.
---
But I dont care that much.
---
Orc/human are the best pic for warrior and troll is the best for mage
---
You think a game that has hit a 10 million concurrent player count is going to be "dead" in 6-12 months? You sound like the kind of people that said WoW would die 10 years ago.
---
Warriors will be strong with a decent weapon.  For PvP Arcanite Reaper will give warriors a HUGE advantage over other classes until the other classes have raid gear/weapons.
---
TBC release is when I got into WOW and in my opinion that and LK was when the game was at its peak. Would love for it to go back to that era. Though I’m pretty excited about classic.... I do not have any experience in it.
---
"*My grandma died, again, and the funeral will be a week-long event out of state*"   
---
No shit, I was told this by an employee a few years ago.  The "again" remark was legit.. her maternal grandmother died the week prior.
---
I'd like to see Classic eventually (after majority of the raiding population has Naxx on farm and the drought starts to set in), of getting unique Classic-oriented content developed for it, in addition to new/refreshed Classic servers so people can start from level 1 again, as well as branched BC/Wrath servers that don't overwrite the previous versions.
---
Basically a mix of all 3 to suit whomever's taste.
---
Unique is the only way
---
“You have no idea what you're talking about...Clearly”
---
The irony is palpable
---
not all PvPers either, evidently.
---
It just depends what you want to do. Do you want to raid? If you want to be the best healer, go priest. If you want to be a healer and horde, but don't want to be the best, go shaman. If you don't want to heal, don't roll anything that can heal.
---
its really not.
---
Let's say it's early vanilla and you've just done VC and want to run it again because it was fun so you decide to make a group for it. You know it's called Deadmines but you're also aware you only found that out after running it, so anyone who hasn't done it wouldn't know that. Do you a) say LFM DM and not get any whispers from people wanting to kill VC and not help your fellow players progress which is a pretty rude move. Or b) realize most people around you think it's VC and say LFM VC which will be understood by both people who have and haven't done the dungeon and helps your fellow players who need to kill VC?
---
This is how terms get cemented and important to remember that in early vanilla, everyone was a newbie. Also I already know your answer to the question is a.
---
I am going to NoLife so hard.
---
Though I've pretty much only ever mained horde, my favorite by far has to be Teldrassil for the absolutely stunning visuals and relaxing music with Elwynn Forest coming in a (semi distant) second due to it being the most traditional high fantasy setting in all of classic, which is what really got the game to resonate with me
---
Awesome! Think you'll make a video on routes as well?
---
You get a cat form at lvl 20 and it's a game changer
---
I'd say overall it was most like WC with Alliance not having a true equivalent to RFC.
---
I'm hoping to find a running of the bulls. Lets find out just how many cows it takes to break this thing.
---
your mother!!
---
Classic with fresh servers for those who want to start anew. Reseting servers is bad idea, don't make people feel like they have a time limit. Community split also prevents multiple versions from happening. 
---
Classic+ also brings problems where many are left behind. I mean find one thread where there are like 3 people that agree on promoted changes first, then make your mind.
---
Here is the OSRS, success or not, people want "true" classic even there. They get shot down the same way  we used to be back then. Wall of no... These people will become way more over time, its inevitable.
---

---
I mean when you have Classic which is desired and also TBC + WotlK, how many franken-games can you make before it all collapse's on itself? Reading these threads for 2 years now and EVERYONE wants their version on Classic, TBC or Wotlk. I mean, c'mon...
---
Wishful thinking is fine, but we aren't talking about WoW vs WoW 2 here. People are split between Classic, TBC and WoTLK. Maybe draw a line somewhere and realize that you can't make everyone happy.
---
I wish blizzard will finally come and end this Classic+ once and for all, no matter what the decision is. It's annoying, it breeds toxicity and constant drama in every single board.
---
Classic should be vanilla and dats it... No point in going further....
---
This hits home.  
---
Many of us rectified our original stupidity with alts, but I remember fighting with a friend I was questing with over a green dagger that had like +1 strength to it. 
---
My Warlock HAD to have it as it was a huge upgrade. 
---
I ended up stabbing my way to glory in Westfall while my friend who was running around with a mage was jealous of my stabbing power. We were both idiots.
---
"Here"
---
I'm from the UK mate.
---
One is a man and one is a boy.
---
True true, but we can't really draw the line on reaching lvl 60 as the point where someone is "actually playing the game" and not just surfing around.
---
I was actually considering it when it releases. I'm not sure if I will have the time to manage a guild, though. I can set up a raid schedule, no problem.. but the rest - I'll have to "hire" officers. Lol
---
Is undead mage not good for PvP?
---
My understanding is the stress test is only 2 or 3 hours, but the beta is down for 24 hours
---
And chances are you accidentally pulled at least 3 of them.
---
The reason it's called VC is exactly the reason you stated. It's the very first dungeon that anyone outside of Blizzard had played.
---
When the vanilla beta first started (not Classic, the actual original vanilla beta) the level cap was 30 much like in the current Classic beta. On top of that, the first phase of the beta only had three races available to test: Humans, Dwarves, and Gnomes. That phase of the beta was called the "tri-alliance push".
---
Since it was only the Azeroth Alliance races and it was only up to level 30, there were only two dungeons to test out: Deadmines and Stockades. When people got the quest to go kill Van Cleef, it didn't specify that it was the Deadmines dungeon, it was just "go get Van Cleef's head". So people would make a group to kill Van Cleef. Thus, "LFG VC" was born.
---
(The reason Stockades wasn't similarly abbreviated to "TtD" was because most people didn't realize that Targorr the Dread was the final boss because it could be completed in any order of bosses, and the term "Stockades" doesn't really lend itself well to being further abbreviated... to anything besides "Stocks" anyway.)
---
When the game was further fleshed out and more dungeons were added, they started going by the initials of the dungeon. But by that point, VC as the abbreviation for Deadmines had stuck.
---
Did my best to word it so your dumb ass can understand it. Also, no problem. :)
---
It's not even that it's the quest for his head.
---
You spend a chain of quests working your way up the Defias Brotherhood hierarchy from killing low level thugs and then running from Westfall to Red Ridge to Stormwind to Westfall all over the damned place trying to figure out who these people are that are terrorizing the kingdom of Stormwind.
---
After investigations and checking with spies and all this hoopla you finally figure it out that Edwin VanCleef was at the heart of it, angry for being shortchanged by the King after rebuilding Stormwind City post Warcraft I (as leader of the Stonemasons).
---
[Then you're told to kill him.  Not in which instance... just kill him and bring back the head.](https://classic.wowhead.com/quest=166/the-defias-brotherhood)
---
So from the perspective of a new player with no database websites to work off of, or instance names... you're looking for a group of people to kill VanCleef.
---
Don’t think they’ll ever do this but I’d love it if they did.
---
A lot of gameplay aspects don't make sense in roleplay, both PvP and PvE.
---
Mages have teleport and portals
---
Doesn't matter now, Dire Maul exists, even if not at release we know it exists, it gets to have the main DM abbreviation. Dead Mines gets to be VC because of the quest alliance get and because it is not as important a dungeon in the grand scheme of Classic content.  
---
Only retarded Alliance call Dead Mines DM, the superior master races of the Horde pity anyone retarded enough to call it that. :P
---
Either case it is not objective, it is subjective depending on how you view the game. You can call it whatever you like but some abbreviations will lead to confusion more often.  If you are intelligent enough you realize that a convention/consensus of what the two should be called needs to be made.
---
For actual Vanilla players(esp. Horde side) Dire Maul = DM. This makes VC a good substitute for a direct abbreviation for Dead Mines and leads to less confusion with fewer questions asked by players interested in running one of those two instances.
---
In the new era of Classic perhaps the 'tards will win and then the convention will be DM = Dead Mines, and then DM:X = Dire Maul with X=(N)orth/(S)outh/(T)ribute.
---
I am fine with the last idea I gave, but to avoid confusion we either need to keep it DM and VC or go to the DM and DM:X.
---
Pirate Cave

Got mine last night at 7 but didn't show up in the client until today
---
Well, it depends. Mage hard counters warrior and rogue, because of the slow effect on frostbolt. Classes with healing probably counter mages, as the damage frostbolt puts out costs way more mana than healing it. (So priests and shammys might counter mages) Druids will probably either be a middle ground pick, or they are just going to oom so fast they are worthless. Warlocks decently kill melee classes, as they can just kite and have their pet destroy the melees, and maybe even mages because of knockback. Although, rogues do get stealth around level 4 I think, so if they stealthed up to a warlock they might be able to get the kill. Hunters are also probably going to be a heavy damage dealer, but get outclassed by melee because they can't kite. They'll be a vulnerable support unit, as in melee they do like no damage. Just my thoughts on the meta.
---
Holy cow. I got a few ranks on my mage doing AV back when it sometimes took 12 hours to finish one.
---
I love that command, I can summon campfires and roleplay!
---
I'm not confused at all I know what you're trying to say. I'm an English major I know what you're talking about. And you can call it Hot Hot Zone or whatever the fuck you want sure and if 1 out of every 10 person calls it that then I won't be confused. That isn't my argument at all. The overlying discussion is "What's the correct abbreviation DM or VC" then the answer is DM. You can call it VC all you want just like you can call it Hot Hot Zone all you want. But it's not the Hot Hot Zone it's Molten Core. And it's not VC it's DM.
---
I renewed my game time just to try to get it. Last time I played wow was in the start of legion and I got mine today, 5 days later. I don't even have BFA.
---
And free water
---
Go with a class that can tank if those are the classes your friends are playing. Warrior or druid. Otherwise any time you want to do a dungeon you'll be stuck looking for a tank. (Shamans can't btw)
---
I’d say do them all. Let there be some pure untouched servers. Have some for the osrs style and let there be some of the other favorite expansions (first 3 mostly)
---
Dictating someone else's use of their money that they earned is far more pathetic then someone spending money on something they enjoy, regardless of whether it's a smart idea or not. You probably don't tip at restaurants either
---
Protection paladins have two problems that keep them from being viable raid tanks
---
1) once they run out of mana, they have no threat, so they fall apart on long boss pulls
---
2) no taunt button
---
Druid can tank a lot of stuff, and what it cant tank it can heal, so they are another option for you.
---
This is just a pole of the coming ratio of horde to alliance. Horde generally calls it DM. Alliance need the distinction more because they use it so much.
---

Get the right weapon, aka, something slow AF, and it's a bloodbath.

On the topic of MMO mouses, if you are new to them this is a good way to set up your UI/action bar with bartender/bongos or similar wow add-ons : https://i.ibb.co/J3Qkp8d/Screenshot-20190522-163237.png
---
This helped me many years ago. Hope it's useful to you looking into making the switch
---
Warlock is so fun and is the best class fantasy execution in rpgs
---
Don't tell anyone. I like ripping on people for missing it.
---
That's the argument I make for RP-PvP, but I'm playing devil's advocate to put forth the RP-PvE viewpoint.
---
Yep, you’re correct, just one instant blast of damage in a V shape and that’s it.
---
Can confirm this, I maxed fishing on my early vanilla druid after to take advantage of the amazing fishing skill counting as your weapon skill while in feral - so I had 380 something (With a lure) / 180 or 190 weapon skill, giving me like 60%+ crit chance lol. Too bad that bug is from a much earlier version so we can't do that sillyness

This whole comment chain makes me feel like ive had a stroke

Whenever we had a healer repeatedly having lots of mana left over and rarely refilling midfight, it usually meant we had one too many healers and took fewer next time. Don't know how common it was, but we split our healers in half and had half casting and half regenerating mana all fight long. So it wasn't uncommon to see 3-4 healers nearly full on mana at the end.
---
"When did they update the /camp animation?"
---
What makes you think that? Not everyone wanting classic is a streamer slave. Get off your high horse dude.
---
I’ve previously played Priest (WotLK and again in BFA) fairly heavily and I’m leaning that way now. However, it’s been a lot of Shadow in the past and I don’t want to feel forced into just one spec for classic (seeing a lot of Holy or bust type posts about Priest).
---
My primary goals are going to be fun leveling experience, dungeons, wPVP, BGs, and then raids in that order.
---
Some additional thoughts: I usually prefer a ranged class but am open to other play styles. Most likely will be going Alliance due to friends. I’ve worn robes through most all my WoW play time and I’m a little over wearing robes but this doesn’t make or break it for me...
---
This post is crummy
---
steht bei Dir auch, dass der Server um 8 Uhr offline geht?
---
Yeah because they’re selling the gold themselves...
---
Troll is technically best PVE caster race for horde because of the berserking racial (faster cast time based on health percentage) but Undead is a fine choice for PVP.
---
Edit
---
Don't worry about a raid spot as warrior. They do amazing dps if you aren't tanking and guilds load up on them. Your little friend comp doesn't really need two healers, you have a priest, and you'll be healing in the end as the shaman if you pick that.
---
Druids have an incredible amount of options in WPVP and have a lot of good matchups
---
you ok?
---
Better than your sorry streams
---
The chance of the average doing underground assault before Defias Brotherhood and Red Silk Bandanas is incredibly low.
---
Real talk, since I got bit by the WoW bug again, I've barely touched Fortnite.  
---
I still think its a great game and they're doing some awesome events (Avengers, John Wick).  But I NEED MY WOW SODFHSADIOFIOSDF!!11!!1one
---
And yet people want true vanilla. They get the same "wall of no" we used to get. But i guess since they are still minority we can ignore them. We will see how many years that will last. Growing doesn't indicate it will work for WoW. WoTLK was the peak of WoW, yet that SAME expansion, midway through was the reason the decline started.
---
I just love how you just ignore everyone that isn't compatible with the "majority". But i guess that's how Mob Rule works in OSRS. We will see how many people will want actually "vanilla" few years into the future.
---
The commercials are incredible, this is a time capsule in so many ways.
---
I didn't get in either man =( my account is from wotlk and has been subbed on and off through all expansions. Been subbed for most of BFA
---
What I find even more odd is that you need 1! xp for 72.
---
This sub has been saltier than nba game threads
---
i dowloaded the stess-test client already 8 hours ago and got email around 2hours ago so .. (and i dont have regular beta)
---
Thanks for your considered and valuable input.
---
For me, I would always start as a Mage. You start with a decent class, you can teleport and make your own food. It makes sense because its efficient to get around etc. Level quick and farm herbs and ores on the way to sell to fund alts. However, I'm considering a change of pace and starting with a Warlock this time round. Free mount, cool class with utility. I'm just not sure....
---
If i dont get any enjoyment out of testing i should get paid
---
Population density has nothing to do with this.
---
Yes. If you treat the game as a near full time
---
job at 30 hours a week, I would imagine you will get all you desire. 
---
You’ll have to position yourself in a seat of leadership in a guild if you want the legendary staff, since in my experience the legendaries seemed to find their way to GMs and their officers versus the regular chaff. 
---
Considering how much time you can invest, it sounds like you could run that guild and get what you want.
---
Warlock is also very needed, mages are very high in population so there are already plenty of them, as a warlock you will be wanted/needed for healthstones and summons and some curses. I'm a mage, just saying the benefits of warlocks and the pop size.
---
I know people worry about the expansion idea because it divides an already possibly small community, but if FFXI can stay going...
---
I will still always refer to it as VC. Everyone will know what I mean, especially after all this debate.
---
I like Corsair as a company. I have a Corsair PC case, power supply, water cooler heatsink and mousepad. They are also very reliable. Never used that mouse though. If it's anything like their other products it's probably gonna be great
---
we bake our own cookies
---
Again you've clearly never controlled the resources in a game like this.
---
People will do it....And at a high level it will fuck up the game
---
jesus christ, seek some professional help, actual brainlet right here.
---
Yeah. I’m going to mainly focus on the 1-20 ish for routes. Really trying to get ahead of the curve ^_^
---
I'm good, k1rage. I'm excited for the stress test tonight. How are you?
---
Be sure to check it out on Ven's YouTube too!
---
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_ADR4HF79M
---
Unique classic, alternate timeline, would be amazing.
---
Mages could pull shit like this off in tbc, wotlk, and cata as well.
---
i have fake beta can i join? god damn stress test getting my hopes up
---
also look sick every tier
---
I'll throw in a couple things since you say you're new.
---
Warlocks have a lot of debuffs, and enemy mobs have a debuff limit. Your debuffs will be pushed off the boss if too many debuffs pop up. In a 40 man raid it becomes extremely difficult to keep your debuffs up. This leads to min/maxing that can be interrupted by your allies, and this class is pretty much the only class that can have your min/maxing affected by someone else.
---
Soul Shards are so critical that most people have a specific bag with larger than normal limit that holds exclusively soul shards. The problem with this is that you end up with less bag space. Soul shards can only be gained by getting the killing blow with your soul drain, or it can be like 5 seconds after using destruction talent Shadow Burn (which I think is a large reason why most people like Destruction.) It may not sound like that big of a deal, but in a long dungeon you may struggle to reclaim any soul shards because everyone will be burning a low hp target down.
---
If you're not a human and you're coming to SW at at least 15 than you will see Underground Assault as you get into SW. That is not incredibly low
---
Oakenscowl is harder
---
"they don't require fancy foot work" Fuckin had me rolling

Then why'd you volunteer to do it for free?

---
Congrats man!  From one dad to another, if you can get the wee one to sleep on your chest and still be at your PC, you're golden!
---
It’s okay friend, I didn’t get mine either.
---
Same, why has the stress test gotta start at midnight gmt, really want to see it live! Midnight!
---
Pick a cloth class, they are the least gear dependent.
---
I feel you! I have twins due a month after the release of classic. The first time around, I certainly wasn’t thinking about kids in my 14 year old brain.
---
“Quit having fun” I love it
---
Hi, /u/OhSix
---
I would LOVE Unique Classic if we can see them add horizontal content that doesn't take away or rebalance things.  
---
For instance, content I'd like to see finished / added
---
Cat form quest
---
Proper Air totem quest
---
Azshara completed and filled
---
Hyjal completed
---
That's fine but we're 15 years away from that. We know it's called Deadmines now. The correct way of abbreviating Deadmines is DM. If you want to call it VC with your group than fine but people claim that DM is wrong and VC is right and that's false.
---
they don't have a reliable means of hitting with spells until a couple phases into the game.  Mages have a talent that gives them spell hit, but locks only source comes via gear, and that gear doesn't get introduced until ZG at the earliest.
---
You sound like a jealous virgin yourself man. I would NOT reccommend you to keep getting emotionally attached to people on reddit. 
---
Venruki, you reading this? I defended your virgin honor, and have subtly insulted a random idiot on reddit, who is now blocked because he tires me as much as he amuses me! :D
---
That deflection though, Oof.
---
Looks like a dope mouse. I might grab one when my piece of crap Razer Trinity inevitably dies on me lol
---
I'm board at work personally, you just seemed wound up over nothing so I was just checking in, enjoy the stress test
---
And it looks way cooler than blasted lands. Stupid Medivh. Can't wait to take his staff.
---
This clown got an invite and only started playing in 2017? 
---
Yikes. I'm actually embarrassed for you and blizzard.
---
I noticed that also, Im to scared to move incase i discover a new location and ding :P
---
Came into this thread expecting to see people that never used Eagle Eye, Far Sight, etc. and wasnt disappointed.
---
I dislike how people take minmaxing into classic. Back in the days you just played what you liked most. I played a human mage, because my 12year old me thought the rest was not cool. I would love to go back to that time without having to think about minmaxing my race/class..
---
I would say.. just try them both on private server or beta if you get acces and decide yourself.
---
So: 15015015#5 then :)
---
Play whatever character you know best. I’ll be playing a NE rogue because that was my main back in the day. Best way to see if there’s a bug is if you play what you know. I will not be rolling NE rogue this time around but I’ll play it for the stress test. Probably still roll  rogue though.
---
Yea... servers for everyone's twisted version of WoW. I heard atleast 50 million people will play this. No chance of splitting the community too much, and no chance of our favorite sharding/realm imbalance returning.
---
WeirdChamp
---
Very cool. Although you slipped in the name of "Private Server 2" near the bottom (not that it was much of a mystery).
---
Arcane facking explosion
---
No, Wild Growth Spaulders have a lower item level (71 vs 75). Ternary Mantle just blows more of its stat pool on intellect, spirit and stamina. Neither item probably puts any more points into armor than is absolutely necessary (necessary according to whatever guidelines Blizzard had when designing items).
---
This is one of those things where it literally cannot be helped.
---
The stress test wont have a meta you daft bastard it will be a thousand people running around doing random shit.
---
Just click on play in the launcher and it will autoconnect you? :D
---
Don’t. Play a warrior instead !
---
Legit, stuff like the "are you sure you want to leave your guild?" pop up from modern WoW should be back ported to Classic. I know you guys love memes and what not, but there's legitimately no reason to leave bad UI stuff like this that has basically zero effect on gameplay in just for a silly joke like this.
---
Sorry to be a spoilsport, I'm just a fan of good UI patterns.
---
You are right! I also love this topic so I appreciate the long answer. Assuming the calculations don’t run any loops they’d be O(2N) which is a subset of O(N), since it’d 2 calculations per player, correct?
---
Loved your second example by the way!
---
I did this back in classic days. Playing is okay, but raiding not so much.
---
Yes sorry for not expressing myself correctly. I just meant the client has to interface with it and needs to be changed constantly. Anyway.
---
As far as I know the behind the scenes stuff was all updated to match BFA in the beta client. If it's sufficiently isolated they could probably maintain both clients without having to make changes to them individually.
---
Doing mc and rerolling the boss loot 5 times is great content
---
This dumbass is in the beta?
---
I know all the spots.
---
Tbh I will absolutely have a stream open while chilling and leveling when Classic releases ^^
---
I used to do it with tv shows and youtube videos and it was sooo relaxing
---
The downside is how many specs were a complete joke. Imo, vanilla mage stands out a lot in terms of great design. But then there's druid, hunter and paladin..
---
I quit WoW after vanilla. Did TBC and WotLK feel better in terms of class design and talent tree balance?
---
Oh shit, you're right. But even that doesn't completely cover it because there are other quests that show up under "The Deadmines" that don't require entering the instance itself.
---
A lot of you probably remember that before Bnet came around you would login using an account name not an email. I thought I would put this out as an fyi to remove some stress from the stress test via people not being able to log in.
---
[Reminds me of this Golden Oldie](https://i1.wp.com/www.geeksaresexy.net/wp-content/uploads/2009/03/abprog1.jpg?w=640)
---
Wasn’t aware of the american way. But this guy cleared it up already.
---
I just call it DeadMines, some people are too stupid to /who your name and see that you are level 19 and not in fact trying to find more people for Dire Maul
---
$$$$ tho
---
Ok, that's fair. I didn't mean it that way, but I'm not going to tell you how you feel is wrong. Thanks for your honest answer.
---
If they're going out this week again I'd assume Friday the earlier yeah, but probably nothing. Last week was majority NA, this week was 2 days of EU people. Who even knows at this point, Monday looks likely.
---
That was my problem. I would love to start one but to manage would be nightmarish
---
Priests are better healers. Shamans are less mana efficient and keeping totems going is a pain.
---
Oh okay
---
Honestly I think the more likely result is a mix between 1 &amp; 3. I think they'll release other expansions (BC &amp; WOTLK) and allow players to choose if they transfer from vanilla on to those realms.
---
I also think at a similar time they will open "fresh" vanilla realms to allow players to start over.
---
Downvote. Over this format.
---
They are not being used improperly, its just a terrible system that encourages dickish behavior.  As each new expansion comes out it only reaffirms how pointless realms and guilds are.
---
Then a lvl ''skull'' mob runs in and wipes the entire server Pog.
---
try a warlock
---
I also feel like I should stop saying it is the "Legion client" and more specifically say that it was created originally with the Legion client. 
---
Though again, I thin it is more complicated to push identical updates to two different clients. And if those updates are in fact identical, despite being for two different games with two different sets of rules (like if you can create cross-faction alts on PvP servers) than you are looking at more things you have to run through QA as opposed to treating them separately.
---
Duplicate characters to a new set of realms for TBC, and eventually WOTLK (with tweaks) while keeping old realms open. This way if you want to stay on classic forever or hop back and forth, you can. You can also experience TBC and WOTLK without risking losing your “Classic” progress. 
---
However, for TBC and WOTLK, they should implement a player voting poll system (like OSRS) for those expansions to include players feedback (except hide the poll results LULJAMFLEX). Players can vote to “throw-out” features that killed or ruined the game (such as flying for instance, personally, I think flying at 60% max would be fine) and vote to about major additions to the game as well.
---
I could make a mirror post of yours in response to your post. Lol!
---
Take up residence in Tiragarde Keep.
---
Agreed. Knowing I'm going to lose everything would make me not even try. The whole point (for me, anyway) is that I could take my time and NOT do a mad dash to the finish line.
---
If they made a few servers like that for those who want it, I'm fine with that.
---
Ah yeah good idea. I have tendinitis in my left wrist, so its actually most of the keyboard movements that start hurting, especially repetitively stretching for some keys. I haven't really played many MMOS since Vanilla/BC WoW except ESO (which I had to stop playing for the same reason, as that game is very keyboard side intensive), so I haven't needed one of those mice. But getting that razor mouse with like 12 buttons might be good way to relieve some stress on my keyboard hand. Good idea.
---

I knew I loved this episode but this video contains so much time capsule content from 2005 that I can't believe I was able to find it.
---
Scorch's short cast time makes it better for mobility and less likely to get interrupted.
---
Ja aber ich denke da ist was falsch übersetzt worden mit der Uhrzeit.
---
&gt; There wasn't any e-mail, just an ambiguous option of "beta &amp; stress test" in the battle.net launcher. It's not hard to understand that it comes across as teasing.
---
There was an email that explained exactly what you were invited to. The client would just pop up on your battle.net launch first.
---
i got it on my warrior back in the day before normalized weapon attacks... lets just say leveling untill i got my whirlwind axe wasn't that bad.

Still a damn impressive video, just wish it was something other than the forever kiting class vs those 2 slow as shit melee classes. Again not that it wasn't cool, it'd just be cooler if it wasn't totally expected
---
surely layer is not as bad as you purport it to be
---
Well for not "nearly enough" there sure are like 15 threads a day. Just wait till launch and tourists start pouring with their "ideas that won't change the game too much". You know very well the immense drama and crying will happen. I hope you are right.
---
&gt; Just joining a large leveling guild would easily solve this problem for you. And again paying would be worth it so people would jump at teh chance.
---
Not if your guild is on the same layer as you.
---
which will have you banned in no time
---
I dont?
---
because they are bad at everything, like rly rly bad, they even suck at healing which is their main role
---
I believe Swifty wants to level 4 shadow priests for some reason.
---
I NEED A SECOND MONITOR
---
3 all the way with a combination of 2
---
Just don't break tos and I dgaf what you do
---
Which is also why even though there were hybrids in vanilla back then and diverse specs, there won't be many now. We know what's the best and everyone is going to play the most optimized and best (as u can see, even taking races into consideration). We know what classes/specs are going to suck and nothing is going to change, so most people won't level a shitty spec for 3 months to not get an invite to raids.
---
It was definitely a server-by-server basis for the abbreviations. Greymane-US was all in on calling it VC
---
Could be Horde going to get the Rogue BiS headgear.
---
The Red Defias Mask has stats in swag.

How many of you are actual humans that legit like this post/video and aren't one of his fan boys? anyone? Ya, didn't think so.
---
I leveled a night elf druid in vanilla on a PvP server and could get away most of the time. I stealthed around a lot!
---
Rogues were the worst, especially if they got a jump on me and put me in a stunlock. I came to despise undead rogues.
---
Honest answer: multi spec/hybrid classes do not fill the same roles as single spec powerhouses. 
---
If you’re playing ally I would suggest pally over priest. Both classes are single spec, however you’ll get more enjoyment out of pally in PvP compared to priest imo. Raid wise they’re both equal.
---
I heard this. But man does it sound like some chicanery.
---
I.. um, am also one of your friends! We had some good times at some point in the past.
---
Sorry, I shouldn't have assumed you opted-in to Beta.
---
My point is that those who did, volunteered to test. And are salty that that's what they've been asked to do.
---
Here's a comprehensive list of the top talents for a level 5 player. Bear in mind that at level 5 you only have 0 points to spend so picking carefully is advised :
---
Druid : n/a
---
Hunter : roll a rogue or a mage ffs
---
Mage : nothing
---
Paladin : No Horde paladins in Classic
---
Priest : your pick
---
Rogue : depends, are you going swords or daggers?
---
Shaman : nada
---
Warlock : zip
---
Warrior : you'll be too busy trying to generate rage to pick talents.
---
Also note that racials have no impact on talents at this level.
---
Oh man this actually makes me want to make a dwarven paladin a little more than the human now. When he first starts killing those whelps and Swamp of Sorrows? and does that little twist animation on the reckoning proc!   
---
Great stuff, have an upvoot.
---
I got the stress test and then log on and it’s offline lmao
---
&gt; Only retarded Alliance call Dead Mines DM
---
But imagine being either so braindead or such an unbelievable dork that you pretend you can't deduce what someone means when they say 'DM' based on their level and location
---
Some guy had an item that got him a picnic complete with umbrella and he plopped it down in one of the cities. He would /say "Type /camp to join!" and people would keep vanishing. xD
---
I can't even remember where I stored my old vanilla screenshots, much less the damage of trash mobs in sub 55 instances.
---
LIVE TO WIN!!
---
My friend tanks and I heal. So easy to get 3 dps for any dungeon. No waits at all.
---
Unique, it gives the option of a fresh game in the style of MMORPGs of the day
---
how to identify a pathetic toxic kid in this sub:
---
-he thinks 'streamer follower" is an insult
---
-didnt put any thought into topics he offensively discusses
---
thanks buddy, 1 more to my ignore list &lt;3
---
Who cares? There's people who would want to move on from Classic if they got their fill, or people who only would want to come back for BC or Wrath. If you have at least 1 server worth of population for Classic that's all that's going to matter in terms of community.
---
Fuck all of this "splitting the community" sky is falling bullshit, if people want to play a different version of the game, then let them. Stop trying to dictate how people should be enjoying the game, you're being greedy and controlling.
---
I would play Classic unchanged. I would play Classic+ with new content. I would play BC, Wrath, Cata servers. I would want them all to be separate so people who only prefer one or a few could enjoy them each individually, uncompromised by overwriting old progression.
---
The "community" is the entire WoW fanbase. Not just one segment of the population who prefers one specific version.
---
You underestimate how many people will be likely to play &amp; stick with Classic, even if they did the same thing for old expacs.
---
seems to invite stagnation 
---
Im all for keeping them frozen for a good long while but eventually everything dries up including player base
---
It's my opinion, I played fortnite and it's not a good game. It's great people love it. I love LoL but I can understand why a lot of people hate it.
---
'Beta' is just whatever the developers want it to be. It doesn't have a set in stone definition.
---
For a long time, pvp servers had something like a population balance, It wasnt really until TBC came out, that horde gained a huge population buff from elves. 
---
I was on a pvp server Akama, that at one time had a US top 10 guild Alliance, and a US top 25 Horde guild. As of now, theyve since transferred off, or disbanded
---
Our original discussion began when you listed a typical conversation and I suggested that it just end with "ah I see" and then everyone moves on with their lives. You and I weren't arguing about what it SHOULD be called. My point and original reply to you was about how it doesn't matter if it should be called DM. If enough people want to call it VC and most people recognize VC as Dead Mines then they're not wrong. It's not something you can be wrong about. It's an alternate abbreviation based on what people are calling it. It's like a chicken and egg scenario. Naming conventions didn't just magically exist and there's no magic rule. People, for the most part, decided that taking the first letter of each word makes sense for a lot of dungeons, but if a large group of people wanted to change that for one dungeon, that's now an alternate naming convention. My reason for ending the dialogue with "ah I see" instead of "the argument begins" is because most people during Vanilla didn't have this argument. They just knew this one dungeon as both names and it wasn't really an issue for anyone except completely knew players. And the new ones would have that exact dialogue you posted, but they wouldn't still be confused at the end. They would easily acknowledge this discrepancy and move on with their lives.
---
I had a 30 minute fight as a druid vs a priest in epl. So fun, no one could win. Except me.
---
I signed up for beta testing, the beta that i see streamers play on twitch. Where i can actually test things.
---
Besides i could not play the stresstest anyways because i work at that Times.
---
I have been streaming private servers for years so....lol.
---
Thought it was some weird multiboxing setup.
---
Woohoo! Mine is showing up now and installing.
---
The e-mail I got says it's only 2 hours. Has something changed?
---
 **Install now** and get ready to rush our test realm as soon as it **opens at 4:00pm PDT Wednesday, May 22, until 6:00pm PDT** . Play up to level 5 and help us make sure we can provide the best experience possible when *World of Warcraft Classic*launches August 27, 2019.
---
I remember having fights about this in Nost.  Like c'mon guys no one is doing LFG Dire Maul *in* Westfall.
---
Yea, as we all know, there will be at least 50 million players. Every twisted version of the game will have servers filled to the brim and everyone will be happy./s
---
I can get on board with that but.... zones in wrath and BC would need to be dramatically redesigned as they were built for flying
---
I played from Nov 24th (I was flying back from a vacation in LA and the 23rd but had my mother pick up my pre-order while I was away). I even played a bit of the beta a couple weeks before release, thanks to a friend's older brother sharing his beta access with us.
---
I never heard anyone refer to the Deadmines as anything other than VC or Deadmines. I played on an NA:E sever (Shattered Hand). The first time I ever heard of Deadmines being referred to as "DM" was when I was trying out a private server back around 2015.
---
I do think that for, simplicity's sake, VC would be the better acronym for the instance. I've seen the argument that Dire Maul has it's different wings, but I distinctly remember people throwing out the "LFG DM" for general DM runs, as the east and west wings are similar enough in level that one group can run both. Where one would specify if the run was for DM:N.
---
All that being said, it will always be VC for me, but call it DM if you want. I know I'll get plenty of whispers telling me I'm wrong, no matter which acronym I LFG.
---
DM .. dire maul is DM north etc never heard of VC for Deadmines before this beta
---
I mean he currently has around 40-60k viewers. There are with guarantee at least a few hundred maybe thousand viewers that might even be 60 before him and if only a small group of 10 or 20 people think its funny to gank him i can kinda understand him on his choice to go pve.
---
That actually looks really fucking cool
---
I think you are falling into a logical trap when trying to identify why Blizzard changed things like the talent tree.
---
It must feel pretty rewarding to pin it all on "casuals" but i think a much more probable reason is that they saw that most classes only had one spec that people used. If you were a mage it wasnt that people used different fire specs when playing fire, they were all using the same fire spec.
---
So they misidentified a solution to something that was not a problem and homogenized the specs because it would have very little impact on how different peoples specs were.
---
But they totally missed that small nuances existed that were very impactful and important. As well as the amazing feeling of getting a small bit of progression each time you level up. Currently in BfA you only get a new talent point every 15 levels or so, up to a certain level. In between talent points you dont get anything special other than unlocking new dungeons and when you reach Zandalar/Kul'Tiras you dont get any direct feeling of power increase at all.
---
And i wouldnt say that playing mage in BfA is more "dumbed down" when it comes to abilities compared to Vanilla. My fire mage in BfA has more abilities it has to keep track of and use than Vurtne had in vanilla.
---
Downranking does not exist, this is true. But the only ability people really downrank in vanilla is frostbolt. Even with that in mind i would say that BfA has a larger or equal amount of abilities compared to vanilla.
---
What is truely missing tho is a lot of the fluff-stuff. Mages dont have mana gems. Warlocks dont have soul shards. Hunters dont have pet-happiness. Mages dont have detect magic, dampen magic, amplify magic, Frost Ward, Fire ward etc.
---
And of course in vanilla you feel like a more "complete" mage than you do in BfA. You are a master of elements in the arcane. Not just one school of magic.
---
It feels really good to throw out both frostbolts and fireballs. Rather than only frost themed spells or only fire themed spells.
---
I'd prefer unique, with updates/tuning to classes more in line with classic. The rock paper scissors type. Each class having a niche, and giving each class it's weak points - but not making a good majority of specs just suck.
---
Exactly. It's not a problem that existed then. People are just bored and need to find problems. Anyone over the age of like 6 playing WoW understood once they were told what VC was and then got to choose which to call it.
---
Just an FYI, and this might be because of Sharding, but you can only see or track players/NPCs/Objects in the same zone that you're in. If you eagle eye into a different zone it'll be completely empty.
---
He does a lot of arena in Retail, quite successfully I might add.
---
I didnt play a ton in vanilla. Was kind of late to the game but TBC was amazing as long as you weren't a paladin, and WotLK was pretty well balanced for everyone imo while still not being boring. After that though it got way worse and worse.
---
https://youtu.be/1MbFYHCK1lM Guide for 1-75 ( great channel btw)
---
Nope asked my mom, she said she ain't playing :(
---
Nice, its always good to find someone that's never played vanilla WoW before. I bet you're really excited to experience it and I hope you have a fun time. Don't give up when you realize all the knowledge you think you know is completely wrong :)
---
LF land lubbers
---
I don't know who you are, but these are getting better and better. Do you have an album anywhere of your work ? What media / software do you use ?  
---
It took me over 9000 spider kills to get my first thunderfury /s.
---
to much community division
---
If that's the ONE thing I'll EVER remember... Even WHEN I started in BC (early ish 2007) was to call Deadmines VC.
---
Baron Run on AKama us, was specific to timed runs for the 1.5 set. Otherwise, it was Live vs UD
---
God damn these are great!
---
I laughed at this louder than I expected.
---
Fuck dude that text is next level
---
Just noticed the priest has Anathaema ? or is the Benediction ? lol.
---
As others have said, most would do a DKP system in progression 40 mans as a means of rewarding people for showing up.  Especially since some bosses might drop 1-2 items at most, limiting the amount of upgrade opportunities to a raid in a single visit.   It would create the least amount of drama and resentment. 
---
MC has 10 bosses with most dropping 2 or 3 items. Initially, chances someone gets an upgrade are decent assuming a full clear from the start, but even if there were 30 pieces of loot that dropped, 25% of your raid leaves empty handed. The more time you clear it, the greater the chances of duplicate/wasted gear, so the opportunities start to diminish.  You also run into players not showing up as they get geared, so DKP at least provides an incentive for better geared players to jump into content that they might not need anything from. 
---
People aren’t going to bother if they think their efforts won’t eventually be rewarded and all the gear trickles to the same few people in a loot council.  
---
Classic WoW is going to be interesting because I would imagine more guilds will be clearing content at a faster rate than Vanilla.
---
I’m not sure. I started October 2005, but I don’t think I bothered fishing until 06. Been a long time and my memory barely handles the day-to-day.
---
ikr?
---
No it doesn't.  Where do you see an interest in pets weapon DPS switching between melee and ranged and an interest in the different tricks of the trade hunters are asked to perform.
---
Besides Shadow priest it sounds like Op would be interested in warlock or mage depending on the interest in their skills and whether or not they are okay with a pet.
---
I don't understand why people would somehow make an exception to the rule of making an abbreviation from the dungeon's name for deadmines. Diremaul wasn't around for quite a while so that cannot be the reason. Why would people go with the end boss instead of the dungeon name for this dungeon only?
---
There is a mountain Stonetalon that says PLEH on it too.
---
I don't have an active subscription and will not until Classic comes out which means I have no chance of getting into the Classic beta at all.
---
Yes, their design philosophy in vanilla was very... experimental. They wanted to provide items with pretty much every possible stat combination you could dream of, and let players figure out what they actually want to use.
---
Part of this was probably a philosophical matter, but they also had a practical reason in that they didn't actually know ahead of time what kind of builds would end up being good in the game, with balance and design constantly being in flux.
---
I’m a new player set on playing Classic when it comes out, and on the fence between Rogue and Mages. Any input on what is fun and good in WPvP and Raids would be appreciated.
---
The true vanilla experience is having both good and terrible players in world pvp.
---
Honestly, if you think warriors did well against mages in Vanilla, I don’t know what to tell you. They’re a hard counter.
---
Holy shit let that stupid fucking meme die. The same guy who said it is spearheading vanilla WoW.
---
Well Pally is alliance only so thats sort of a con but they are the best single target healers in the game, the never go OOM if built right. Druids very versatile and can Brez and innervate, their focus being hots
---
12am I believe, 1-3am CEST.
---
Is it important to you that all Cata-era players must hate Classic?
---
Give this man a Beta invite already.. &lt;3
---
It’s 6 free name changes too 😩
---
2 hours from now.
---
In exactly 2 hours.
---
2005. Same. I did get stress test tho!! Yay.
---
 [https://www.wowhead.com/news=291829/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-22nd](https://www.wowhead.com/news=291829/wow-classic-stress-test-on-may-22nd)   
---
literally first duckduckgo search result for me
---
You thought you knew, but you didn’t.
---
I was in a guild with all of my EQ guildies on Shadowsong, so there was something like 70 of us that were all running DM in the first 24 hours.  Granted I was leveling pretty hard out of the gates, but up until these classic posts I have never heard of it being referred to as VC. Maybe it caught on being referred to that in westfall after the first few days, but it's just mind boggling to have never seen it even once in town at all, thru the entire course of vanilla and BC
---
you said you wanted to play something underplayed but then listed the 3 most played classes
---
big fan of these graphics dude! +1
---
Modern rotations are lit up so you don’t have to know what to do you just push the glowing button
---
Oh I see
---
Dead body in the bottom of thousand needles, the pouch gives you a diary with a quest in it. Just saw asmongold do that yesterday
---
Nope. No invite.
---
While I did enjoy retail and there are things I’ll miss (upright Orcs, spell effects, transmog), i was among those who quit for BfA. I’m just not into the theme park. I want the sandbox. I want to be immersed. I want to have a sense of accomplishment with varying degrees, unlike retail where it’s either100% hardcore M+/ Mythic raiding, or just empty calories. Classic has much more on the menu and will fit a number of different play styles. Playing solo in vanilla was FUN. Making friends was meaningful. Things that are stripped of their fun like kiting world bosses, leveling professions, and world PvP are going to feel good again. I don’t mind losing the cosmetic improvements of classic if it means I can have the sense of accomplishment back.
---
This is what happens when you cater to people needs in retail for so long they think their entitled to everything. If you don’t want to do the stress test don’t. If you can’t do it don’t..... stop crying about not getting what you want.
---
he said his primary goals were "fun leveling experience, dungeons, wPVP, BGs, and then raids" which the hunter can do very well. Also said robes might be an issue.
---
I'm for real super jealous, I wish I was in the beta.
---
Go to any rockets/warriors/Celtics/raptors thread. Blizzard could say they’re cancelling classics release and it wouldn’t be as salty as those threads
---
Well tanking is always in demand. If you love it, you can’t go wrong there. Warriors are notoriously slow for leveling if that’s a concern though.
---
ive sent 6 tickets to twitch trying to recover my stolen account. 
---
i know this has nothing to do with classic but fuck twitch.
---
Apparently this is a glitch happening to people with multiple ptr accounts
---
thanks to asmongold/sodapoppin*
---
i still hope people will level non favrable specs for alts then. Even tho fury warrior sucks till you get gear, I used to like it back in the days :)
---
something that isnt the best, can still be fun to level :) Maybe as an alt indeed.
---
As a boomer I love the boomer meme.
---
Sorry to hear bro :(
---
This is actually impressing.
---
Great work
---
western WI count?
---
tear to my eye :')
---
Orc is strictly better but, play the one you like the most they are both fun.
---
I won't lie, that conflictseith a lot I have read and seen people.say about resto druid I've yet to see anyone else call resto bad, just not top tier.  But apparently offer a lot to the raid while still doing decent heals.   Can you tell me why they're bad?   Resto that is. I saw a lot of reasoning for the other specs.
---
It's ok i like alliance haha x) So, are druids bad at single target healing? more mana needed and stuff?
---
/dance on the pile of corpses
---
Worked for me man. I swapped out my desk chair for a recliner, put a hard mous pad on my arm rest, and click spell grind alts and WQs, while my baby sleeps on my left arm =D
---
I actually started in cata and i'm pretty fucking hyped for classic
---
More deflection - OOOOOOOF
---
I think you getting thunderfury this early may be a bug
---
As a Warlock you look and see that you're one of 3 or 4. And then find out that the other 2 or 3 are assholes and don't have any shards. Then you proceed to spend the next 25 minutes outside with 2 people summoning assholes to the raid. Then you go inside and find out that you missed buffs. Bug individual people to buff you. Then spend the next 15 minutes conjuring 40 Healthstones.
---
It's like heroin, feels so good but is soo bad for you.
---
The cocky mage who blinked himself into melee range and got HoJ'd lol
---
They're not wrong.
---
Yeah I'm not saying one is right and the other is wrong. Just sort of explaining why it was called VC before it was DM.
---
Just because it was VC "first" doesn't make VC right, and just because the majority now say DM doesn't make DM right. Call it whatever you want, call it *Blizzard's Defias Pirates Of The Caribbean Westfall Adventure* if you want. As long as the message is getting across, what's the difference?
---
Of course they're going to ask for as many people as possible. This isn't the first time that Blizzard has ever done a stress test: they know around what percent of people will show up and they know how that's affected by peak times.
---
If they don't select a target window, people will just completely stagger throughout the whole event and they won't get any useful data. As it is, EU peak time is a longer window than 2 hours, and given that it's only through level 5, many people will only log in to briefly check it out. They have an estimate for how many people will log in during the targeted 2 hours (and again, if they didn't say "we want *you* to log in", they would be unlikely to hit it), but the hours they selected (and how early this stress test is in the beta) say a lot about how low that target actually is compared to what it could be if they picked, say, a true peak time.
---
Of course they'll look at the data from the rest of the time. Why wouldn't they? That's literally the point of testing -- they have monitoring, metrics dashboards, alarms, and all sorts of systems set up for both their beta and their live servers, I have no doubt they'll have them set up for a stress test as well. But the *specific* goal of this stress test is very likely to do a focused test on the layering system and possibly the login servers, since those are the two systems both likely to have problems that haven't been thoroughly tested yet and would be revealed under medium-high populations (the layering system because it's new, and the login servers because they probably haven't tested the way those interface with the classic servers under extreme load). Keep in mind, the devs work semi-regular hours. Just because they aren't *actively* monitoring and interacting with the servers doesn't mean they won't look at the data in retrospect.
---
But again, without a target window during EU peak, they won't be able to get the same type of useful data as they can in a targeted 2 hour window.
---
I am expecting my 2nd january 10th! Congrats and see you on the battlefield!
---
This video gave me cancer
---
How is their healing endgame?  I also read feral ta ks are decent for dungeons.   That's a plus at least ha
---
Doesnt windfury hit twice with increased attack power?  SoC just hits once as 70% wep hit as holy dmg.
---
whats the joke?
---
Which is funny to me because I would much rather face WoTf on my lock then face paladins. If you need fear that bad. You are a terrible warlock.
---
"You think you want it, but you don't" was always only ever said by people who've not played vanilla in 10 years, or never played it in the first place. 
---
I always laughed as I alt-tabbed back into whatever vanilla private server I was on at the time.
---
EU! :D
---
Which is why I'm asking. I'd be happy to go Paladin or Shaman as well since they seem fun, but if using them means not getting into raids or dungeons or being people's last choice then obviously not. Are paladins good for anything besides buffing? And what about shamans, ive always thought of them s excelent healers but im not sure in classic
---
To be fair, the majority of time I saw it was in Westfall and occasion in stormwind. If I saw DM in a hub during that point in time I would have thought it was a completely different dungeon.
---
why? it has no p2w elements, completely free game with cosmetic stuff only  
---
you want it to die just because its popular?  
---
would much rather have fortnite on top and showing other games how its done than LoL with its p2w crap
---
Glad you enjoyed it! Have a great afternoon :)
---
I joined at the start of Burning Crusade. I've still got quite a bit of time on hand to dedicate to playing Wow. Back in Burning Crusade I was primarily a BM Hunter, but I also spent quite a bit of time playing Enhancement shamans, dps druids, and Warlocks. Which class would be good for damage dealing in both pvp and pve and brings the most to the table in terms of raid viability/desire, world pvp(mostly fighting off ganks while leveling), and hopefully some organised group Pvp?
---
Gratz man! Im not in the beta but I will be in Classic day 1! I was thinking of starting or finding a guild strictly for parents, because as a dad myself I could think I have 2 hours of freetime for raiding or pvp but then I have to go and change a diaper or my son decides to play with me on the computer out if the blue. In other games people normally get mad at me for stuff like this. "Cant your wife just do it?" And shit like that gets real annoying. Anyway, I have a feeling if Im with other parents they will be a little more forgiving haha.
---
Did someone say [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?
---
Pure classic. Pure tbc. Pure wotlk.
---
Progression servers where all xpans are unlocked over time. Preferable under same time tables as they did in 2004.
---
Warrior - tank/dps 2 specs - you can fury tank all 5 man content 
---
Priest - 99% holy, there is a small chance you get a single shadow priest in raid because of 16 rebuff slots at launch
---
Pally - holy heals
---
You can play suboptimal specs, but only expect to be in casual guilds if that’s the case. 
---
The issue with multi spec hybrid classes is the niche roles they fill in addition to the sheer cost of respec. 50g at max with 10g decay per month. 
---
If you truly want a jack of all trades and do not care about respec costs, play a Druid. You can tank 5 mans, you’re used as raid heals and innervate in raids as resto, and finally for PvP you can go flag carrier build and be an unstoppable bear. 
---
The single spec classes will always be better than hybrid classes at specific roles. The hybrid classes allow for the freedom of changing specs and they support the single spec roles.
---
But they are the only good tanking class for endgame content right?
---
I thought it was that but I’ve never heard of it called VC
---
Classic wow is just the wow Avengers going back in time to kill sylvannas
---
DEADASS. This is an A+++ post
---
Hi, /u/Runupgodumbonem
---
None of those guys hold a candle to Marm. Marm isn't only the best Mage in the world, he's also the best Rogue and Priest. He is a legend. Anyone who played on Arena Tournament knows this is true.
---
$40 each for me, fricken Canada eh
---
Thats $560 right there, plus tax
---
I mean it’s possible. As long as you don’t play balance lol. You can easily tank dungeons as bear for prebis and even raid as OT for trash pulls.
---
The art is down to taste for sure. The stat problem isn't though. Having 4 versions of the same set and most items being unremarkable stat sticks doesn't really make for an exciting looting experience. Artificial scarcity really makes me feel better about looting than continuously replacing gear on the daily.
---
I think your just on a low pop server, on Area 52 I've been able to run dungeons in under 10 mins with dungeon finder.
---
Mage, rogue, and warrior will literally be the most played classes by far. If you want an underplayed class that's in demand then druid is generally the best choice.
---
If you'd use those things attached to your face you could clearly see the plagueland background, but nah
---
Wait so it will be dark for a month? Lol good night
---
I’m not talking about mythic. I’m talking about normal and even heroic being easier than vanilla. And most people don’t do mythic at all so “most people are better now because it’s more complicated” is a false statement because while even normal is probably technically more complicated with mechanics than most of vanilla content, in vanilla if you messed up slightly you’d be dead while in normal and heroic retail you can stand in fire all day long if your healer doesn’t suck or even if you just have self sustaining ability
---
no bad just not the best, in raids you are more of a support class
---
you patch folks up with rejuvenation, tranquility is pretty amazing
---
but your main job is to be the Brez and innervate guy
---
You keep saying Black Lotus, but that was already a rare spawn. You could go to all of those layers and not see one. You typically have to keep farming the Dreamfoil spawns, and then a Black Lotus might spawn in behind them. So what are you achieving with that one?
---
paladins are good healers, not too sure about shamans ive heard heal or ele but that could be wrong
---
You have some numbers from the future or what? "Lets make twisted version of WoW for everybody". Community split is real, chance of fail is also real.
---
And since we are going with the "Fuck", then Fuck Classic+.
---
Look at this retarded thread, everyone LITERALLY has something in their minds that should happen with either Classic or TBC/WotLK. Are you really suggesting that there will be people for everything? Get real.
---
Worse thing is, a server doesn't really cut it, there are factions and their balance will also be affected. The split is a very real thing.
---
So please don't assume that you can come here and expect people to bend their ass because blizzard should cater to everyone's twisted dream game.
---
The ONLY thing that should be allowed is TBC and eventually WoTLK realms. And that's ONLY if that split you call bullshit wont be too big.
---
No it was definitely possible and there was a patch that explicitly made the instance backdoor harder to get to.
---
MAN YOUR POSTS, TAKE UP YOUR ARMS, IT'S TIME TO GET THIS SIEGE UNDER WAY!
---
Yeah, a Warlock who just resurrected is like a quarter of a player.
---
That's not how the world works, fellow Norway-inhabitant.
---
Circling back to this to say that's actually what the macro reads, and I still log in to a ? until I open my /macro window and click over each one.
---
Those bastards. I'm going to shrug this off like everything else.
---
When we had our daughter And I was on maternity leave I worked it out with the hubby that when he got home from work at 6p I would go to bed and he would be on baby duty from 6p-12a. This way I would get at least 5 hours of sleep. 
---
He would set up our daughter in a rock n play next to the computer and play Fallout and she would be asleep probably 90% of the time. 
---
Who knows, you could get lucky and baby just wants to sleep when dad is around. This way you can get in a fair bit of game time in. Best of luck!
---
Back then, we didn't even really know what an instance was. So, when you reached the last quest of the Defias Brotherhood chain, which requires you to kill Van Cleef, you would throw a "lfg Van Cleef" because, what the hell is Deadmines? The only real reference one had up to that point was hogger.
---
Eventually it got shortened to VC, which stuck, at least on my server.
---
I think a lot of people don't quite understand how people looked at the game back in '04. We didn't know what instances, raids or battlegrounds were. People were still figuring everything out, so a lot of the conventions that seem standard today just didn't exist.
---
Of course it's DM.
---
Dire Maul has a suffix. Tribute/N, E, W.
---
Brez and innervate are most definitely desired.
---
Trust me, people who asked for Vanilla don't give a flying F about these people. We knew what we wanted, and if WE are why this is made, blizzard should care about these people either. So, these people can either adapt or go home, it's not the game they wanted, neither it should turn into it.
---
you guys know nothing about DM easy ;\]
---
$1300 for a bassinet? Holy shit.
---
I know what the end result of this is, but what exactly does it mean?
---
Country roads...
---
I’ll be maining a Druid for the first time this time around and I’ll be doing something similar as you are.. my plan is deep feral for leveling then switch over to Hotw spec when I sing 60 and start working on engineering and then take that spec till bgs come out where I will be going into a resto spec for raids and flag running
---
Nothing was quite like vanilla. In TBC and WotLK you have one spec that is superior and basically mandatory. Talents at the bottom of the tree were better and that basically contributed to this.
---
The class balance was incredible in WotLK and cata for pvp though.
---
ok
---
My mate is going on and on about that one all the time but whats actually a good money maker right after reaching 60 in general?
---
Rofl, this is a problem again? This was an issue a while back as well.
---
I dont think they're bad at all. Just depends on the player and what you want to do with the class. 
---
They're hybrid, so by definition they'll never be topping dps, hps charts. Nor will they tank all the content they want. In terms of pvp, the play style is difficult to master but you can wreck as a druid. Domination thru attrition
---
Whoever says VC makes me sick. DM is Deadmines and you abbreviate dire maul for the wings like DMCG smh
---
Alliance meet at Hogger
---
Horde meet at Elwynn
---
Dude I fucking love this post I just read it to my girlfriend and the whole time I was commeting about how this is exactly me and she kept laughing like I was joking
---
ust gunna say this... Play whatever the \*\*\* you want man honestly. Classic wow is going to played 10x different then it was in 2004. Don't go with play whats needed. Play the one who you think is fun. Personally i was gunna level druid/war... Now im thinking Warrior and Spriest. Cause i PVP all the time. 
---
So do you booboo
---
Bring back the gnome run!
---
Venruki was OOM also, the only way the warrior loses is by running away at that point haha
---
/camp logs out, usually takes 20 seconds but in cities it’s instant.
---
I guess it means to set up camp? ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
---
Druids will probably be most underplayed next to hunters.
---
The only issue is if you try to level in an area that doesn't support your class. If you try to level a Paladin in the Night Elf zones it's gonna be a pain in the ass to get your skills and class quests.
---
God i want unique so bad. Its cliche af but the old definition of insanity is doing the same thing over again and expecting a different result, thats exactly what "true classic" would end up being. Give me a lvl 60 Caverns of Time, Hyjal, Kara, Sunwell, etc. All these zones were already in the world so why not utilize them? Gear would get to the point where PVP would be one sided but then maybe at that point extend the level cap to 62 and add a zone for 60-62. One zone, both factions, tons of wPVP. Say the mobs in the zone are tuned to the difficulty of  a lvl 60 raid so you had to go in with other geared friends to kill them making it so you never lose the sense of community. Make it so gear from new content is the same as classic where loot really isnt itemized great (maybe more mem spec/pvp/resist/situational gear?) This way people are still running 60 raids for items like Thunderfury, Rejuv Gem, etc. That way people just hitting 60 can still work through the content and people who have been farming content will still have a reason to go back and do old content which would also help gear up the newer players in the process. 
---
TL:DR Do unique, add content, but dont make old content useless.
---
You can chain Far sight as a shaman too
---
&gt; I think a lot of people don't quite understand how people looked at the game back in '04.
---
I played Alliance ever since the game launched. I understand quite well. Nobody on my server called it VC, though. I'm not bashing anyone or anything, I just find it very curious. Apparently many american servers seem to have gone with VC. On german servers it was even called DM although the german translation did not suit that abbreviation (because the localization of certain zone names came in a post launch patch)
---
I can shed some light on this: It's primarily americans that call it VC. Americans are weird and do strange things. Case closed.
---
Teaching your children is good. Doesn’t matter what you’re teaching them. Just teach them something.
---
oof
---
Yeah pretty much.
---
You’re going to stay up longer. Longer play is shorter nights.
---
My point is your perspective is garbage.
---
My main WoW account still has an actual account name attached to it rather than being WoW1, WoW2, etc.
---
i think group finder is all servers
---
what level were you at?
---
There are still alot of china farmers selling other stuff than gold, for example TCG mounts which would cost above gold cap and stuff... and still there are alot gold sellers left, despite the tokens
---
the only down side is getting there
---
I know a lot of undead players used to go to the barrens to quest because it was so rich with quests and WC of course
---
Keep smiling, keep shining  
---
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure  
---
That's what friends are for  
---
For good times and bad times  
---
I'll be on your side forever more  
---
That's what friends are for
---
because it's, like the beta itself, on NA server ?
---
So you think people like Asmon/Tips are better than [this guy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAR1CsAXLCw)?
---
I avoided for... years ??? The only time I got temp banned was because I was 15 and dumb and paid a leveling service. So I got busted since they were playing from China I guess lol.  
---
For golds ? Never, ever had anything. On both my accounts.  
---
So yeah, whatever.
---
Unique Classic *eventually*. Give people plenty of time to clear Naxx before adding new content, as that will make the rest much easier.
---
yeah i mean i think druids are more fun in general specially while leveling, my main concern is getting a raid spot and theres probably gonna be a lot more druids then paladins around
---
headquarters are in PDT timezone, 4pm locan till 4 pm local they use to monitor. Which is workhours for them. So it was either Really early PDT so EU is evening. or evening/primtime US and EU late.
---
I would also choose EU late. (im EU)
---
exactly the opposite my man
---
Nobody will play for more than a year and a half tops then
---
Dude, cataclysm raiment is god-tier.
---
Afaik hordies on Zenedar EU referred to it as DM, whereas people lfm Dire Maul typically included which wing they were running
---
I knew it logged out but I have no idea why.
---
Only if he didn’t have double standards. So he won’t dare, cause he’s a self-described scumbag. Obviously if asmon was good enough to get the trinket, he wouldn’t be banning it.
---
So about my previous response, appears it is an issue again but they are fixing it themselves.

If I really want to go Troll Priest, how much of a disadvantage in PvP would you say I'd have compared to an Undead Priest? I'll be Holy mainly at max so I would prefer being Troll(and I like the look better) but I want to know how much Im gimping myself for Shadow and PvP.
---
Great video btw! So happy you made an updated leveling guide with the Beta values. Hope to see more videos from you, you seem to really know your thing! :D
---
Quick question about Classic from someone who didn't played Vanilla.
---
Posting here just to not make a post to ask this...
---
I was watching a Hirumaredx video talking about  10 removed class fantasy abilities in WoW. And one think that caught my attention was that Rogues needed to learn how to make their poison... is that going to be a thing on Classic? Also how about Class Quests?
---
I really hope that this will be on Classic. It will feel like I'm playing an actual RPG
---
I would play gnome warrior if I was you. Human warriors get kited 24/7
---
No one is talking about Asmon / Tips. I was saying even decent players now are better than a lot of the best players then.
---
Its going on for 24 hours anyway. I think blizz is more doing this to not exclude anyone here. Also iam from germany and for me its weekend right now i can participate and give some much needed infos on how its from here =)
---
Evacuate the forums, engage all applications and get this man a beta invite.
---
It's all on one NA based server. So they are basing the times off of that. There isn't a separate EU server.
---
not sure about that, im told druids are one of the least played classes on the private servers 
---
or so ive been told 
---
but as a healer a raid spot would be easy to get either way
---
I mean, he did the same thing in this video and had to pop ice block to fix it. Didn't learn from the first time? Well since he went 2v1 I guess it worked out anyway.
---
Only the tanks bro...
---
I wonder if people will still charge or tip for portals. They did back in the day if you were out and about. It was customary to have a portal home at the end of a dungeon. I know people would be willing to pay, they'd message me asking for a port to SW or IF and would include "will pay."
---
Curious to see how people will behave this time around.
---
Sure, but he’s not gonna ban the items that *he* has that gives me an obviously huge advantage.
---
Well, it actually saves a lot of money.
---
You need to be invited / your account flagged for the stress test.
---
Eh it’s not that bad. If you grab the fp’s on your run it’s really just a boat ride and a flight. Rather than go every 2 levels I make the trip every 4 if I’m in an area that doesn’t support my class.
---
When you're so upset about not getting into a stress test that you have to make a post on reddit about it
---
Make food.
---
Eating exclusively prepackaged crap and snacks will ruin you. 
---
Take a day, look up some recipes, make stuff in advance and stock your fridge. You’ll thank yourself when you actually feel full instead of an unending hunger.
---
\+1 would love to see an album of your work. You are a fucking genius.
---
From what I remember, it’s more class specific. Like will you have a class trainer in the other zones.
---
&gt;very little competition on your gear in raids
---
More like every single fury warrior trying to steal your Crown of Destruction. "But it's good for Fury too guys". Get your grubby warrior hands off my gear.
---
The only thing that separates players are new islands/continents. As long as it's in the same Classic map than that would be awesome. Hyjal/Kharazan would be amazing.
---
Probably gimp or photoshop. Something like this is pretty easy to do. Just find a picture, make that layer 1, make a transparent new layer over top, layer 2, and just use the color picker tool, or ctrl+click to get the exact color from layer 1, and literally just color it in layer 2. Not trying to sound like that guy or anything but anyone could make one of these, if you dont believe me, apply the knowledge I just gave you and see how yours turns out. Reference: I used to do these all the time, making irl people look like cartoon graphics.
---
Look dude, i get your delusions, i truly do. "Community split isn't real". Whatever.
---
I care about Classic and i definitely don't care about people that want to turn it into something else. People that wanted Classic knew it's bullshit mechanics in and out. According to Blizzard, its these people that were loud enough that eventually pushed them far enough into making it.
---
Also i mean... "community split isn't real, everyone should get what they enjoy". Maybe i do need some therapy but if i end up in an mental institute and yell your name, im pretty sure i will hear an answer.
---
It looks like benediction..
---
He's not taking part in the event so I'm not sure what you're going on about
---
the thing that made ilvl fine in classic is that it is actually a budget system rather than "well we need to use this much in str and this much in crit etc." insted everything is put into the budget even stamina is budgeted for freely in classic.
---
sure this is give items that is most of the time just awful god awful and somtimes god like. while having a stat such as stamina budget for somthing no DPS would willingly take is bad game design. somtimes bad game design is needed inorder to deepen the complexity of a game.
---
the same thing applies to the talent tree. the argument that max level people will just pick the same talents every time and it just leads to traps for newbs is 100% true and is bad game design. but is also adds a level of depth since that one talent that is very rarly picked might have a niche or you can do a fun leveling build that only works between 30-35 untill is breaks apart. that depth and fun is just gone when you remove that bad game design.
---
the main WoW sub meme of "FUN detected" really is true blizzard stomped down hard on quirks since it is not how the now ridged wow works.
---
Missed opportunity for sure.
---
AWESOME thanks

Seconded

9pm EDT happens when this comment is 3 hours and 44 minutes old.
---
You can find the live countdown here: https://countle.com/Ac975kqrI
---
Was on magtheridon as well, always VC
---
Source for what?
---
That purple and orange dont both put you at purple when you zone into mara? Or that the sevice gate and the main gate of strat both go to different places? Or that DM North is a different entrance to the same large instance as DM West and East but only one of those has you chase that little imp right at the door?
---
These are baseline, never changed things.
---
I played on EU Ragnaros (Queue and server downtime 24/7) and Darksorrow. Never heard about DD before. Same in SWG you only used DPS.
---
Ok
---
So here I am, deciding between rogue, lock and hunter. I
---
I'm planning on doing PvP mostly, but I don't have a problem with farming PvE for that because I remember how vanilla was with PvP gear. So I'll probably try to get into the raids but nothing hardcore. I'll focus on PvP more.
---
Back in the actual vanilla, out of these 3 I played lock and I don't even remember it that much. Then when TBC came I switched to rogue, then in Wotlk to DK and I've been a DK main since then, with the other mentioned being alts, including hunters. Yes, I'm still actually playing even BfA, but I play like once per week and DK is still my main, altough it plays terrible. 
---
The thing is unholy has been always my thing more due to having a pet and I don't know, kinda always preferred it over the frost, but I played both. 
---
This might seem like I enjoy pet classes, but sometimes I jump on rogue and I enjoy ganking people. 
---
However I also remember enjoying lock after it got buffed in the actual vanilla. And they're badass as fuck.
---
Then I think about Hunter which I started playing in TBC and how much this class has lost over the years. I'd say vanilla and retail hunter are one of the most different classes when comparing vanilla/retail. I also love their theme, just a lone wanderer with their pet.
---
So I'm asking for advice between these three. My main focus will be PvP, all sorts of PvP. With some PvE, dungeons or raids. But they won't be my main focus. I enjoy farming things, solo play when my friends aren't online which happends a lot during the week. 
---
Don't care if it's melee or ranged, altough if I had to be honest maybe I'd actually prefer ranged. I've been a melee main for so many years on retail.
---
&gt;Because i always ran to drekthar and feared everyone into him before they were ready
---
I like your optimism.
---
29/11/11. Feral charge, insect swarm, and the rest balance.
---
since no one else told me, prepare for a very frustrating first several weeks
---
Pretty sure it would take more work to create new content than it would to recreate burning crusade and lich king so your argument is moot.
---
If Dire Maul is in the game then Deadmines is VC. This was done back when Dire Maul launched as it was the most common content being run in recruitment of people wanting to run DM. People will run Dire Maul for longer than Deadmines as it was a part of progression so it just made sense for it to take on a simple abbreviation and change the one for the content that would only be run three or four times during leveling for most people.
---
"I ran VC over 20 times"...
---
Yeah, they are calling the dungeon VC.
---
It is VC. Anyone who says otherwise is a big poopie head.
---
But Wild growth are objectively better for any class that can wear leather + so while iLVL is in the game, it doesnt necessarily mean anything.
---
Always called it “tribute run”
---
5 Accounts multiboxing
---
Uh... Skip class?
---
I'm heavily leaning towards druid. Never had the chance to play one past like lvl 20.
---
How are they for fighting multiple mobs in the context of leveling / farming? Obviously nothing beats mages but I was more wondering where they're at. 
---
I'm suspecting the answer is 'no' but are they at all capable of soloing elites while leveling?
---
How do they perform in world pvp in the context of uh... ganking? From what I've read their main strength in pvp is great sustain but how does this hold up if you get the drop on someone?
---
That's your opinion. People value different things and have different priorities in life. This is his life and his choices.
---
Do we know what the regen was on pservers?
---
I would argue BC, WotLK, and some of cata were still good, but mists only had a few good ones and it reaaaaally dropped off hard in WoD. Really is impressive how good they did with the sets in Vanilla and BC though. I've never played an RPG or an MMO that had sets that were as well designed as those ones
---
Did somebody say.. ***'Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker?'***
---
Hi, /u/Saczuanello
---
(repost cuz I somehow managed to give the exact same title as a current top post)
---
I want an spriest as well for a pvp realm. Mind controlling unaware people is always fun
---
Depends on your preference tbh. Both of these are solid classes for raids and pvp. It just really depends which playstyle you enjoy more.
---
Nah the stress test itself is 2 hours yes.. but the server will be up for 24 more hours. Also i guess the info they cant gather from EU players in that timewindow will be gathered in the other 24 hours. 
---
But i think the first two hours will be enough anyway.
---
I didn't mean to infer anything about you specifically. I just think this is a perspective that many people seem to misunderstand. That being said, it seems that the VC name was a NA regional occurrence.
---
&gt; Obviously this is highly unethical behavior ~~and I don't condone it~~, but ~~back then~~ getting ~~your best DPS~~ geared up for PvE and PvP faster meant cheating ~~the system a bit.~~
---
It's all depending on the specc. SM / ruin specc you mostly dot everything up, and spam shadow bolt up with a occasion shadow burn, the free procc from nightfall is awesome if you have corruption on different targets. And have a pet there for silence. Drain life and siphon life is good for keeping the hp up (and maybe get another shadow bolt procc from draining life). But melees will mostly target you since you can't escape that easily, but with the 15% hp talent, HS and such your survivability is actually good. And if you die, the opponent most likely will die also. 
---
And then you have the destro locks, with high nuke dmg. Soul fire is sick, but it uses soulshards and a little bit of casting, but it is fun, since you have daze, stuns on proccs. If you got some gear you one hit easy, if not you can finish of with conflagrate + shadowburn. Usually goes best with succubus for seduce. (Almost like fire mages is)
---
Demo locks is more tanky then the other speccs, but it is mostly like sm / ruin, but with less dmg on shadow bolts and relying more on you pet. The lock speccs are different play styles, and i'll say i enjoy them all, depending on the mood.   
---
Have been playing a lot outdoor pvp, whereas I've delayed a bwl raid by 2 hours, by killing the main tank and healer with my mate, that was a shadow priest. We were unstoppable, his heavy nuke and my dots + curse hurts so bad. 
---
Locks are really gear dependent in the early game, so it might be hard, but with some practice even bad geared pvper can kill 1 v 1. Just use the tools at your disposal efficiently and locks have a chance early game pvp.
---
Hope this was some clarification.
---
yes but server is open for like 24 hour but stresstest is only at the time
---
Thx m8, no idea what to makenout of the recent discussion.
---
Im willing to bet you that this is bullshit. Define "nobody" a fan doesn't need 1 million players, they need enough. Did D2 die?
---
My shit says Beta:Classic WoW but I only have stress test realm. The ultimate jebate
---
Currently still practicing heavily, arm fatigue is rough, but by the end I should be able to click my spells with incredible speed
---
Awesome clip
---
Good to know, would have been pretty OP! I'm pretty sure it's more in a sense that the game doesn't load characters or objects not in your zone, that would be too heavy don't you think? I'm not an expert but I'm pretty sure there's a limit around you where you don't load stuff, but world elements like trees are a matter of distance vision in parameters
---
I see, so i do not have to play this night? I can enjoy it tomorrow evening?
---
No such thing exists in Vanilla PvP if you actually are serious about it.
---
if you can get them, the bloodseeker and frenzied bloodseeker bats are really tough to tame by yourself they are really useful because of the fast attack speed (1.0) but they arent the only one Broken Tooth has it as well but hes a rare spawn
---
But also to be fair, this beta is only to level 30 and there isn't much to do. Lots of the streamers I watch are gonna play classic but arent playing the beta. I have a feeling it is gonna break some records for viewership when it actually comes out.
---
Never played one second of wow, but for some reason i'm hype for Classic. Given I know nothing about it this was a useful thread, thanks.
---
Boralus says hi
---
I'd say Enh Shaman is the easiest class for one-button kills. Next would probably be Shadow Priest.
---
Do you take commissions? I would love to get a few of these with the Horde emblem.
---
there's a huge chain starting from a dwarf crushed under rubble of the thandol span.
---
As we are learning from everyone complaining the damage isn't high enough, low level instances are not difficult. If it's true to wow fashion you'll have anything from Ret Pallys and Fury Warriors to fucking Rogues and Hunter pets as your tanks. You'll have Feral Druid and Shadow Priest Healers. You'll have DPS Hunters who don't know any of their skills and don't know how to put their pet on passive. Guess what? You'll still get shit down. The criteria for getting through lowbie dungeons is 5 (sometimes even less) players who are clinically alive.
---
I started in BC and I'm hyped for classic.
---
yo can you toss me an inv when you get a chance ty
---
Idk why but this reminds me of osrs
---
Also, the big Blizzard logo in the bottom center was removed.
---
I hated Fortnite since it gained so much popularity. But ever since the Epic Game store shit i hate Fortnite even more.
---
Maybe holy paladin?
---
I main'ed a priest that I lvl'ed as shadow and my main alt was a shaman who I lvl'ed as enh (didn't play ele until mid BC so I can't speak for it's viability during Vanilla). I never had any issues getting into groups and never felt like my dps was an issue. 
---
Are there better dps classes? Sure. But as you are specifically asking about low lvl stuff pretty much anything is viable pre-60 from my experience.
---
You...you give your money to streamers don't you?
---
But does WoW even have a Prime Minister?
---
They also look stupid on horses which was my no-go.
---
Tanks are always in demand, so go with Warrior. You don't even need to be prot as long as you're rocking a shield.
---
Pure chaos incoming
---
I love the Deadmines. The presentation of the dungeon is wonderful - gradually forcing your way deeper, going through door after door until you open the last one and this huge chasm opens up before you and Mr. Smite yells out. Plus the story leading up to it are among the most lengthy and immersive quest lines in Azeroth.
---
I think another reason people love it so much is because it's the Alliance's parallel to the Barrens. *Everyone* has done Deadmines. No matter if you leveled in Loch Modan, Darkshore or Westfall, you can count on people trekking to Moonshire just to do that dungeon. And for many it represent a lot of firsts: their first dungeon, their first dungeon drop, their first blue equipment, their first grey shoulders, a rogue's defias mask... I think we all have some fond memory of that place.
---
Its pretty basic economics actually but feel free to elaborate if youd like to.
---
I clicked your profile and on the first page I see you post on Asmongold and Sodapoppin's subreddits.  I think you may be in denial there chap.
---
Different ball game, but I'm one of the guys who put a lot if effort into reversing WoW back in the day in order to create most of the bots for farming some of the mundane tasks. 
---
I've already got the client tore apart, and me and some of the other guys I used to work with already have a pretty functional product running on the beta! As someone who also has a full time job but wants to enjoy WoW when I can, we feel your pain.
---
years.
---
Horde group up and let’s hit Elwynn, lvl 5 landslide boi
---
Seems like hunter to me. Don't need much pve gear to be insane at ganking and world pvp and are always wanted in BGs and you got the pet playstyle along with great solo farm.
---
How complicated is it for some people here ? He said 24 hours.. how are you still having questions mate ? :D Look at the clock now.. add 27 and a half hour.. is it in time timeframe for tomorrow evening or not?
---
Only so far as you'll still need to be granted access to regular beta. It doesn't strike you off the beta invite list.
---
no seeing as opt-in is only once with your battlenet account

Please follow this thread, I've been posting updates as I see them. Checking the forum post every 15 mins. There has been ANOTHER update since this one.

---
Mage for convenience. The word “convenient” basically doesn’t exist in vanilla: limited flight paths, no mount until 40, expensive lvl 60 riding, basically no portals to use in cities, long hearthstone Cooldown, etc. Mage teleport/portals can be a HUGE time saver and helps a ton with visiting the AH regularly or changing zones. 
---
Also the free food and water, very helpful. Plus both of these features make you very desirable in groups, can build your server rep, and can score you some extra silver through tips
---
"Can I get that... ?"  
---
Everything checks out here, except that he has a Pepsi and not a dr pepper lol.
---
You said there was a patch that fixed things like being able to get into the back of deadmines, I obviously know this is a lie so I’m asking you to source it.
---
I can just imagine you accidently smashing your mouse into your desk trying to right click a quest item before someone else gets it.
---
Hey on a serious note I appreciate the info you posted I've already saved it to reference later! Thanks man
---
It’s weird how you are able to create such consistency in how bad everything looks that it makes the entire thing look good. Truly masterful.
---
Nah, a dismissive, soul crushing statement like that from a high profile blizzard representative to a guy asking an honest, heartfelt question deserves to be memed for all eternity.
---
They were good for their time, but like I said the best players now are far better than the best players then. There are more mechanics in a single Mythic raid now then there were on every boss in Classic combined essentially.
---
Probably not coming by the Classic WOW subreddit if they don’t plan on playing classic
---
&gt; Would not have liked to play with you and yours.
---
That's cool.
---
I was old enough back then to have my own credit card, it still feels good :)
---
they’re either gonna do the blood plague or drop World bosses into the zones haha
---
Hahahaha
---
It did help that these war/pal players were *exceptionally* bad.
---
So when do we stop acting like all the Retail players actually give a shit about us enjoying Classic? At this point, it seems like this community is the only one bringing it up.
---
I still think Vurtne is among the best mages ever in terms of skill-expression &amp; creativity. That fucking guy was like 5 years ahead of the rest. Unbelievably fun wpvp by him.
---
Talk about being obtuse, rofl.
---
It would alleviate it relative to a 10k server pop. But in practice, each layer will still have 3333 people, which is the same as Vanilla server caps, which means **It will be just as bad as you remember Vanilla for new servers**. I honestly have no idea how you don't understand that.
---
But the servers after layering **will not** have a 10k server pop. This would throw off things like Black Lotus farming, World bosses, and other such things that are limited per server, rather than per instance/dungeon run for example. It just will not happen. That one big Pserver had to put in dynamic Lotus spawns as part of their solution to deal with a pop that high. That's not Classic and will not be in the game.
---
Check meandro on youtube
---
Wrath.
---
The insult could be humor or could be blizzard deserving a stern talking to. He lost me at "fuck me over". What a childish perspective.
---
Lol. That's just going to skew you results, not get what you're interested in.
---
agreed, id love for gearing to be slower and last longer. I do think stats can be fine, for some reason i always love getting the right stats on gear, even when its just haste/mastery/crit altho i do like block and parry etc.
---
M+ is interesting in that regard, as i love it for gameplay but it plays all sorts of games with gearing. Having said that its certainly not the main offender in retail imo
---
What is VC never seen it used.
---
Indeed, the number of "fuck"s in one sentence defies belief.
---
It doesnt matter any class is super fun when its  vanilla. Let rng decide if its so hard for u.
---
[The stress test realm itself will be available until Thursday, May 23 \(becoming unavailable around 6:00pm PDT\).](https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/wow/t/wow-classic-stress-test-1/178282)
---
its worth doing if you are going for another faction mount, its possible to get nightsaber at around lvl 40-45 but you have to complete every quest before they turn green, thats when they give less reputation and when grey they give 0 reputation
---
Oh I Think it is, sometimes I forget these things, but I've always been able to find dungeons from 15-120 no problem. I am in NA servers though.
---
On Feathermoon US, we called it VC well before Dire Maul came out.
---
Shadowburn costs a soul shard just so you know, an enemy dying within 5 seconds is just a refund on the shard
---
I have a suspicion you won't be the one getting the bonus card
---
4:3 too
---
I don't recall anyone calling it "VC" back when I played at launch, but that was also 15 years ago. Seriously though, VC is more confusing than DM. Nobody just says "DM" to mean "Dire Maul". There is ALWAYS specification.
---
Night elf Hunter - put your pet on stay, walk away, racial stealth.  Wait for your victims.

no fucking way you just looted that, no fucking way!!! GZ MAN!

God i just want to return aswell and autoattack with my Benediction again!!!

That’s fine too!

Huntard
---
I think the top 0.1% of players that are insanely skilled like venruki/Xaru are for sure going to be likely better than the best back then. But, these elite level arena/PvE players are not that common, maybe a few hundred people are on those two level.
---
I got invited for the stress test,  but it's between 4-6 PM. I'm not home until after 5, then it's dinner time and have to take care of the dogs. I doubt I'll even get to log on, maybe for 15 minutes.
---
Does it makes sense to you guys, putting a stress test at this time ?
---
Edwin is the final boss of DeadMines. So they should be saying EV or Mr. VanCleef. Or CV for Captain VanCleef since he is in charge of a boat.
---
FWIW, in the very earliest days of raiding, we made our feral druid in charge of decursing his group in Molten Core, like how every other decurser was assigned a group. This was before raid UIs were even really a thing, so probably not as applicable.  
---
Also in MC, the only time I remember feral being significant enough for us to ask him to go bear form was on the fire resist trash cause he wouldn't get insta-gibbed as much, on Garr since the adds were a PoS with their knockback, and on Council during the lava pit teleport.
---
We never really asked him to play resto, but if we were having subbing people around for progression, he'd volunteer for respec if it was healing-intensive since he'd rather have a spot than sit out all night cause he was feral.
---
He got to be feral more as we (the guild as a whole) got better, starting sometime during late BWL.
---
You might find that people throw way too much healing at a fight until they're comfortable with it, so your plan might be backwards since you'll be asked to be healing more in the first half of raiding rather than the more mature back half of the raid content
---
cool
---
Honestly just play what you want to.  I know that might sound like the cop-out answer but you have to remember that in Classic there wasnt Arena.  In normal BG play you dont really have to play at 110% because instead of only having 1 or 2 others on your team you now have 9 or 14 or 39.  You can afford to play more casually becaus you have many other people there to support you. 
---
That being said Id proly avoid Hunter because of deadzone and have to make use of a lot of tools in order to maintain distance.  People always refered to them as "Huntards" but I found them far from faceroll to play well.  Also Warrior will have a lot going on due to stance dancing being a thing.  Shaman have a lot of binds if you count all their totems.  No idea how much not using those will gimp you as I played Alliance back then.
---
yeah ofcourse. youre the first out of 9000-12000 players to set foot into burning steppes? You know there will be dozens of players atleast questing there already when u hit 60 / the required gathering skill, right?
---
And once youre there you can somehow farm a years worth of mats in a day? thats not even possibel in your completely hypothetical scenario, where youre the only one farming 4 instances of burning steppes, youre still capped by 60% mount and actual gathering speed.
---
Except there's no guild reputation in classic so it literally could not matter less.
---
You mean SN? Since "Sleeping Nightelf" is the final boss?
---
holy shit this brings me back
---
First off. Starting in wotlk doesn’t make you a veteran at all shit for brains.. it’s only for those you started in tbc and classic. 
---
Secondly. You just named 3 non underplayed classes. So tf you talking about?? 
---
Everytime I wonder how stupid people can be.. I look no further than reddit. I’m always less than 5 mins away from seeing a post like this made by an OP who parents are most definitely siblings. 
---
What a joke... started in wotlk and calling himself a veteran. Laughable.
---
Nah you're perspective is garbage
---
Man see. Like i can't just leave i have invested so much time in this game from vanilla to BFA! part of me would feel broken if i just stopped playing retail and ditched my characters that i have put years into. 
---
So ill play 3-4 months straight of classic and level a War/Spriest (or ele sham) then catch up
---
just being up to date on BFA since it takes no time to catch up.
---
Kristin Holt and Morgan Webb were hot af
---
Random, commented about the same camp from EQ haha
---
Don't forget the Mauradon jump where the Hydra is down the bottom waiting for anyone who jumped ahead of the tank.
---
How can it both been always called VC and also get changed to VC from DM when dire maul came out?
---
See, on the counter point when I played Vanilla Deadmines was exclusively called VC.
---
As much as I agree with the lack of decent armor sets, the diversity was killed with the transmog patch. It’s a great and fun feature but, just like phasing, destroyed a core aspect of the game. You used to be able to immediately spot the best players on the server. Now I don’t even look at people 90% of the time unless they have absurd tmog.
---
Healing classes are always in demand can’t go wrong with Pali if ally shaman if horde and even priest. Druids the most underplayed class but not desired 5 mans as a healer because they didn’t have a normal Rez spell but every class has a utility a raid will need. Wouldn’t stress too much about that play a class you haven’t played before and just enjoy it. Besides balance druids class wasn’t even finished in vanilla.
---
Exactly, I feel so thankful for being able to do that! Also the fact that I have a job and will be able to pay it myself is awesome :)
---
Oh for sure
---
blegh gross gross gross!
---
Can someone please explain the context here? I've always referred to deadmines as DM but wtf is VC
---
And it's likely very very common. Browsers, websites, antivirus, Windows itself, games and other programs all do it more often than not.
---
&gt; TBC was amazing as long as you weren't a paladin
---
Tankadin in TBC was amazing fun in PvE.
---
you don't even need to be feral. So much your power is baked into the forms themselves you just need some appropriate gear. (tanked plenty of dungeons with the janky Pre-Buff Bear/Dire Bear forms. The post buff versions we're actually getting in classic are ridiculously powerful by comparison. (Pre-Buff Dire Bear is weaker than Post-Buff Bear Form. Just to put that into perspective).
---
Inb4 teleporting all people to Kazzak's original spawn point and once again Horde and Alliance have to fight together.
---
why do people think just because their account is old they’d get beta access?
---
Blizzard wants active high tier players and public figures, not some random from 2007
---
Hi, /u/Ultima1221
---
Yeah this is bound to be the right answer.
---
The servers are doing CONSIDERABLY less.
---
Dont lose hope man you will get in before it launches !
---
Could the whole VC DM thing be a result of the Mandela effect?
---
Well there's no arguing with that.
---
I just remember referring to the stuff we did as tribute runs, and the infinite mindtap talisman runs we did for all the guild healers after DM was added. There's probably going to be a lot of surprise waiting for me when I go back there...
---
What magics type has he put most of his points in
---
Almost certain I am the responsible for Sweden being at #3. The amount of googling I've done for classic related content is not healthy. Is it the 27th of August yet?!?
---
frost mage, all you gotta do is spam frost bolt and frostnova every now and then
---
I want to go in and actually test things, I have 4 accs made in 2005 that are opted in for beta and non of them got an invite.
---
 [https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=166](https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=166) 
---
Even the quest text refers to him more as VanCleef than Edwin.
---
Brilliant
---
and always got tenacious D stuck in my head for a few minutes after anyone posted tribute run in trade chat.
---
They just announced that most of the beta invites are out and they are decreasing the invites.... so yeah, bamboozled hard. (I did get in the stress test at least for which I am willing to sacrifice some sleep...it will be shit running on 4 ours during work but I'll manage somehow lol)
---
I'm not really focused on the economics of thorium farming for the example, only how easy it is to exploit sharding, for various purposes as opposed to layering. 
---
&gt; Small groups of players farming resources and abusing layering will be part of the meta.
---
Except you can't really explain the mechanics of how that will work, with out working against the information we currently have about layering. Not to mention making assumptions about how many layers will exist (if any) once anyone reaches max level. Hell, could you imagine doing this multi-boxing strategy only to have rolled on a server that doesn't even generate a second layer? 
---
&gt; And clever multiboxers could definitely do better, although it would be much more appealing if you had a guild of people with a dozen accounts.
---
Again, if you are a minority of people who multi-box, land on a server with layers at level 60, somehow get your accounts reliably into separate layers, than I guess kudos to you. That guy getting some gold isn't gonna significantly hurt anyone though. 
---
Guild's don't help. They will be regularly placed in the same layer. Friend's list again, friends may not be in different layers. And I still don't know how many friends want to get spammed with requests for test invites constantly. You'd need a significant number of people willing to do that for you in order to reliably find new layers. And finally even if you can change layers, you then have to still rely on the rare spawn rates of something like a Black Lotus. You still have to farm the nodes hoping for a spawn.
---
I'm still highly doubting the efficiency, plausibility, or worthwhile of this to actually be an issue for anyone but a few crazy people.
---
Here's the thing.   
---
You can argue that if someone says "LFG DM" you can shift-click the player's name to see their level and determine if they mean Deadmines or Dire Maul but the point of using VC is to save the player from having to shift-click the player's name. Not to mention the player may need to scroll up in chat on a busy day to find and then shift-click that players name.   
---
Seems easier and more efficient to just call Deadmines VC.
---
I'm fairly sure an active sub is an active sub no matter how you twist it - bought for gold or real money shouldn't matter
---
It says in the invite you can play until the 23rd.
---
I'm telling my friends I'll be a filthy casual (I won't). Hence I'm not telling my girlfriend anything.
---
Ohhh no definitely not, classic wow for sure won't die in a few weeks. Absolutely no idea why the hell you think that haha, very weird.
---
Try this link - I didn't do the math myself just saw it linked elsewhere

---
I'd love Unique, I want more updates and I'd like specs to not be traps. I want a better classic, one that is updated and made a better game with all the community aspects of it and I'm probably going to be downvoted for my opinions.
---
I want Ret to be a class people can play (without being Rez/buff bots), I want shadow to have access to raids and not locked out due to debuff limits. I want Balance to be an actual spec people can use and prot paladin to actually useful, or in example for [Paladin Healers](https://i.redd.it/mlbep5i1d4z01.jpg).
---
I don't know how people wouldn't want this or the thought process of the Purist mindset. There's even Purist against the idea of Addons (there were addons back in 2004 guys) or better graphic options for people who want them. 
---
Are they going to pulling out 20 year old CRT monitors and a Gateway computer with  6800 GT graphics cards and using a 56k modem so they can get the old school feel? Of course they are not going to do that.
---
The game isn't going to be 2004 all over again for you guys and I can understand keeping the principles of classic again: Community and time Investments that matter, which we will have.
---
Just because you haven't touched classic doesn't mean people haven't. Players have been playing on PServers for over a decade, everything has been found out from the most minute details to the best optimized stats and class breakdowns. Every Raid has been killed over and over for decades and the mechanics are simplistic and easy to deal with, I don't want to be stuck in the same classic world for the next 3 or 4 years, or even 10 if it keeps going.
---
Youtube and Streamers have made the internet completely different, guides are easier to find. We as Players have grown, so why do we not want to make Classic a better game in the long run?
---
Take a look at OSRS, it is THRIVING on new content for the game, it's not locked in time from 2009, it has evolved to be a entirely new game WITH THE SAME MINDSET that OSRS players wanted.
---
Calm down kiddo.
---
Yep they be cleansing all your dots lol
---
You just LOS every cast and take 0 damage. Would rather fight 20 of these at once that 2 of any of the melee ones.
---
We called it DM back in the day in vanilla why the hell would we name it after the last boss?  
---
its like saying hey lets raid ragnaros does not make any sense.  
---
as mentioned most ppl that search DM go by wing or write DM tribute. wich clears up and you can always shift click level of the player. wich kinda sums up where he is going if you are uncertain :)
---
This is the map from the Warcraft I Orcs &amp; Humans manual. The first Temple was built by the Orcs in the Black Morass and was used to create Necrolytes by making a sacrifice to the gods. It was later destroyed by the humans in the first war. 
---
Further Temples were built by Gul’dan during the second war and this is were he summoned the army of Death Knights - who are very different in characteristics to the modern WoW death knights. In Warcraft II and the expansion, Death Knights were spell casters like an unholy mage, and much more vulnerable to attack than the current type, certainly not wearing thick plate armour.
---
Truly the classic experience.
---
Oooo! Link?
---
It’s a known bug
---
Keep in mind, I was one of the voices yelling out for Classic's return. I signed the petition just the same as everyone else, and I want/appreciate Classic for what it was. That doesn't mean I can't also enjoy the possibility of some new level 60 content being developed for it. Or the possibility of TBC/Wrath/Cata servers being launched branched away from Classic/eachother (as not to overwrite the progress, with an option to transfer/copy one's character to the next expansion at-will). I, or anyone else who shares that opinion, aren't going to be pigeonholed by your limited ideal of what Classic should be. Worrying about "ruining the community" is doomsaying about something that would likely be several years down the line when likely the majority has already gotten their fill of Classic, with the hardcores happy to stay where they are and the rest of player base either went back to Modern WoW or are clamouring for new content/new Legacy expansion servers. Either way, it won't hurt Classic whatsoever.

Why are you so concerned about this topic?
---
What I'm interested in is the players who are coming to classic and where from... people that dont play classic are irrelevant in it.
---
can you link?
---
i got in stress but i really want beta
---
1: Are you aware of the subreddit you are posting on?
---
2: If someone can't wait 2 days to hang out with you. There's likely a problem.
---
anything is fine in any dungeon. you only get the "meta" complaints during raids and even then, imo, the only bad DPS classes are Moonkin and Enhancement Shaman, just due to how they function. Moonkin OOMs extremely fast and Enhancement is just way too reliant on Windfury procs to do anything.
---
DID SOMEONE SAY [Thunderfury, Blessed Blade of the Windseeker]?!?
---
There will be a system...It's unclear how they will implement Lotus but that's not how it worked. 
---
There were only a few spawns, very easy to control
---
And if they deviate from that people will game that too. Probably will bot it eventually
---
Notice how he says "in my opinion". Its subjective not objective. There are tons of people excited and happily going to play classic, but would most look forward to TBC or WOtLK.
---
Laughing skull was VC
---
Yes if I wasn't disgusted by the idea of playing allaince. I would much rather be an alliance lock. They are stronger in group pvp and, you already run yard in duels.
---
Pretty much same as me. But, I was also thinking about going 14/32/5 and really pushing the DPS in the early phases. Unless I miss NS to much in the open world lol.
---
Hey, that's 5 more levels than my uninvited ass.
---
Third paragraph.
---
Oh ok, most of the stress test invites are out. I thought you were alluding to the actual beta.
---
Yup. Rogues had a skill for making poisons (you have to level it up btw).
---
Also pickpocketing
---
I'm on this sub every day and never saw the poll, also, i played on three different OG vanilla servers and they all used VC for deadlines. So yea this poll is probably a bunch of dumb retail shitstains or private server weirdos
---
if they manage to aoe shit down, which means you're competing with other mages on a full server to do that plus any leveler that is already there too
---
I don't think a mage will be beating a hunter in a fresh environment, or a Warlock/Druid
---
no u
---
No you both
---
You can attend that same class next year, but you won't have WoW Classic Beta next year. Take this free advice from a Master of Science!

I never said a discord channel wouldn't exist. In fact I'm pretty sure I said the opposite, that it was a good compromise. I seriously hope blizzard disables any add-on like the one you're pining for since it goes against what classic is about but nowhere did I ever say it wouldn't exist. I just said it is a terrible thing for classic and would make the game worse. In regard to the discord thing, a discord server would never get as popular to the point where people would stop looking in game for groups.
---
The things you can do to pass the time when you don't have a key
---
And on my german servers I never heard DPS. What is your point, exactly? 
---
Do you know what the French use? Do you know what players from the netherlands use? From denmark?
---
I am using DPS on private servers in a completely english context too. Hell do I know if there are differences in closed off french discussions.
---
And since german players use DD, "Eu says DPS" is already wrong. So, what is your point?
---
He meant he cast rejuvenate and didn’t go bear form to gain DR.
---
No, they are actually talking about the actual beta.. "That said, the amount of closed beta invites that we’re sending out is rapidly decreasing as we have met our current population needs for testing. "
---
I stand corrected, it does say actual beta. rip
---
hello this is your brother i will test for you
---
Hope so. Still unlikely that it matters much whether it's 2 subs on an account or just one, though.
---
Well that's disappointing. I guess 3 months isn't that long of a wait.../s
---
I feel you man, i got an exam in 9 hours.
---
Probably a retail player who thinks guilds still give buffs
---
and that is exactly why no one likes politics in a fantasy role playing game.
---
riiip
---
I'm just happy I now am old enough that I have a job and even more happy that my sub price went up to $30 per month because my wife (who started in Cata) is so excited to experience the game that I have so many fond memories of.
---
I just subbed yesterday and I got beta access. I want to play but Im suppose to go out for volleyball tonight at the same time.
---
split the player population like this and youll have no one to play with
---
&gt;So basically you really think layer-switching is done by just "getting invited from another layer", regardless of time or position?
---
This is how it works in other games with similar systems. EQ2 you could get invited to a group and it would switch  you to that layer, and just leave you in the same relative position. 
---
Not saying this guy is right that it will be easy, or common. I don't think it will be.
---
Haha :P
---
Thanks, makes me happy that it was able to help someone
---
they should just spin up 2 more servers and souble the people doing closed testing
---
its litterally free advertising 
---
im going to be pretty salty i just get in this stupid stress test
---
Maybe Eryx? I watched him alot when I was playing vanilla and actually made my rogue the same as his when I got the claw from BWL
---
It's quite apparent there is no right or wrong answer here. It's a regional thing possibly. I played and twinked "a lot" (4 60s) and have never seen VC but it's apprently a very common thing in NA at least
---
He played very well but also got lucky crits. He had a non-shattered fireblast crit that warrior plus every spell on frozen enemy crit. Without that, probably would have lost.
---
cool pics, bro
---
Your kidding, right? It looks like it was hand drawn by a 5 year old using markers for the first time. I've drawn better then this with broken hands. For you to think it's cool relly shows how poor you're taste in art is, but I guess I can't expect everyone to have the cultural knowladge and social entelligence that I possass.
---
&gt; "are you sure you want to leave your guild?" pop up from modern WoW 
---
Warhammer vibes. This is beautiful.
---
Oh noes you might miss out on the awesome experience of leveling all the way up to 5...
---
If this was a beta invite I'd be a little more sympathetic, but you can hardly do anything during the stress test.
---
blood plague would be fun, though i dunno if 24 hours is enough time to *fully* enjoy that :P
---
He can do what he wants
---
Normal servers came before PvP in the beta. In a few developer interviews they mentioned they never even intended on releasing with PvP servers, but one developer pushed really hard for it so they ended up doing it. PvE was supposed to be the main focus and what they balanced around.
---
Nobody really cared about his damage, there was like one big thread about it. Most people are wondering about the general elite mob damages from various dungeon mobs
---
I was there at the beginning - the reason is that there are a lot of quests in the Dead Mines before the instanced part (e.g.  [https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=167](https://vanillawowdb.com/?quest=167) ) and a few inside the instanced part.
---
Both the areas were called Dead Mines and it was confusing, so people fairly quickly adopted "VC" meaning the quest to kill the boss, or just linked the quest(s) they wanted to group for.
---
Lots of people would help you kill VanCleef because of boss drops along the way (Defias Armor, Cruel Barb, Smite's Mighty Hammer) but would avoid the early parts because it was time consuming and didn't benefit them.
---
Well.. okay then...
---
Don't get me wrong, I'm also excited for classic, but let's remember a few things. 
---
1. Classic is still relatively new, so there is a large hype train rolling through.
---
2. Classic is very limited right now on who has access. This means more people are watching rather than playing.
---
3. BFA had very similar viewing numbers at the start as well.
---
Let's wait until June to really judge audience engagement and interest. More beta keys will be out, people will be at the level cap for over a month, we can accurately judge who's really interested.
---
That sucks, wish I was a streamer.
---
Since when was posting on a streamer subreddit classify you as a streamer worshipers?
---
you can just cast blind on someone up against that one wall.
---
Please inform us (the poor non invite people) what the event was :D
---
Also the sneaky sneak in lbrs iirc
---
I have not yet done so, though I do have twitch Prime and occasionally will give a sub when I can. As someone who hopes to stream in the near future however, I see no issue with people wanting to give money to a content creator they support. I used to subscribe to several patreons before I stopped having extra money.
---
No one asked you to open your cocksucker. You should really learn to think before shooting off your big mouth. I guess not everyone is capable of such things as critical thought.

I'm running a tabletop game tonight, we start at 6:30 and will play til 10ish, at which point, I will run home and log on. I hate being a responsible adult with friends :b  (my only hope is that they finish up the mission from last session early, but we're all chatty RP people, so it's probably not going to happen)
---
Add me to the list of old school vanilla tanks making the come back with classic. Im guessing they will be a least a few of us lol.
---
That's some fine meme!
---
If you think things are fairly polished you're part of why classic is going to suck
---
That's awesome! Classic is gonna give us a lot of great memories for sure. See you in Azeroth ;)
---
Yeah but the 70% holy damage ignores armor so it can deal similar damage.

True, it was the Blizzard rep that was the asshole, he deserves the "Fuckin told you so".

Hey everyone, instead of down voting this guy like he wants, let’s upvote him for shits and giggles

I’ll I can say after playing the beta for an hour is I thought I did and damn it I was right!
---
I'm still waiting on you to name a single example or, in fact, say anything of any value at all.
---
It kinda did. Blasted Lands are what happened to it from having a Portal in the middle.
---
He did use HoJ and used BoF to get away right before that. The animation is different than retail.
---
/r/BirthOfAMeme?
---
this sucks. :(
---
No one will want the progress to reset. But everyone is crazy about and wants F R E S H servers. But to put a lot of progress and effort into it knowing its going to go for nothing, its demoralizing.
---
Someone needs to make a new thread about non boss elites. Not bosses. Itd be nice if blizzard addresses this also.
---
Are you really as sick as you say you are?
---
*Yeah, Ma, I'm that sick! I'm ill!*

Cocksuckers just robbed everyone of $15

Fair enough, it’s true you only got the initial trap and then the one extra. But I always felt the off-tank pet made up for the lack of dedicated CC.
---
No warmode that's a retail wow mechanic they wouldn't put that into classic so they will have pvp servers just like the current beta
---
i didnt mean to reply to the guy above lol i meant to reply to the guy below this guy
---
Makes sense. thanks :3

I use mushrooms to make rl people look like cartoons

I am just glad to have to collect pets that are special again

I felt like the ultimate bad ass having dual 1024×768 monitors back then.

Uncanny!

I mean, you CAN play classic wow right now if you really wanted to. Or at least something similar
---
Soooo streamer beta lol
---
You try way too hard to be edgy.
---
Out-fucking-standing. Excellent twist on a classic
---
What kind of job do you need to pretend to be sick instead of just taking vacation time?
---
Lets narrow it down then. You are basically saying this: In a game with closed community, and &gt;factions&lt; we should launch:
---
WotLK
---
PvP/PvE/RP servers for &gt;every&lt; one of these.
---
Fresh servers for every single one of these, because people also want to simply start over.
---
Servers that stay the same because there are also people that don't want to feel &gt;forced&lt; to complete something in time?
---
And somehow this sounds like it's possible without tearing up the community? What does "down the line" even means. Do i have some time limit or what?
---
You can't make everyone happy, its impossible. No game ever made this, and the top games of our time followed a strict patter for over a decade and that's why they are played for over 15 years now. I don't know who needs therapy here, but if you think that everyone can be happy, then good luck.
---
10 versions of WoW will absolutely tear people apart, this isn't lineage, this is WoW and if that "untouched" server goes 20/80% ally/horde ratio ONCE , it is screwed. 
---
Define majority. How do you push changes, what changes, what if people want TBC+ or WotLK+? I mean just give me an answer with yes or no here. Do you think that you can make a all of this and actually expect it to thrive without some of these "Pieces" of community get screwed to the point of either quitting or being forced to move to "insert WoW version N=" ?
---
What about LoL is p2w?  The ONLY things you can buy with money are cosmetic skins and champions which can also be earned through playing.  Don't even say the champs are p2w because they balance the game so that all champs tend to have winrates between 47-53%  LOL is definitely skill based, I can't buy my way to challenger without paying someone to play my account.
---
Dunno if they'd work with your desk or space but you can get clamping monitor arms that have Vesa mounts. My housemate had them on his desk and they swung out far enough that he could lie back on his bed and play :D
---
Beauty thanks
---
I hope it doesn't because the test is while I'm at work. Blizzard will think I'm lazy and didnt want to help. :(
---
Hi, /u/Sydarmx

Shang! I believe that you ganking me in BRM was the first time I appeared in a PvP video haha. Tell Nexius and Zekk I said hello. 
---
\-Wence

Ricky?
---
I saw him say on Twitter that Vanilla WoW sucked and all the changes were for the better. It's just nostalgia, nobody actually wants to play it, etc.
---
Sure, I'll be horde and itll be a blast if we came across and fought to the pain of the other ego!
---
Sad that I won't see you on the subreddit posting though, it's rough when your thoughts are down voted to oblivion.
---
I asked OP and OP said paint with mouse and keyboard but now its seems like BS now as its oddly getting better with the more he does.
---
Lol’d
---
Good on you man. I only saw it as a difference in time. Weather I'm there or not, it's going to be done by someone else. I'd rather enjoy the more fun aspects.
---
&gt; There will be a system...It's unclear how they will implement Lotus but that's not how it worked.
---
&gt; ​
---
&gt; There were only a few spawns, very easy to control
---
They worked just how other rarer node spawns worked. If I wanted to farmed silver veins (for whatever weird reason) I couldn't just stand on the spot where silver last spawned. I'd just be staring at a tin node. I'd have to farm the tin nodes that were there, and then hope that it would come back as silver. That's how all of those worked. 
---
So even if you are in a layer, you have to farm the nodes that *could* spawn lotus. If you are having to actively farm the those nodes, at what point is it actually prudent to layer swap? If you do find a way to move between all layers and none of them currently have lotus spawned, what do you do? You'd have to stay on one and farm nodes until a lotus spawned in their place, while the other layers were unfarmed. 
---
So again that just brings it back to maybe a multi-boxer, who are already hardcore niche players who are very few and far between, to hope that several things align for them to get a character on each layer then they would still have to farm nodes to generate lotus spawns based on RNG.
---
Fireball still hits harder than a frost mage's frostbolt on a non-frozen target. It is the correct move. Also at level 30 its hard to get points in Frostbite. Too many other more essential talents to take.
---
So you're sayin there's a chance...
---
I think everyone is going for hogger
---
ZG pre nerf, now that was a nightmare.
---
Paladin's don't have cleanse at 30. It is because fireball hits harder, thats it. So much overanalysis.
---
Plate is the superior armor type tho. Playing mail or leather is suffering.

Cool

Someone help me out here. That means what I think it means right?
---
Is Blizzard...Is Blizzard *cool* again?
---
&gt; They have new content every week.
---
I wonder how long those 100 hour work weeks will last.
---
That's cool then. I don't think I'd care for my 18-23 year old self either, but the past is the past.
---
Sigh :(
---
Also in 1.12 the 50% increased crit chance to frozen targets applies to ALL schools of magic, not just frost. Only the increased crit dmg applies to frost.
---
Are you joking right? Everything started from Nostalrius takedown.
---
Well its not too much of a stretch that their testing needs could change, like he says.  Especially when they raise level caps and might want some fresh faces in there to further test lower content.
---
Nah fam.
---
Most fun I ever had in a WoW dungeon, to be honest.
---
Then we'll do it again fren. As many times as it takes.
---
Yeah mate, that's 2 in the morning.  I'll be asleep.
---
maybe thats because they're closing the closed beta and doing an open beta? maybe? please.... please......
---
Listen here boyo you better keep that negative ass mindset the hell out of classic kid
---
Wait the beta stress test is still going? I thought it was like 4 hours?

It might seem silly but people in classic were alot more forgiving for the most part of things, mostly because "I need to change the baby" is 5-15 min vs "let's find a new tank/heals" of 3 hours ;)
---
I was there man. It was good times.
---
These videos bring back such great memories! You should throw in the Darkspear Tribute videos for any oldschool Darkspear folks looking to get real nostalgic. 
---
Just because it is that way on your pservers doesn't mean that wasn't how it was in Vanilla /s
---
Time for the rage posts of those who didn’t get in telling us how they will not play Classic now and how Blizzard fucked them for being “loyal customers”.
---
Black Rock Spire is literally a black rock spire.
---
He wanted to get out of combat. It only takes 5 seconds or so. It isn't a horrible play to try. You guys are all results oriented. Obviously he lost and it didn't work out but the play is understandable. it is easy to armchair analyze.
---
Test didnt even start yet.... 1 hour 10 minutes and it goes on for 26 hours.
---
Congrats on the sex.
---
They said the servers would be up for 24ish hours though, didnt they?
---
So i guess it'd be 22 hours, but close enough.
---
I just want them to bring back the TCG, the actual cards, not just the in game rewards.
---
Noooo :(
---
Shaman, warlock, feral druid is rough for mage.
---
That's a leading question. "DeadMines" is part of the question while "Van Cleef" is not.
---
But yeah, it's definitely DM.
---
I like how im being downvoted for pointing out the truth.
---
Damn, there’s a glaring flaw in my plan
---
Im bot surprised no one here has a sense of humor and apparently thought Privie is a real thing
---
No.  That was false information spread.
---
&gt;We’ll be performing our first stress test for WoW Classic on Wednesday, May 22, from 4:00 – 6:00 p.m. PDT.
---
Literally the first line of the Blue Post.
---
Grind your pre-BiS for resto raiding as a bear. You can be a great dungeon tank without a ton of gear and help everyone get their pre-raid blues.
---
I am from EU and yeah, I have never seen someone call Deadmines a VC, it was always DM, people shouting in Westfall or sometimes in Stormwind, always a DM.
---
Paladins are the Best tank Healers, I would bring 2-3 Paladins to my raid.
---
He drew on a bug reporter in the left side.
---
WoW has been pretty dead on twitch when Asmongold isn't streaming
---
BFA is a shitty game with boring gameplay
---
For now, it will be interesting to see how long it lasts.
---
Yes, the server will be up for 24 hours - but the **FOCUSED STRESS TEST** only lasts from 4PM PDT to 6PM PDT.
---
Technically true, but the form drawn is benediction
---
Warlock is a maybe.
---
Shaman and Druid are free kills.
---
they should spin up 2 more servers so some more people can test its not like the subs dont cover it
---
free advertising and all that
---
Well yeah I haven't played since tbc I was hoping it'd be more like vanilla, killing the alli leaders was always fun. But I think after a certain level everyone got flagged for pvp from memory?
---
It was only the stress test. I can’t even play it because I’m scheduled to work for the two hours it goes live.
---
Moreover, Blizzard has been very vocal in saying it’s randomized in who gets into the beta. Age doesn’t matter; you just need a sub.
---
That's all well and good, but if we never let this die and WoW Classic is a smashing success maybe it will get them to change course in retail.  I know it's a pipe dream, but a guy can hope.  I love vanilla, it's definitely home, but I'd still love to see new content in the same style as Vanilla as well.
---
haha same
---
Played a mage on Nost/Ely etc and had good gear and in a good raiding guild. My hardest opponents were hunters and shamans, priests too just because of mana loss. The hunter pet and the constant slowing was so hard to get past and shamans constantly debuffing was tough. Rogues and warriors were quite easy to take down. Druids were meh, they’d keep re-shape shifting so my slows were useless and they’d heal. Locks were manageable, you just gotta get away from the pets.
---
First time I see blizzard not taking free profit.  This post made me cancel my sub(only for beta inv) until release date. If beta was open for all subscribers, they could earn shitloads of money.
---
Lmao I play on a Mac laptop from 2012 and got in, I don’t think that was it. This was also my first time subbing ever (subbed on last Sunday). Pretty sure it was just random.
---
2006 account throughout TBC. resubscribed on friday, not invite tostreas test
---
Am I the only one who can't watch a stream of the same game I'm playing, simultaneously? My brain doesn't like the conflicting sound effects and visuals.
---
Man I remember one Sunday afternoon when I took the subway for one hour to the only store I knew would be open, only because my game time ran out and I had to raid in the evening. Good times.
---
Edit: learning that the servers will be open longer than the 2 hours... it’s a Christmas miracle!  Sad Peon is happy!
---
Especially during the escort.
---
If Thrall dies before he leads the horde to ruin, you have to kill him when he's in Eastern Kingdoms, before Medivh appeared in his dreams. And that will ultimately lead to the destruction of the horde, since Sargeras' Burning Crusade will end everything.
---
So like, sure? I mean... No horde = Good horde.
---
FOR THE ALLIANCE!
---
And you should learn to read. I said that the mail did arrive after it was available in the launcher. So the only thing I saw was that I had the beta available in my launcher. I got the mail hours after I finished the download.
---
I was told to report this as mimicking system messages and thus pretending to be a part of blizzard, which is a violation of the ToS.
---
Don't remember, but you don't need to.  Just your pet standing there with a convincing name was sufficient most of the time.
---
Humor was understood when you called me a privie. Think it's a contextual thing.
---
Recent drama everywhere addressed people shitting on those who played on private servers. General consensus is they are solely the reason why we get to Make Azeroth Great Again.
---
Thank you for clarifying! Is feral charge worth sacrificing NS for? NS feels like such a flexible and powerful ability I’m surprised to see this, especially because the first 10 points in feral don’t seem super strong of you don’t spend a ton of time in feral forms.
---
Like really caring about this in any which way isn't petty nonsense
---
No. Everything should be like it was 15 years ago. Get your mom to pay for it.

i enjoyed finding and then reading your comment.

I'm in Alaska... right there with you ;)

They should send beta invite to beta opt-in with no subscription if they wanted easy money. My account is feb 2005 but i wont pay for a chance to get an invite, i never gamble, but i'll pay for sure if i get invited...
---
&gt; My very first ever group in MC 
---
&gt; 800 attunement steps
---
Huh? MC attunement had one step, go click a rock in BRD. Excluding the Onyxia key quest, none of the attunements were difficult, fun, or interesting. I don't understand why people romanticize the vanilla attunements so much. The MC attunement (and likely the BWL and Naxx ones) was only added as a QoL change after they capped how many players could be in an instance, since the original design was to have raid groups run through the dungeon portion (i.e. BRD, UBRS, Strat) to enter the raid portal.
---
Only acceptable way to be greedy without driving the playerbase away is to make it mobile friendly
---
He's right, don't loose hope, you might be able to play at release !
---
Strafing on the Classic Beta is currently bugged. The torso does not turn the way you’re facing when strafing, only the head does. This bug only shows when targeting another player or NPC. When targeting yourself it works as intended.

What do you think about elemental shamans, moonkins and demo locks? My priority is to enjoy levelling and the wpvp.
---
I don't understand your question or its relevance
---
A lot of them aren't. 1.12 came after a huge wave of standardization. There are some unique skins, but the only unique "ability" is Brokentooth having a 1.0 attack speed, and MAYBE Lupos still deals shadow damage, but I'm not sure about that one.
---
Please don't let it happen. There were a lot of \*'s on the Release Date Announcement. Now I'm scared

I think you're right. I found this. I hope it clears things up! https://vanilla-wow.fandom.com/wiki/PvP_flag

why does it matter? if its in ur launcher its in ur launcher .. lol
---
It may be quite a basic free site to use but it does the job fairly well:
---
[Shivtr](https://shivtr.com/)
---
We are planning to use it for our guild site, nothing crazy special but done a few bits to it and getting there with it, example as per below.
---
[Dark Reign](https://darkreign.co.uk/)
---
They would also be grouped with one not visible behind a bale of hay. Then you would wonder how rapid fire fireballs were getting cast until the second one would go oom and reveal themself.
---
the biggest tip i can give guild leaders is class leaders for each class
---
they should also have a class chat they use 
---
i still know the class leader that interviewed and handled me from vanilla.
---
so yeah they make sure the class is sorted , help them and reduce the number of people the gm needs to deal with. 
---
you want as many people as possible helping with stuff because 40+ people can be insane to manage
---
CAW...
---
IT'S BLUE!?
---
(As someone who played Shaman in Vanilla, this was nostalgic,
---
As someone who just woke up after a 13.5hr sleep, this was surreal to experience lol)
---
Never forget they promoted that guy
---
Can a boy have a dream...  :'(
---
they were only a complete joke in pve. can't think of any that you couldn't pvp with
---
We haven't gone that far back. Thrall was a useful fool. He has outlived his usefulness however.
---
That happens to me if i'm doing something that requires attention yes, but I just mute the stream. 
---
I always have something in the background while playing, I don't know. But when I'm leveling and just killing mobs or farming it doesn't bother me. And it's great to have something to do while flying!
---
Just wasn't sure what they are doing with the servers is all since there's been no official word with the layering or sharing whatever it's called
---
yes exactly, thats how its used to be in retail aswell. but offensive discussion based on the assumption that blizzard makes layer-switching as exploitable/easy as possible are just pointless imo...
---
Not all launchers are showing it. There’s a bug for people with multiple PTR accounts on their BNet.
---
Fuck that. I'm gonna go bash my level 5 face into Hogger multiple times.
---
&gt; Its VC. Always has been. Ways will be.
---
I am simply baffled by your logic. You start by saying it was always VC and then you say it had to be changed to avoid confusion. So I'd like to hear what was the abbreviation for deadmines that you yourself used first?
---
:D this sounds amusing and I'm on board hopefully I won't be the only troll there!
---
le sigh
---
Well it's for when the devs are in the office ready to observe, which sadly is night for the Europeans. The launch is going to be phased according to time zones.
---
I started in Cata and I don't think like that, I'll have fun with classic just like I had with all the expansions.
---
It has been 15 years since the beautiful days of elementalist pvp mage. Rank 1 frostbolts, scorches, cold snaps and brutal snares and roots - blast wave for that final burst. Amazing playstyle and so good to see it's still as brutal as it ever was against melee classes.
---
NO! VC is the correct abbreviation. DM is Dire Maul, you heathens.
---
The 10% is from Honored, not Revered.
---
&gt;need about 4200 less carapace fragments for the scepter quest.
---
My sides.
---
I think it's a holdover from older MMOs like Ultima or EQ.
---
The OP did
---
And if everybody had that mentality, they wouldn't exist.  If you like the fact that streamers exist, you should thank those "pathetic" people for making it happen for you.
---
diaf
---
Thank you dude
---
The original death knights were also human corpses with orc souls bonded to them.
---
Ahh now i get it. I thought you thought you missed it because of the server showing offline. 
---
Maybe you should be clearer in your wording and less hostile my friend. But hey be angry be my guest.
---
Thanks pal
---
The only way to get flagged in classic is to:
---
1. Travel to a contested zone
---
2. Travel to a zone that the opposing faction controls.
---
3. Toggle pvp with /pvp
---
4. Attack someone of the opposing faction that is pvp tagged
---
I might have forgotten some, don't @ me.
---
Oh man, so they got their sub numbers up enough so no need to keep the allure of a beta invite, well they at least got me, bought 6 months hoping for an invite.
---
Arthas called it VC
---
Take that retail Karen.
---
Correct abbreviation, lok'tar Ogar.
---
Just to let everyone know I mean no offense to those who started in cata it’s mainly just for laughs for the vets. I do the same for the man/nco/snco Facebook page.
---
Correct
---
and also because it's fun to stir the pot here ;)
---
I'm playing a Paladin on the beta. No interrupt, obviously. Started running away from one of these, only to pull two more on my way out of Moonbrook. Had to pop Lay on Hands (Hello, 60 minute CD!) and then Divine Protection to get out of there. Can confirm they do indeed hit like a freaking train.
---
That is quite a grind. Mobs in the plague lands and instances stop giving rep at honored, elites stop at revered. Only bosses continue on to exalted.
---
I like the idea of splitting timelines. When do you propose we kill off Thrall?  
---
Just after the fall of deathwing?
---
net, rocket helm
---
I love these! I wish this was a gameplay art
---
And fire departments, libraries, schools etc.
---
In one hour you can log in, get to level 5, and level fishing.
---
Basically 75% vote to screw up the remaining 25%. And after few years, these 25% asked for "true vanilla" and they get laughed at. But since they are minority now, they don't matter. Like us back in Cata when we asked about Vanilla again. Because at the time apparently "cata has enough players, Vanilla isn't worth it".
---
Lvl 5 Hogger raid? Count me in!

What the client says on the launcher doesn't tell you anything *everyone* who has either beta or stress test access has the same client, which is called "Beta and Stress test."  
---
The only way to know what you actually have access too is to download the client, open it up, and see what servers you have access too.  If you have access to beta and stress test servers, congrats.  If you have access to stress test servers only, now you know.
---
Extra large F for the fellas who subbed in desperation trying to increase the chance for an invite.
---
But if you get invited there's no reason for you to sub

Geared lvl 23 tank, getting hit for about 120 damage when its a normal hit (240+ when it crit). Tips was crit for 300 with less gear and red gear.
---
Whoa no love for my boi Esfand
---
&gt; Edit: And of course, you cant forget the big reason that a lot of game design has gotten more "convenient" over the years. Making things more convenient has a short term positive impact, if i take LFG as an example. The people who played when auto dungeon teleporting was introduced must have loved it at that moment. Almost everyone. But over time many of them have probably come to realize that when making the dungeon experience "more convenient" they also lost something.
---
I think it depends on the change. Dungeon teleporting wasn't so much the issue as the dungeon finder destroying server communities was.
---
Some QoL changes were really amazing back in the day, like the addition of Dual Spec. Respec costs are going to be the real test for me personally, because of how incompatible some talent builds are between raiding and PvP.
---
The person you're arguing with is a capital G Gamer.
---
Ok but asmongold isn't pulling 70-100k viewers when he's playing any other game... This is all due to WoW Classic hype, don't be foolish.
---
The progression of these make me feel like I’m leveling an undead toon again. You hit on really memorable images. Thanks for that early gift.
---
Venruki played Vanilla.  He was in my guild.
---
Can I remove them myself? I have a couple random PTRs
---
? They didn't gaurantee anything for subbing. Not sure what you expected when it's a chance
---
So Brave.
---
This has to be a meme right?
---
Dude, we called it VC back in vanilla.
---
&gt;But the server cap will be 10k and you will have layers for that. 
---
No it wont. You are pulling this out of your ass. Where is this stated? Do you actually have a source?
---
&gt; Which is what I was originally saying before you came saying I didn’t know what I was talking about. 
---
You don't, you're making stuff up.
---
&gt; Edit: which isn’t bad, that’s why I said it was “bad”. Bad is the 10k pserver clusterfuck. 
---
It's already bad with Vanilla pop limits. Which is the entire reason they were even considering using Sharding in the first place. See my other response with links to a youtube video with Ion and a Blue post saying exactly this. 
---
And on the Pserver thing, Classic \*\*will not\*\* have a 10k limit, for the exact reasons I listed above. 10k is too many for a Vanilla server. Nothing to do with hardware limitations. It's about server community. Rare material (Black Lotus and Thorium) and WOrld bosses.
---
Blizzard, blizzard never change.   
---
Maybe there is a 3d chess move in waiting for a week to clarify their closed beta invitation's objective but I will stay with the impression that they have their head in their ass.
---
Nah, let deathwing have his fun. By Cata era if we make Garrosh warchief in TBC. We'll have many worlds by then. We leave the alliance on azeroth, and let of DW lay down the beats.
---
We have a winner. Thank you so much
---
you seem to see layering/sharding/phasing as the same word? i clearly differentiated between layering and sharding...  
---
again:  initially they wanted to implement SHARDING to alleviate zone load, which they have disregarded.  
---
now:  its LAYERING for a healthy population in the long term, so we dont have 300 servers with 1,2k people on each server...
---
there wont be an open beta 
---
source : there are 3 more stress tests which they would not need if there was an open beta
---
Woo! I got invited a couple hours ago and all downloaded and ready to go!
---
Dude! Start streaming! I'll watch! Then you can help me get in too!
---
What scenario we're you in where you had to draw something with broken hands
---
maybe playing could be the reason ?
---
I remember finally getting Benediction, worked so hard on that and was such an amazing feeling to finally finish it.
---
he's saying that launch will be like an open beta since it will be filled with bugs(due to having so few beta testers, and the ones that are in the beta are people like t ips out)
---
Dont forget its 2 hours stress test + 24 hours + a even in the last two hours.
---
Told my fiance ahead of time she is gonna be neglected. I'm considerate and in total control of the situation. Catheter installment is gonna be a yikesy tho
---
i live my life in 60 day intervals
---
Servers go online at Midnight 00:00 GMT:UTC or 18:00 PDT. Gonna be a big rush if people, hence stress test.
---
They sold physical game cards and in at least Europe those cards came in an actual full sized disc box. Not sure if you can still buy those, but I think someone mentioned they were still available in Germany.
---
The gold is effectively burned. I sold materials to acquire gold from other players, which I then never put back into the economy. It's removed from the economy. It's a sink.  
---
With WoW tokens, I'd buy up tokens. That's money back into circulation. I'm now a faucet.  
---
It's so hard not to get banned on this sub because people like you exist.
---
Jokes on you, I normally go to sleep at 4am.
---
Lmfaoooo
---
Ultimate my arse. Where's the DM (I'm OCE) option?
---
Really? No head?
---
Man, the Retail streamers are fucked.
---
What? I highly doubt they'd push back release, especially so soon after announcing a release date.
---
No he must get pussy because that dude can’t
---
Did you get in?
---
Private server here. I'm playing a druid and my friend is a rogue. We LOVE having shamans in our group. Windfury kicks ass when you have a solid melee group.
---
Haven't seen anyone Boomkin yet but the population isn't that large. I'm sure you will see some in Classic.
---
yeah, i was there yesterday and some dude was spamming about how they should heavily increase the damage/difficulty for an "authentic vanilla experience", as if Blizzard recreating the values from 1.12 isn't "authentic" because it's not as hard as he remembers it being when he was 13.
---
If only I could draw :(
---
What a sheep. You can buy champions for real life money. That is literally pay2win as it gets.
---
All the proof I needed to not play on a streamer server.
---
Well I’m glad that developer pushed for it, because the PvP aspect is what drew me to the game 😋
---
Man you are level 5, and still use the same skills from level 1. Where is battle shout, rend?
---
Eh we can all see it, but being edgy and throwing insults stops being funny after middle school for most people.
---
Paladins are a few changes away from being a great class design in vanilla IMO. What they need is a taunt and probably one on use DPS ability that isn't judgement. Hunters are good period, their rotation is very demanding when talking raid DPS though and they do not scale all that well. Druids are also great with the exception that they need to actually be good for real at something. Right now they are pretty much the worst healer, they are decent tanks and have a spot both in raids and 5 mans, melee dps is pretty good but also demand "abuse" of Manual Crowd Pummeler and powershifting, balance is kinda bad outside of fun sub optimal PvP spec but there is something there. If they where just considerd good at one of those things they would be a great class which really do use all of it's tools.
---
IF you don't want to be "stuck" for 4 years, then quit. You are asking for changes that won't simply add content, you ask for changes. And don't tell people what they want, because that's all im getting out of this post.
---
Even people that want OSRS (which i don't) have better arguments than you.
---
Agreed!
---
As of right now? I'm afraid not. However, if I see enough interest and I think that there's a chance that this idea will take off then I won't hesitate to create an official Discord for the future guild right away! (: Just waiting a little longer to see how many people would be willing to join. (Y)
---
That's how you get better at something, mate. Practice.
---
If you are serious, would you mind letting me know what kind of pick pocket values you are getting off of mobs in the beta?
---
&gt; of PvP skirmishes. But I hated the gear issues. It's
---
Good question, would also like to know.
---
Yes it does... it moved and its hard to find. I looked for it when I was looking to find any update or beta settings changes for classic months ago. Was digging through for a few minutes and found my specs as they have them. 
---
Also to note you would have to prompt it to update your specs for betas back in the day but it takes them every time you log now. Mine showed hardware changes I had recently made.
---
Pretty sure seal had a WAY higher proc rate which meant the occurrence of getting utterly obliterated by a double crit (like said clip) was much, MUCH higher than getting triple-crit windfuried. 
---
Plus shamans were kinda weird garbo in pvp after the diminishing returns nerf on frost shock. They used to be disgusting before that as they just shat on melee classes going 30/0/21, and enh only got a bit of attention in PvP after (I think) Alterac Valley was released and they started getting access to the unstoppable force en masse, as shamans were unlikely to be given DKP priority on those weapons in raids.
---
Enh shaman and ret paladin were very similar in playstyle, but the frequency of getting BOPT by an enh shaman were much lower. People used to laugh so hard if they got a bad roll on their windfury procs because they effectively just dropped dead on the spot, whereas paladins were at least durable if they didn't get decent procs. 
---
And yeah, even on a mage the armor thing mentioned by /u/final21 was relevant too because they only have frost armor. That means he's probably pushing between 25% to 30% DR, which you can see by the damage of the Proc and the auto attack crit being near identical in damage. Holy resist is not a thing on gear.
---
Is anyone surprised?
---
I wanted to list more, but I felt like a single instance of where taxes go looked for elegant. I do like your list though haha
---
Just as he uses Arcane Explosion for the first time, you can see something very weird happening with Wtfmaan's nameplate.
---
Or they played before DM came out and called it VC anyway.
---
For me it's not about the confusing abbreviation. I just prefer the abbreviation VC.
---
On the one hand streamer servers are cancer for shit like this entitled asshole. On the other, it looks like a lot fun to mess with them :)
---
I’m sure more people subbed for than chance to get invited than the other way round. The amount of invites can’t be more than a few thousand, but I’m sure that much more than that resubbed for classic.
---
DEUS VULT INFIDEL
---
Personal experience, I was exalted with AD when Naxx released and this was before we knew what the attunment took.
---
Publish a book of these and I will buy it

Most guilds will run DKP till AQ40. DKP makes people show up for gear and donate to the guild bank for extra DKP. By AQ40 you can swap to loot council to see who actually deserves loot.
---
This morning my wife told me we’re having another baby! 
---
No beta invite though...
---
Eh not really, the top two streamers for WoW make up nearly 2/3 of the viewer total. Fortnite is about 20%
---
keep dreaming my friend...
---
attitudes don't change - streamers live in a warped version of reality where arrogance is applauded
---
We could also launch an alternate plan where we remove Chris Metzen so we can get something done without needing green Jesus.
---
Update, actually got the e-mail as well but it came way later lol.
---
Yeah but I follow a lot of big streamers and I have like 2 or 3 that arent planning on playing WoW Classic. I wouldnt be surprised if we saw WoW up at like 500k+ minimum tbh.
---
Frostbolt Rank 1 had a 1.5 sec cast time though and slowed the same as max rank!
---
Thanks mate.
---
Yeah, sorry about that. Thought I was quite clear but as always, the receiver of the message is the one to judge that. I'm just a bit disappointed and took it out on you a bit. But I still think Blizzard should have made sure that the e-mails would have arrived sooner. I'm lucky to have a fast connection so the download wasn't really any wasted time, but it might have been for others.
---
Get your comments in now before the streamer fanboy homos flood in
---
Ninja looted and got kicked seems like classic to me.
---
Dude, how will you play Diablo Immortal now?!
---
That was S tier of hype.
---
GUYS CLASSIC IS LIKE RLY HARD, YOU HAVE TO ACTUALLY WORK FOR LOOT, BFA IS SO BAD U CAN JUST BUY LEVEL 120 THATS WHY I LOVE CLASSIC BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR EVERYTHING WAIT WHAT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN SOMEONES LOOTING MY CHEST? WTFFF!!!! KICK THAT ASSHOLE! KICK HIM NOWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
---
The guy who got kicked is probably pretty upset and it's just a joke to this guy. And somehow our hatred of streamers is "unfounded"  
---
Said it before, they're cancer. &lt;Oncology&gt; recruiting now.
---

Alliance Burning Blade and Mug'thol - VC
---
The guy who took the chest messaged him afterwards talking shit. Don't feel sorry for him. He was trolling on purpose
---
There was an episode of Cheat! where they went over one of the TBC dungeons and how to defeat the bosses. It got me to install a private server because no way were my parents paying that much for a game. Fuck, I miss G4.
---
Yep, 75% of the people telling the rest to go home. Whats your opinion on people in OSRS that want "true vanilla" osrs?
---
The answers they get are the same we used to get in Cataclysm "sorry guys, you aren't woth it". Exactly the same shit. Guess it didn't play out in the end. Im willing to bet that same cycle will repeat for OSRS eventually.
---
Mob rule in wow is a bad idea.
---
To this day I think Cataclysm was the best expansion for PvP. WOTLK was really good too, but the damage was too bursty for a lot of the expansion. Cataclysm was a slightly slower pace, had a lot of depth to the class mechanics, and was the last expansion before they started to go waist deep with the ability removal. MOP they were up to the shoulders, and in WoD they were basically up to the nose gasping for air.
---
If you ever want to know how not to record yourself, watch this video!
---
I feel like this is the type of behavior that shows why this sub hates streamers
---
Well that escalated quickly.
---
I think most people who are watching don’t have access to the beta (like me) and just filling the void until the day comes.
---
I played a hunter to 57 and never logged on him again until BC because it was so boring. It almost made me quit wow completely. I made a mage and never looked back. Hunter and pally are the two most boring classes in vanilla.
---

Love these Mr. Foe. Plz keep it up
---
You should report that bug, btw.  TF shouldn't be dropping off monsters.
---
I watched that one too lol, it's on YouTube.
---
people have been banned for it, even when it wasnt doing any automation.
---
Its very easily detected anyway...
---
Maybe not if you are going for speed runs and min maxing. But enjoy classic for what it’s meant to be, whether that’s running 5 shamans in WC or 4 priests and a holy paladin.
---
Hi, /u/King7y
---
As a person who played in the original beta on a NA server, I've NEVER heard Deadmines referred to as VC. It's always been DM.
---
The following is referring to using mostly cat form in PvP: 
---
I played a feral druid all the way to level 58 on a blizzlike private server, and I consider myself to be a pretty good PvPer. I would absolutely not recommend it. I didn't really do much research into how good ferals would be, so I went in kinda blind. IMO the easiest way to see why cat form is bad in PvP is to just compare it to a rogue. You guys do about equal single target DPS ONLY if you are using all of your mana to powershift with Wolfshead Helm. Otherwise the rogue will do way more damage. But the rogue also has vanish, stuns, blind, gouge, kick. For control, you have... pounce, war stomp if horde, bash/feral charge if you wanna switch to bear for a second and waste a shit ton of mana and 3 globals for a 5 second stun and the going back to cat. Practically no utility whatsoever until you switch out of cat form, at which point, why are you even playing feral?
---
You can switch to bear and have better exchanges against melee classes, but idk, to me, auto attacking, mauling and then hitting an occasional bash as my 2 buttons doesn't sound that fun to me. And even doing that, you're still going to lose unless you pop out and heal yourself when you get low. I feel like at that point you may as well be playing the resto/balance hybrid spec that Stormlingx uses. You'll still do decent damage in bear with no talents in feral, along with damage from dots and you have way more mana to cast with.
---
In a group PvP setting, everyone knows that Druids in cat form are pretty limited in terms of defensive CDs, and are squishy since they have leather armor ratings. So the second you pop out of stealth, EVERYONE is going to jump on you, and you're going to die quickly. If there's a warlock in the enemy group, you might as well just leave, since you get fucked so hard by death coil into fear.
---
With all of that being said, playing PvE on a feral is very fun and satisfying because when you get your Wolfshead Helm at 40, you get to press a lot of buttons and you're rewarded for pressing them fast and in the right order. I was usually far ahead of my peers on the damage meters when DPSing dungeons which gave me the hope that I'd be able to shred people in PvP. Not the case, unfortunately.
---
CAN WE MAKE ANOTHER SUBREDDIT FOR GARBAGE WOW DRAMA?
---
Yeah no worries i get it man. Been there done that.
---
sure but marm is a arena only player
---
I know there's many examples of a certain talent build being preferred in either PvE or PvP, but not both. Are there any classes that have builds that do well in both without the need to respec to see a noticeable performance increase?
---
Are there (or if you know, will there be) any detailed deep dives into class performance in PvE, and various forms of PvP? I found the "Life at 60" link to be more of story-time show and tell threads, and the "Picking your class" link to be very... fluffy, in terms of class performance. Someone in another thread linked me to a [World PvP guide](https://barrens.chat/viewtopic.php?f=15&amp;t=903), which included some very nice class performance description/ratings, however obviously there's nothing in there about smaller scale/1vX pvp, or PvE. I'd really love to read some deep dives into vanilla class performance (especially smaller scale PvP), but just can't find anything that gets into the specifics.
---
I could of swore at one time she had an actual banshee body....
---
Would if I could but I’m an MBA student and the class meets once a week, gotta do it.
---
Classic is all about drama though, #nochanges
---
After soda raged at him you mean? It was his chest, he won it, why should this autistic man child get the chest? You snooze you lose, and that's even more embarrassing when you have 40 children aiding you at it.
---
I bloody love these posts
---
Rolled on Spinebreaker a few weeks after launch, DM was what we called it.
---
Of course this subreddit jumps immediately on the anti streamer circlejerk. That gkick was more in fun, the mage ninjalooted the arena chest for which soda formed a raidgroup. Soda wasn't really pissed, that was all just joking, he was expecting a ninjaloot from someone because it was a pretty hectic arena fight
---
I wonder how much they made with all of the new subs for beta invites
---
Now i have it. Just took them a while.
---
THats literally the picture I had in my mind.
---
This is why I'm not going pvp this time around. I'm just not able to keep up with this kind of player.
---
Poop in a hat and wear it.
---
They think they are Gods lol please GTFO me away from all of these streamers.
---
THIS ISN'T EVEN HALF OF WHAT I'M CAPABLE OF. 4AM STRESS TEST. BRING IT BLIZZARD. I AM HERE. I REPRESENT FRANCE AND WE ARE READY.
---
Fine by me.
---
The amount of info theyre receiving right now and actioning seems substabtual. More than on the BfA beta for sure.
---
Its a beta, im enjoying watching streamers have fun and its a nice teaser to get me hype but im in no rush to make a char thatll get wiped in the 3 months.
---
Get it done right blizz! Youre doin good so far.
---
&gt;you seem to see layering/sharding/phasing as the same word?
---
No, it was just a reference to what initially started anything to do with Sharding/Layering. None of the actual examples and sources I've given are about Sharding, they are about Layering. 
---
&gt; now: its LAYERING for a healthy population in the long term, so we dont have 300 servers with 1,2k people on each server... 
---
And they have, in no way, confirmed how they are going to handle the removal of Layering. If, upon removal of Layering, a server has a Low pop, they can merge it with another low pop server. Also, there are plenty of people who prefer a lower pop server to a higher pop. 10k is waaaay too many people for a Vanilla server. Again, nothing to do with hardware limitations, purely about resource availability by Vanilla standards.
---
[Here is yt channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/wedwmv) 
---
He has tons of stuff and he play different classes.
---
I get it. I'm the same way. But, I'm on the other side of the coin: I resubbed my account just for the chance for beta.
---
I played vanilla, and I haven't played retail seriously since WotLK, so I really just can't wait to get back into it all, even realizing I'll have to start all over come release. Oh well! I've been waxing poetic about vanilla for years, it is high time for me to finally see how rose-colored my glasses really are.
---
Enough streamers have it for free advertising already, the only thing more does is increase the likelyhood people will burn out either by playing beta too much or making them (those who haven't played before, or haven't in a very long time) realise classic isn't for them.
---
No, it doesn't because champions don't give you an advantage.  Just because I own (and didn't pay real money for a single one) all champs doesn't give me any advantage over someone who owns 10 champions.  I'm average at LoL and someone with a higher skill/more experience on their 10 champs will stomp the shit out of me.  That is literally NOT pay to win.  Oh wow, I can pick a different champion, but guess what, we still start with 500 gold at level 1 with neither of us having an advantage.
---
Not sure why people here are saying this just happened because streamers.
---
Anyone who ninja loots in a guild would get kicked, whether it's a streamer guild or not.
---
Oh look, a reason why I'd hate a popular streamer being on my server #10292.
---
Yeah, I mean PinkSparkles even went so far as to date him.
---
This could be taken 2 pretty different ways xD
---
Outside of streamers and their friends who even got an invite? Seems like this "beta" is all just a hype stunt. Almost nobody is doing any actual testing, all they care about is getting lots of viewers. 
---
Honestly if they keep this up until late August it might backfire on them. People will get sick of it by then and all the hype will deflate.
---

Give me ur account info I’ll let you know /s
---
I'll make sure to update you
---
I used to draw comics in paint for another game I played. Just takes patience.
---
The joke is that release will be like an open beta since they won't have enough testers in the actual beta.
---
I mean, you're the one that started the e-shouting by giving an aggressive and dismissive response...
---
It's becoming more and more alarming how over hyped a closed beta and even the stress test has become. The point of the tests are becoming more and more clouded by people who just want to treat it like an open beta. 
---
I got into the stress test and can easily say I was very meh about it because im hyped about actually playing the game not alpha's /beta's and stress tests. 
---
Im glad they came out and finally said they are stopping invites because people clearly don't understand the point of what they are doing.
---
we at least had realm forums for this kind of childish shit
---
OP just wants everyone else to wait until week 2 so he can be 1 week ahead of everyone.
---
Torturing pokers with dual +15 agi enchants on my 29 twink rogue....god i cant fucking wait to blow people up lol
---
Doesn't it also pre-date the popularity of DM as 'direct message', which somehow supplaned IM 'instant message' at some point in the last fifteen years.
---
People thinking it will be fun to play in a streamer guild omegaLUL. Good luck ever progressing.
---
They already stated that tokens will not be in classic
---
so beta players don't get to keep their stuff? I am relieved.
---
Stress test is only for 1 day and you can’t go past level 5 though.
---
DM = Deadmines. DM+N,W,E=Dire Maul.
---
Dont worry. You can play the launch and through the initial months of hype of the wow classic release . Just to then grind out your reputation with your baby. Dont worry again, you usually start at friendly . Just be careful around level 13. Things get tricky starting there
---
Prepare for insane lvl 1-5 PvP battles
---
Seriously? Tokens destroyed the economy in retail.
---
The door is that way, please use it.
---
st cloud REEEEEEEEEEEE
---
I know :(
---
they will be stress testing the players
---
What class should I play for the stress test? I'm interested in Hogger raids and world pvp. I'm worried that I'm not ready to commit to a class for the long haul
---
I think you need it to even be invited to it.
---
I'm calling shenanigans.
---
I have a feeling they want just enough in so that everything they want tested gets tested - part of the charm of classic is the leveling up experience. Most people only do that once.
---
If they invite half of the WoW population for a 3 month long classic binge before it's release... a lot may choose not do it for real. I'm sure there will be a large open beta early August.
---
You'll enjoy it more if you just wait till release, kinda reluctant to jump in beta myself (if i had the option)
---
Yeah idk what that guy is smoking. Holy and Prot were in a great spot during TBC, while Ret was... in a special place.
---
Received the email, but not showing in battle.net client. 
---
I have two PTR ‘licences’, a main account and two starter accounts. 
---
Should I contact blizz or wait?
---
Clearly you dont have a good grasp on this problem.
---
The only time that matters is after dire maul.
---
since then i have only exclusively used VC.
---
It was 3rd overall last night and didn’t have either streaming.
---
Won't be an issue however Shadow priest is really lackluster to play when you go OOM all the time. Personally I'd much rather heal.
---
I'd have to leave work, to change pants.
---
What private server u playing on? Me and some homies just want to get to know the game again before release.
---
? If they got access to the beta, I don't think you need a sub to be able to actually sign in + play on it
---
Yes making poisons, pickpocketing (with which you can open closed doors too), needing reagents for vanish (vendor), blind (herbs) and you can cook thistle tea from herbs that gives you energy.
---
All will be in classic.
---
Being able to purchase tokens to sell for gold caused extreme inflation. Prices went up for items drastically.
---
Tbh they are all pretty trash, i like preach but hes not hugely on the classic hype train
---
money is money, and for content I don't care how much these people work if I get what I want.
---
He literally formed a raidgroup to get his 12. trinket,
---
everyone was fine with it and had fun.
---
And 1 guy ninjad it.
---
Your anti Streamer Meta doesnt work on this one
---
So it sounds like the chances of getting into the full Classic beta are going to become much smaller now. There will still be the other stress test phases, but those are limited in time and level. 
---
I was hoping to have beta access, but it's not looking too promising now. So I'll have to find something to keep me busy until August 27th.
---
Priest, pally and mage. Roughly in that order
---
What is this stress test? Can anyone explain please?
---
I think mages mostly will offer after a run. But they will expect a tip or charge. They will most definitely charge from Sillithus because people set their hearthstones there!  :)

Your post has been automatically removed because you used a keyword which is reserved for the subreddit moderators.
---
Ah, I see. Should've guessed then.
---
Streamers wont play classic that long. How they play will get old and boring. Literally defeats the point and fun in classic, similar to cheat codes in certain games.
---
Stress test server closes at 4pm tomorrow, but the main stress testing phase will be 4pm to 6pm pst today
---
There's still a huge difference in APM. Vanilla required more thought and effort when it came to gear and consumables, not how fast you could spam Shadowbolt or Frostbolt. Noobs in vanilla will be unenchanted with zero consumables and zero consideration of what the term BiS means.

How does the weapon skill help with PvP?
---
I think that’s fair. The dudes hating are probably just thirsty af.
---
Played on EU servers my whole life and never heard anyone say DD until I started on private servers and figured it as a US thing!
---
I've also almost never seen anyone refer to Deadmines as anything other than DM, except for a few rare occasions on private servers. (which I also assumed was from US people)
---
you could buy runes for very long time which were direct power increase  
---
even buying champs is pretty p2w in itself
---
^this
---
Uhh no pussy is sub par to world of Warcraft classic sir.
---
Only downsides to warrior is raiding is last on the priority list, and if he wants to pvp and pve, he's going to need to respec a lot (assuming he wants to run fury/fury tank for dungeons/raids and arms for pvp)
---
Basically, putting as many players possible in an area, and see how much the servers can handle.
---
I’m a senior software engineer and 100% understand why the point of a closed beta is and what they are trying to accomplish. 
---
That doesn’t mean I’m not hyped for a beta invite or not hyped about my stress test invite. 
---
If you’re invited you can enjoy it however you want to. This may shock you but not everyone feels the same way as you. 
---
As for not getting burnt out, there’s plenty of us who haven’t gotten burnt out after 15 years so yeah just keep spouting bullshit.
---
LOL @ paladin teal dress. It’s so true!
---
Stuck between Hunter and Warlock. Plan to play "seriously" and will hit 60 in the first 14 days.  I know most of what needs to be known to make the decision, I just cant make it. 
---
Leaning Hunter for better pet mechanics and being able to res-and-go in BGs as opposed to a Warlocks res and setup.
---
I can't help but try messaging mrgm on twitter or when he is streaming, pretty sure he has this addon working or something similar as he's using the short bar shown in the screenshot.
---
I could have sworn it came out during wotlk. That's when they changed the website and launcher etc
---
Plenty of time to get that kid up for adoption, shouldn’t affect your leveling if you get going quickly.
---
Do you really think they are going to launch with 3k realm caps and apply layering to those realms? So what 1k per layer?
---
Are you sure? I googled it and only found that they have not taken a stance on it.
---
Thanks for the information :)
---
Haha I hope this is trolling. Homeboy misspelled knowledge and intelligence
---
&gt;so while iLVL is in the game, it doesnt necessarily mean anything.
---
A socket is currently worth 15 item levels at the moment in retail. Different secondary stats greatly impact the value of an item and it was even worse in Legion.
---
Item level is still not the best determinant in whether something is an upgrade which is why everyone still sims their gear.
---
GG
---
I'm calling remove layering and flagging everybody as hostile. THOUSANDS Of hostile players crammed in starting zones :D
---
PvP server. Might go rogue though.

---
tbf in 3 months everyone's beta characters will disappear but these sick illustrations will still exist
---
So for (most of) EU users stress test is until 3 AM and I have to be wake at 5 AM. Talk about being fair. Why couldn´t the test start 1 hour sooner? I really need sleep but this shit is hyping me AF. :/
---
Gearing for healing won't be hard since most guilds fun with few druid healers. When they got their tier pieces you'll have an easy time. Also when ZG/AQ20 is out you'll fill up whatever you're missing.
---
However I imagine gearing for dps is a totally different story competing with warriors and rogues. Very unlikely.
---
I started in Vanilla and I'm excited for classic.
---
He’s just the best there ever was simple as that. Back in vanilla and BC he was legendary for beating classes people thought mages shouldn’t like rogues and locks
---
All Druids could do was starfire, entagle roots and wrath then sit in bear form. It got better as you got better gear but then you became a healer This patch I believe they started to itemize for hybrid specs. They changed the talents around if you look at the original talent tree its all over the place.
---
how the fuck did this guy get in
---
Yeah because he has thousands watching him. It’s easy to infuence because you’re “popular”. It’s a joke
---
There were way more than just 1 guy trying to grab the chest.
---
was it understood within the raid group that he had priority on trinket?
---
The test runs for 24 hours, it is only the focused stress test that lasts 2 hours.
---
they changed the launcher and user names and such, but b.net was always there ;)
---

Do you have 2 beta clients installed per chance? If so maybe you're in the last wave of people getting stuff now
---
I would like to see a single example of a random person getting an invite to the closed beta. It's all just streamers or friends of streamers.
---
Learn something new every day...
---
I started in W3 and im hyped for classic.
---
It’s from an well known troll
---
Like it.
---
Spot on mate!
---
Blizzard is the best at making me extremely happy and extremely sad all at the same time. Bravo.
---
We really gotta point out how this happens to every game upon release or beta launch. How this will go away real fast after about two months of release.
---
JAB is right. You think you do, but you dont. I've already seen people on twitch complaining about the lack of QoL features that retail has. People that didn't play vanilla will HATE classic. Those are the people JAB was talking about.
---
Don’t adapt and you’ll have nobody playing anyway.
---
Exactly. As much as I want to play the Beta, there's a very good chance I'd burn myself out before release. If anything, it's for the best I don't get Beta because when it finally does come out, it's going to be an even more intense couple months - especially since your character won't get deleted.
---
I played in Legion and BfA (after quitting in pre-wotlk) and i cant say i had much problem buying anything on the AH in any of the expansions.
---
Prices adjust with supply and demand. If one person loses 5k gold and another player gains 5k gold the supply remains the same and the demand remains the same so prices stay the same.
---
What may have inflated in prices are the super rare things like mounts or transmogs that are really hard to come by. Since people who really really want them can "buy gold" to outbid everyone else.
---
But common stuff like crafting materials, gems, enchantments, consumables etc. are unaffected by WoW tokens.
---
Thanks mate!

---
Not a change to the actual game......LMAOWTFSTFU
---
No there won't. However Paladins are much better. Ideally you don't want more than 2 druid healers. HoTs don't stack.
---
Also Paladins are fine healing as ret while leveling. Just slap on some int gear.
---
It runs for 24 hours.  The focused part of the stress test is the only part that lasts two hours.
---
compared to the I put my dots on you and will now drain life until you are dead unbeatable raid boss that is SL lock it is very skill intensive. Yes, I'm very much exaggerating and I have been a mostly lock main all the way from vanilla. But SL is almost like super basic version of warlock that just out gears everyone, that is what they feel like. They are just so tanky that nothing can kill them in 1v1 and they just outlast you while doing nothing, if you decide that you don't want to take the fight they can never chase you down and kill you ether.

https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/bq5mpn/all_the_pros_and_cons_of_the_tauren_hitbox/
---
Lots of good info there about Tauren. I'd assume based on this that the minimum distance for Charge is increased as well as the max:
---
"4: In smaller confines and rooms, the increased maximum range given to Tauren is made irrelevant, and forces Tauren casters and Hunters to stand closer to melee range than other races. In such situations, Tauren Hunters may even be prevented from using their ranged abilities entirely."
---
LOL. this sub still goona defend streamers? Oh wait. Probably because they are 40k view streams and this sub only had 100k.
---
Streamers own this game.
---
See, thats what I though. I thought the stress tests where over a day or 2. But people keep saying 4-6...
---
yeah its not about distance, but if you're outside of the range of things like first blast, CoC and arcExp then he has to spend time casting a frost bolt - which might JUST be enough
---
Me :)))
---
But retail sucks and vanilla is fun :(
---
Or just use [multistre.am](https://multistre.am) It's Squad Streaming, but before Twitch mad Squad streaming. It's also 4 less windows and cleaner.
---
No it isn't. I am in the beta and the vast majority of people aren't streamers.
---
call me when you gather 150k+ gold on classic
---
Why does he have hair?
---
&gt; Classic, Classic+ TBC WotLK PvP/PvE/RP servers for &gt;every&lt; one of these.
---
&gt; Fresh servers for every single one of these, because people also want to simply start over. Servers that stay the same because there are also people that don't want to feel &gt;forced&lt; to complete something in time?
---
That sums it up, yes.
---
&gt; And somehow this sounds like it's possible without tearing up the community?
---
Irrelevant. You assume that the "community" is/will be comprised solely of people who played Classic and that said community will be stagnant. There's over 100 million people who've ever had an active World of Warcraft account. Not everyone liked Vanilla, but liked one or more of BC/Wrath/Cata/etc. Said additional legacy servers might spawn their own communities, comprised in part by some people from Classic, Modern, and returning players. There's nothing wrong with that, and to advocate the stifling of enjoyment for other versions of the game for your own misguided worrying about bifurcation of the community is completely asinine and naive.
---
&gt;  What does "down the line" even mean?
---
Pretty pedantic of you to even ask that, as it should be pretty obvious. For the sake of completeness, I will elaborate. 
---
At some undetermined point in the future (probably several years) where Classic has been played out to exhaustion and there may or may not be a groundswell for further re-release of old expacs, or for the development of new Classic+ content.
---
&gt; You can't make everyone happy, its impossible.
---
Yeah, so we shouldn't bother trying! That sounds sensible /s
---
&gt; 10 versions of WoW will absolutely tear people apart.
---
I shouldn't even bother dignifying that gross assumption with a response, but I might as well. There hasn't even been 10 versions of WoW, first off. Second off... this is likely something that would have to occur gradually and organically with community feedback. Not all at once. This is long-term future what-if stuff here. So stop getting your panties in a bunch over it.

Cookies need love like everything does.
---
Anything is possible if youre brave enough.
---
Warlock if you want easy leveling and pet management followed by more complicated dps and dat portal. Lol shard bag items :(
---
Personally I hated pet management, and easy dps rotation = harder to mess up and do terrible. Ports are not quite as nice as summoning but still nice-  and, dat free water!
---
Both can roll gnomes so you’re good either way really.
---
Real shit was doing Stockades as a horde.
---
No, I think the concept of servers is irrelevant until Layering is done, and we won't have actual servers until it's removed. I'm thinking they are going to do some kind of server merges or something. Even then, if they start servers with 10k pop and layer that, they **will not** have 10k server pops after layering is removed. They are going to have to merge or transfer people either way. Again, 10k is just way too many.
---
Thought i'd add in a Lord of the rings Lighting of the Beacons theme to that Epic Eagle Eye Clip
---
Does anyone know how many hours untill the  stress test opens? pulling my hair out trying to figure it out as a european / stupid person
---
I started in Vietnam and I'm hyped for classic.
---
yeah, 10k is way too high (i didnt say that, the other one did)
---
merging lowpop servers afterwards has a lot of problems with character and guildnames though, this is why they went with layering instead of frostwolf1 frostwolf2 frostwolf3 i think.
---
Just watched it and I still love you man &lt;3
---
He should gather his own army of his viewers as bodyguards to combat the snipers and have massive battles randomly throughout the world. Would be great content
---
1. Pretty much all that can be expected for "testing" is having people play the game as normal and see if they encounter bugs, this is what everyone in the Beta is doing and people are frequently reporting what they run into.
---
2. Blizz isnt telling anyone to sub for a chance at beta, simply they have outlined what the criteria is for being chosen. It wouldnt make sense for them to send out Beta keys to inactive accounts.
---
And 3. Yes it is a "hype" stunt or what is more commonly known as Publicity. Its really good for them not only from a marketing standpoint but also a bug reporting standpoint to have as many eyes as they do watching. Why wouldnt they want streamers playing the Beta? it does far more than just the average player.
---
Im no economist but i think the price of wow tokens are dependant on what people are willing to pay for them. Aka the player economy decides the price.
---
If 150k in BfA has equal purchasing power as 200g in Vanilla then a WoW token in vanilla would cost ~200g.
---
Where do you think the gold comes from?
---
B..but he's a streamer!!! REEEEEEEEE
---
Mage is probably the best pick, but mobtagging is a MUCH better way to power level. Stay ungrouped, let the lowbie tag the mobs with thorns / AoE and then arcane explosion. Lowbie gets full xp for all kills
---
Why does the player base deserve a server list at all?
---
This is why you make friends and have a guild. Provide the materials and they'll craft it for free.
---
get the fuck out me away from all of these streamers?
---
It wasn't a ninja loot.
---
But you will have servers prior to layering being removed.
---
Specs?
---
Pretty sure you spawn with pet in BGs in 1.12 no?
---
The issue would be that you'd then have insane prot pally tanks with both absurd aoe threat and single target threat with taunt wouldn't you?
---
Wtf is VC?
---
You can take on a couple of mobs at the same time easy. Do not underestimate the power of Bear Form, roots, and HoTs. If you feel comfortable tanking in dungeons then keeping your gear up to date is a breeze too.
---
If you are good, then yes. It largely depends on the elite. If you have a way of creating distance while you jump out of Bear Form and throw a quick Rejuv &amp; Regrowth you'll be manage to solo a lot. 
---
If the elite is not immune to roots, gg you win.
---
Yeah the time issue is true for me as well. But can't I form groups fast as a tank. I will be playing with two friends. But for the reasons you mentioned I am considering hunter and warlock heavily. But again I am split between the two.
---
WoW has an ingame economy, you want to inject actual money into that economy. This is some dumbass shit.
---
The poster is actually a youtuber and red is his primary color for his channel. So I imagine the choice for red was less for the eyes and more for his vid quality.
---
Lol fixed
---
Can we get a seperate title for Classic?    
---
It is such a different game, and I'd love to be able to filter the BfA streams away.
---
Yeah? so? you can still pay real life money to get an advantage. Bro, don't you think I know how it works? I have probably played LoL way before you even knew what it was. Same with Dota2 and HoN and even wc3 dota.
---
If you can pay real life money, to unlock a character in a game that someone needs to either grind (a lot, lmao) to unlock then you have an advantage over them just by that. Because you paid for it, with real life money.
---
Pretty sad to be honest that you're defending it. I don't play shit pay2win games because I prefer it to be pure skill and not if I spent 20-30 usd on a new character that just came out that's op.
---
Like in LoL for example.
---
In the official strategy guide by BradyGames under glossary of terms it lists "VC Van Cleef - Boss of Deadmines instance in Wesfall. Sometimes used interchangeably with "Deadmines." (ie. LFG VC is the same as LFG Deadmines.)"
---
This was even before Dire maul was out, and it seemed to differ from server and faction.
---
I believe you can use it to reset password but you would have to have his email. So idk what could be done with it.
---
Lol my favorite video series from classic wow has to be World of Roguecraft.   Speaking of which I may go watch that right now lmao.
---
I just think it's funny how all of these streamers who are high skill make new accounts that have like 15 champs and get right back to where they were in the rankings even though they don't have access to the other 125 champions.  Odd that they can make it that far since it's p2w by purchasing all of the champions.
---
i never talked shit and i stand by what i say, dont i? I hope your day gets better tho than it seems to be :)
---
Oh what a terrible beast it is, look at its sharp teeth and grotesque face.. much worse then Hogger.
---
I'm not defending streamers, I think they're cancer, but this situation was totally different. 
---
It wasn't just some item to drop, think of it as a DKP/Loot Council system. Why would 1 random guy be entitled to ONE arena token when someone else in the guild has 11 (1 less from completing the quest). With that said, the raid was formed with the intent for the leader to get the drop. This is how games worked back then. You reserved items. The arena token was reserved. The mage took it, and he suffered the consequences. Does it matter in the long run? Absolutely not. However, if this WERE classic retail, this would undoubtedly affect this player's reputation.
---
Worst : Hogger in starter zones.
---
Priest? Only if it's a very low level. For anything that's high level like SM Armory/Cath/ZF I'd imagine mage/pally are a lot faster.
---
Wake up to a Banana and some trail mix, Lunch prepackaged sandwich, Dinner, UberEats. Out here living my best life.
---
a lot.
---
SO FUNNY HAHAHHAHAHAHAHHAHAH
---
Are they bad at fresh 60 in PvP as Sm/Ruin?
---
I never heard about VC and I played Vanilla for 2 years+
---
Don't let me forget that if I pick said character nobody else can pick them anyway, so I'm not sure what your point is.  Champ select != victory.
---
The legendary story of two adventurers!
---
Icefoe the Warrior, and his companion.....Bill.
---
15 to get nothing :(
---
This done with mouse or stylist?
---
No it wasn't a DKP /Loot council system.  Lmfao.
---
So much bias.
---
I seriously doubt it's gonna be 18 months before Naxx drops.
---
I mean I don't either so if you want I could
---
This looks like Karazhan in low graphics.
---
I'm specifically refering to classic WoW.
---
Warden doesn't read the memory outside it's own process. It would need admin privileges for that.
---
lol GOTEMMM
---
Dunno, I was on multiple servers early in vanilla and always heard DM.
---
It wasn’t only streamers who got in. I got in and have never streamed. They said there are a variety of factors.
---
I have an extra monitor, I should learn how to set that up lol
---
The entire stress test will be Asmongold vs. Sodapoppin fans so I wouldn’t even worry about trying to group up or doing anything.
---
He has Soviet in his name, that sort of implies why he's upset about people spending money in the way that they want to
---
https://discord.gg/Gh5qnt
---
Here :)
---
Someone said it was maybe I'm getting mixed up
---
Asmond, Esfand, and Soda all need to be on different servers or else the server is gonna die
---
The problem with this is, im in europe but i started playing in the us servers before the us servers opened. And i didnt create a new account until really late. So im missing the benefits of actually playing since done because they didn’t have European servers at the same time with US :/ feels sad
---
It might have been a server specific thing, but I can't recall seeing someone refer to it as "DM" during Vanilla. I've been playing since open beta and I only ever saw "Deadmines" or "VC". It doesn't have to make sense, but that's what people called it.
---
I'll probably don't play too much due to real life / girlfriend / work / studying. But if I had to prepare myself heavily I'd go with something like:  
---
Snack:
---
\- Fruits, a sack of apples and oranges, maybe something more fancy depending on availability and craving. (e.g. Mango, Pineapple, Figs or Kaki).  
---
\- Yoghurt or Skyr, maybe a couple of Kefir's  
---
Breakfast:
---
\- 2x12 Eggs + fitting veggies for omelettes, (e.g. Spring onions, Paprika, Tomatos) and some Sheep cheese.  
---
\- Cereal / Porridge + a couple cartons of milk  
---
\- Some Bread for the first days, and probably some instant bakeable breadroll(? not sure if it fits).  
---
Lunch: 
---
\- Something like Pasta sauce / Chilli con carne, a curry, which can easily be frozen.  
---
\- Precut fresh salad mix, for the first few days with chicken or turkey breast.  
---
\- Some onepot pasta dishes, with different ingredients, chicken, cheese, greens of all sorts -&gt; it's quick and balanced.  
---
Drinks:
---
\- Tap water.
---
\- Maybe some diet drinks for change of taste.
---
\- Beer / lemon mix, for the evening.
---

r/iamverysmart 
---
possibly r/woosh in my part
---
cool story bro
---
I mean the inflation happened cause Blizzard fucked up the economy by having garrison missions for 2 expansions in a row
---
entire raid was formed for soda to get it, also hes the only one who can actually get the trinket so its kinda a waste on someone random. And the whispers from the guy who took it clearly show he was trying to be a dick to soda, he was talking about how he "farmed" him 3 expansions ago
---
Actual money is being injected into that economy already. Do you think you have ever played on a vanilla server where people arent able to buy gold for money then you are living in some serious denial.
---
WoW tokens take chinese gold farming, a problem that exists, and makes it safer and less shady. I look at it the same way i look at legalizing drug use or having clean-needle initiatives or legalized abortion.
---
Shit like thats going to happen anyway so its better if we let the people who do it be safe while doing it.
---
I guess they are starting the server up right now
---
People are there solely to support him getting all the arena trinkets?
---
Of course there will be no tokens in Classic.
---
cringe backpedaller bfa player
---
That literally makes zero sense as I played at launch and people called it VC, scrub.
---
Cat form dude.
---
I thought the withered were introduced with legion
---
&gt; What media / software do you use
---
He's using a piece of software from the Windows XP days called "World of Warcraft".
---
Also. can u just stick on the sever selection screen, or do u have to login after the server is up? :D
---
Complete garbage as fresh 60 regardless of spec. That being said the pay off is their. Warlock can be argued to be the strongest pvp class in the game. They only get deadlier as the raids progress. If you want a pvp class that is good as a fresh 60. I would recommend mage over warlock.
---
Good, I'm glad. Poor baby Soda didn't get what he wanted for all the work he doesn't do.
---
More so it shows how **context** is left by the wayside when something fits a narrative that this sub wants to push :)
---
If you subbed expecting to get a random invite then you were tricked.
---
Friends/family of employees were invited and given several invites to redistribute at their discretion. Roughly 1/5 of the beta is employees/streamers, the other 4/5 are friends of friends. That is the extent of the beta.
---
My vote would be hunter for a few of the reasons you mentioned. First of all, it's a totally unique experience from retail hunter. Being able to melee and ranged, worrying about dead zone, much more focus on kiting. They're the undisputed gods of world PvP to the point that people will definitely complain they're OP. For PVE, they start off strong and fall off hard in terms of raid dps by AQ40 / Naxx.
---
Also the fastest levelers by a mile and just a ton of fun imo.
---
Where in ashenvale?
---
I didn't want to comment any futher because you're obviously not good enough (probably why you play LoL) to even realise that it's pay2win, but here you come and say that what champion you select don't matter? bruh. 
---
literally can'tt even fun.
---
Hey, Troll is actually super good in PvP as well. Shadowguard procs Blackout off of virtually everything, so as long as you’re not getting dispelled it is very strong. Personally, I won’t be skipping Undead though. Phase 1 will be mainly world PvP and DP is so useful in the open world.
---
Exactly this.
---
TBH I have not put to much research in to raid tanking paladins but is their singel target threat not a part of the problem? A taunt would not make them generate more threat all taunt does is put you on top but it does not generat any threat directly. They also have some mana issues on top of their other problems so I don't think a taunt alone would make them the number one tank no questions, merely just a viable option.
---
***HUH Intensifies***
---
guys i dont understand that beta hype :D everyone knows whats going on in classic ... whats the whole point to farm bis gear like streamers do :D just wait 3 months and dont waste your time there :D
---
Nicely done!! Jagex eat your heart out.
---
Pally never casted it
---
Nothing for me. I'd never dream of paying to test something.
---
You're missing the fact that you can give every single person currently playing LoL access to every character to play and 99.9% of them will end up at exactly the same rank they are at now because of their skill level.  I'd actually be willing to bet that more people would DROP in rank because they try to play the mechanically difficult champions and int their way down a few tiers.
---
If it can be feared safely, Warlocks can take it down.
---
Bill is join to ninja loot Thunderfury. I dont trust Bill. Nobody should trust Bill.
---
again, +1 for your reading and comprehension. literally the first sentence disputes your nonsense.
---
Did you read my part about naming convention importance?  My suggestion makes simpler, either one the old or new.  Using a good naming convention eliminates the need to look up a person's level and location.
---
I don't have to imagine someone so braindead, I've read your posts, I've seen it in action. :P

Privateserverscrub that made Classic possible and is now getting flamed for playing or once having played ona. private Server*

Look at the sidebar.

Correct, the paladin never casted HoJ
---
For real I been pounding the paint to get classic to come back since the end of Wrath. I feel so salty every time I see my friend on FB playing it. That nerd didn't start playing till WOD and would argue with me all the time how I was dumb and no way it was better. The only solace I have is him now knowing I was right.
---
Downvoted for not saving the cases.
---
I haven't seen these available for purchase for at least 5 years, you can imagine the shock of seeing them on GameStop shelves when I visited Germany 2 weeks ago...a blast from the past indeed
---
Nostal was taken Down because there were worki g on classic anyone who Thinks otherwise is dumb

There's a blue post saying that they'll be monitoring the servers for the first two hours, hence the 4-6 bit. Third from the bottom.

Tonight we feast, brother!

as a guild leader im not hyped for the drama of legendaries tbh..

Just announced in beta that there will be a brief window where no realms will be available, then stress test will go live.

They can't put Gollum in the game, they'd get sued.
---
Dang u really missed out on a level 5 experience, where you wait in line to kill mobs.
---
Nah Asmon and soda are going to be on the same server Asmon and Esfand said. Esfand is not sure if he will be playing with them, because Staysafe doesn’t want to be on a huge mega server with them cuz the queues will be insanely long.  It would be cool to see all of them on the same server, if Blizzard white listed them or gave them priority in the queue.  But, I don’t advise anyone in their right mind to main a character on that server. I think I’m going to make an alt on a big streamer server to participate in some wpvp events, but no way in fuck I’m maining a character there.
---
Yeah not gonna disagree with you there, WoWs current levelling is terrible and I don't think they know how to fix it without major revamps.
---
Error 37 here we go, it is going to be fun on release.
---
O\_o :D
---
I am so fucking hyped. My personal wish is that they drop a level 100 Hogger into stormwind or something
---
TRAIN?  THOSE FIREBALLS HIT LIKE THE METEOR THAT TOOK OUT THE DINOSAURS!
---
While backpedaling in PVP is usually frowned upon, in PVE and even a few fringe cases in PVP, backpedaling is an absolute necessity, such as tanking, or, in vanilla, staying within a hunter's or warrior's deadzone.
---
Yeah I don't plan on going dps post phase 2. Was mainly thinking about preraid gear. Feral seems to be strong in just blues while other classes get better with raid gear. Was trying to DPS while ferals are considered "good" before they fall off or need a million consumables.
---
Venruki ice blocked the first and second warrior charge stuns. The paladin never casted HoJ

It's a weird one, because people insist it was in the database prior to 1.12, but Blizz was not able to find it in the 1.12 DBCs, and there are no patch notes about it. The spellID was confirmed to be a 2.0.1 spellID as well.

People say it was in earlier patches, and maybe it was, but they were able to confirm that authentic 1.12 did not have this.

I guess playing vanilla private servers since 2010, being vocally against changes that Blizzard made even since TBC andGM'ing on Feenix Emerald Dream while playing in the top raiding guild on the server is "Blizz shill" these days.

The differences between vanilla 1.12 and classic should only be the graphics options, and layering.  Anything else is a bug.

Shadow priests are monsters from the day they get shadow form. Very powerful pvp class but, I warn you. Very boring. DoT, DoT, DoT, watch die. Shadow priests in my opinion are the best pvp class but, most don't agree with me. I could be biased toward them though. I pop an erection everytime I dispel a harmful CC effect so that may be why I love them so much. Either way even if people don't think they are the best. Everyone know Shadow is scary as fuuuck.

Thanks for this insight. My EQ background is limited. I played a little but didn't get super hooked on MMOs until DAOC.
---
That's an interesting idea.
---
I did that too, but only for shits and giggles. I think I only ran there with an actual group to run it as level appropriate once or twice, the rest of the time I stealthed in there with my rogue and some lowbies and ran them through.

SFK was a really popular run-through, SM as well. SM is legend for me.

You must have a lot of friends. Btw, omegalul? Get off of twitch every once in a while. No need to be hostile, if you don't like my post downvote and move on.

The comparison was between old forum posts from Allakhazam and Classic beta. Not private servers and beta.
---
This. I was personally making something like 30k or so straight gold daily from legion mission table. Didn't have a chance to cash in on the WoD cashcow though...
---
Because the paladin never casted HoJ
---
I would have believed you but then you wrote "then" instead of "than".
---
Yeah- fear was a great tool
---
there is like 3 months to classic
---
plenty of time to farm enough to never need to pay for classic
---
lesson learned:
---
dont join a streamer guild. especially on lead by tips out and sodapoppin.
---
I've noticed this one. I thought it was an EU thing but not sure. However I'm NA and saw VC a lot.
---
wasnt World of Roguecraft already over by the time of the patch they will be using?
---
Posts like this are not doing anyone favors. Yes streamers/employees have an advantage, but to pretend like only people "in the know" got beta is bullshit and you know it.
---
Myself and several other friends got beta with varying types of accounts. We're nobodies, biggest thing I had was a vanilla CE account but a few other friends had accounts made in 2006 that hadn't played in years.
---
I don't care what you say, You are lying.
---
Keep defending streamers, Pleb.
---
Ofcourse not, that was (one of the reasons) why in BfA we can't have 400 ppl on the screen.
---
I don't remember what it was as I didn't play any tanks until horde got pallies. I was just curious if there were factors that people might not immediately consider like significant gear disparities that could explain this.
---
Same place and I saw VC.
---
"get the fuck me away from all of these streamers"?

I hear ya on the dps.. I just like the utility I’ve seen from hotw spec for wpvp.. side note I’m going herb/skin then drop skin for eng... what are your profs going to be(Tauren here with alchemy on an alt is the plan) just might be spending all my earnings to buy mining mats for eng. I feel like mining/herb is a headache but could be useful to save up the mining mats for guicker eng later

I'm actually subbed to Soda. Funny guy, just a trash player and streamers influence on Classic WoW pisses me off and it gives me joy watching them suffer.
---
People were calling it both things on Neptulon-EU and Boulderfist-EU. DM was the dominant one though

Because DM is now an overloaded abbreviation so to reduce obfuscation the cool kids refer to Dead Mines as VC. ~Aegwynn US alliance since forfuckingever.

---
Then don't spoil it any more beyond that lol.
---
Either way, it'll still be a new experience for you. It's hard to regain that feeling. A fresh expansion drop with new lore and pretty scenery is usually enough for me to get a little of that, even though it's a rehash of everything I've seen a million times already in any MMO ever. It's still fun going through it the first time.
---
Still a strong class. Not everyone is gonna be a rank 14 tryhard
---
&gt; Heres an example : I'm a casual, can't be bothered grinding and earning things. I buy a token with real money sell it for game currency and buy an awesome epic weapon.
---
You can only buy these awesome epic weapons with gold that other people have farmed. So there wont be an influx of "awesome epic weapons" because there wont be an influx of gold and there wont be an influx of epic weapon drops.
---
If anything the price of items like Krol Blade may go up and become even more rare because only people ready to spend huge amounts of gold will afford to buy them.
---
And it sounds like you dont even know how tokens work but still have a very strong opinion on them.
---
The over all farming on a server would stay the same. Tokens is not buying gold from Blizzard. Its buying a tradeable token (that can be exchanged for game time) for money from Blizzard - and then selling it to other players for gold.
---
So if player A has 100 gold and player B has 800 gold then player A can buy a token for money and trade it to player B for lets say 300 gold. Player B then uses the token to get game time.
---
No gold was created, no extra loot was created. The economy is unharmed. Theses proccesses also already exist in vanilla, but are handled by third party chinese gold farmers. There are websites where people can trade gold for money and money for gold. They are shady as shit and frequent with scammers.
---
WoW tokens would simply take the chinese gold market and make it safe.
---
Heh I’ll post another photo today, one of beta and one of the stress test. Hopefully imma little caught up!
---
I chuckled but I'll never upvote someone who doesn't wanna do Cookie

If this is not taken down in the next 30 minutes I will be forced to take legal action
---
Plenty of normies in there, it’s just likely that your exposure has only been to streamers.
---
Right, but it won't be relevant at that point relative to /u/Nokrai 's point. The 'server cap' and number of servers during layering is irrelevant. You will still be sorted by layers. It could be one giga server with everyone on it, or a bunch of 10k pop cap servers, but it will still be spread into different layers and we wouldn't see the difference. All we will see is the 3k per layer. His 10k pop limit is just pulled out of his ass, that has never even been mentioned by anyone from Blizz. 
---
Which is why I don't like the system. It does nothing to alleviate the starting zone madness (the initial reason they said they were even considering any form of Sharding -layering was not mentioned at this point), while leaving the potential for exploitation by layer hopping. 
---
And how are they going to consolidate after the supposed wave of 'tourists' is gone? Even if they did have 10k pop limits, you could still end up with nearly empty servers, and possibly a crap ton of people moving to one server and trying to fill it to the 10k max, which would destroy any semblance of a Vanilla-style server. It doesn't make sense from any point of view IMO. Unless someone can actually show me something that says otherwise, with an actual source .
---
If so, I wanna watch the chaos!
---
Why do all the autistic retards get access to the beta first?
---
Hehe beta is all about throwing caution into the wind! I can be as basic as I want!!
---
Are you 12?
---
The PvP realm is listed as FULL and the PvE realm is High.
---
The Stress Test is offline right now, but I'm sure it's coming up soon.
---
Just give them to the right people and everyone will accept it.
---
I’ll be on for the last hour.
---
i'm probably gonna restart since i don't even get the realm select rn
---
Grats on the drop! Shame there's no Hunter in the group to put it to proper use.
---
Yeah wPvP might keep me from going all in on 14/32/5 but I planned on trying both. Also plan on rolling with a rouge so might not miss NS so much but we will see. I'm Alliance scum (Paladins seem to make druids better WSG/Raids) and plan on going skinning/mining during leveling and dropping skinning for engineering at 60. Herbing seems easier but would rather have my engineering mats from mining.
---
No changes....wow tokens...hmmm
---
VC = voice chat
---
Loaded it ages ago and it was taking ages on that so lots of people waiting on the realm list page like me I imagine.
---
Should I leave it on the realm selection screen or do you think I will have to refresh the page before it shows as online?
---
&gt;wait times may take up to 3 weeks
---
Considering that certain drops are pursued for literally months by people, I fail to see what you see wrong with this.
---
But, of course, not understanding opportunity costs is a common theme among people who like to make fun of highly complex economic systems that they have no understanding of.
---
Oh bro don’t admit this. Your gonna get so much hate for this post.
---
Played all vanilla, started on medivh, it was always DM back then.  Dire Maul you specified a side because why would you not?
---
These are really good! I especially like how you put all the levels at 5 just in case you didn't finish the drawing before the stress test started.
---
im ready
---
I think the Realm will change form grey to green when the server is up but I'd restart at about 7:01 if it doesn't change.
---
They didn't say there isn't going to be any more invites. They are just winding down on the amount of invites.
---
Yeah i just had a small waiting time to 1 player before me. We gonna hug it to death :p
---
r/woooosh
---
I dont have beta, so i just see the stress realm. im wondering if i can stay or if i have to relog.
---
Yes its normal - Normal PTR appears as Legion as well, guess they  havent updated something for few years
---
About to watch some Vurtne vids.
---
If you have an invite via email it’s official. 
---
But if it’s not showing up on BNet, then you could be aware and would have had some time to correct it before the test. 
---
If it’s not caught in time tonight, perhaps a response to Blizzard might grant leverage to getting into the June Test. 
---
Just trying to help
---
It says "Beta &amp; Stress Test: WoW Classic"
---
Nope, I just tell the truth.
---
Sorry, I know the truth is hard to understand when you can't read. Try learning to read.
---
Happy for you man enjoy it while it lasts.
---
I mean the entire argument is "which one is right?" I know why it's called VC i don't need 12 different people explaining it to me. It's been a debate for 15 years.
---
was thinking this and didn’t want to break it to him
---
If they want to go out of their way to hate, they don't deserve shit lmao.
---
Legion is standard WoW now. Subscribing to WoW gives you all content except BFA.
---
Did you look at that early demo they released? If they had been working on it when nost was taken down then they were working slow as snails.
---
Maybe they had some guys working on integrating something into battlnet but I don't honestly think they were doing much for it back in 2016.
---
Are you trying to say that a person has to be #nochanges to not be a Blizzard shill?
---
LMFO dude.
---
Lol I just skimmed over the hogger part. I’m shot.
---
im wondering the same bud.
---
By building the UI = setting up various addons, a custom UI that would be used straight away at launch. For august release, I'm planning to recreate my vanilla UI. Currently, the addon's aren't quite ready yet for Classic, only a few work, most of them are are in the works for being updated.
---
I got the stress test invite, but I won't actually be able to mess with any addons. Thing is, I wouldn't actually want to spend the first hour(s) at the august release setting up the UI, so that's why I'd want to do it during the beta.
---
What was the comment?
---
Seeing that also.
---
The servers aren't live yet.
---
Streaming the stress test live here: https://www.twitch.tv/cooleobrad
---
Arcane Explosion as well
---
This was not one of those situations though, it just shows that he has a bad habbit of backpeddaling.
---
Same, but I'm gonna bite the bullet and sub two weeks early, grind out a few tokens and reserve my names.
---
/cry
---
lol let me try this again
---
&gt; because I can't play Classic Wow right now
---
and thats why im currently on a PServer.  obviously its not perfect and things are whack af in places.  but its a good way to try and get back into the flow. 
---
cant believe its going to be 3 months -_-
---
Why not let her come over and ride on you while you do the stress testing??
---
Congrats ! Good part is you will have time to level before the level 1 comes along :)
---
Sounds like a good idea to me :)
---
Not sure.
---
The PvE realm is in the process of shutting down now, 3:00 until it does so.
---
I had that but only took like 30 seconds for me to see realm selection
---
Anal [For the Children]
---
What a shitty perspective. 
---
1. You didn’t pay for beta, you paid for a wow sub
---
2. blizzard doesn’t owe you shit
---
3. The beta is not done, it’s just scaling back invites
---
4. For those who are foaming at the mouth for this, I don’t foresee any enjoyment of this product. Have any of you considered that perhaps this small pooling of invites was meant to reflect the content flow represented in Classic? Patience = satisfaction.
---
"less QQ more pew pew"
---
If you're just staring at your inbox/app, just login and farm some tokens, might as well make it worth your time.
---
It has bad ripple effects though. Cool at first, but bad objectively.
---
yes, you have to /pvp to enable your pvp on a pve server. not marked players can attack you, if your pvp is enabled. if they do, there pvp will enable automatic and are attackable. after 5 min it will be disabled automatic if they dont do any pvpish actions. if you /pvp again it will be toggled the same way after that 5 min
---
Yes! Man I haven’t thought about that game in a while. Time to boot up the old DOSBox!
---
Level 10?
---
...or value maintaining healthy relationships. Since when did this sub revert to a “if you don’t share my opinion you must be ______” mentality?
---
There is non. People don't like (other) rogues in vanilla, because they gank the shit out of you and are so difficult to handle in a typical open world scenario.
---
We'll find out in about ten minutes. I honestly don't see why Blizz would allow just anyone to download the stress test server if they weren't invited. Just seems counter productive if you ask me.
---
Team up with a DPS friend in decent gear, go farm elites in Tyr's hand.
---
that's all of us jumping in to see if its up yet when we know really it's not
---
How does that make him a trash player though?
---
I just wanted to inform you guys that this is actually happening ^^ I didn‘t read and other posts about people getting invites that have relatively new accounts
---
Welcome to problems us oceanic guys have been facing since the start of online gaming
---
Your*
---
Honestly Ret in TBC is soooooo good compared to Vanilla, lol.
---
PvP realm aswell, watching Soda (yes i admit)
---
Just a prank bro, chill
---
Its not like if asmon started streaming a different game right now they would all leave, most of his viewers are there for him not wow.
---
This whole comment chain is because you can't read, lol.
---
Hunters are awesome in vanilla, i'll never understand all the hate.
---
Arguably the best 1v1 class in the game, great DPS all the way up until Naxx (some of the best dps in the game in MC/BWL/ZG) 
---
Best solo class in the game hands down, great solo farm capabilities with DM solo runs and mara princess runs.
---
You will! On PvE servers you have to flag yourself for PvP or the opposite faction won't be able to attack you. On PvP servers, you're always flagged for PvP and can be attacked at any time.
---
On PvE servers, attacking another player or NPC will flag you for PvP automatically. Getting too close to some areas will also flag you, such as the Gurubashi Arena and most of the opposite faction's cities. Obviously if you go into a BG you will also be flagged.
---
I played on a RP PvE server and there was always plenty of world PvP to be found. Basically if you want to kill or be killed at any time, pick PvP. If you want some peace now and again, pick PvE.
---
ele/resto is prefered, yes. full resto is not that great because the stuff you gain from it is only really useful in raids.
---
enhance is not as good as ele, people do it for big windfury 2h hits but ele has way more reliable burst.
---
If I was a NE I would absolutely take mining over herb but just feels like herb and tauren Druids are meant to be haha, plus I want to have pots for pvp that I can make so I had to make a sacrifice somewhere and my alt will have alchemy and tailoring so mining’s out on that one as well... just gonna have to buy the mats it seems or deal with the pain of herb/mining
---
\+1 for responses.
---
Sorry, after you tried to assert my age as a point to disregard my posts, you have lost all respect. 
---
Go jump in his chat and be a pleb, thats where you always are.
---
Desperate for upvotes lol.
---
It's [AsmonGollum!](https://clips.twitch.tv/AwkwardMotionlessOcelotBleedPurple)
---
except hunters can, at least up until some AQ40 fights / Naxx when casters and fury warriors finally have 14% hit lol 
---
up until that point hunters are some of the best dps in the game
---
But Hunter is a pure damage class, not a hybrid.
---
True, i can also just attend my real job and put in some extra hours and be more cost effective.
---
The reason i would like tokens in Classic is that i enjoy vanilla. Getting gold in vanilla is something i do naturally while enjoying myself.
---
Farming in BfA would not be enjoyable, it would be like attending a really low paying second job.
---
&gt; A lot of people would love to see new content so most people are on board would probably be about 90/95%   
---
&gt; TL:DR #NoChanges is entirely based on an unrealistic outlook of the future. Change my mind. 
---
Why would we try and change your mind when you make up numbers to support your own head cannon?
---
Position in queue "666" you can't make this shit up rofl.
---
Still wasn't up when I got through the que. Lol
---
I called it VC or VCDM because DM was Dire Maul
---
That's just the login server the realm isn't up yet
---
It’s not online yet
---
True, but what other options do they have? Even if the layered servers have a pop cap of 10k, they can still end up with a bunch of nearly empty servers, or a handful of nearly pop capped servers. We simply won't know until the time comes to remove layering. 
---
If everyone shares the same name pool across layers, is it just going to be a pool of layers with no option to pick a server? If they do split it down into servers, what will the overall pop cap be? What will they do if, upon removal of layering, the server pop is still much higher than the Vanilla 2.5-4k pop?
---
IT'S UP BOIS EVERYONE RUSH HOGGER
---
Ah shit, here we go again.
---
This is the longest five minutes in the last fifteen years of my life.
---
Hmm, I get booted out after queue. :(
---
I think people are mixing things up here. Are people hyping something the streamers are noticing or did the streamers notice it because of all the hype?
---
They've just sad that they met their current population goal. And not a single word was ever sad about increasing the lvl cap.
---
Everything else is wishfull thinking
---
Lightninghoof US also VC
---
I get it, one of those people so engulfed with trying to get people to understand that you, yourseld simply doesnt understand that people are allowed to have views that differ from yours. 
---
No witty snapback or anything, just gl.
---
Yup, got through login queue and all 3 realms are offline.
---
Just hit 4:00 PST so let's hope.
---
I'm surprised that no other MMOs have a noticable twitch presence, what Happened to Black desert online? In 2015 everybody said it was fun
---
At 182 here I goooooooo!
---
How'd you set your language to Orcish?
---
Hi, /u/wuwut
---
&gt; But the only ability people really downrank in vanilla is frostbolt.
---
Yeah...this is false.
---
There's at least 1279 people trying to login right now...
---
i got passed the queue and then it said the server was offline!
---
I didn't have one initially either. Once they flag your account for a beta, or if you have game licences in other regions, the drop down appears after restarting bnet.
---
I didnt have a lot of problems against them on my feral druid
---
Client hack. Lel
---
followed by greyed out offline server list
---
I loved my Druid. I remember spec being something like 1 17 33 good for raiding and PVP. If you want to do both i loved it. When I got better feral gear from PVP and raiding I able to spec deeper into feral but then I stopped raiding because PVP became much more fun.
---
It was made with paint... No layer work here. Literally just MS Paint.
---
Not sure I understand?
---
And server is still offline after waiting 800 position in queue. :D
---
That Eagle eye is a bug right?
---
same. wtf
---
This guy's remakes are top notch, have you seen the other ones?
---
I’m in but server isn’t up!
---
As of this posting, Fortnite has 125K viewers and WoW has 140K viewers.  Go Classic!!
---
Pizzas from the freezer, potato crisps, some candy and energy drinks. Eating like this for like four days from launch.
---
You're entirely right, let's say I don't attempt to postulate to prove a point and you then argue that I use another opinion based argument. How exactly could I argue my point? 
---
There is no actual metric  and it would be immposible to achieve one. Is it unrealistic of me to assume 90% of players would be okay with additional content in the form of a meaningless level 33 quest? Could you rationalize your point to me?
---
Server offline here
---
gl to you too pleb.
---
I am hoping this as well
---
No thanks
---
Same here, it was sad to see that private servers were the only ways to re experience it, i personally didn't get the whole "it's a private server so I won't touch it" mentality of retail players before Nost came out- it would've been nice to see a healthy pop
---
Well, no. There are way worse things than WoW Tokens that you could take from retail wow and put into Classic.
---
I'd say the largest gap is between #nochanges and Multi-difficulty raids with LFR. But that might just be me, you may like that more than you like Tokens, what the fuck do i know.
---
But my point was that i am a huge supporter of everything that makes vanilla amazing. But i dont see WoW Tokens taking away from that since chinese gold farming is already in vanilla. WoW Tokens is just a way of providing safe transactions for people who are already trading gold for money in vanilla.
---
Servers are still offline after 1000+ in queue. That is why it goes so fast, everyone is relogging
---
[Here is a picture of my tatas](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.potatopro.com%2Fsites%2Fdefault%2Ffiles%2Fpictures%2Fpotatoes-in-the-soil-in-a-field-80-1300x1000.jpg&amp;f=1)
---
Relogging and it's now 1500 line. ;)
---
So you gambled and lost. You knew the risk.
---
I’m 1429. Suk it
---
Why would it take 18 months to get exalted lol. You make a whole lot of assumptions.  The guy is asking about prepping for rep grinds, do you feel like you are responding to a casual player here?
---
Fresh bread here!
---
P2W implies no matter my skill I can spend money to win. 
---
You are more arguing that its pay for a minor advantage, which for sure is still morally grey, but not the same. It's similar, but you are missing the point. 
---
(this is just about the champs, not the runes, that shit was pretty p2w)
---
Hi, /u/ch33zynach0s
---
Hmm it says offline for me once I got through the queue.
---
Walk into the inn
---
Aggro the upstairs somehow
---
HUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUHUH
---
20 fireballs pyroblast you off the face of azeroth from the stairs
---
894
---
yeah same, I didn't have a quest but I'm sitting at a server offline screen.
---
Try using a mouse with buttons on the side!  Mine has 12.
---
 You can move by holding down Left Mouse button and right mouse button, and use up to 12 spells with the buttons on the side.  One handed gameplay!  granted, I wouldn't do anything that requires too much skill, maybe no dungeons, but great way to grind with only one hand.
---
Last check (two seconds ago) the servers still weren't up.
---
Server still ain’t up though
---
688
---
Same, can I just sit and wait?
---
Hi, /u/HangMeGod
---
Perfection
---
Honestly, I never even realized that Stockades or Deadmines existed until way later because I was a horde player. And when I did find out about Deadmines, it was called DM, but that was during Cataclysm. And I only figured out about Stockades because of the classic dungeon achievement. 
---
RFC was in Org (so like Stockades), and WC or SFK would be the Deadmines equivalent I suppose. 
---
But personally, I came in at the tail end of BC and the beginning of WotLK.
---
guess that makes it even more authentic xD
---
Man it’s really moving...
---
You can 1 trick a champion all the way to challenger lol
---
Yes you did, you just didn't know they were using macros
---
Hi, /u/lolboonesfarm
---
Yup.
---
Talk about the wrong stuff, right?
---
i dont see anything wrong you are a male and she is a female
---
Realm isn't up lol
---
pretty sure /s. But also not technically wrong. Without subs the game would have never been alive long enough for classic to be a thing. Private servers would have existed yes, but not an official release of classic.
---
Got offline realm and needed to relog, hope to getting in.
---
Ah its been a while hopefully it's still the same. Although I can't remember honestly I thought it was a free for all for everyone after 20 or something
---
Classic should be in its own category.
---
This is my 4th time relogging, still down
---
Same here. Not sure if I should reload or..
---
Im past that.  Now its time to wait for it to retrieve the realm list.
---
Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand DCd.
---
thats like 55 seconds
---
They existed in vanilla. It's in your escape menu, they can simplify some things
---
Made it through the queue and the server is still offline  lol
---
They were always a thing too. You just didn't have the knowledge of them that's all.
---
First thought I had. We're home bois. Login queues and all. FeelsGoodMan.
---
Almost wonder if that isnt blizzard being cheeky as a throwback though :P
---
only for realm not to be up and to do it again:X
---
I played WoW from day 1 and stopped because of the first extension, BC. Maybe it was good, but I was a fairly casual player and was on my way to gearing up my warrior to the Valor Set (I was just missing the breastplate! Damn Drakkisath) and I spent so much time doing those dungeons over and over again! I know it’s not a great set but I didn’t have a very good guild and not too much time. But then when all my work became wasted and irrelevant because of an extension, it annoyed me and I stopped playing.
---
So I don’t know how you can make everyone happy, hardcore players and casuals 😄
---
I got into the stress test but honestly "playing up to level 5 for 12 hours" really doesn't even seem worth it.
---
Of course I'll still play though.
---
Hi, /u/Vralak
---
We still have them in Hungary!
---
same issue
---
i have sat through the queue twice and i keep getting disconnected and having to sit in Queue again.
---
They definitely deserve a stern talking to. Especially after blue posted instructing he to delete PTR accounts as a fix. And for your last sentence, that makes you a big lipped bitch.
---
Alliance had a bridge with two towers. Very hard to get past that point. Early avs would often sit there.
---
Hi, /u/Antipathy17
---
The line keeps getting longer on each disconnect. I was logged in at 7:55 and waited to 8:00 but list was still grey. I thought a quick restart would help. Was wrong.
---
Me too man lol been through the queue twice now and got disconnected. Guess the stress test is working haha
---
Test successful.
---
That just happened
---
If they are flagged and you aren't, you can attack them. As soon as you do, you will also be flagged. If you aren't flagged, they can't attack you. If you are flagged and they aren't, you won't be able to attack them.
---
Something else I forgot to mention, you can flag yourself by typing /PVP and you will be flagged until you turn it off. When you do turn it off, you will still be flagged for 5 minutes before it goes away. If you are automatically flagged by attacking a player or getting too close to a city, the flag will turn off on its own but you still have to wait the 5 minutes.
---
I got in at the third attempt. Server was online, population low. Clicked on it, started loading.............aaaaaaaaaaaaaand DC’d again.
---
Character creation timed out.
---
ah shit here we go again
---
think they are linked to the same server as the login server, they always go down together
---
Experiencing the same
---
[Network Administration at Classic HQ right now](https://proxy.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=http%3A%2F%2Fpop-verse.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2017%2F08%2Fit-crowd-moss-fire.jpg&amp;f=1)
---
I'm stuck on creating character. I got character creation timed out.
---
Fuck! I keep seeing shit that makes me want to roll a different class!
---
Lol same
---
Same here. Before 4pm pdt /i had been able to log in and see the offline server. Now I've had my 4th DC after the 2k queue
---
Booted me. Had to restart
---
&gt; A lot of people would love to see new content so most people are on board would probably be about 90/95% 
---
Is not a fact, its an opinion...
---
No. It just lights up when it's online.
---
I think it does matter at the start. The items that drop belong on the server they drop on. Having servers broken into layers is vastly different than just having layers and letting the people land where they may.
---
How do you coordinate playing on the same server as friends without servers at the start?
---
Perfect! No changes :)
---
WTF? Why would you even lie about this?  Blizzard staff said they would try to fix this earlier today, and were working on it - removing the extra PTR accounts.   
---
Why lie?
---
Been happening to me for about 4 cycles. On the second one I got my hopes up when it took a little longer to retrieve the realm list.
---
This was the whole point of the stress test, so I’m waiting patiently
---
At least you got to create a character...
---
No. It'll just light up
---
You can actually find a lot of time to play in those early months, as long as you can play with baby cradled in one arm and don't mind getting your time in at 3 am.
---
It is told me the realm is full :(
---
Yep, same here.
---
OwO what's thisss?
---
Wow Classic only has this many viewers because not everybody can play it.
---
big hype! how's the pizza?
---
didnt even make it that far, wait in queue, get disconnected after lol
---
I dont believe so. If you do that would change my tendency towards Hunter a bit
---
Then you'd get DC'd at 2hrs 57mins.
---
Every time I click to join the server I get dced. F
---
Yep. It did for me. Still logging in though
---
I keep getting "Character creation timed out." You're not missing anything.
---
Oh MY, 5min waiting for "Your password is incorrect" I remember vanilla authored passwords before realm queue...:(
---
Yes, I know.
---
Did I hurt your feelings? Sorry buddy
---
Right there with you
---
It says there are no servers to join or whatever makes me login again
---
Yea but it's great to see.
---
already doing my part.  character creation failed 3 times
---
I actually got in... then disconnected lmao
---
These servers are stressed as fuck
---
I was in a queue, then got kicked out.
---
IK but just seeing that there is a queue and disconnections brings me back. Pepperidge farm remembers!
---
Well, chances are pretty low that one server has 90% leavers and others have 15%, but we will see how they will solve that, lets hope the currently running stress test sheds some light on layering mechanics
---
Yeap
---
False - this is happening to people who did as well.
---
and now DC'd
---
Does retail not have any longer? Macros are and always were supremely useful. From a simple target macros to mouseovers, totem stomps to castsequence, and even a script to charge in combat, they were a big part of the game. Look up and learn, you'll probably be using a lot by the time you start MC.
---
I just did the same thing. I logged in again only to get disconnected at the end.
---
DC'D NOOO hahahaha
---
that's what u think
---
One of the things I remember most about the WoW beta was how fun it was when they started spawning bosses inside cities.  I hope they do something similar again, but unfortunately they have apparently deemed me not worthy to get in on the Classic beta or stress test.
---
I can't believe I have 150 word essay due tommorow but I'm just sitting here playing WoW.
---
got d/c'd and then put into a 3k queue I CRY
---
Server offline for me
---
Thnx. It was offline for me and couldn't get the realm lists bcs of disconnects. Now going in I hope.
---
Yep, I've got pretzels and margaritas and a login queue. It's like 2005 all over again.
---
I tried five times to make a character and then I got disconnected. FML
---
Now realm is up but locked already due to extreme popularity. ;)
---
I was in and making a character. Character creation timed out multiple times (never seen that message in my life).
---
Disconnected. 2k queue.
---
No, kiddo. Using age-based posts don't hurt feelings. They just cause you to lose credibility.
---
I guess it was.  Played NA and we always called it VC on our server.
---
On my third go-around now, still can't get in
---
You're reading too literally into what Blizzard are saying. Never believe the PR man of any group fully, because they will feed you what they want you to hear. It makes 0 sense logically speaking for them to only be monitoring the first 2 hours, regardless of what they say, because the other 22 hours will have a plentitude of useful data. So we can safely assume they'll be monitoring that as well. As for your comments about it being in the working week, well, EU isn't the only place in the world. For us Aussies it's 9am, and I'm drinking coffee while I wait for the servers to work properly. They're gonna get a good, sizeable population in, which will be intentionally low due to the working week, due to EU being asleep. Think critically about what Blizzard says, don't read and repeat what they say. They're trustworthy, but the PR guys' job is literally just to tell the public what the company wants them to hear.
---
Ahh, now this is an authentic experience!
---
I’m in the CBT, and I’m getting disconnected whenever attempting to join
---
I got all excited when I saw the email from blizzard, then I saw it was just for a stress test so sucks kinda.
---
You will get disconnected next :p
---
Well they probably did know a thing or two on the builds that will be good but by going against it while doing the itemization they introduced something called fun.
---
I can still remember stacking lvl 60 mail greens with random defence rolls on my shaman in order to tank. Good times!
---
States classic should have wow tokens.....calls someone else a troll....lol
---
No, They said they would remove the PTR account for people had not already done it themselves, with blizzard support. If you took a earlier blue posts advice and got your extra ptr account removed by blizzard support. Blizzard so you were crap out of luck basically.
---
Hi, /u/workgymworkgym
---
Too all, the pizza is delicious! The off line server however...is very sour.
---
Yeah just got through for the 4th time and this time no realms were available
---
Somebody needs a wambulance.
---
That's the spirit! Or agility!
---
Lmao as soon as you posted I dc..
---
Round table is 🔥 🔥 🔥
---
Don't be too upset, the server is still down anyway - even after the queue.
---
Haha shocker. Probably some pserver player. They love shady software.
---
Mine failed twice before I got kicked out. At least we're all suffering together lol
---
Dude... My wife just showed me I'm going to be a dad for my third kid. We need to group up together. Strength in numbers and an internet friend to complain too lol.
---
I got there too and after few errors it just kicked off and back to queue so didn't even get to actually create the character...
---
Further than me, the realm just shows offline for me even restarting client lmao
---
these login servers are trash,I was just thrown out for like the 5th time
---
Yup got the character creation timed out x2 then disconnected
---
shut up
---
Hi, /u/RoeJaz
---
why aren't you watching the little payo's stream?
---
I hope you find it oddly satisfying to then get through the queue, disconnected and then re-queue for eternity, because that's how it seems to be going right now.
---
You're 20 people ahead of me.  /wave
---
Fuck off, we know.
---
I mean, I may very well be intentional
---
Here's what I posted above " WoW 3 takes me to stress test and then disconnects."
---
I got invited. I downloaded the Beta &amp; Stress yesterday. But it still gives me WoW 2 or WoW 3 server options.
---
Because you did not take blizzards advice and ask them to manually remove the extra ptr account when they originally requested. Please go and read the thread. The 2 PTR accounts arent the problem, the problem was if you did what blizzard said and got one removed by them before they came up with the later solution. just trying to explain the situation.
---
I just plain got returned to the account name/password screen after it couldn't retrieve the realm list.
---
Just keep rushing. That will bring the best results for blizzard!
---
Almost like they're stress testing the servers
---
5th attempt @19 minutes in. Got to see a server up on attempt 4 but was disconnected trying to login to it. I do think we are stressing the system. =)
---
WoW5 for me.
---
\+Evocation
---
guy comments on other subs all the time lol
---
Thought I got in finally when I picked the server after being kicked out 4 times only to have it kick me again😭
---
Ohh :( well i guess enjoy retail. I played it for whole 30 minutes after coming back from mid wotlk before going mad.
---
This is literally what the stress test is for. You are testing it by sitting in queue.
---
 i just got to character creation again... same error lol
---
zug zug
---
Instanced powerleveling basically doesn’t work. The calculation for XP earned means the lower leveled characters get basically zero XP. And if you want the exploit/jank way: you’d need to be in group, enter instance, then disband, then the noob tags mobs, then the power leveler kills the mobs, then you all zone out and repeat. This would work except you only have 5 instance resets per hour. Plus it may be bannable. I remember in Cata (or something) they banned people for this.
---
Take the empirical evidence: when any big guild needed to power level a class back in the day they would simply kill tagged mobs out in the world. So hunter is going to be your best bet here, followed by lock. Or maybe Warrior if the noob is playing a healer.
---
Yeah, that kinda sucks. I'm hoping if it's too crowded for the actual stress test I'll still get to login maybe later tonight? I really hope this isn't it, and the servers are locked for the next 24h.
---
Try to contain the excitement of the people, I won't let you!
---
&gt; stop making 100 of the same posts 
---
. . . like this one?
---
Keep getting disconnected and sent to back of the queue.
---
Brings back memories... After logging into the server I get sent back to the title screen to go back into the queue. 10/10 Bringing the classic experience back lol
---
shut the fuck up, it failed before it started.
---
No, that means its succeeding. We’re breaking it and theyre getting data
---
BUT I GOT INVITED WHAT THE FUCK REEEEEEEEEEEE. /s
---
But significantly less hair
---
Same thing keeps happening to me.

---
It's honestly not as bad IRL, the camera of the phone doesnt help, it makes everything look a lot brighter and more contrast
---
I mean when they teased us all with streamers playing for the first week of course we are going to rush it if we only get 24 hours
---

---
People who say VC for Deadmines make me physically cringe and recoil. Should be a crime against humanity.
---
Is that garlic sauce for a pizza...?
---
I felt honored to get an invite. They probably invited 100,000 people.
---
This is the stress test. They wanted thousands in queue so they can see what kind of stress the servers have.
---
Hi, /u/PeKING_
---
Undead gets devouring plague, so if you even remotely think about going shadow, Undead is your only option.
---
It's also a nice touch since it adds selfheal for pvp.
---
Yes, you should. Just have to run to Mulgore. But if it means you can enjoy the game with a friend, then RUN!!!!!!!
---
Always did prefer chocolate
---
cant even log in, wait in the queue and then it gets to server select, lets me pick and it kicks me out, have been doing this sense 7:01
---
What is your point, this is a stress TEST for blizzard. All these entitled people, there’s nothing you can do except keep trying thus keeping the load high for blizzard which means they get better data to fix problems for release.
---
Because it's a stress test. This is literally the point. Now they have data to work with to see where the bottlenecks occur.
---
This is why they're testing. Your doing great testing! Hopefully for you reward, you get to the cinematic.
---
Hearth to Stormwind and turn off exp gain. Explore with a lvl 71 forever. It's what I did with my first 60.
---
Server population: Locked.
---
lolz
---
Yes. We might be testing the queue systems atm
---
This is wow classic, you are supposed to be keyboard turning.
---
Trying to log in for twenty minutes. Somehow it's comforting, this was my Thursday nights ten years ago. It really is classic.
---
the biggest number should be your testing account
---
Figure out how much time you have to dedicate to wow. Tanks require far more dedication than any other role in a guild. If you can't make every single raid and event, don't be a tank IMO.
---
Listen buddy, stop making posts telling me what to do &gt;:\[
---
Population went from "low" to "locked" real quick.
---
If I remember correctly, the original beta ended with infernals raining from the sky in the barrens. Blew my mind at the time.
---
yeah, they took it away in the MoP reshuffling of the talent system, but basically you were extremely edgy until you got your first talent point -- but for some reason it was glitched for DKs cuz they never "dinged" 10 so they were stuck with it from 55-80
---
So painful but even the loading screen makes me happy.
---
People are stressed so I guess it worked
---
So far the only stress test I've participated in is that of the login servers. Currently on try #3.
---
Hi, /u/attluh
---
yep. same, but with the occasional disconnect
---
Absolutely love it.
---
I got in and tried to make a cow named Asmongold.  It timed out :(
---
Items were always 30 minutes no matter what.
---
I mean it may be intentional
---
Correct. But does it matter which WoW X ? For me it's WoW 2 or WoW 3.
---
I can't get in anyways, I've gotten through the queue many times and I'm always instantly disconnected.
---
https://www.reddit.com/r/classicwow/comments/brvlia/3_mins_after_servers_should_be_up/
---
Not very similiar to MoP though. You got 3 spells in your rotation, no procs and only oomkins run oom quicker.
---
PvP is decent if not doing premades.
---
You can play until tomorrow even when the stress test is over.
---
Oh forgot mention healer, wont be shadow.
---
stfu and go back to retail /s
---
I am already demanding a refund for the stress test. Unacceptable
---
You are testing it right now by sitting in queue. You are stressing the server.
---
Why not go to sleep at 6PM and wake up just before?
---
Measuring time in crafts is an awesome move - I am just thinking about all the possibilities. 
---
"I'll be there in ~~five~~ one blessing of might."
---
I bet my cat this is going to happen at launch aswell, with or without a stress test. I've been down this rodeo one too many times.
---
I completely agree. Not gonna stop people complaining though :|
---
Ranch my dude
---
The weak point was always the login server. 
---
Some stuttering and lag once connected, but login servers were the bottleneck iirc.
---
Horde. Undead rogue or tauren shaman with the name : Redridgeboss
---
It's actually up till tomorrow.
---
The 2 hours isn’t for you to play it’s 2 hours for you to STRESS FUCKING TEST
---
Of course they were expecting us to show up. They were counting on it. We're stressing their servers
---
Not getting in is part of the test, enjoy!
---
Likely, no matter what I am going to sleep at 2 AM. So tough luck if I still can't get in until then.
---
Sweet, so we get to try to log in for 2 hours.
---
What did you expect from a stress test? I dont expect to be able to login at least for the first two hours and maybe longer even.
---
I got a beta invite for the stress test but it doesnt seem like the servers are up yet.
---
I hope so. If they’re testing both the logins and the amount of players in the same area then probably. A lot of people still aren’t in.
---
But that's all they wanted to test in those 2 hours
---
It certainly wasn't playing wow from release all the way to wotlk or killing every boss in Vanilla up to 4H. I mean why would you want actual players that know what the game was like. Better fill it up with a bunch of douche bag streamers that will fill thousands of bug reports for standard Vanilla features.
---
Hi, /u/CallmePell
---
Server is stressed
---
This is the test
---
It didn't take long to get to "Posts Complaining About The Complaining" haha-- 22 minutes!
---
samesies.
---
Second attempt now
---
Fishing!!
---
Change your password it usually fixes that kinda thing.
---
Whoops, incorrect password!
---
2709.
---
lol, I'm a photographer. This is professional deviation
---
Yes, we are stress testing, not play testing...
---
I distinctly remember ret paladins having a really good time in TBC...
---
Was the non boss elite damage ever addressed?
---
THANK YOU for actually reading the thread and understanding what im trying to say.
---
June? What about at release?
---
The ultimate boss. UNTIL WAIT THE BLUE BAR BOSS
---
Well, he's been playing with Asmongold a lot... I usually open both but just watch one, just to give him that extra viewer.
---
[HUH](https://youtu.be/lv7wDaIaS2I)
---
Super important info there. Glad you to,d us you got to char creation.
---
No, we're all in and having fun, must only be you
---
yes, many, many people are getting that.
---
Has anyone gotten in?
---
Sitting in queue is stress testing.
---
For PvP - do you want to be the chaser or the chasee?
---
I looked right before I posted this.
---
I know right? Just hearing the menu music again is awesome.
---
I've tried logging in like 6 times now and no success.
---
FYI you got your formatting wrong. You put a bracket at the end instead of a parenthesis
---
Everyone is at the moment
---
About 3 or 4 times so far. I wait in line, get to pick the server and get dc'ed.
---
Did your daddy rape you when you was a kid or something?
---
Same here. Gonna try at least the full 2 hours. I'm pretty hyped just to be staring at the login screen tbh.
---
Same. Sometimes it allows me to go to the character creation screen, but then it times out and i DC.
---
I hope Blizz is having enough stress for its stresstest.
---
I have been disconnected 10 times. So yeh, think it is happening to alot of people.
---
so much insane 5man challenges
---
has anyone managed to get in?
---
Finally someone understands the meaning of "stress testing"
---
typical
---
I'm getting to the point i can choose a server, clicking it, waiting for it to load, then being booted to login
---
I have strongly mixed feelings about Asmon. He’s passionate, has a good time, and seems to genuinely care about the game. He can also get a bit ragey. Watched a PvP raid of his get stomped due to lack of leadership, he proceeded to blame everyone but himself and moan, “This is why I wanted to play on a PvE server”. Also said something to the effect of, “Oh I’d never say that word... on stream” when his chat spiraled into racism and N-bombs, which is gross and spineless.
---
That being said, he’s ten thousand times better than that arrogant ragechild, Soda. Talks smack after every victory, yet has an excuse for every defeat. Streamers bring a weird dimension to Classic, and I’m interested to see how it shakes out on Live.
---
this \^\^
---
I think that just means their layering tech isn't working correctly. Instead of locked, it should be kicking us into another layer. But my guess is it hit the max player limit for layer 1 and kicking over to layer 2 is broken. They'll probably have to patch some code out to their "server selection" server.
---
Login Queue -&gt; Realm Full Queue -&gt; Unable to connect -&gt; Login Queue -&gt; Realm Full Queue -&gt; Unable to connect.
---
Stress test is doing its job I guess.
---
What exactly is this?
---
This is some tinfoil hat shit.
---
let’s keep it going
---
How bout no.
---
Ohh i know mate im just being silly. im not even in the stress test. im just enjoying watching people flip out over a stress test not working
---
I’m at the character creation screen!
---
Yeah, also getting "Locked" in server status in server list. I got the beta stress test invite that started about 30 minutes ago but I haven't been able to get to the character creation screen. Just constantly get disconnected when connecting or queuing.
---
Well weirdly enough all streamers i see are able to login :p
---
61k watching Asmon 43k watching Soda.  I think the fans won.
---
Of course fucking asmon got on
---
I think some people have gotten in.
---
Dont project your worthless life on others to make yourself feel better, at the end of the day you will still feel bad Pussy
---
We get it
---
Damn. I knew Blizzard hates me.
---
That’s exactly what they are doing. See how we stress the system so they can improve it.
---
This is a stress test. We are stress testing the login servers. This is exactly what they want. Jesus.
---
Same for me. :)
---
It's essentially just us trying to login so they can see how it goes their end. This is not us testing the gameplay.
---
I played alpha 2 back in the day and figured $15 was worth it to risk this time around. No luck, oh well. :) Those who didn't have an old account and resubbed for their chance I pray for their recovery.
---
Pretty much-we're helping them big time by giving them the info they need to see how much their servers can handle come launch day.  Then once in we can just goof around for a bit
---
I think some people are actually in. The way I see, almost evryone got a stress test invite, so they might have only a few thousand on the server, with tens of thousands in queue.
---
Yep..tried to make my character and got "Character Creation Timed out" and then I got DC'd. Back in the queue!
---
Clearly not with 10+ posts per minute asking "WHY CANT I PALY?!?!?!?!?"
---
yeah. idk how blizz can deny that streamer privilege doesn't exist tbh.
---
It's sad you felt the need to make a whole post about how you dont understand what a stress test is.
---
But you do have a stun.
---
"Official" lmao
---
Been 30 minutes now.
---
too bad it's past midnight here and I got work tomorrow. :(
---
"wEll YoU cAN oNly gET cHarAteRs uP to levEl 5 anYWay"
---
Or something along those lines
---
Wow isn’t popular at all except
---
For lately or is one big streamer is on
---
Same here.  I'm getting that true vanilla experience.  I did get to the character creation screen the first time but when I hit create, after a minute I got character creation timed out and then disconnected.  Still, I'm happy just to be on the old login screen.
---
They're back now. Watch on twitch
---
definitely the real account
---
\*raises hand  
---
I got in, not a streamer or friends of anyone important.
---
That's a code you must get from your authenticator. You have one?
---
At least we saved the others that had the issue I suppose, but sucks to be in that small group :&lt;
---
Thousand iq
---
based on your bitching you are the only angry pussy , which no one ever takes seriously , that's why you are so angry in coments lmAO
---
DM Forever! For the Alliance!
---
My team plows through. And I'm a cat.
---
Didn’t they say at the end they were going to do a huge event in game? Apparently they expect people to be playing it
---
I had a class today so I could only do one loop but I did my part the best I could!
---
That's not a blizzard twitter my dude
---
Midriff Sylvannas was best Sylvannas.
---
Looks like it’ll be two hours of trying to login. Just like old times!!
---
Going to be a casual, mostly PVE player. Classic coming back has sparked some interest in returning. 
---
I played a Rogue (raided) and Warlock (BGs) back in vanilla. I did alright, but in tBC I decided I wanted to stay away from pure DPS. So, I mained as a Prot Paladin from tBC through early Cata (haven't played since). I also had a few alts (DPS and healers), but that was the majority of my playing and my favorite character. 
---
Obviously, Prot Paladins were not really viable tanks in vanilla. I'm also planning on being Horde, so they're out. 
---
I could go Warrior, but they were the most popular class back then and probably will be again. Lots of competition. 
---
I could go Druid, but I don't have fond memories of watching Druids trying to tank back then. They may have just been awful players, I don't know. Benefit of Druid, if it turns out I don't like tanking anymore, I have two DPS and a healing spec to fall back on without leveling a new character. Downside is also Feral competing with Rogues (another class that's going to be popular).
---
You gotta be careful of the asmon, he'll ninja you're loot and expect a bunch of handouts.
---
That's my life right now.
---
You smite twice before they get to you and then wand. It's actually pretty dang efficient/fast. And if you luck out with two smite crits then you usually score a quick kill.
---
As a long time priest player, I was the same way before I tried a 1-39 smite build, and now I definitely think that both are just about even in terms of leveling speed. If you do end up trying it/making a video, give it an honest chance. I think you'll be surprised.
---
I got an invite. Not a streamer.

Wow legion had 3-4 times the players classic did. Judging a game from the amount of players it has means fortnight is best game ever made. Do not make this mistake.
---
I've played both and personally like horde more. The races are more aesthetically pleasing in my opinion (dwarfs and gnomes I'm looking at you), the questing seems to flow better, the instances are closer to the horde for the most part, and I actually enjoy the "underdeveloped tents" vibe when compared to the large castles and cities.
---
Nice reference. Have an upvote.

everytime I use my phone authenticator it doesnt work. It doesnt pop up or anything

What’s that weapon? looks op

And neither are we since we are only level 5

Oh wait I misread the email.

They had stress tests for bfa (which imo was definitely smaller than classic launch will be) and realms were unplayable for about 6 hours)
---
No changes.
---
WC stands for Wan Cleef then.
---
Confirmed adding pet battles.
---
So you know the exact data for simultaneous login requests for both the official servers right now and the random ass private servers in Serbia?
---
Totally agree. Spam them for 2 hours trying to get in. Melt the servers
---
This isn’t about playing tonight guys, it’s about making sure august launch goes well
---
The objective of beta is testing, not playing. You did not have to pay to play, you paid for a chance to help test. That's called impatience.
---
This comment is BS.
---
&gt; Blizzard specifically asked everyone who wants to play Classic to sub
---
Please show me where they did that. You are full of shit dude. They can EASILY fill the stress test with just the active subs, nobody was asked to resub for anything.
---
I just shift click the person’s name in chat to see what level they are. If they’re 60 I assume Dire Maul. If they’re teens and 20’s I assume deadmines

LOK'TAR OGAR
---
And then exit the game window and lose my place?! NICE TRY PAL!
---
Didn\`t work for me. Tried to login 3+ times with in game authentication code.
---
Still not in, somehow still excited. I'm in a queue, and I'm smiling. How does that happen?
---
I just hope I'm in by 6 for The Event.
---
Eh maybe some other time... trying and failing to login to the stress test at the moment
---
Sounds like vanilla to me, once you change zone itll be better
---
I dunno. We're all trying to get on one server. On launch they'll be multiple servers so it'll be spread out more... then again there's the people who didn't get an invite
---
Are you surprised? This is Activision's Blizzard we're talking about. They literally created a team of economic experts and even psychologists to figure out the best ways to dick consumers. Standard corporate American practice.  
---
Streamers make them the money.
---
I have been subbed for most of the time from 2004 until now and I got in. I remember and played the most in vanilla by far. Been reporting bugs and doing my best as a beta tester. The people they invited made sense for the most part.

Pure bitterness.  Perfect description
---
If you want even more evidence for my point, second last time I got into the realm list portion of the stress test, it said Low population. The last time I got into the realm list portion of the stress test, it said Locked. They're actively limiting the number of players in the game right now.
---
what the hell are they going to do with retail? classic is going to overtake it completely. no one gives two shits about retail any more lol.
---
basically just queuing up over and over. not like i should actually be on the computer anyway. tornado sirens keep going off
---
Same. Lost count. Will probably quit trying after the current one. :p
---
Yep, was also on Frostmane and remember it being exclusively called VC. Which didn't matter anyway because I don't recall ever hearing someone looking for a Deadmines group anywhere but Westfall.

I mean I’ve been siting here for over 40 min logging in, getting DC’d but if it helps bring back Classic, so be it. I’m watching golden girls on the side. Don’t judge me.
---
Because the stress test is the only realm available?
---
The one that I didn't realize was its own instance for the longest time was Stockades.

I mean I'm the lucky guy who hasn't had an issue with Razer as of yet. I got a decade old keyboard from them and my last mouse lasted 9 years before my dog chewed the shit out of the cable
---
Wow and you didn't even put it on the glass for easy removal
---
That I can agree with. A lot of the people I’ve talked to have played in vanilla though. And all of them aren’t streamers
---
Wdym?
---
I mean yea these are imperfect people, and we’ve all rage quit or something along the lines before. Just think of them as your average person playing wow except with a camera and nothing more and you’ll get a lot more enjoyment out of them. If it isn’t entertaining you, then turn them off or find a new streamer. I think they will be really good for the longevity of classic.
---
relax
---
Pretty much all the streamers yeah
---
I'm fkn loving it.  I log in, alt-tab to reddit and classic wow forums to watch the chaos ensue then alt-tab back every few minutes to see where I'm at.
---
I don't get the rage, this is working as intended.
---
Same dude, made it to character creation, but when I try to finish I get "Character creation has timed out" Very unlucky.
---
Got to the character selection screen and it didnt work.
---
True but raid night was always Thursday in my Guild so this reminds me of Thursday night.
---
Asmongold, and you can see on his stream a lot of people are too.
---
Playing during Vanilla, I rarely ever heard anyone call it DM. Usually I heard VC or spelled out Deadmines.
---
From what I understand the PTR issue is those who have already got 2 PTR accounts. For myself that's WOW5. WOW7 is my Stress Test account so it's likely that WOW2 could be yours.
---
You aren’t even cool enough.
---
Dumbass
---
This is me first 2 times. Managed to get to character creation finally, then got dc.
---
Can we ban this meme for 24 hours
---
I have the same problem. Both seem to lead to an error “wow##########”
---
That music!  I'm still hyped and I still haven't got in yet.
---
s t r e s s t e s t
---
i cant create my char =/
---
So you saw the screens of every streamer and every non streamer to be able to make this logical deduction?
---
I'm three beers in. But no I haven't been able to log in
---
I'm still on character creation screen, timing out on creation. I'm taking my chances that my luck is better here than backing out to login
---
You need to select your main account with a sub which should be wow1, or else close the client and reopen and make sure that you are connected to battle.net and you have beta stress test selected from the drop down.
---
I think it's attached to his arm like that guy from FF6.
---
That was my server! I played Horde though, so never saw DM before Dire Maul.
---

I see you too are a man of culture, are you a member of the Big Dick Club?

but bro.....LAYERING!!!!  Insert picture of ancient alien guy
---
Should be a fun time.
---
mage is a great asset in 5 mans. their grinding options are also very fun imo.
---
You're not screwed, I'd pick WoW2, that "worked" for me. I got to logging into the realm but haven't been able to play yet. Selecting my other PTR account (WoW1) wouldn't get me anywhere.

---
Nope, keep getting dc'd before seeing the realm list. Meanwhile i see some streamers in, like Asmongold
---
It's marketing. Tens or hundreds of thousands of people watch these streams, so seeing them actually play the game benefits Blizzard.

that smiley doesn't hide how you truly feel, you are seeeeeeeeeeething!
---
Great, now you got this squeaker thinking all of reddit is waiting for his update on the event. The most attention he's gotten since birth. What have you done!?
---
Hey, we only got 30 of those in the 45 minutes of testing.
---
Looking forward to Classic and know that I will be playing a healer class. Would like to raid and do end game dungeons occasionally, but my primary focus will be on WPVP with friends. Any recommendations on which would be best at 60 (horde)?
---
 43 minutes of sitting in queue, Logging into game server, or anything else BUT playing the game. Sigh, haven't even seen character creation screen.
---
Nope server crashes and DC everyone already
---
Nope, came to character screen once but could never create a character.
---
So far I haven't disconnect (crosses fingers), but keep getting "Character Creation Timed Out". Anyone got a character in-game yet?
---
A lot of people did get in. It appears that people from EU can't really log in.
---
How about wait until blizzard is turning off all the backend tools for the stress test in ... 10 minutes. If your patient you will be able to login.
---
Pre-release hype, for a beta most can't get in.
---
100k of 190k viewers are in the top 2 streams. Many of these don't care about wow just the streamer.
---
A lot of the viewers are shared between the streams and counted multiple times.
---
Just to keep it real.
---
It has been nearly a hour now and I'm stuck at the character creation screen, with it just timing out over and over
---
WHAT.
---
Nice job
---
I think they cut it off. People are in but I get disconnected every time I get to retrieving realm list.
---
p(l)aying for more than 10 years and no invite for something i actually care about. fuck you blizzard
---
50 minutes in, still haven't been able to create a character
---
Ok I’m mad I missed this I won’t lie
---
Well if you think about it all the people who haven't got in are posting here, and everyone that got in are too busy playing
---
no judgement here. but i've had my fill of golden girls. there was a time where the wife wanted me to just sit on the couch wth her watching golden girls or roseanne all day on netflix or hulu. currently just listening to deftones reading the ashbringer comics and lurking reddit in between logins
---
I’ve not made it to even Character creation. Also I have 2 WoW accounts?  Happy to be helping stress test though.
---
Same, just keep trying or log out and log back in?
---
Yup. That’s what I’m getting over and over.
---
Yep, so many people in a single server is unstable and difficult to like get working.
---
They will not get it working 100% on launch.

---
Yeah. I can imagine.
---
I have played since 2005 too but have not been subbed for a few months now. Super weird.
---
Almost me, but I'd have to buy the new game to get any use out of it so I decided against it
---
Dude I'm sorry but your mindset seems so BfA lmao who even said skipping ? 
---
You just jump to conclusions and make assumptions everywhere you can... 
---
In vanilla , frost wasn't the only spec to raid with. If that's your opinion it's simply wrong. 
---
If you think guilds won't take people who aren't frost, again, wrong. 
---
If you think I don't already have a vanilla guild who I've talked to about this and who is comfortable with it, you would indeed be wrong.
---
Like you have this idea that every single person is either a min-max raider or some casual newb who won't get to 60 until Christmas lmao
---
druid, mage, warlock, hunter
---
Of course ;)

Let people enjoy things.

Hi, /u/neettransgirl

I get it too.  Are you from EU?
---
“omegaLUL”
---
Fucking yikes dude
---
Got a new error message this time! “No realms are currently available”.. Ughhh. -_-
---
you made it in or is that from earlier?
---
If only there was a way to channel this post into everyone in twitch chats heads
---
"Gnome is the superior race and comes with extra salt, but the horde have cooler races over all.  I'm starting to lean towards undead rogue, so I don't have to deal with better pvp racials though.  Being a higher level, and picking the fight on my own terms might not be unfair enough.   Redridge looks promising, but I'm worried that the corpse runs won't be long enough."  Quote from my friend of course.
---
I just got a no realms available error wtf lol
---
Yeah, is it because increased latency -&gt; insane risk of getting kicked out?
---
Seems like people with a beta invite can get in but people with stresstest invites get booted in the queue currently
---
me too
---
lol.

That's my experience too.   Except I'm making a NE.
---
70 minutes.

Same. Cant get through character creation, if I even get to it...eventually get kicked somewhere along the line
---
lets make another post about the stress test being a stress test!
---
What do you mean? This is what we wanted no?
---
If you back out and try to change server you'll see it's now locked.
---
Hi, /u/Shalnack
---
The person that said that only plays lfr in retail
---
Nope, US
---
glad someone can login
---
Obviously it wasnt only streamers who got in, that would be small population.  But it certainly isnt random like blizzard said since all of the streamers got in
---
Actually insane. Marry her mate.
---
They should of had like 4 servers just for today.
---
Population locked now.

You from EU too, buddy? Having the same problem right here, while Asmon, Soda and Tips and their army seem to have no problem creating running their characters to AQ. Damn.
---
Yep it does
---
Nah too lazy! Lol
---
&gt;Prot Paladins. Survival Hunters. Balance Druids.
---
I can't argue with these three, they are pretty shit
---
As for ret, well, any raid group is incomplete without the ret they are carrying !
---
It's from the stress test.
---
From the looks of the streams it seems like a ton of people were able to log in. I, however, am not one of them.
---
Same here. Meanwhile I'm watching all the streamers and hundreds of people play :/

---
I can't get in
---
Every time
---
Hmm weird i musst have misscalculated something.. hey at least the queue is getting smaller and i now time out at char creation.
---
That's not how layering works.
---
I was wondering if I tried horde if I might get in, good to know it's the same no matter which faction you choose.
---
"How do I leave my guild?"
---
tfw you give benefit of the doubt and try to be helpful but forget to put a space before /gquit and your guild is small and nobody else will be on to reinvite you for hours.
---
^ this guy is also right
---
Hi, /u/VegDestroyer
---
This stress test is a disaster
---
They want this kind of traffic, they wanted this to happen to try to figure out what bits they could fix.
---
However they won't be able to, and it'll be fucked on launch.
---
My account is from 05 but I haven't had a sub since like 2011 and didnt get in :(
---
Oh for sure. Bfa was a shit show and that is minuscule to classics launch

I can’t even get past “retrieving server list” on an iMac though
---
But what about shape shifting?
---
Sure you slow them down the first few times with first bolt and then you’ll use nova but after that’s on cool down they will catch up to you
---
I’d say priest. They are great healers in both PvE and PvP, with the ability to kill people by yourself as shadow and can rezz.
---
I think the stress test is to see how stressed we get trying to wait out the character creation time out
---
No I'm on attempt like 12. 
---
Now got in the realm is offline
---
There's another one that walks between Hillsbrad, can't remember what all he sells but I think its a gnome or a goblin and a harvester, think it might just be engineering stuff but not 100% sure.
---
I used to play MM hunter (and am planning on playing MM hunter in Classic) and used it in both PvP and PvE effectively. Frost mage is the other one that jumps to mind. Obviously there are slight tweaks to each spec that would make it hard to min-max both PvE and PvP with a single spec, but you could definitely min-max for PvE and still have fun PvPing.
---
I've not gotten to that screen at all yet.
